                                                               February   , 2001

To our stockholders,

     You are cordially invited to attend the special meeting of stockholders of
Allaire Corporation, to be held at the offices of Foley, Hoag & Eliot LLP, One
Post Office Square, Sixteenth Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02109, on
            , March   , 2001 at 10:00 a.m., local time.

     At the special meeting, you will be asked to vote on the approval of a
merger agreement, signed on January 16, 2001, and amended and restated on
January 29, 2001, among Allaire, Macromedia, Inc., and Alaska Acquisition
Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Macromedia. If the stockholders
approve the merger with Macromedia, Allaire will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Macromedia, and you will become entitled to receive either stock
and cash or just cash in exchange for your shares of Allaire common stock,
depending on the closing price of Macromedia common stock two trading days
before the Allaire special meeting. If that price is greater than or equal to
$15.00 per share, you will receive 0.2 shares of Macromedia common stock and
$3.00 in cash for each share of Allaire common stock you own immediately before
the merger. If that price is less than $15.00 per share, you will receive, for
each share of Allaire common stock you own immediately before the merger, cash
equal to $3.00 plus 0.2 of that closing price.

     Macromedia common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the
trading symbol "MACR," and on February   , 2001, the closing price of Macromedia
common stock was $       per share.

     After careful consideration, your board of directors has unanimously
approved the merger agreement and the merger and believes it is fair to and in
the best interests of Allaire and its stockholders. The board of directors
unanimously recommends that stockholders vote FOR the proposal to approve and
adopt the merger agreement and the merger.

     The attached notice of special meeting and prospectus/proxy statement
explain the proposed merger and provide specific information about the special
meeting. Please read these materials carefully. IN PARTICULAR, YOU SHOULD
CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE DISCUSSION IN THE SECTIONS ENTITLED "RISK
FACTORS -- RISKS RELATED TO THE MERGER" BEGINNING ON PAGE 18 AND "RISK
FACTORS -- RISKS RELATED TO THE COMBINED COMPANY" BEGINNING ON PAGE 21. Do not
send any certificates representing Allaire common stock at this time.

     It is important that you take part in the affairs of Allaire by voting your
shares at the special meeting. Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting,
please complete, date, sign and promptly return the accompanying proxy card in
the enclosed postage-paid envelope so that your shares will be represented at
the special meeting. Your failure to return a properly executed proxy card or to
vote at the special meeting will have the same effect as a vote against the
merger. Your vote is important, regardless of the number of shares that you own.

                                          Sincerely,

                                          /s/ DAVID J. ORFAO

     NEITHER THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES
COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED THE MACROMEDIA COMMON STOCK TO BE ISSUED
IN THE MERGER OR DETERMINED IF THIS DOCUMENT IS ACCURATE OR ADEQUATE. ANY
REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

     The following questions and answers are intended to address briefly some
commonly asked questions regarding the merger. These questions and answers may
not address all questions that may be important to you. Please refer to the more
detailed information contained elsewhere in this document, the annexes to this
document and the documents referred to or incorporated by reference in this
document.

Q: WHAT IS THE MERGER?

A: In the merger, Allaire will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Macromedia.
   Stockholders of Allaire will receive either Macromedia common stock and cash
   or just cash in exchange for their shares of Allaire common stock. If Allaire
   stockholders receive shares of Macromedia common stock, the shares they
   receive will represent approximately   % of Macromedia's outstanding common
   stock, based on the capitalization of Macromedia and Allaire as of February
     , 2001.

   For a more complete description of the merger, see the section entitled "The
   Merger" on page 30.

Q: AM I BEING ASKED TO VOTE ON ANYTHING ELSE?

A: Yes. The Allaire board is asking you to authorize Allaire to adjourn the
   special meeting to a date not later than                     , 2001 if the
   number of shares of Allaire common stock present or represented and voting in
   favor of approval of the merger is insufficient to approve the merger under
   Delaware law. Adjourning the special meeting to a later date will give
   Allaire additional time to solicit proxies to vote in favor of the merger.
   The Allaire board of directors recommends that you vote FOR the adjournment
   proposal.

Q: WHAT WILL ALLAIRE STOCKHOLDERS RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?

A: What you receive will depend on the closing price of Macromedia common stock
   two trading days before the Allaire special meeting.

   If that closing price is greater than or equal to $15.00, then you will
   receive 0.2 shares of Macromedia common stock and $3.00 in cash for each
   share of Allaire common stock you own at the closing of the merger.
   Macromedia will not issue any fraction of a share, so you will receive cash
   instead of any fraction of a share that you would otherwise receive.

   For example, a holder of 101 shares of Allaire common stock will receive 20
   shares of Macromedia common stock, $303.00 in cash, and an additional amount
   of cash equal to 0.2 times the market price of one share of Macromedia common
   stock.

   Alternatively, if the closing price of Macromedia common stock two trading
   days before the Allaire special meeting is less than $15.00, then you will
   receive only cash in exchange for your Allaire common stock. You will receive
   $3.00 plus 0.2 multiplied by that closing price for each share of Allaire
   common stock you own at the closing of the merger.

   For example, under this alternative, if the closing price of Macromedia
   common stock two trading days before the Allaire special meeting is $14.50,
   you will receive $5.90 for each share of Allaire common stock you own,
   computed as follows:

   $14.50 X 0.2 = $2.90

   $3.00 + $2.90 = $5.90

   The number of shares of Macromedia common stock to be issued for each share
   of Allaire common stock is fixed and will not be adjusted based upon changes
   in the value of these shares. In the event of an all cash exchange, the
   amount of cash you will receive is directly linked to the closing price of
   Macromedia common stock two trading days before the Allaire special meeting.
   As a result, you will not know the exact value of the stock and/or cash that
   you will receive in the merger until the closing

   of the merger. That value will go up or down as the market price of
   Macromedia common stock goes up or down.

   The market price of Macromedia common stock is volatile. As an example, the
   following table provides, as of the end of each of the last 12 calendar
   months, the closing price per share of Macromedia common stock on the Nasdaq
   National Market. This table also reflects the value that would have been
   received in the merger for each share of Allaire common stock at these
   prices, calculated by multiplying the closing price per share of Macromedia
   common stock by the exchange ratio of 0.2 and adding the $3.00 cash
   consideration.

   Allaire is not permitted to terminate its obligations to complete the merger
   or resolicit the vote of its stockholders solely on the basis of changes in
   the value of Macromedia common stock.

Q: DOES THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF ALLAIRE RECOMMEND VOTING IN FAVOR OF THE
MERGER?

A: Yes. After careful consideration, Allaire's board of directors unanimously
   recommends that its stockholders vote in favor of the merger agreement and
   the merger.

   For a description of the reasons underlying the recommendation of the board
   of directors of Allaire, see the sections entitled "The Merger -- Allaire's
   reasons for the merger" on page 31 and "The Merger -- Recommendation of
   Allaire's board of directors" on page 33.

Q: ARE THERE RISKS I SHOULD CONSIDER IN DECIDING WHETHER TO VOTE FOR THE MERGER?

A: Yes. For example, Macromedia might not realize the expected benefits of the
   merger. Also, the value that Allaire stockholders will receive in the merger
   will decrease if the market price of Macromedia common stock decreases before
   or after the merger.

   For a more complete description of the risks to consider, see the sections
   entitled "Risk Factors -- Risks related to the merger" on page 18 and "Risk
   Factors -- Risks related to the combined company" on page 21.

Q: WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?

A: Please complete, date, sign and promptly return your proxy card in the
   enclosed postage-paid envelope as soon as possible so that your shares will
   be represented at the special meeting. Please see the instructions included
   with your proxy card.

Q: WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON'T VOTE?

A: If you fail to respond, it will have the same effect as a vote against the
   merger.

   If you date, sign and mail your proxy card, but do not indicate how you want
   to vote, your proxy will be counted as a vote in favor of the merger and the
   adjournment proposals.

   If you respond and abstain from voting, your proxy will have the same effect
   as a vote against the merger. However, it will have no affect on the
   adjournment proposal.

Q: IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY MY BROKER, WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY
SHARES FOR ME?

A: If you do not provide your broker with instructions on how to vote your
   "street name" shares, your broker will not be permitted to vote them and you
   will, in effect, be voting against the merger. You should therefore be sure
   to provide your broker with instructions on how to vote your shares. Please
   check the voting form used by your broker to see if it offers telephone or
   Internet voting.

Q: WHAT IF I WANT TO CHANGE MY VOTE?

A: You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the
   special meeting. If you hold your shares in "street name" through a broker,
   you can send a written notice to your broker stating that you would like to
   revoke your proxy or you can complete and deliver a new proxy to your broker.
   You may also appear at the meeting with a signed revocation and a legal proxy
   from your broker allowing you to vote your shares in person. If your shares
   are held in your own name, and not by your broker, you may revoke your proxy
   by completing and delivering a new proxy or by appearing at the special
   meeting and voting in person.

Q: WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE COMPLETED?

A: We are working to complete the merger as soon as possible. We expect to
   complete the merger promptly after the approval of the stockholders at the
   special meeting. However, the merger is subject to several other conditions,
   such as regulatory approval, that could affect the timing of its completion.

Q: SHOULD I SEND IN MY STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW?

A: No. After the merger is completed, Allaire stockholders will receive written
   instructions for exchanging their stock certificates.

Q: WHAT VOTE IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE THE MERGER?

A. The merger will require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
   the shares of Allaire's common stock outstanding on the record date.

Q: WHAT ARE THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO ME?

A: The federal income tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on
   whether Macromedia exchanges Macromedia common stock and cash, or only cash,
   for your shares of Allaire common stock. If you receive Macromedia common
   stock and cash in the merger, then, as a general matter, you will recognize
   gain (but not loss) only to the extent of the cash consideration and any
   additional cash that you receive in lieu of a fractional share of Macromedia
   common stock. If you receive only cash in the merger, then you will be
   considered for tax purposes to have sold your Allaire shares for cash and
   will recognize taxable gain or loss to the full extent of the difference
   between the amount of cash you receive and your adjusted basis in your
   Allaire shares. Tax matters are very complicated and the tax consequences of
   the merger to you will depend on the facts of your own situation. You should
   consult your tax advisors for a full understanding of the tax consequences of
   the merger to you.

   For a more complete description of the tax consequences of the merger, see
   the section entitled "The Merger -- Federal income tax consequences of the
   merger" on page 43.

Q: AM I ENTITLED TO DISSENTERS' OR APPRAISAL RIGHTS?

A: Under Delaware law, holders of Allaire common stock may exercise appraisal
   rights in the merger.

   For a more complete description of the appraisal rights, see the section
   entitled "Appraisal Rights" on page 81.

Q: WHOM SHOULD I CALL WITH QUESTIONS?

A: Allaire stockholders should call Allaire's Investor Relations Department at
   (617) 219-2020 with any questions about the merger.

   You may also obtain additional information about Macromedia and Allaire from
   the documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission or by

                                   THE MERGER

THE MERGER AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE 46)

     In the merger, Allaire and Alaska Acquisition Corporation, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Macromedia, will merge, and the surviving corporation will become
a wholly owned subsidiary of Macromedia. The structure of the merger and the
form of consideration to be received in exchange for shares of Allaire common
stock depend on the closing price of Macromedia common stock two trading days
before the Allaire stockholders' meeting. If the closing price of Macromedia
common stock on that date is greater than or equal to $15.00 per share, Allaire
will merge with and into Alaska Acquisition Corporation, Alaska Acquisition
Corporation will survive the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Macromedia,
and Allaire stockholders will receive 0.2 shares of Macromedia common stock and
$3.00 in cash for each outstanding share of Allaire common stock. See "The
Merger Agreement -- Exchange of Allaire common stock for Macromedia common stock
and cash" beginning on page 46.

     If the closing price of Macromedia common stock two trading days before the
Allaire stockholders' meeting is less than $15.00 per share, Alaska Acquisition
Corporation will merge with and into Allaire, Allaire will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Macromedia, and Allaire stockholders will receive an amount of
cash equal to $3.00 plus two tenths of that closing price for each outstanding
share of Allaire common stock. See "The Merger Agreement -- Alternative exchange
of Allaire common stock for cash" beginning on page 46.

     Tax Consequences (see page 43). These merger structures differ so that,
whether Macromedia exchanges Macromedia common stock and cash, or only cash, for
the shares of Allaire common stock in the merger, Allaire itself will not incur
federal or state income tax liability. In either of these merger structures, the
Allaire stockholders will incur income tax liabilities, but the amounts of these
liabilities will differ. If Macromedia issues cash and stock to the Allaire
stockholders, the merger is expected to qualify as a reorganization under the
tax code. In that case, Allaire stockholders will recognize no gain or loss, and
pay no tax, on their receipt of Macromedia shares, but will recognize gain, but
not loss, to the extent of cash that they receive. If, however, Macromedia
issues only cash to the Allaire stockholders, then the Allaire stockholders will
be treated as if they had sold their Allaire shares to Macromedia. In that case,
the Allaire stockholders will recognize gain or loss to the full extent of the
difference between the amount of cash received and their adjusted tax basis in
their Allaire shares.

     Assumption of Options (see page 47). When the merger is completed,
Macromedia will assume each outstanding option to purchase Allaire common stock
and convert it into an option to acquire shares of Macromedia common stock. The
number of shares of Macromedia common stock and the exercise price of these
assumed options depends on whether the closing price of Macromedia common stock
two trading days before the Allaire stockholders' meeting is greater than or
equal to $15.00 or less than $15.00 and also depends on the average of the
closing prices of Macromedia common stock on the five trading days before the
completion of the merger.

     Assumption of Warrants (see page 48). When the merger is completed,
Macromedia will assume each outstanding warrant to purchase shares of Allaire
common stock and convert it into a Macromedia warrant. If the closing price of
Macromedia common stock two days before the Allaire stockholders' meeting is
greater than or equal to $15.00, the warrant will be exercisable for shares of
Macromedia common stock and cash. If the closing price of Macromedia common
stock on that date is less than $15.00, then the warrant will be exercisable
only for an amount of cash.

     The merger agreement is attached to this prospectus/proxy statement as
Annex A. We urge you to read the merger agreement carefully.

SPECIAL MEETING OF ALLAIRE STOCKHOLDERS (SEE PAGE 27)

     Allaire will hold a special meeting of its stockholders on
March   , 2001 at 10:00 a.m., local time, at the offices of Foley, Hoag & Eliot
LLP, One Post Office Square, Boston, Massachusetts

02109. At the meeting, Allaire stockholders will consider and vote on a proposal
to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger. In addition, Allaire
stockholders will consider and vote on a proposal to grant Allaire management
the discretionary authority to adjourn the special meeting to a date not later
than             , 2001 in order to enable the Allaire board of directors to
solicit additional proxies in favor of the merger.

     Only holders of record of Allaire common stock at the close of business on
February   , 2001, the record date for the special meeting, are entitled to
notice of and to vote at the special meeting. A majority of the shares of
Allaire common stock outstanding on the record date must be present, in person
or by proxy, to constitute a quorum at the special meeting. The merger must be
approved by the holders of a majority of the shares of Allaire common stock
outstanding on the record date. The adjournment proposal must be approved by a
majority of the votes cast on the adjournment proposal.

     Four stockholders of Allaire who beneficially owned approximately   % of
the outstanding Allaire common stock as of the record date have agreed to vote
in favor of approval of the merger agreement and the merger. Directors and
executive officers of Allaire and their affiliates collectively beneficially
owned approximately      % of the outstanding Allaire common stock as of the
record date.

RECOMMENDATION OF ALLAIRE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS (SEE PAGE 33)

     Allaire's board of directors believes that the merger is fair to Allaire
stockholders and in their best interests. The Allaire board has unanimously
voted to approve the merger agreement and the merger and recommends that its
stockholders vote FOR the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the
merger. The Allaire board unanimously recommends that Allaire stockholders vote
FOR the adjournment proposal.

OPINION OF ALLAIRE'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR (SEE PAGE 33)

     Allaire's financial advisor, Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, has
delivered a written opinion to the Allaire board of directors as to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration provided
for in the merger. The full text of Credit Suisse First Boston's written
opinion, dated January 16, 2001, is attached to this document as Annex D. We
encourage you to read this opinion carefully in its entirety for a description
of the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations
on the review undertaken. Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion is directed to
the Allaire board of directors and does not constitute a recommendation to any
stockholder as to any matter relating to the merger.

NO OTHER NEGOTIATIONS (SEE PAGE 51)

     Until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated,
Allaire has agreed not to take any action with regard to an acquisition
proposal, as described on page 51, unless Allaire receives an acquisition
proposal before the Allaire stockholders' meeting which its board of directors
reasonably concludes may constitute a superior offer, as described on page 52.
If Allaire receives an acquisition proposal which its board considers to be a
superior offer, Allaire may, subject to the conditions specified on page 51,
furnish non-public information regarding itself and may enter into discussions
with the person who has made the acquisition proposal.

     Allaire has agreed to provide Macromedia with advance notice of any board
meeting at which Allaire expects to consider any acquisition proposal to
determine whether it is a superior offer. If the Allaire board believes, after
consultation with its financial advisors, that an acquisition proposal it
receives is a superior offer, it may withhold, withdraw, amend or modify its
recommendation of the merger. We will notify you in writing if the Allaire board
changes its recommendation of the merger. However, Allaire must still call and
convene the Allaire stockholders' meeting to consider approval of the merger
with Macromedia.

CONDITIONS TO COMPLETION OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 49)

     The completion of the merger depends upon meeting a number of conditions,
including:

     - the merger agreement and the merger must be approved by Allaire's
       stockholders;

     - Macromedia's registration statement, of which this prospectus/proxy
       statement is a part, must be effective, no stop order suspending its
       effectiveness may be in effect and no proceedings for suspending its
       effectiveness may be pending before or threatened by the SEC;

     - no governmental entity shall have enacted a law, regulation or order that
       has the effect of making the merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting the
       merger;

     - no governmental entity shall have commenced any proceeding preventing the
       merger or restricting Macromedia's operation of Allaire after the merger;

     - the applicable waiting periods under antitrust laws must have expired or
       been terminated;

     - the representations and warranties of each party in the merger agreement
       must be true and correct;

     - the parties must have complied in all material respects with their
       respective agreements in the merger agreement;

     - no material adverse effect with respect to Macromedia or Allaire shall
       have occurred; and

     - Allaire must have obtained all necessary consents and approvals with
       regard to the merger under specified material contracts.

     Macromedia and Allaire must each receive an opinion of its tax counsel to
the effect that the merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization unless the
closing price of Macromedia common stock two trading days before the Allaire
stockholders' meeting is less than $15.00 per share, in which case this
condition will not be applicable to the merger.

     Macromedia, Alaska Acquisition Corporation and Allaire must each satisfy
additional conditions before the completion of the merger. Each condition to the
merger may be waived by the company entitled to assert the condition.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE 53)

     The merger agreement may be terminated at any time before the completion of
the merger, whether before or after approval of the merger by the Allaire
stockholders:

     - by the mutual written consent of Macromedia and Allaire;

     - by either Macromedia or Allaire if:

       - the merger has not been completed, without fault of the terminating
         party, by September 30, 2001;

       - a governmental authority has issued a final, non-appealable order,
         decree or ruling, or taken any other action, that would permanently
         prohibit the merger; or

       - the stockholders of Allaire fail to approve the merger agreement and
         the merger, except that Allaire may not terminate the merger agreement
         if stockholder approval was not obtained either because of Allaire's
         action or failure to act, which constitutes a material breach of the
         merger agreement, or because of a breach by one of the Allaire
         stockholder parties to the voting agreements, described in "Related
         Agreements - Allaire stockholders' voting agreements" beginning on page
         61;

     - by Macromedia if:

       - Allaire has breached any representation, warranty, obligation or
         agreement in the merger agreement and the breach would cause Allaire to
         fail to satisfy a condition to the merger, except

         that Macromedia cannot terminate the merger agreement if it is at that
         time in material breach or if Allaire has cured the breach within 30
         business days of written notice of the breach; or

       - at any time before the approval of the merger agreement and the merger
         by the Allaire stockholders, a triggering event, as described on page
         54, has occurred;

     - by Allaire if Macromedia has breached any representation, warranty,
       obligation or agreement in the merger agreement and the breach would
       cause Macromedia to fail to satisfy a condition to the merger, except
       that Allaire cannot terminate the merger agreement if it is at that time
       in material breach or if Macromedia has cured the breach within 30
       business days of written notice of the breach.

     Termination of the merger agreement will generally terminate the
obligations of the parties to perform their obligations under the merger
agreement, except that the parties must continue to comply with miscellaneous
provisions, including those concerning mutual confidentiality, and, if
applicable, the termination fees and the payment of expenses.

TERMINATION FEES; PAYMENT OF EXPENSES (SEE PAGE 54)

     Allaire has agreed to pay Macromedia a termination fee of $10,350,000 if a
triggering event occurs and Macromedia terminates the merger agreement before
the Allaire stockholders meeting.

     Allaire has also agreed to pay the termination fee if all of the following
occur:

     - an acquisition proposal has been announced before the Allaire
       stockholders' meeting;

     - the Allaire stockholders vote against approval of the merger;

     - either Macromedia or Allaire terminates the merger agreement; and

     - within 12 months after termination of the merger agreement Allaire enters
       into a letter of intent or similar agreement or completes a transaction
       in which majority control of Allaire's voting stock or more than 50% of
       its assets are acquired by a third party.

     Other than the termination fee, Macromedia and Allaire will generally bear
their own costs and expenses in connection with the merger. However, if
Macromedia or Allaire terminates the merger agreement for the other's breach of
any of its representations, warranties, obligations or agreements, then the
terminating party is entitled to payment from the other of the terminating
party's fees and expenses in connection with the merger, up to $1,000,000. In
addition, if Macromedia terminates the merger agreement after a triggering event
or if Macromedia or Allaire terminates it after the Allaire stockholders vote
against approval of the merger, Allaire will pay Macromedia's fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the merger, up to $1,000,000.

THE STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE 59)

     Macromedia and Allaire have entered into a stock option agreement that
grants Macromedia the right to buy shares of Allaire common stock equal to 19.9%
of the shares of Allaire common stock outstanding on the date of exercise at an
exercise price of $5.75 per share. The option becomes exercisable only upon the
occurrence of specified events. Macromedia required Allaire to grant the option
as a condition for entering into the merger agreement. The option may discourage
third parties who are interested in acquiring a significant stake in Allaire and
is intended by Macromedia to increase the likelihood that the merger will be
consummated. The stock option agreement is attached to this document as Annex B.
We urge you to read it carefully.

THE VOTING AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE 61)

     Four stockholders of Allaire holding approximately   % of Allaire's common
stock have entered into voting agreements with Macromedia. The voting agreements
require these stockholders to vote all the shares of Allaire common stock they
own in favor of the merger and against any competing proposal or

proposals in opposition to the merger. The form of voting agreement is attached
to this document as Annex C. We urge you to read it carefully.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 38)

     When considering the recommendation of Allaire's board of directors, you
should be aware that some of Allaire's directors and officers have interests in
the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, your interests.

ANTITRUST APPROVAL REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 42)

     The merger is subject to antitrust laws. We have made the required filings
with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and we will make
any necessary filings with foreign regulatory agencies. The Department of
Justice or the Federal Trade Commission, as well as a foreign regulatory agency
or government, state or private person, may challenge the merger at any time
before or after its completion.

RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY TO SELL MACROMEDIA STOCK (SEE PAGE 42)

     All shares of Macromedia common stock received by Allaire stockholders in
connection with the merger will be freely transferable unless the holder is
considered an affiliate of either of Allaire or Macromedia under the Securities
Act.

LISTING ON THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET (SEE PAGE 42)

     Macromedia common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq National Market
under the symbol MACR. Macromedia will list the shares of Macromedia common

ALLAIRE STOCKHOLDERS' APPRAISAL RIGHTS (SEE PAGE 43)

     Under Delaware law, Allaire stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights
with respect to the merger and, if the merger is completed, to receive payment
in cash for the fair value of their shares of Allaire common stock. In general,
to preserve their appraisal rights, Allaire stockholders who wish to exercise
these rights must:

     - deliver a written demand for appraisal to Allaire at or before the time
       the vote is taken at the Allaire special meeting;

     - not vote their shares for approval and adoption of the merger agreement
       and the merger;

     - continuously hold their shares of Allaire common stock from the date they
       make the demand for appraisal through the closing of the merger; and

     - comply with the other procedures set forth in Section 262 of the Delaware
       General Corporation Law.

     The text of the Delaware statute governing appraisal rights is attached to
this prospectus/proxy statement as Annex E. Your failure to comply with the
procedures described in Annex E will result in the loss of appraisal rights. We
urge you to read the text of the Delaware statute governing appraisal rights
carefully.

                             MACROMEDIA AND ALLAIRE

         SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL DATA
                    (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

     The following unaudited pro forma financial information of Macromedia and
Allaire has been derived from Macromedia and Allaire's financial statements,
selected financial data and related notes included elsewhere or incorporated by
reference in this prospectus/proxy statement, accounts for the acquisition as a
purchase transaction and assumes that the acquisition had occurred at the
beginning of the periods presented. As a result of the differing fiscal years of
Macromedia and Allaire, results of operations and balance sheet information for
different periods have been combined. Macromedia's financial information for the
year ended March 31, 2000 has been combined with Allaire's financial information
for the year ended December 31, 1999. Macromedia's financial information for the
nine months ended December 31, 2000 has been combined with Allaire's financial
information for the nine months ended September 30, 2000. Macromedia's financial
position as of December 31, 2000 has been combined with Allaire's financial
position as of September 30, 2000.

     A charge for in-process research and development attributable to the
purchase of Allaire has been included in retained earnings (deficit) in the pro
forma combined condensed balance sheet, but has been excluded from the pro forma
combined condensed statement of operations as it is non-recurring.

     The unaudited pro forma financial information includes estimates, and the
purchase price of the acquisition of Allaire has been allocated on a preliminary
basis to assets and liabilities based on Macromedia management's best estimates
of their fair value, and the excess of purchase price over the net tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired has been allocated to goodwill. This
allocation is subject to change pending a final analysis of the total purchase
cost and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The
impact of these changes could be material.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed information is presented for
illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating
results or financial position that would have occurred if the acquisition had
been consummated at such time, nor is it necessarily indicative of future
operating results or financial positions.

         COMPARATIVE HISTORICAL AND UNAUDITED PRO FORMA PER SHARE DATA

     The following tables reflect the historical net income and book value per
share of Macromedia common stock and the historical net loss and book value per
share of Allaire common stock in comparison with the unaudited pro forma net
loss and book value per share after giving effect to the proposed acquisition as
if it had taken place on April 1, 1999. These tables also reflect the pro forma
net loss and book value per share attributable to the exchange ratio of 0.2
shares of Macromedia common stock that will be issued for each share of Allaire
common stock.

     The information presented in the following tables should be read in
conjunction with the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements
included elsewhere in this document and the historical financial statements and
related notes of Macromedia and Allaire that are incorporated by reference in
this document.

     The historical book value per common share is computed by dividing total
stockholders' equity by the number of shares of common stock outstanding at
March 31, 2000 and December 31, 2000 for Macromedia and December 31, 1999 and
September 30, 2000 for Allaire. The pro forma combined book value per common
share is computed by dividing pro forma total stockholders' equity by the pro
forma number of shares of Macromedia common stock outstanding at December 31,
2000. The shares outstanding for Macromedia were 50,674,000 and 63,884,000 as of
March 31, 2000 and December 31, 2000, respectively. The shares outstanding for
Allaire were 26,816,000 and 27,400,000 as of December 31, 1999 and September 30,
2000, respectively. The pro forma shares outstanding were 69,405,000 as of
December 31, 2000.

     The Allaire equivalent pro forma combined per share amounts are calculated
by multiplying the Macromedia combined pro forma share amounts by the exchange
ratio of 0.2 shares.

                           FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

     The Securities and Exchange Commission encourages companies to disclose
forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company's
future prospects and make informed investment decisions. This prospectus/proxy
statement contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of
1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements
may be made directly in this prospectus/proxy statement, and they may be made a
part of this prospectus/proxy statement by reference to other documents filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission and incorporated by reference into
this prospectus/proxy statement. These statements may include statements
regarding the period following completion of the merger.

     Words such as "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "believes,"
"seeks," "estimates," variations of these words and similar expressions are
intended to identify these forward-looking statements. In particular, statements
regarding expected strategic benefits, advantages and other effects of the
merger described in "The Merger -- Allaire's reasons for the merger" beginning
on page 31 and elsewhere in this document are forward-looking statements. All
forward-looking statements are management's present expectations of future
events and are subject to many factors and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking
statements. In addition to the risks related to the businesses of Macromedia and
Allaire, the factors discussed under "Risk Factors -- Risks related to the
merger," among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from
those described in the forward-looking statements. Macromedia and Allaire make
no representation as to whether any projected or estimated financial information
contained in any forward-looking statements will be obtained and stockholders
are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements,
which speak only as of the date of this proxy statement or the date of the
document incorporated by reference in this proxy statement. Neither Allaire nor
Macromedia is under any obligation, and each expressly disclaims any obligation,
to update or alter any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     The merger involves a high degree of risk. By voting in favor of the
merger, Allaire stockholders will be choosing to invest in Macromedia common
stock, which also involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other
material contained in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus/proxy
statement, you should carefully consider the following risk factors in deciding
whether or not to vote for the merger.

RISKS RELATED TO THE MERGER

IT IS EXPECTED THAT ALLAIRE STOCKHOLDERS WILL RECEIVE A FIXED RATIO OF 0.2
SHARES OF MACROMEDIA COMMON STOCK FOR EACH SHARE OF ALLAIRE COMMON STOCK EVEN IF
THERE ARE CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF ALLAIRE COMMON STOCK OR MACROMEDIA
COMMON STOCK BEFORE THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER.

     Unless the closing price of Macromedia common stock two trading days before
the Allaire stockholders' meeting is less than $15.00, there will be no
adjustment to the exchange ratio if the market price of either Allaire common
stock or Macromedia common stock fluctuates. If the market price of Macromedia
common stock decreases or increases before the consummation of the merger, the
value of the Macromedia common stock to be received in the merger in exchange
for Allaire common stock would correspondingly decrease or increase. The
specific dollar value of Macromedia common stock that Allaire stockholders will
receive upon completion of the merger will depend on the market value of
Macromedia common stock at the time of the merger. We cannot predict the market
prices for either Allaire common stock or Macromedia common stock at any time
before completion of the merger or the market price for Macromedia common stock
after the completion of the merger. The share prices of both Allaire common
stock and Macromedia common stock are subject to price fluctuations in the
market for publicly traded equity securities and have each experienced
significant volatility. Macromedia and Allaire believe that

Allaire common stock presently trades on the basis of the value of the
Macromedia common stock, discounted primarily for the uncertainties associated
with the merger. Apart from the publicly disclosed information concerning
Macromedia that is included and incorporated by reference in this prospectus/
proxy statement, Macromedia cannot state with certainty what factors account for
changes in the market price of the Macromedia common stock. WE URGE YOU TO
OBTAIN CURRENT MARKET QUOTATIONS FOR MACROMEDIA COMMON STOCK AND ALLAIRE COMMON
STOCK.

IF MACROMEDIA AND ALLAIRE CANNOT EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATE THEIR OPERATIONS AND
INFRASTRUCTURE, SOME OF THE POTENTIAL BENEFIT OF THE PROPOSED MERGER WILL NOT BE
REALIZED.

     It is expected that the merger will allow Macromedia to use Allaire's web
design and development software products and the experience of Allaire's
employees to provide an enhanced level of services in connection with
Macromedia's software products. To do so, Macromedia and Allaire will have to
integrate their computer networks, management teams and software products. If
this integration effort is not successful, then results of operations could be
harmed, employee morale could decline, key employees could leave and customers
could cancel existing orders or choose not to place new ones. In addition,
difficulties or delays in the integration of the operations and products of
Macromedia and Allaire, including web design and development software products,
could disrupt customer service after the merger. If Macromedia's operations
after the merger do not meet the expectations of Macromedia's or Allaire's
existing customers, then those customers might reduce their future orders or
cease doing business with the combined company altogether.

THE MARKET PRICE OF MACROMEDIA COMMON STOCK IS HIGHLY VOLATILE AND COULD DECLINE
AS A RESULT OF THE PROPOSED MERGER.

     In the past, Macromedia common stock has experienced substantial price
volatility. This volatility might occur again in the future, which could cause
the Macromedia common stock to be worth less after the merger than before the
merger. Volatility can arise particularly in response to quarter-to-quarter
variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of Macromedia, its
customers or competitors, and announcements by Macromedia or its competitors
regarding new products and services introductions. The market price of
Macromedia common stock can also fluctuate in response to price and volume
fluctuations in the stock market, particularly those that affect the market
prices of technology stocks.

     In addition, the market price of Macromedia common stock might decline
significantly as a result of the proposed merger if:

     - Macromedia does not experience the benefits of the merger as quickly as
       anticipated, or at all, or the costs of or operational difficulties
       arising from the merger are greater than anticipated;

     - the impact of the merger on Macromedia's financial results is not in line
       with the expectations of financial analysts; or

     - margins on web design and development software products decline because
       of competition or other factors.

THE BUSINESSES OF MACROMEDIA AND ALLAIRE COULD SUFFER IN RESPONSE TO THE
ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE MERGER.

     The announcement of the merger may increase the likelihood of changes to
the businesses of Macromedia and Allaire. These potential changes include:

     - loss of key management, development or other personnel;

     - cancellation or decline in the rate of orders for products or services or
       deterioration of customer relationships;

     - delays in product development or development of new service capabilities;
       and

     - loss of key strategic relationships, joint marketing arrangements or key
       business partners.

     Changes in the businesses of Macromedia or Allaire pending the merger could
have a material adverse effect on the business of Macromedia after the merger.
Even if the merger is not completed, Macromedia could be harmed by the
expectation of these changes, and restoring Macromedia's business to its
pre-announcement value could take a long time and be costly.

THE MERGER COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF EMPLOYEES AT MACROMEDIA AND ALLAIRE
BEFORE AND AFTER COMPLETION OF THE MERGER.

     Whether or not the merger occurs, Macromedia and Allaire may be unable to
retain some of their key employees. Although incentives offered by Macromedia
and Allaire to their employees before and after completion of the merger may
mitigate this effect, it is possible that employees will seek employment
elsewhere. After the merger, integration of the businesses of Macromedia and
Allaire could result in changes in the culture and operations of both companies
that could cause the combined company to lose key employees. The success of the
combined company will depend in part upon its ability to attract and retain
highly skilled technical, managerial, sales and marketing personnel,
particularly additional management in the areas of application integration and
technical support. The loss of key employees at any Allaire office could
adversely impact Allaire's overall financial results, which could have a
negative impact on the operating results of Macromedia after the merger.
Competition for such personnel is intense. After the merger, Macromedia may not
be able to hire or retain the necessary personnel to integrate Allaire with
Macromedia and implement its business strategy. In addition, Macromedia may need
to pay higher compensation for employees than it currently expects.

IF MEMBERS OF ALLAIRE'S MANAGEMENT LEAVE, THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THE MERGER
MAY NOT BE REALIZED.

     Many members of Allaire's senior management will benefit significantly from
the partial acceleration of vesting of their Allaire options as a result of the
merger. Success of the merger will depend, in significant part, on the continued
services of Allaire's senior management personnel and of its key technical and
sales personnel. If members of Allaire's current management were to terminate
their employment with Allaire, the ability of Macromedia to manage Allaire's
business and workforce after the merger would be harmed and Allaire's operations
could be disrupted. Although Macromedia has entered into employment agreements
with several members of the Allaire management team that will take effect upon
completion of the merger, these agreements may not result in the retention of
the members of the management of Allaire for any significant period of time. A
loss of any member of Allaire's management could prevent or defer realization of
the benefits that Macromedia anticipates from the merger.

THE MERGER COULD HARM KEY CUSTOMER AND THIRD-PARTY RELATIONSHIPS.

     The proposed merger could harm relationships with customers and other third
parties with whom Macromedia and Allaire do business. For example, the
continuance of Allaire's customer relationships is generally based on continued
customer goodwill and satisfaction rather than long-term orders or other
contractual commitments. Customers might postpone or cancel sales orders for
Allaire's products if they perceive that customer services and support would
decline as a result of the merger. Any changes in customer relationships could
harm the combined company's business. Allaire's customers and other third
parties may delay or defer decisions concerning using Allaire products. In
addition, existing and potential strategic partners of Macromedia who view
themselves as competitive with Allaire, such as application server vendors, may
seek to terminate their relationships with the combined company, or avoid
renewing or entering into new relationships with the combined company. Any
changes in strategic partner relationships could harm the combined company's
business.

THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MERGER MAY BE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED, WHICH COULD
HARM THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THE COMBINED COMPANY AND CAUSE A DECLINE IN THE
VALUE OF MACROMEDIA COMMON STOCK.

     Macromedia and Allaire estimate that they will incur direct transaction
costs of approximately $5.3 million associated with the merger. Macromedia
expects to incur additional costs associated with the consolidation and
integration of products and operations. Macromedia cannot accurately estimate
these

costs at this time. If the total costs of the merger and related consolidation
and integration exceed estimates, or if the costs of the merger exceed the
benefits of the merger, the financial results of the combined company would
suffer. Any shortfall in anticipated operating results of the combined company
could cause the market price of Macromedia common stock to decline. In addition,
the market price of Macromedia common stock could decline immediately, and
perhaps significantly, if Macromedia does not experience the business benefits
of the merger as quickly or in as great an amount as securities analysts expect.

THE ACQUISITIONS THAT MACROMEDIA AND ALLAIRE HAVE RECENTLY COMPLETED MAY
INCREASE THE INTEGRATION DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPOSED MERGER
BETWEEN MACROMEDIA AND ALLAIRE.

     The challenges of integrating the operations of Macromedia and Allaire will
be increased by ongoing efforts associated with the continuing integration of
other recent acquisitions by Macromedia and Allaire. Macromedia acquired
Middlesoft in June 2000, Andromedia in December 1999 and ESI Software in
September 1999. Allaire acquired the M39 product line from EvolutionB
Information in January 2001, the Kawa and Jforge lines of business from TekTools
in October 2000, the Open Sesame line of business from Bowne Internet Solutions
in March 2000, Valto Systems in December 1999, Live Software in June 1999 and
Bright Tiger Technologies in April 1999. Macromedia's failure to integrate and
manage acquired businesses successfully, to retain their employees and
customers, and to address new markets associated with the acquired businesses
successfully could harm its business and increase the difficulties associated
with the integration of the operations of Allaire. Macromedia anticipates that
it will continue to consider other acquisitions of businesses and assets to
expand its business and to acquire complementary technologies and personnel. The
integration of multiple organizations requires a substantial amount of
management resources and attention. These acquisitions, as well as other
potential future acquisitions, will require Macromedia to manage and integrate
the acquired businesses and their personnel, which are and may be located in
diverse geographic locations, and will also require Macromedia to develop and
market services to new markets with which it may not be familiar.

ALLAIRE HAS A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY AND ITS BUSINESS MODEL IS STILL
EVOLVING, WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE ALLAIRE, ITS PROSPECTS AND THE
BENEFITS OF THE MERGER TO MACROMEDIA.

     Allaire's limited operating history makes evaluating its business
operations and prospects difficult. Allaire's range of product offerings has
changed since its inception and its business model is still new and developing.
Because some of Allaire's products are new, the market for these products is
uncertain. As a result, the revenue and income potential of Allaire's business
and the potential benefits of the merger may be difficult to evaluate.

RISKS RELATED TO THE COMBINED COMPANY

MACROMEDIA FACES INTENSE COMPETITION.

     The markets for Macromedia's products are highly competitive and
characterized by pressure to reduce prices, incorporate new features, and
accelerate the release of new product versions and enhanced services. A number
of companies currently offer products and services that compete directly or
indirectly with one or more of Macromedia's products. With respect to
Macromedia's software business, competitors include, among others, Adobe
Systems, Corel and Microsoft. As Macromedia competes with larger competitors
such as Adobe across a broader range of product lines and different platforms,
Macromedia may face increasing competition from such companies.

TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES WILL AFFECT MACROMEDIA'S BUSINESS.

     The developing digital media, Internet and online services markets, and the
personal computer industry are characterized by rapidly changing technology,
resulting in short product life cycles and rapid price declines. Macromedia must
continuously update its existing products, services and content to keep them
current with changing technology and consumer tastes and must develop new
products, services and

content to take advantage of new technologies and consumer preferences that
could render its existing products obsolete. Macromedia's future prospects are
highly dependent on its ability to increase functionality of existing products
and services in a timely manner and to develop new products and services that
address new technologies and achieve market acceptance. New products and
enhancements must keep pace with competitive offerings, adapt to new platforms
and emerging industry standards, and provide additional functionality. There can
be no assurance that Macromedia will be successful in these efforts.

MACROMEDIA'S BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT ON THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF INTERNET USE.

     The success of Macromedia's business is especially dependent upon the
existence and future growth of the Internet as a business, entertainment and
communications platform. Many critical issues concerning the commercial use of
the Internet, such as security, remain unresolved and may affect the growth of
Internet use, together with the software standards employed in such markets. A
decline in the growth of the Internet or any inability by Macromedia to adapt to
changes in the Internet or the technology used for operation of the Internet
could have a material adverse effect on Macromedia's results of operations.

MACROMEDIA'S QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE AND ITS FUTURE REVENUES
AND PROFITABILITY ARE UNCERTAIN.

     Macromedia's quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending
on the timing of new product introductions and enhancements. A substantial
portion of Macromedia's revenue is derived from the introduction of new products
or enhancements to existing products. Macromedia has in the past experienced
delays in the development of new products and enhancement of existing products,
and such delays may occur in the future. If Macromedia is unable, due to
resource constraints or technological or other reasons, to develop and introduce
products in a timely manner, this inability could have a material adverse effect
on its results of operations. If Macromedia does not ship new versions of its
products as planned or if new products do not receive market acceptance,
Macromedia's results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

     Macromedia's results of operations also may vary significantly depending on
the impact of any of the following:

     - the timing of product and service introductions by competitors;

     - changes in pricing;

     - execution and volume of technology licensing agreements;

     - the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter for software
       products; and

     - any acquisitions of other companies or technologies.

Macromedia's future operating results may fluctuate as a result of these and
other factors, including its ability to continue to develop or acquire
innovative products and services, its product, service, and customer mix, and
the level of competition.

     Macromedia's results of operations also may be affected by seasonal trends.
A significant portion of Macromedia's operating expenses is relatively fixed,
and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts. As a result, if
revenues do not meet Macromedia's forecasts, operating results may be materially
adversely affected. There can be no assurance that sales of Macromedia's
existing products will either continue at historical rates or increase, or that
new products introduced by Macromedia, whether developed internally or acquired,
will achieve market acceptance. Macromedia's historical rates of growth should
not be taken as being indicative of growth rates that can be expected in the
future.

MACROMEDIA MUST ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH
DISTRIBUTORS.

     A substantial majority of Macromedia's revenue is derived from the sale of
its software products through a variety of distribution channels, including
traditional software distributors, mail order,

educational distributors, VARs, OEMs, hardware and software superstores, retail
dealers, and its direct sales force and Website. Domestically, Macromedia's
products are sold primarily through distributors, VARs, and OEMs. In particular,
one distributor accounted for 29% and 28% of Macromedia historical revenues for
the three months ending December 31, 2000 and 1999. In addition, Macromedia
believes that certain distributors are reducing their inventory in the channel
and returning unsold products to better manage their inventories. Distributors
are increasingly seeking to return unsold product, particularly when a new
version or upgrade of a product has superseded such products. If Macromedia's
distributors seek to return increasing amounts of products, such returns could
have a material adverse effect on Macromedia's revenues and results of
operations. The loss of, or a significant reduction in sales volume to, a
significant reseller could have a material adverse effect on Macromedia's
results of operations.

MACROMEDIA'S INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS.

     For the three months ended December 31, 2000, Macromedia derived
approximately 45% of its revenues from international sales. Macromedia expects
that international sales will continue to represent a significant percentage of
its revenues. Macromedia relies primarily on distributors for sales of its
software products in foreign countries and, accordingly, is dependent on their
ability to promote and support its software products, and in some cases, to
translate them into foreign languages. International business is subject to a
number of special risks, including:

     - foreign government regulation;

     - general geopolitical risks such as political and economic instability,
       hostilities with neighboring countries and changes in diplomatic and
       trade relationships;

     - more prevalent software piracy;

     - unexpected changes in, or imposition of, regulatory requirements,
       tariffs, import and export restrictions and other barriers and
       restrictions;

     - longer payment cycles, greater difficulty in accounts receivable
       collection, potentially adverse tax consequences, the burdens of
       complying with a variety of foreign laws;

     - foreign currency risk; and

     - other factors beyond Macromedia's control.

     Additionally, Macromedia is uncertain whether the recent weaknesses
experienced in the economies in Japan, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Latin America
will continue in the foreseeable future due to possible currency devaluation and
liquidity problems in these regions.

     Macromedia enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce
economic exposure associated with sales and asset balances denominated in
various European currencies and Japanese Yen. As of December 31, 2000, the
notional principal of forward contracts outstanding amounted to $28.9 million.
There can be no assurance that such contracts will adequately hedge Macromedia's
exposure to currency fluctuations.

MACROMEDIA FACES RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EUROPE'S CONVERSION TO THE EURO CURRENCY.

     On January 1, 1999, eleven of the fifteen member countries of the European
Union adopted the Euro as the common legal currency and established fixed rates
of conversion between their existing sovereign currencies and the Euro. The Euro
trades on currency exchanges and is available for non-cash transactions. A
three-year transition period is underway during which transactions can be made
in the existing sovereign currencies. The conversion to the Euro has alleviated
currency exchange risk between the member countries.

     There can be no assurance that all issues related to the Euro conversion
have been identified, and Macromedia may be at risk if any of its principal
suppliers are unable to deal with the impact of the Euro

conversion. To date, none of Macromedia's international suppliers have expressed
an intention to invoice in Euros.

MACROMEDIA MUST MANAGE ITS GROWTH AND EXPANSION.

     Macromedia has experienced and may continue to experience rapid growth,
which has placed, and could continue to place, a significant strain on its
managerial, financial and operational resources. Macromedia's workforce has
grown more than 58% over the past year. Macromedia anticipates that it will need
to implement a variety of new and upgraded operational and financial systems,
procedures and controls, including the ongoing improvement of its accounting and
other internal management systems. Macromedia also will need to continue to
expand, train, manage, retain and motivate its workforce. All of these endeavors
will require substantial management effort and resources. In the future,
Macromedia anticipates that it will need to continue the expansion of its
facilities or relocate some or all of its employees or operations from time to
time to support its growth. These relocations could result in temporary
disruptions of its operations or a diversion of management's attention and
resources. If Macromedia is unable to effectively manage expanded operations,
its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially
and adversely affected.

MACROMEDIA'S STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE.

     Macromedia's future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant
volatility. For example, for the period from January 1, 2000 to January 31,
2001, Macromedia's stock price ranged from a high of $120.88 per share to a low
of $29.00 per share. Any shortfall in revenue or earnings from levels expected
by securities analysts, general decline in economic conditions or material
reductions in spending by its customers, could have an immediate and significant
adverse effect on the trading price of Macromedia's common stock in any given
period. Additionally, Macromedia may not learn of such shortfalls until late in
the fiscal quarter, which could result in an even more immediate and adverse
effect on the trading price of its common stock. Finally, Macromedia
participates in a highly dynamic industry. In addition to factors specific to
Macromedia, changes in analysts' earnings estimates for Macromedia or its
industry and factors affecting the corporate environment, our industry, or the
securities markets in general will often result in significant volatility of
Macromedia's common stock price.

MACROMEDIA FACES CHALLENGES IN PROTECTING ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

     Macromedia relies on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets,
and trademark laws, as well as employee and third-party nondisclosure
agreements, to protect its intellectual property rights and products. Policing
unauthorized use of products and fully protecting its proprietary rights is
difficult, and Macromedia cannot guarantee that the steps it has taken to
protect its proprietary rights will be adequate. In addition, effective
copyright, trademark, trade secret and patent protection may not be available in
every country in which Macromedia's products are distributed.

     Further, Macromedia is currently, and may in the future, be involved in
legal disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of its, or of a
third party's, intellectual property rights. Intellectual property litigation is
typically extremely costly and can be disruptive to Macromedia's business
operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key
technical personnel. In addition, any adverse decisions could subject Macromedia
to significant liabilities, require Macromedia to seek licenses from others,
prevent Macromedia from manufacturing or licensing certain of its products, or
cause severe disruptions to its operations or the markets in which Macromedia
competes, any one of which could dramatically impact Macromedia's business and
results of operations.

MACROMEDIA FACES RISKS RELATING TO EXISTING LITIGATION.

     On July 31, 1997, shareholders filed a lawsuit against Macromedia and five
of its former or current officers and directors, alleging that they had engaged
in securities violations by seeking to improperly inflate the value of
Macromedia stock. In May 1999, the court certified all persons who purchased

Macromedia common stock from April 18, 1996 through January 9, 1997 as a class.
Trial has been set for November 2001.

     On August 10, 2000, Adobe Systems filed a lawsuit against Macromedia
alleging that some Macromedia products infringe on several Adobe patents.
Macromedia has denied these claims and filed a counterclaim against Adobe for
infringement of several of Macromedia's patents. Each party seeks to enforce its
patents and to receive monetary compensation.

     On or after September 25, 2000, shareholders filed eleven virtually
identical lawsuits against Allaire and several of its officers and directors,
alleging that they had engaged in securities violations by making statements
that were materially false or misleading. Each of the plaintiffs in each of the
actions purport to bring their complaint on behalf of all purchasers of Allaire
stock during the period of July 20, 2000 to September 18, 2000. The plaintiffs
seek damages, interest, costs and attorneys' fees. The parties to these lawsuits
have agreed, and the court has ordered, that all of the cases be consolidated,
that the defendants need not respond to the pending complaints and that lead
counsel approved by the court shall file an amended complaint applicable to the
consolidated actions.

     Macromedia and Allaire believe that these lawsuits are without merit, and
are vigorously defending them. However, there can be no assurance that they will
be successful in these efforts. Macromedia and Allaire could incur substantial
costs defending the lawsuits. The lawsuits could also divert the time and
attention of both Macromedia's and Allaire's management. As a result, these
lawsuits may materially adversely affect Macromedia's and Allaire's financial
condition or results of operations.

MACROMEDIA'S INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE COMPANIES ARE VERY RISKY, AND MACROMEDIA
COULD LOSE ITS ENTIRE INVESTMENT IN ONE OR MORE OF THESE COMPANIES.

     Through Macromedia Ventures, Macromedia invests a substantial amount of
capital and time on finding, funding, and helping to develop certain privately
held companies, many of which can be considered in the start-up or development
stages. These investments are inherently risky as the market for the
technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early
stages and may never materialize. Therefore, Macromedia could lose its entire
investment, or a substantial portion thereof, in one or more of these companies.

MACROMEDIA'S FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN GENERALLY
ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.

     Macromedia prepares its financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. GAAP are subject to interpretation by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Securities and Exchange
Commission, and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate
accounting policies. A change in these policies can have a significant effect on
Macromedia's reported results, and may even affect the reporting of transactions
completed prior to the announcement of a change.

MACROMEDIA'S BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ITS PRODUCTS FAIL TO
PERFORM PROPERLY.

     Software products as complex as Macromedia's and Allaire's may contain
undetected errors or "bugs," which result in product failures or security
breaches or otherwise fail to perform in accordance with customer expectations.
Errors in certain Macromedia and Allaire products have been detected after the
release of the product. The occurrence of errors could result in loss of or
delay in revenue, loss of market share, failure to achieve market acceptance,
diversion of development resources, injury to Macromedia's and Allaire's
reputations, or damage to its efforts to build brand awareness, any of which
could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and
financial condition. In addition, any failure in a customer's web application
developed and deployed with Macromedia's or Allaire's products could result in a
claim for substantial damages against Macromedia, regardless of Macromedia's
responsibility for the failure. Although Macromedia maintains general liability
insurance, including coverage for errors and omissions, there can be no
assurance that its existing coverage will continue to be

available on reasonable terms or will be available in amounts sufficient to
cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage
as to any future claim.

MACROMEDIA'S BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED IF THE JAVA PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE LOSES
MARKET ACCEPTANCE OR IF MACROMEDIA IS NOT ABLE TO CONTINUE USING JAVA OR
JAVA-RELATED TECHNOLOGIES.

     Allaire's JRun Java application server is designed to comply with Sun's
Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition, or J2EE, Specifications. Using the JRun
application server, Macromedia's customers can build Java applications on the
J2EE platform. Many of Allaire's, and therefore some of Macromedia's, next
generation products are also expected to be based on Java. While a number of
companies have introduced Web applications based on Java, Java could fall out of
favor with computer programmers and software developers, and support of the Java
programming language by Sun Microsystems or other companies could decline.
Moreover, there can be no assurance that the J2EE standards will be widely
adopted or that Macromedia can continue to comply with Sun's J2EE specifications
established from time to time. If support for Java or J2EE decreases or Allaire
cannot continue to use Java or related Java technologies, or if Macromedia is
not able to comply with J2EE standards, Macromedia could lose revenue
opportunities and its business could be harmed.

MACROMEDIA MAY EXPERIENCE LOST OR DELAYED SALES AS ITS SALES CYCLE LENGTHENS.

     A longer sales cycle for Allaire products reduces Macromedia's ability to
forecast revenue levels and may result in lost sales. Any delay or loss in sales
of Allaire products could have a material adverse effect on Macromedia's
business, operating results and financial condition, and could cause operating
results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. As Macromedia increases
its sales and marketing focus for Allaire products on larger sales to businesses
and other large organizations, it expects that increased executive-level
involvement of information technology officers and other senior managers of its
customers will be required. Potential large sales may be delayed, or lost
altogether, because Macromedia will have to provide a more comprehensive
education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of its Allaire
products. Macromedia's customers' purchase decisions may be subject to delays
over which Macromedia may have little or no control.

                    SPECIAL MEETING OF ALLAIRE STOCKHOLDERS

     We are sending you this document in order to provide you with important
information regarding the merger in connection with the solicitation of proxies
by Allaire's board of directors for use at the special meeting of its
stockholders and at any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting.

DATE, TIME AND PLACE OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

     Allaire will hold a special meeting of its stockholders on             ,
March   , 2001, at 10:00 a.m., local time, at the offices of Foley, Hoag & Eliot
LLP, One Post Office Square, Boston, Massachusetts 02109.

MATTERS FOR CONSIDERATION

     At the special meeting, Allaire stockholders will be asked to consider and
vote upon a proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger.
Allaire stockholders will also consider and vote on a proposal to grant Allaire
management the discretionary authority to adjourn the special meeting to a date
not later than             , 2001 in order to enable the Allaire board of
directors to solicit additional proxies in favor of the merger. In addition,
Allaire stockholders will consider and vote upon any other matters that may
properly come before the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of
the special meeting. Allaire is not currently aware of any other matter that
will come before the special meeting.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS' RECOMMENDATION

     After careful consideration, the Allaire board of directors has unanimously
approved the merger agreement and the transactions it contemplates, including
the merger. The Allaire board of directors has determined the merger agreement
and the merger to be fair to and in the best interests of the Allaire
stockholders and unanimously recommends that Allaire stockholders vote FOR
approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger. The Allaire board
of directors unanimously recommends that Allaire stockholders vote FOR the
adjournment proposal.

RECORD DATE

     The record date for determining the Allaire stockholders entitled to vote
at the special meeting is February   , 2001. Only holders of record of Allaire
common stock as of the close of business on that date are entitled to vote at
the special meeting. As of the record date, there were                shares of
Allaire common stock issued and outstanding, held by approximately
               stockholders of record. As of the record date, the directors and
executive officers of Allaire and their affiliates held
outstanding shares of Allaire common stock. Each share of Allaire common stock
issued and outstanding as of the record date entitles its holder to cast one
vote at the special meeting.

QUORUM AND VOTE REQUIRED

     In order to conduct business at the special meeting, a quorum must be
present. Allaire's by-laws provide that a quorum at the special meeting will be
the holders of a majority of the stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote
at the meeting. Allaire will treat shares of common stock represented by a
properly signed and returned proxy, including abstentions and broker non-votes,
as present at the meeting for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum.
If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, the special meeting will be
adjourned or postponed to solicit additional proxies. A majority of the shares
of Allaire's common stock outstanding on the record date must be voted for the
proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger in order for
the proposal to pass. The adjournment proposal must be approved by a majority of
the votes cast on the adjournment proposal.

VOTING OF PROXIES

     General. Shares represented by a properly signed and dated proxy will be
voted at the special meeting in accordance with the instructions indicated on
the proxy. Proxies that are properly signed and dated but which do not contain
voting instructions will be voted FOR approval and adoption of the merger
agreement and the merger and FOR the adjournment proposal. The proxy holder may
vote the proxy in its discretion as to any other matter which may properly come
before the meeting.

     Abstentions. Allaire will count a properly executed proxy marked "ABSTAIN"
as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present, but the
shares represented by that proxy will not be voted at the special meeting.
Because the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Allaire
common stock is required to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the
merger, if you mark your proxy "ABSTAIN," it will have the effect of a vote
against approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger. Because
only votes cast on the adjournment proposal will determine the outcome of any
vote on the adjournment proposal, if you mark your proxy "ABSTAIN," your proxy
will have no effect on the adjournment proposal.

     Broker non-votes. If your shares are held by your broker, your broker will
vote your shares for you only if you provide instructions to your broker on how
to vote your shares. You should follow the directions provided by your broker
regarding how to instruct your broker to vote your shares. Your broker cannot
vote your shares of Allaire common stock without specific instructions from you.
Because the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Allaire
common stock is required to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the
merger, if you do not instruct your broker how to vote, it will have the effect
of a vote against approval and adoption of the merger agreement. Because only
votes cast on the adjournment proposal will determine the outcome of any vote on
the adjournment proposal, if you do not instruct your broker how to vote, your
proxy will have no effect on the adjournment proposal.

     Voting shares in person that are held through brokers. If your shares are
held by your broker or another nominee and you wish to vote those shares in
person at the special meeting, you must obtain from the nominee holding your
Allaire common stock a properly executed legal proxy identifying you as an
Allaire stockholder, authorizing you to act on behalf of the nominee at the
special meeting and identifying the number of shares with respect to which the
authorization is granted.

HOW TO REVOKE A PROXY

     You may revoke your proxy before it is voted by:

     - providing written notice before the special meeting that you have revoked
       your proxy to:

          Allaire Corporation
          275 Grove Street
          Newton, MA 02466
          Attention: Secretary
          Fax: (617) 219-2001

     - submitting a new, signed proxy with a later date; or

     - attending the special meeting.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES AND EXPENSES

     Allaire will pay its own costs of soliciting proxies. Allaire will
reimburse brokers, banks, fiduciaries, nominees and others for the out-of-pocket
expenses and other reasonable clerical expenses they incur in forwarding proxy
materials to beneficial owners of Allaire common stock held in their names.
Directors, officers and employees of Allaire may solicit proxies, without
additional remuneration, by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail, telegraph and
in person. Allaire expects that the expenses of this special solicitation will
be nominal. Macromedia may engage a third-party solicitation firm in connection
with the Allaire special meeting.

VOTING AGREEMENTS

     Four Allaire stockholders holding approximately   % of the outstanding
voting power of the Allaire common stock entitled to vote on the merger
agreement and the merger have agreed to vote all of their shares of Allaire
common stock in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and
the merger and against competing proposals for the acquisition of Allaire and
have executed proxies with respect to their shares in favor of Macromedia.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Allaire stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights with respect to the
proposed merger and, if the merger is completed, to receive payment in cash for
the fair value of their shares of Allaire stock. To preserve their appraisal
rights, Allaire stockholders who wish to exercise these rights must:

     - deliver a written demand for appraisal to Allaire at or before the time
       the vote is taken at the Allaire special meeting;

     - not vote their shares for approval and adoption of the merger agreement
       and the merger;

     - continuously hold their shares of Allaire common stock from the date they
       make the demand for appraisal through the closing of the merger; and

     - comply with the other procedures set forth in Section 262 of the Delaware
       General Corporation Law.

     Allaire stockholders should carefully review the section entitled
"Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 81 and Annex E, which contains the text of
the Delaware statute governing appraisal rights, if they wish to exercise or
preserve their appraisal rights. Failure to comply with the procedures described
in Annex E will result in the loss of appraisal rights.

                           PROPOSAL ONE -- THE MERGER

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     Macromedia and Allaire have had commercial relationships with each other
since September 1997, and as a result, a number of senior officers of the
companies had regular business dealings and communications with each other.
During the week of May 22, 2000, David Orfao, chief executive officer of
Allaire, and Rob Burgess, chairman and chief executive officer of Macromedia,
discussed potential business relationships between the companies, including a
business combination. On June 12, 2000 in San Francisco, and then on June 15,
2000 in Boston, officers of Allaire, including Mr. Orfao, J.J. Allaire, chairman
of the board, Jeremy Allaire, chief technology officer, and Simeon Simeonov,
chief architect, met with officers of Macromedia, including Kevin Lynch,
executive vice president and president of products, Ian Richmond, senior vice
president and general manager, embedded systems group, Paul Madar, senior vice
president, engineering, David Mendels, senior vice president, business
development, and Stephen Elop, senior vice president, worldwide field
operations, to discuss a possible business combination. Subsequent meetings to
discuss potential strategy and products for a combined company were held in
Boston on June 26 and 27, 2000, and included, in addition to many of the
foregoing persons, Mr. Burgess, Betsey Nelson, executive vice president and
chief financial officer of Macromedia, and David Gerth, chief financial officer
of Allaire. On July 7, 2000, the Macromedia board of directors held a meeting by
teleconference during which they discussed the potential Allaire transaction.

     On July 14, 2000, in San Francisco, Messrs. Orfao and Gerth and
representatives of Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, financial advisor to
Allaire, met with Mr. Burgess, Ms. Nelson, Margaret McCarthy, senior vice
president, corporate development, of Macromedia, Tom Hale, senior vice
president, marketing, of Macromedia, and representatives of Morgan Stanley &
Co., Inc., financial advisor to Macromedia, to discuss the terms for a potential
business combination between Allaire and Macromedia. This meeting concluded
without agreement between the parties with respect to price or other financial
terms. On July 22, 2000, the Allaire board of directors held a regularly
scheduled meeting and discussed the previous meetings between Allaire and
Macromedia. On August 2, 2000, Messrs. Orfao and Jeremy Allaire again met with
Mr. Burgess and Ms. McCarthy in Boston to discuss the terms of a potential
transaction; this meeting also concluded without agreement between the parties
with respect to price or other financial terms.

     In early November, Messrs. Orfao and Burgess discussed possible strategic
relationships between Allaire and Macromedia, including resuming discussions
between the parties regarding a potential business combination. On November 6,
2000, Mr. Lynch presented at the Allaire Developers Conference in Washington,
D.C., and met that day with Jeremy Allaire to discuss a potential business
combination between Allaire and Macromedia. On November 14, 2000, Mr. Allaire
met with Mr. Lynch and Phillip Mazzie, director of corporate development, of
Macromedia, in San Francisco to discuss a potential product roadmap for the
combined company. Additional meetings were held on December 6, 2000 among
Messrs. Orfao, Gerth, Mendels and Mazzie, and on December 7 and 8, 2000 between
Mr. Allaire and Mr. Lynch, at which the product and financial plans of the
respective companies were discussed. On December 15, 2000, Macromedia's internal
strategy team met to review the potential transaction with Allaire, including
discussions regarding the appropriate valuation ranges of Allaire. From December
26 through 30, 2000, Mr. Burgess and Mr. Orfao and representatives from Morgan
Stanley and Credit Suisse First Boston held numerous telephone calls to discuss
the financial aspects and terms of a potential transaction.

     On January 4, 2001, the Macromedia board of directors met and received an
update on the strategic purposes of the proposed business combination and the
status of negotiations regarding a potential transaction with Allaire. The board
authorized Macromedia management to continue discussions with Allaire. On
January 4, 2001, Allaire and Macromedia entered into an exclusivity agreement,
expiring January 17, 2001, providing for a period of exclusive negotiations
regarding a potential business combination involving Allaire and Macromedia.
From January 3 through 8, 2001, Macromedia engineering and legal personnel,
representatives of Fenwick & West LLP, legal counsel to Macromedia, and

PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, accounting advisor to Macromedia, and
representatives of Morgan Stanley, conducted a due diligence investigation of
Allaire in Boston.

     On January 6, 2001, Fenwick & West LLP sent Foley, Hoag & Eliot LLP, legal
counsel to Allaire, drafts of transaction documents which were negotiated by
Allaire and Macromedia and their respective counsels over the following ten
days. During this period, Macromedia's due diligence investigation of Allaire
continued and Allaire conducted a due diligence inquiry of Macromedia. On
January 11, 2001, in San Francisco, the principal financial officers of each
company and representatives of Credit Suisse First Boston and Morgan Stanley
held financial due diligence meetings regarding the respective companies.

     On January 13, 2001, the Allaire board of directors met to discuss the
status of the proposed transaction with Macromedia and to consider the principal
transaction terms, including the proposed exchange ratio. The Allaire board
authorized Allaire management to continue negotiations with Macromedia.

     The Macromedia board of directors met on January 14, 2001, discussed the
principal transaction terms and those issues as yet unresolved, reviewed
management's and counsel's due diligence reports on Allaire, received a
presentation from Morgan Stanley on the financial aspects of the proposed
transaction, and authorized Macromedia management to propose to Allaire a
purchase price for Allaire shares consisting of a combination of cash and
Macromedia common stock. The parties and their respective legal representatives
continued to negotiate over the next two days to resolve open issues, including
the transaction price and the terms of the Allaire stock option requested by
Macromedia. Also during this period, Macromedia and several Allaire executives
negotiated the terms of employment agreements to become effective if the merger
closes.

     On January 16, 2001, the Allaire board met to consider the proposed
transaction with Macromedia. Credit Suisse First Boston made a presentation to
the Allaire board on the financial aspects of the proposed transaction. After
the presentation, Credit Suisse First Boston rendered to the Allaire board an
oral opinion, which opinion was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated
January 16, 2001, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject
to the matters described in its opinion, the merger consideration provided for
in the merger with Macromedia was fair, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of Allaire common stock. Allaire's board then approved the merger
agreement and the related transaction agreements. Later that day, the Macromedia
board met to approve the merger agreement and the related transaction
agreements. Allaire and Macromedia executed the merger agreement and the related
agreements at approximately 4:30 p.m. Eastern time, and shortly thereafter
publicly announced the proposed transaction. The merger agreement was amended
and restated on January 29, 2001.

ALLAIRE'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     Allaire's board has determined that the terms of the merger agreement and
the merger are fair to, and in the best interests of, Allaire and its
stockholders. In reaching its unanimous decision to approve the merger
agreement, Allaire's board consulted Allaire's management, financial advisors
and legal counsel, and identified and considered several factors which, when
taken as a whole, supported its decision. The board considered the following
material factors:

     - The board considered the complementary nature of each company's products
       and the potential for a combined product offering to address all aspects
       of web development and design. The board believed the combined company
       will offer a suite of tools and application servers that will allow web
       professionals to more efficiently build both the look of a web site and
       the application logic behind the web site and to deliver a web site on
       multiple devices and in multiple formats.

     - The board considered that the combined company might be able to create
       significant product sales and distribution synergies. In particular, the
       board recognized that the combined company will have the opportunity to
       capitalize on each company's strong customer and partner relationships
       and established reputations to provide additional products and services
       to each company's existing

       customers. The board considered that the combined company will have a
       substantially larger customer base.

     - The board considered the ability of the combined company to take
       advantage of the product development and deployment expertise of both
       companies in order to bring new products to market in a timely fashion.

     - The board considered that the merger consideration to be received by
       Allaire stockholders represented premiums of approximately 51.8% and
       111.9% to the closing prices of Allaire common stock on January 12, 2001,
       the last trading day before the meeting at which the Allaire board of
       directors approved the merger, and November 30, 2000, respectively. The
       board also considered current financial market conditions and the
       historical volatility and trading prices of the Allaire common stock and
       the Macromedia common stock, as well as the board's expectations
       regarding the potential for future increases in the trading prices of the
       two stocks.

     - The board considered that a portion of the merger consideration to be
       received by Allaire stockholders will be paid in cash and therefore will
       not be adjusted downward in the event of a decline in the trading price
       of Macromedia common stock or Allaire common stock after the announcement
       of the merger.

     - The board considered the risks and potential rewards associated with
       continuing to operate as an independent company as an alternative to the
       merger, including, among others, risks associated with remaining
       independent in light of increasing consolidation and competition in the
       application server and tools markets. The board also considered potential
       rewards associated with the opportunity for stockholders to participate
       in the future growth of Macromedia.

     - The board considered the possibility, as an alternative to the merger, of
       seeking to acquire another company, seeking to engage in one or more
       joint ventures or seeking to engage in a combination with a company other
       than Macromedia, and the Allaire board's conclusion that a transaction
       with Macromedia is more feasible.

     - The board considered the larger market capitalization of Macromedia and
       the corresponding increase in trading liquidity for former Allaire
       stockholders as a result of the merger.

     - The board considered favorably the financial presentation of Credit
       Suisse First Boston including its opinion to Allaire's board of directors
       as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger
       consideration to the holders of Allaire common stock.

     - The board considered the financial strength of Macromedia and the
       likelihood that it would be able to complete the merger, including its
       ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals.

     - The board considered the complementary corporate cultures of the two
       companies.

     - The board considered the economic effects of the merger on the customers,
       employees, suppliers and other constituents of Allaire and on the
       communities in which Allaire does business.

     - The board considered the limited rights that Macromedia has to terminate
       the merger agreement, including the fact that Macromedia may not
       terminate the merger agreement on the basis of changes in the price of
       the Allaire common stock.

     - The board considered its right under the merger agreement to consider
       superior acquisition proposals, alter its recommendation of the merger
       and, in the event the stockholders do not approve the merger, pursue
       superior acquisition proposals.

     In reaching its decision to approve the merger and recommend approval to
Allaire's stockholders, Allaire's board of directors also considered a number of
potentially negative factors concerning the merger. These factors included the
following:

     - The board considered the volatility of the trading price of Macromedia
       common stock, including the fact that the exchange ratio for the share
       consideration to be received by Allaire stockholders is

       fixed and will not increase in the event of a decline in the trading
       price of Macromedia common stock.

     - The board considered the risk that Macromedia will not successfully
       integrate the operations of the two companies or achieve the anticipated
       synergies of the combination, which might adversely affect the trading
       price of the Macromedia common stock received in the merger.

     - The board considered the possible effects of the public announcement of
       the merger on Allaire's sales and its relationships with its employees,
       suppliers and strategic partners.

     - The board considered that the termination fee and the stock option
       agreement negotiated by Macromedia could have the effect of deterring
       other potential acquirors from proposing an alternative transaction that
       might be more advantageous to Allaire stockholders. In determining the
       fairness of the merger to Allaire stockholders, the board took into
       account the size of the termination fee, the conditions to the exercise
       of the stock option agreement and the board's evaluation of the
       likelihood that another company would propose an alternative transaction
       even in the absence of the termination fee and the stock option
       agreement.

     In addition, Allaire's board of directors considered the interests that its
officers and directors may have with respect to the merger in addition to their
interests as Allaire stockholders. See " -- Interests of certain persons in the
merger" on page 38 for a more complete discussion of these interests.

     Allaire's board of directors evaluated these factors in light of their
knowledge of Allaire's business, Allaire's customers and partners, the market
for web design and development products, and their business judgment. In view of
the variety of factors and the amount of information considered, Allaire's board
of directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify, rank or
otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors it considered in
reaching its decision. The determination was made after consideration of all of
the factors taken as a whole. In addition, individual members of Allaire's board
of directors may have given different weights to different factors. The
foregoing discussions of the information and factors considered by Allaire's
board of directors are not intended to be exhaustive but are believed to include
all of the material factors considered by Allaire's board.

RECOMMENDATION OF ALLAIRE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     ALLAIRE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE MERGER AGREEMENT,
THE MERGER AND THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT.
ALLAIRE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS BELIEVES THAT THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER
ARE ADVISABLE, FAIR TO AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF ALLAIRE AND ITS STOCKHOLDERS
AND RECOMMENDS THAT ITS STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE
MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER.

     If the merger is not completed, Allaire intends to continue as an
independent public company and will continue to evaluate other strategic
transactions or alternatives to realize value for its stockholders.

OPINION OF ALLAIRE'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     Credit Suisse First Boston has acted as Allaire's financial advisor in
connection with the merger. Allaire selected Credit Suisse First Boston based on
Credit Suisse First Boston's experience, expertise and reputation. Credit Suisse
First Boston is an internationally recognized investment banking firm and is
regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection
with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, negotiated underwritings,
competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities,
private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes.

     In connection with Credit Suisse First Boston's engagement, Allaire
requested that Credit Suisse First Boston evaluate the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of Allaire common stock of the merger
consideration provided for in the merger. On January 16, 2001, at a meeting of
the Allaire board of directors held to evaluate the merger, Credit Suisse First
Boston rendered to the Allaire board of directors an oral opinion, which opinion
was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated January 16, 2001, the

date of the merger agreement, to the effect that, as of that date and based on
and subject to the matters described in its opinion, the merger consideration
provided for in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of Allaire common stock.

     THE FULL TEXT OF CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON'S WRITTEN OPINION, DATED
JANUARY 16, 2001, TO THE ALLAIRE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, WHICH SETS FORTH, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE PROCEDURES FOLLOWED, ASSUMPTIONS MADE, MATTERS CONSIDERED AND
LIMITATIONS ON THE REVIEW UNDERTAKEN, IS ATTACHED AS ANNEX D AND IS INCORPORATED
INTO THIS DOCUMENT BY REFERENCE. HOLDERS OF ALLAIRE COMMON STOCK ARE URGED TO,
AND SHOULD, READ THIS OPINION CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. CREDIT SUISSE FIRST
BOSTON'S OPINION IS ADDRESSED TO THE ALLAIRE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND RELATES ONLY
TO THE FAIRNESS OF THE MERGER CONSIDERATION FROM A FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW, DOES
NOT ADDRESS ANY OTHER ASPECT OF THE PROPOSED MERGER OR ANY RELATED TRANSACTION
AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION TO ANY STOCKHOLDER AS TO ANY MATTER
RELATING TO THE MERGER. THE SUMMARY OF CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON'S OPINION IN
THIS DOCUMENT IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL TEXT OF THE
OPINION.

     In arriving at its opinion, Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed the merger
agreement and related documents, as well as publicly available business and
financial information relating to Allaire and Macromedia. Credit Suisse First
Boston also reviewed other information relating to Allaire and Macromedia
provided to or discussed with Credit Suisse First Boston by Allaire and
Macromedia, as well as publicly available financial forecasts for Allaire and
Macromedia discussed with Credit Suisse First Boston by Allaire and Macromedia,
and met with the managements of Allaire and Macromedia to discuss the businesses
and prospects of Allaire and Macromedia. Credit Suisse First Boston also
considered financial and stock market data of Allaire and Macromedia, and
compared those data with similar data for other publicly held companies in
businesses similar to Allaire and Macromedia and considered, to the extent
publicly available, the financial terms of other business combinations and
transactions that have recently been effected. Credit Suisse First Boston also
considered other information, financial studies, analyses and investigations and
financial, economic and market criteria that it deemed relevant.

     In connection with its review, Credit Suisse First Boston did not assume
any responsibility for independent verification of any of the information that
was provided to or otherwise reviewed by it and relied on that information being
complete and accurate in all material respects. Credit Suisse First Boston
reviewed and discussed with the managements of Allaire and Macromedia publicly
available financial forecasts relating to Allaire and Macromedia and was
advised, and assumed, that the forecasts represent reasonable estimates and
judgments as to the future financial performance of Allaire and Macromedia. In
addition, Credit Suisse First Boston relied, without independent verification,
upon the assessments of the managements of Allaire and Macromedia as to the
existing and future technology and products of Allaire and Macromedia and the
risks associated with their technology and products, the potential cost savings
and synergies, including the amount, timing and achievability of those cost
savings and synergies, and strategic benefits anticipated to result from the
merger, Allaire's and Macromedia's ability to integrate their businesses and
Allaire's and Macromedia's ability to retain key employees of Allaire and
Macromedia. Credit Suisse First Boston also assumed, with Allaire's consent,
that, unless the closing price of Macromedia common stock two trading days
before the Allaire stockholders' meeting is less than $15.00, the merger would
be treated as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes. In
addition, Credit Suisse First Boston was not requested to make, and did not
make, an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities,
contingent or otherwise, of Allaire and Macromedia, nor was Credit Suisse First
Boston furnished with any evaluations or appraisals.

     Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion was necessarily based upon information
available to it, and financial, economic, market and other conditions as they
existed and could be evaluated, on the date of the Credit Suisse First Boston
opinion. Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion did not address the relative
merits of the merger as compared to other business strategies that might have
been available to Allaire, nor did it address the underlying business decision
of Allaire to proceed with the merger. Credit Suisse First Boston did not
express any opinion as to what the value of Macromedia common stock actually
would be if and when issued in the merger or the prices at which Macromedia
common stock would trade at any time subsequent to the merger. Although Credit
Suisse First Boston evaluated the merger consideration in the

merger from a financial point of view, Credit Suisse First Boston was not
requested to, and did not, recommend the specific consideration payable in the
merger, which consideration was determined between Allaire and Macromedia. In
connection with its engagement, Credit Suisse First Boston was not requested to,
and did not, conduct a solicitation process seeking third party indications of
interest in the possible acquisition of all or any part of Allaire. No other
limitations were imposed on Credit Suisse First Boston with respect to the
investigations made or procedures followed in rendering its opinion.

     In preparing its opinion to the Allaire board of directors, Credit Suisse
First Boston performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses,
including those described below. The summary of Credit Suisse First Boston's
analyses described below is not a complete description of the analyses
underlying Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion. The preparation of a fairness
opinion is a complex process involving various determinations as to the most
appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of
those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a fairness opinion
is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In
arriving at its opinion, Credit Suisse First Boston made qualitative judgments
as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor that it
considered. Accordingly, Credit Suisse First Boston believes that its analyses
must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and
factors or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without
considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the
analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes
underlying its analyses and opinion.

     In its analyses, Credit Suisse First Boston considered industry
performance, regulatory, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Allaire
and Macromedia. No company, transaction or business used in Credit Suisse First
Boston's analyses as a comparison is identical to Allaire and Macromedia or the
proposed merger, and an evaluation of the results of those analyses is not
entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses involve complex considerations and
judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors
that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the
companies, business segments or transactions being analyzed. The estimates
contained in Credit Suisse First Boston's analyses and the ranges of valuations
resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual
values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly
more or less favorable than those suggested by the analyses. In addition,
analyses relating to the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be
appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually
may be sold. Accordingly, Credit Suisse First Boston's analyses and estimates
are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

     Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion and financial analyses were only one
of many factors considered by the Allaire board of directors in its evaluation
of the proposed merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of
the Allaire board of directors or management with respect to the merger or the
merger consideration.

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses underlying
Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion dated January 16, 2001 delivered to the
Allaire board of directors in connection with the merger. THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES
SUMMARIZED BELOW INCLUDE INFORMATION PRESENTED IN TABULAR FORMAT. IN ORDER TO
FULLY UNDERSTAND CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON'S FINANCIAL ANALYSES, THE TABLES
MUST BE READ TOGETHER WITH THE TEXT OF EACH SUMMARY. THE TABLES ALONE DO NOT
CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES. CONSIDERING THE
DATA IN THE TABLES BELOW WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE FULL NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF
THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES, INCLUDING THE METHODOLOGIES AND ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING
THE ANALYSES, COULD CREATE A MISLEADING OR INCOMPLETE VIEW OF CREDIT SUISSE
FIRST BOSTON'S FINANCIAL ANALYSES.

     COMPARABLE COMPANIES ANALYSIS. Credit Suisse First Boston compared
financial, operating and stock market data of Allaire and Macromedia to
corresponding data of the following 12 publicly traded

companies in the application server vendors industry, e-business applications
industry and web development tools industry:

  APPLICATION SERVER VENDORS       E-BUSINESS APPLICATIONS          WEB DEVELOPMENT TOOLS

                                - Kana Communications

     Credit Suisse First Boston compared stock prices as a multiple of estimated
calendar years 2000 and 2001 earnings per share and fully diluted aggregate
values, calculated as fully diluted equity market value plus net debt, as a
multiple of estimated calendar years 2000 and 2001 revenues. All multiples were
based on closing stock prices on January 12, 2001, the date two trading days
before public announcement of the merger. Estimated financial data for Allaire,
Macromedia and the groups of companies were based on various research analysts'
estimates and IBES consensus estimates. This analysis indicated the following
median implied multiples for the groups of companies, as compared to the implied
multiples for Allaire:

                                                        PRICE/EARNINGS        AGGREGATE VALUE/REVENUE}

     PREMIUMS PAID ANALYSIS. Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed purchase prices
paid in 211 stock-for-stock transactions since April 30, 1987 and 82
stock-for-stock transactions since June 22, 1995 involving companies in the
software industry, as well as Hewlett-Packard Company's acquisition of Bluestone
Software, Inc. For each transaction or group of transactions, Credit Suisse
First Boston calculated the premium of the exchange ratio in the transaction to
the ratio of the stock prices for the acquirors and targets in the transactions
one trading day before the announcement of the transaction and over various
other periods before the announcement of the transaction. Credit Suisse First
Boston then derived an implied exchange ratio for the merger over various
periods by applying the premium in the selected transaction and the median
premium in the groups of transactions to the ratio of the closing price of
Allaire common stock to the closing price of Macromedia common stock over the
same periods. Credit Suisse First Boston then applied these implied exchange
ratios for the merger over various periods before the announcement of the
transaction to the closing price of Macromedia common stock on January 12, 2001.
This analysis indicated the following implied per share values for Allaire
common stock over the various periods, as compared to the per share merger
consideration for Allaire common stock implied by the cash consideration and
exchange ratio of 0.2 in the merger:

                                                   IMPLIED ALLAIRE COMMON STOCK PRICE BASED ON PRECEDENT

Hewlett-Packard/Bluestone Software..............   $6.42     $5.19     $5.18     $6.21    $8.18    $6.35

     Based on the closing price of Macromedia common stock on January 12, 2001
of $41.94, the per share merger consideration for Allaire common stock implied
by the cash consideration and exchange ratio of 0.2 in the merger is $11.39.

     TRANSACTION MULTIPLES ANALYSIS. Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed the
purchase price paid in a selected transaction which Credit Suisse First Boston
deemed relevant and compared the aggregate value of that transaction as a
multiple of estimated calendar year 2001 revenue with the corresponding
multiples for Macromedia as of January 12, 2001 and for Allaire as implied by
the cash consideration and exchange ratio in the merger. The multiple for the
selected transaction was based on a transaction value as of January 12, 2001.
Estimated financial data for Allaire and Macromedia were based on research
analysts' estimates. Using the calendar year 2001 revenue multiple implied by
the selected transaction, Credit Suisse First Boston derived an implied
aggregate value for Allaire which was then used to derive an implied per share
value for Allaire common stock of $11.33, as compared to the per share merger
consideration for Allaire common stock of $11.39 implied by the cash
consideration and exchange ratio of 0.20 in the merger.

     EXCHANGE RATIO ANALYSIS. Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed the average of
the ratios of the closing price of Allaire common stock to the closing price of
Macromedia common stock over various periods ending January 12, 2001. Credit
Suisse First Boston then calculated the premium/(discount) of the exchange ratio
as of January 12, 2001, referred to as the current market, and as implied by the
cash consideration and exchange ratio of 0.2 in the merger to the average
exchange ratio over each period observed. This analysis indicated the following:

                                                                                 PREMIUM/(DISCOUNT) TO

     PRO FORMA IMPACT ANALYSIS. Credit Suisse First Boston analyzed the
potential pro forma effect of the merger on Macromedia's estimated earnings per
share for estimated calendar year 2001 second quarter, third quarter, fourth
quarter and full year based on two scenarios, assuming that the merger is
consummated by April 2001. The first scenario, the street case, was based on
research analysts' estimates. The second scenario, the alternate case, was based
on the street case after giving effect to $5.0 million in pre-tax cost synergies
per quarter anticipated by the managements of Allaire and Macromedia to result
from the merger. Based on the cash consideration and the exchange ratio for the
stock consideration in the merger of 0.2, this analysis indicated the following
accretion/(dilution) to Macromedia's estimated earnings per share:

                                                 MACROMEDIA EARNINGS
                                            PER SHARE ACCRETION/(DILUTION)

     COMPARATIVE STOCK PRICE PERFORMANCE. Credit Suisse First Boston also
compared the recent stock price performance of each of Allaire and Macromedia
with indices comprised of companies in the web development tools industry,
application server vendors industry, e-business applications industry, and the

Nasdaq composite index over the period from January 3, 2000 through January 12,
2001. The results of this analysis were as follows:

                                                            INCREASE/(DECREASE)

                                                         SHARE FROM JANUARY 3, 2000
                   COMPANY OR INDEX                         TO JANUARY 12, 2001
                   ----------------                      --------------------------

Allaire................................................             (90.1)%
Macromedia.............................................             (44.9)%
Web development tools industry.........................              44.5%

e-business applications industry.......................             (71.8)%
Nasdaq composite index.................................             (36.4)%

     OTHER FACTORS. In the course of preparing its opinion, Credit Suisse First
Boston also reviewed and considered other information and data, including:

     - the diluted ownership of Allaire stockholders in the combined company
       implied by the historical exchange ratios of Allaire common stock to
       Macromedia common stock over various periods before the announcement
       compared to the ownership implied by the cash consideration and exchange
       ratio for the stock consideration in the merger of 0.2, assuming a mixed
       cash and stock transaction;

     - selected research analysts' reports for Macromedia common stock,
       including earnings per share and revenue estimates of those analysts;

     - reported revenue, gross profit, operating income and EPS for the last
       five fiscal quarters for Macromedia compared to research analysts'
       estimates for the respective quarters; and

     - historical price performance of Macromedia common stock.

     Miscellaneous. Allaire has agreed to pay Credit Suisse First Boston for its
financial advisory services customary fees based on the aggregate value of the
merger. Allaire also has agreed to reimburse Credit Suisse First Boston for its
out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and expenses of legal counsel and any
other advisor retained by Credit Suisse First Boston, and to indemnify Credit
Suisse First Boston and related parties against liabilities, including
liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising out of its engagement.

     Credit Suisse First Boston and its affiliates have in the past provided
financial services to Allaire unrelated to the proposed merger, for which
services Credit Suisse First Boston has received compensation. Credit Suisse
First Boston served as lead managing underwriter of Allaire's initial public
offering in January 1999 and its public offering in September 1999, for which it
received customary underwriting discounts and commissions. Credit Suisse First
Boston also served as Allaire's financial advisor in connection with Allaire's
acquisition of Bright Tiger Technologies, for which it received customary fees.
In the ordinary course of business, Credit Suisse First Boston and its
affiliates may actively trade the securities of Allaire and Macromedia for their
own accounts and for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, may at any time
hold long or short positions in those securities.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER

     In considering the recommendation of the Allaire board of directors
regarding the merger, Allaire stockholders should note that some of Allaire's
stockholders, directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that
are different from, or in addition to, their interests as Allaire stockholders.
These interests may create potential conflicts of interest. The boards of
directors of Macromedia and Allaire were aware of these interests and took these
interests into account in approving the merger and the transactions contemplated
by the merger documents.

     Voting agreements. David Orfao, a director and the president and chief
executive officer of Allaire, Joseph J. Allaire, chairman of the board of
directors of Allaire, Jeremy Allaire, a director and the chief

technical officer of Allaire, and David Gerth, vice president, finance and
operations, chief financial officer and treasurer of Allaire, have entered into
voting agreements in which they agreed to vote their shares of Allaire common
stock in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and have executed irrevocable
proxies with respect to their shares in favor of Macromedia.

     Allaire stock options. The Allaire stock options held by each of Allaire's
directors and executive officers will be assumed in the merger and become
exercisable, in accordance with their terms, for shares of Macromedia common
stock. Upon the merger, the vesting of the stock options of Jonathan Flint, John
Gannon, Ronald Ward and Frank King, all of whom are directors of Allaire, will
be accelerated so that fifty percent of the unvested shares subject to these
options will become vested. For this purpose, the shares that would otherwise
have vested latest will be vested first. The vesting of stock options held by
four Allaire executive officers will accelerate upon the merger. For more
information about the acceleration of the vesting of these stock options, see
"-- Severance arrangements" below.

     Allaire restricted stock. Upon the merger, shares of Allaire restricted
stock owned by each of Allaire's directors and executive officers will be
exchanged either for Macromedia common stock and cash, or for cash, depending on
the price of Macromedia common stock two trading days before the Allaire
stockholders' meeting, subject to the same restrictions. Any cash consideration
payable to the holders of Allaire restricted stock as a result of the merger
will be paid only according to the vesting schedule in an agreement between
Allaire and each holder of Allaire restricted stock, or as otherwise agreed to
by Macromedia and Allaire. Fifty percent of the unvested portion of Allaire
restricted stock owned by Thomas Herring, a director of Allaire, will vest upon
completion of the merger. The vesting of Allaire restricted stock owned by two
Allaire executive officers will accelerate upon the merger. For more information
about the acceleration of the vesting of this restricted stock, see
"-- Severance arrangements" below.

     Employment arrangements. Three executive officers of Allaire, Timothy
Yeaton, the senior vice president, products of Allaire, Jack Lull, the vice
president, engineering and development of Allaire, and Jeremy Allaire, the chief
technology officer and a director of Allaire, have signed, or are expected to
sign, employment agreements with Macromedia. These agreements will take effect
on the day the merger is completed. Each employment agreement provides for a
two-year service period with Macromedia and provides severance in the event
Macromedia terminates the employee's employment without cause within two years
of the effective date of his employment. Each employee also signed, or is
expected to sign, Macromedia's standard proprietary information and inventions
agreement, as well as non-competition and non-solicitation agreements similar to
those signed by other employees. For more information on these other agreements
with Macromedia, see the description under "Related Agreements -- Employment
agreements" on page 61.

     It is currently expected that David Gerth, vice president, finance and
operations, chief financial officer and treasurer of Allaire, will enter into an
agreement before the merger in which he will agree to work for Macromedia
following the merger for a transitional period ending on December 31, 2001,
during which he will be paid at the level of his salary and target bonus at the
time of the merger. If Macromedia terminates his employment during the
transitional period, it will pay him through the end of the transitional period
and his effective termination date for purposes of his stock options will be
December 31, 2001.

     Severance arrangements. Four Allaire executive officers will become
entitled to severance payments and benefits, including acceleration of stock
options and restricted stock, upon termination of their employment with Allaire
on or following completion of the merger, as follows.

        David Orfao. Under the terms of his employment offer letter from
Allaire, David Orfao, the president and chief executive officer of Allaire, is
entitled to receive a severance payment equal to his annual base salary and the
continuation of benefits for a period of 12 months if he is involuntarily
terminated for reasons other than cause on or following the merger. His offer
letter also provides that his

Allaire stock options will vest in full if he is not offered a comparable
position and title following the merger. Allaire has agreed to provide the
following severance benefits to Mr. Orfao:

     - Allaire has agreed to pay him a severance payment equal to his annual
       salary and target bonus, as calculated at the time of the merger;

     - Allaire has agreed to accelerate the vesting of his stock options in full
       upon the merger;

     - Allaire has agreed to extend the period in which he can exercise his
       stock options so that he will have a period of 12 months following
       termination of his employment in which to exercise his stock options; and

     - Allaire has agreed to pay him a gross-up amount equal to the amount of
       any excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code and
       related interest and penalties, and any taxes arising from such payment,
       that may become payable by him in connection with any of the severance
       payments or other benefits obtained by him on or following the merger,
       including the acceleration of vesting of his stock options.

        David Gerth. Allaire has agreed to provide the following severance
benefits to David Gerth, vice president, finance and operations, chief financial
officer and treasurer of Allaire:

     - Allaire has agreed to pay him a severance payment equal to his annual
       salary and target bonus, as calculated at the time of the merger, on the
       earlier of his termination of employment or nine months following the
       merger;

     - Allaire has agreed to continue his existing benefits for a period of 12
       months following the termination of his employment on or following the
       merger;

     - Allaire has agreed to accelerate the vesting of his stock options and
       restricted stock in full upon the merger;

     - Allaire has agreed to extend the period in which he can exercise his
       stock options so that he will have a period of 12 months following
       termination of his employment in which to exercise his stock options; and

     - Allaire has agreed to pay him a gross-up amount equal to the amount of
       any excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code and
       related interest and penalties, and any taxes arising from such payment,
       that may become payable by him in connection with any of the severance
       payments or other benefits obtained by him on or following completion of
       the merger, including the acceleration of vesting of his stock options
       and restricted stock.

        Amy Lewis and Stephen Clark. Allaire has agreed to provide the following
severance benefits to Amy Lewis, vice president, worldwide sales of Allaire, and
Stephen Clark, vice president, marketing of Allaire:

     - Allaire has agreed to pay each of them a severance payment equal to nine
       months of their respective annual salary and target bonus, calculated at
       the time of the merger, on or before the earlier of their termination of
       employment or nine months after the completion of the merger;

     - Allaire has agreed to continue their existing benefits for a period of
       nine months following termination of their employment;

     - Allaire has agreed to accelerate the vesting of their stock options and
       restricted stock so that fifty percent of the unvested shares subject to
       the options and restricted stock will become vested. For this purpose,
       the shares that would otherwise have vested latest will be vested first;
       and

     - Allaire has agreed to extend the period in which they can exercise their
       stock options so that they will have a period of 12 months following
       termination of their employment in which to exercise their stock options.

     Indemnification; insurance. Macromedia will cause the surviving corporation
to indemnify all persons who were officers or directors of Allaire before the
merger to the same extent those persons were indemnified under Allaire's
certificate of incorporation or by-laws in effect on the date of the merger
agreement or under any indemnification agreement between Allaire and any such
officer or director.

     For five years after completion of the merger, Macromedia will cause the
surviving corporation to maintain Allaire's existing officers' and directors'
liability insurance on terms comparable to those in effect on the date of the
merger agreement. The surviving corporation may substitute a comparable policy
for the existing policy as long as the terms and conditions of the substitute
policy are not substantively less advantageous to the covered officers and
directors. However, if Macromedia's annual premium payment for the insurance
policy exceeds 150% of the current Allaire annual premium, Macromedia will not
be obligated to pay any amount in excess of 150% of the current Allaire annual
premium and will not be obligated to provide more coverage than it can purchase
for 150% of the current Allaire annual premium.

COMPLETION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MERGER

     The merger will be completed when all of the conditions to completion of
the merger are satisfied or waived, including approval and adoption of the
merger agreement and the merger by the stockholders of Allaire. The merger will
become effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the State of
Delaware.

STRUCTURE OF THE MERGER AND CONVERSION OF ALLAIRE COMMON STOCK

     If the closing price of Macromedia common stock two trading days before the
Allaire stockholders' meeting is greater than or equal to $15.00, then Allaire
will be merged with and into Alaska Acquisition Corporation, a newly formed and
wholly owned subsidiary of Macromedia, and Alaska Acquisition Corporation will
be the surviving corporation of the merger. Macromedia will exchange 0.2 shares
of its common stock and $3.00 in cash for each share of Allaire common stock.
Macromedia will not issue any fractional shares of Macromedia common stock in
connection with the merger. Instead, Allaire's stockholders will receive cash,
without interest, in lieu of any fraction of a share of Macromedia common stock.

     However, if the closing price of Macromedia common stock two trading days
before the Allaire stockholders' meeting is less than $15.00 per share, then
Alaska Acquisition Corporation will be merged with and into Allaire, and Allaire
will survive the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Macromedia. In that
event, Macromedia will not issue any shares of its common stock in exchange for
shares of Allaire common stock. Instead, Macromedia will pay cash equal to $3.00
plus 0.2 of that closing price.

EXCHANGE OF ALLAIRE STOCK CERTIFICATES FOR MACROMEDIA STOCK CERTIFICATES AND/OR
CASH

     When the merger is completed, Macromedia's exchange agent will mail to you
a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in surrendering Allaire stock
certificates in exchange for Macromedia stock certificates and/or cash. When you
deliver your Allaire stock certificates to the exchange agent along with an
executed letter of transmittal and any other required documents, your Allaire
stock certificates will be canceled and you will receive Macromedia stock
certificates and/or cash representing the number of full shares of Macromedia
common stock and/or cash to which you are entitled under the merger agreement.
You will also receive payment in cash, without interest, in lieu of any
fractional shares of Macromedia common stock that would have been otherwise
issuable to you in the merger. You should not submit your Allaire stock
certificates for exchange unless and until you receive the transmittal
instructions and a form of letter of transmittal from the exchange agent.

     You will not be entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions on
Macromedia common stock until the merger is completed and you have surrendered
your Allaire stock certificates in exchange for Macromedia stock certificates.
Macromedia does not anticipate paying any dividends with respect to its stock.

     Macromedia will issue a Macromedia stock certificate or a check in lieu of
a fractional share only in a name in which a surrendered Allaire stock
certificate is registered. If you wish to have your certificate issued in
another name, you must present the exchange agent with all documents required to
make the unrecorded transfer of ownership of your Allaire shares and show that
you paid any applicable stock transfer taxes.

REGULATORY FILINGS AND APPROVALS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE MERGER

     The merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act, which prevents transactions like the merger from
being completed until required information and materials are furnished to the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission
and the appropriate waiting periods end or expire. We have filed the required
information and materials with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade
Commission. Upon termination or expiration of the waiting period, the
requirements of Hart-Scott-Rodino will be satisfied if we complete the merger
within one year from the termination of the waiting period.

     The Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission may challenge the
merger on antitrust grounds either before or after expiration of the waiting
period. Accordingly, at any time before or after the completion of the merger,
either the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission could take
action under the antitrust laws. Other persons could take action under antitrust
laws, including seeking to enjoin the merger. Additionally, at any time before
or after the completion of the merger, notwithstanding that the applicable
waiting period expired or ended, any state could take action under its antitrust
laws. A challenge to the merger could be made, and if a challenge is made,
Allaire or Macromedia may not prevail.

     Neither Macromedia nor Allaire is aware of any other material governmental
or regulatory approval required for completion of the merger, other than the
effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus/proxy
statement is a part, and compliance with applicable corporate laws of Delaware.

RESTRICTIONS ON SALES OF SHARES BY AFFILIATES OF MACROMEDIA AND ALLAIRE

     Any shares of Macromedia common stock issued in the merger will be
registered under the Securities Act. These shares will be freely transferable
under the Securities Act, except for shares of Macromedia common stock issued to
any person who is an affiliate of either of us. Persons who may be deemed to be
affiliates include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or
are under common control of either of Macromedia or Allaire and may include some
of their respective officers and directors, as well as their respective
principal stockholders. Affiliates may not sell their shares of Macromedia
common stock acquired in the merger except pursuant to

     - an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the
       resale of those shares;

     - an exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act; or

     - any other applicable exemption under the Securities Act.

LISTING ON THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET OF MACROMEDIA COMMON STOCK TO BE ISSUED IN
THE MERGER

     It is a condition to the closing of the merger that any shares of
Macromedia common stock to be issued in the merger be approved for listing on
the Nasdaq National Market.

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF ALLAIRE COMMON STOCK AFTER THE MERGER

     If the merger is completed, the Allaire common stock will be delisted from
the Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the Securities
Exchange Act.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE MERGER

     We intend to account for the merger as a purchase transaction for financial
reporting and accounting purposes, under generally accepted accounting
principles. After the merger, the results of operations of Allaire will be
included in the consolidated financial statements of Macromedia. The purchase
price, which is equal to the aggregate merger consideration, will be allocated
based on the fair values of the Allaire assets acquired and the Allaire
liabilities assumed. The amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair
value of the net tangible assets of Allaire acquired will be recorded as
goodwill and other intangible assets and will be amortized by charges to
operations under generally accepted accounting principles. These allocations
will be made based upon valuations and other studies that have not yet been
finalized.

ALLAIRE STOCKHOLDERS' APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Even if the merger is approved by Allaire's stockholders, any Allaire
stockholders who do not vote in favor of or consent to the merger and who have
previously taken necessary steps under Delaware law may exercise rights of
appraisal under Delaware law, rather than receive the merger consideration in
the merger. Generally, under Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation
Law, a stockholder who:

     - holds shares of Allaire's stock on the date that it makes a demand in
       accordance with Section 262 with respect to those shares,

     - continuously holds those shares through the effective time of the merger,
       and

     - has not voted in favor of the merger or consented to the merger,

will be entitled to an appraisal by the Delaware Court of Chancery of the fair
value of those shares, excluding any appreciation or depreciation resulting from
the anticipation or accomplishment of the merger, together with a fair rate of
interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.
The surviving corporation in the merger will then be required to pay the
stockholder the fair value determined by the court. A stockholder who wishes to
exercise appraisal rights must deliver a written demand for appraisal to Allaire
before the vote of Allaire's stockholders is completed. Macromedia's
stockholders are not entitled to dissenters' rights or appraisal rights with
respect to the merger.

     The provisions of Delaware law governing appraisal rights are complex, and
you should study them carefully if you wish to exercise appraisal rights;
certain actions by a stockholder can prevent that stockholder from successfully
asserting these rights, and multiple steps must be taken to properly perfect the
rights. See "Appraisal Rights" on page 81 for more detail.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

     The following is a summary of the material United States federal income tax
consequences generally applicable to you, as a stockholder of Allaire, if you
are a United States person as defined for United States federal income tax
purposes and you hold your shares of Allaire common stock as a capital asset.

     For United States federal income tax purposes, you are a United States
person if you are any of the following:

     - a United States citizen or resident alien as determined under the
       Internal Revenue Code, or the tax code;

     - a corporation or partnership, as defined by the tax code, that is
       organized under the laws of the United States or any state;

     - an estate, the income of which is subject to United States federal income
       taxation regardless of its source; or

     - a trust, if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary
       supervision over the trust's administration and at least one United
       States person is authorized to control all of the trust's major
       decisions.

     This summary is based on the tax code, existing and proposed Treasury
regulations and judicial and administrative determinations, as each is in effect
as of the date of this prospectus/proxy statement. All of the foregoing are
subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect, and all are
subject to differing interpretation. No advance ruling has been sought or
obtained from the IRS regarding the United States federal income tax
consequences of the merger. The statements in this document and the opinions of
counsel that are described in this prospectus/proxy statement are not binding on
the IRS or a court. As a result, neither Allaire, Macromedia nor Alaska
Acquisition Corporation can assure you that the tax considerations or opinions
described here will not be challenged by the IRS or that any challenge will not
be sustained by a court.

     This summary does not address aspects of United States taxation other than
United States federal income taxation. It does not address all aspects of United
States federal income taxation that may apply to you if you are subject to
special rules under the tax code, including, among others, rules that apply to
persons who acquired shares of Allaire common stock as a result of the exercise
of employee stock options, tax-exempt organizations, financial institutions,
broker-dealers, insurance companies, persons having a "functional currency"
other than the United States dollar, persons who hold their shares of Allaire
common stock as part of a straddle, wash sale, hedging or conversion
transaction, and some United States expatriates. In addition, this summary and
the opinions described here do not address the state, local or foreign tax
consequences of the merger.

     YOU ARE URGED TO CONSULT AND RELY ON YOUR TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE
UNITED STATES FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL, AND FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE
MERGER BASED UPON YOUR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.

The merger as reorganization

     It is a condition of the obligations of each of Allaire, Macromedia and
Alaska Acquisition Corporation to effect the merger that, unless the closing
price of Macromedia common stock two trading days before the Allaire
stockholders' meeting is less than $15.00 per share, and Macromedia instead pays
all cash for Allaire shares, Allaire and Macromedia shall each have received
substantially identical written opinions from their counsel, Foley, Hoag & Eliot
LLP and Fenwick & West LLP, respectively, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to them, to the effect that the merger will constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the tax code and that
each of Allaire and Macromedia will be a party to the reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the tax code. Allaire, Macromedia and Alaska
Acquisition Corporation have agreed to make reasonable representations as
requested by counsel for the purpose of rendering those opinions.

     As a consequence of reorganization treatment, the following United States
federal income consequences will result:

     - you will recognize no gain or loss upon your receipt of shares of
       Macromedia common stock in partial exchange for your shares of Allaire
       common stock; you will recognize gain (but not loss) equal to the lesser
       of the following:

       - the total amount of cash that you receive, including cash in lieu of a
         fractional share interest in Macromedia common stock, and

       - the total gain that you realize in the transaction, as measured by the
         difference between the total fair market value of the cash and
         Macromedia common stock you receive in the merger and your adjusted
         basis in your shares of Allaire common stock;

     - your gain or loss will constitute capital gain or loss from the sale of
       stock if you hold the Allaire common stock as a capital asset at the
       effective time of the merger, and will be long-term or short-term capital
       gain or loss depending on your holding period. Your aggregate tax basis
       of any Macromedia common stock you receive in the merger will be equal to
       the aggregate tax basis of the Allaire common stock you surrendered,
       increased by the gain you recognized in the merger, and reduced by the
       cash you received;

     - your holding period for any shares of Macromedia common stock that you
       receive in the merger in exchange for your shares of Allaire common stock
       will include your holding period for those shares of Allaire common
       stock; and

     - none of Macromedia, Alaska Acquisition Corporation, Allaire or any
       stockholder of Macromedia will recognize any gain or loss as a result of
       the merger.

     If you receive any cash in the merger you may become subject to the backup
withholding rules, unless you are a corporation. Those rules require withholding
at the rate of 31% unless you fall into certain exempt categories or provide a
taxpayer identification number and otherwise comply with the applicable
requirements of the backup withholding rules. Any amounts you pay as backup
withholding are creditable against your income tax liability provided that you
make the required filings with the IRS.

IRS challenge to reorganization treatment

     If the IRS were to challenge successfully the treatment of the merger as a
reorganization, as set forth in the opinions described above, then you would
recognize taxable gain or loss with respect to your shares of Allaire common
stock surrendered in the merger, in an amount equal to the difference between:

     - the fair market value of the shares of Macromedia common stock and cash
       that you received in the merger, and

     - your adjusted tax basis in your shares of Allaire common stock.

     In this case, your aggregate tax basis in the shares of Macromedia common
stock received would equal the fair market value of the shares, and your holding
period for the shares would begin the day after the merger. In addition, Allaire
would recognize taxable gain or loss with respect to its assets considered, for
tax purposes, to have been transferred to Alaska Acquisition Corporation in the
merger.

Conversion event

     If the closing price of Macromedia common stock two trading days before the
Allaire stockholders' meeting is less than $15.00 per share, and Macromedia
instead pays all cash for Allaire shares, you would be considered for tax
purposes to have sold your Allaire stock for cash and would recognize taxable
gain or loss with respect to your shares of Allaire common stock surrendered in
the merger, in an amount equal to the difference between:

     - the amount of cash you received in the merger, and

     - your adjusted basis in your shares of Allaire common stock.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     This section summarizes the material provisions of the merger agreement.
The following is not a complete statement of all the provisions of the merger
agreement. Detailed terms and conditions are contained in the merger agreement,
a copy of which is attached to this document as Annex A and is incorporated into
this document by reference. For a complete presentation of this information,
please read the full text of the merger agreement.

THE STRUCTURE OF THE MERGER AND MERGER CONSIDERATION ALTERNATIVES

     The structure of the merger and the form of consideration to be received in
exchange for shares of Allaire common stock depend on the closing price of
Macromedia common stock two trading days before the Allaire stockholders'
meeting. If on that date the closing price is greater than or equal to $15.00
per share, Allaire will merge with and into Alaska Acquisition Corporation, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Macromedia, Alaska Acquisition Corporation will
survive the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Macromedia, and Allaire
stockholders will receive 0.2 shares of Macromedia common stock and $3.00 in
cash for each outstanding share of Allaire common stock. If the closing price on
that date is less than $15.00 per share, Alaska Acquisition Corporation will
merge with and into Allaire, Allaire will survive the merger as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Macromedia, and Allaire stockholders will instead receive only
cash for each outstanding share of Allaire common stock, as described below.
Shares of Allaire common stock for which dissenters' appraisal rights are
validly exercised will not receive Macromedia common stock and/or cash in either
case. Instead, holders of these dissenting shares will receive only the payment
that they are entitled to receive as determined, after litigation, by the
Delaware Chancery Court. See "Appraisal Rights" on page 81.

     These merger structures differ so that, whether Macromedia exchanges in the
merger Macromedia common stock and cash, or only cash, for the shares of Allaire
common stock, Allaire itself will not incur federal or state income tax
liability in connection with the merger. In either of these merger structures,
the Allaire stockholders will incur income tax. However, these different merger
structures and forms of consideration have different tax consequences to the
stockholders of Allaire. See "The Merger -- Federal income tax consequences of
the merger" on page 43.

EXCHANGE OF ALLAIRE COMMON STOCK FOR MACROMEDIA COMMON STOCK AND CASH

     If the closing price of Macromedia common stock two trading days before the
Allaire stockholders' meeting is greater than or equal to $15.00, then Allaire
will be merged with and into Alaska Acquisition Corporation, and Alaska
Acquisition Corporation will be the surviving corporation of the merger. Except
with regard to dissenting shares, Macromedia will exchange 0.2 shares of its
common stock and $3.00 in cash for each share of Allaire common stock. Allaire
has informed Macromedia that as of February   , 2001, there were outstanding
               shares of its common stock.

     For example, as of the close of business on January 12, 2001, the last
trading day before the signing of the merger agreement, the closing price of
Macromedia common stock was $41.94 per share. If $41.94 per share were the
closing price two trading days before the Allaire stockholders' meeting, each
share of Allaire common stock would be exchanged for 0.2 shares of Macromedia
common stock, valued at $8.39, and $3.00 in cash, for a combined merger
consideration of $11.39.

     The aggregate number of shares of Macromedia common stock actually issued
will vary based upon the number of shares of Allaire common stock outstanding at
the completion of the merger, which may change between signing and closing for a
number of reasons, including option exercises, stock repurchases and warrant
exercises. The per-share value of Macromedia common stock may also change based
on changes in its trading price in the same time period. Allaire is not
permitted to terminate its obligation to complete the merger, nor may Allaire
resolicit the vote of its stockholders, based solely on changes in the value of
Macromedia common stock.

ALTERNATIVE EXCHANGE OF ALLAIRE COMMON STOCK FOR CASH

     Alternatively, if the closing price of Macromedia common stock two trading
days before the Allaire stockholders' meeting is less than $15.00 per share,
then Alaska Acquisition Corporation will be merged with and into Allaire, and
Allaire will survive the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Macromedia. In
that case, Macromedia will not issue any shares of its common stock in exchange
for shares of Allaire common stock. Instead, Macromedia will pay cash equal to
$3.00 plus two tenths of that closing price for each share of Allaire common
stock.

     For example, if the closing price of Macromedia common stock two trading
days before the Allaire stockholders' meeting is $14.50 per share, Macromedia
would pay $5.90 in cash for each share of Allaire common stock except for
dissenting shares, computed as follows: $3.00 + (0.2 X $14.50). If the closing
price of Macromedia common stock two trading days before the Allaire
stockholders' meeting is less than $15.00, the actual amount of cash exchanged
for each share of Allaire common stock will depend on that closing price.

CONVERSION OF OPTIONS

     When the merger is completed, each option to purchase shares of Allaire
common stock will be assumed by Macromedia and converted into an option to
purchase shares of Macromedia common stock. Allaire has informed Macromedia that
as of January 30, 2001, there were outstanding options to acquire 11,450,954
shares of Allaire common stock.

     In connection with this conversion:

     - each assumed Allaire option can be exercised only for Macromedia common
       stock;

     - the number of shares of Macromedia common stock issuable on exercise of
       the assumed Allaire option will be determined by multiplying the number
       of shares of Allaire common stock subject to the Allaire option by the
       applicable option conversion ratio (described below); and

     - the exercise price of the assumed Allaire option will be determined by
       dividing the exercise price of the Allaire option by the applicable
       option conversion ratio.

     If the closing price of Macromedia common stock two trading days before the
Allaire stockholders' meeting is greater than or equal to $15.00, then the
option conversion ratio will be 0.2 plus the quotient of $3.00 divided by the
average of the closing prices of Macromedia common stock on the five trading
days ending the trading day before completion of the merger.

     For example, if the closing price of Macromedia common stock two trading
days before the Allaire stockholders' meeting is greater than or equal to
$15.00, and the five-day closing average for Macromedia common stock ending on
the trading day immediately before completion of the merger is $40.00 per share,
an option to acquire 10,000 shares of Allaire common stock at $7.00 per share
would be exercisable for 2,750 shares of Macromedia common stock at an exercise
price of approximately $25.45 per share, computed as follows:

     - 0.2 + ($3.00 / $40.00) = 0.275, the option conversion ratio.

     - 10,000 shares X 0.275 = 2,750 shares; and

     - $7.00 / 0.275 = $25.45.

In this example, assuming that at the completion of the merger the number of
shares of Allaire common stock subject to outstanding options is the same as the
number on January 30, 2001, in the aggregate, the Allaire options would be
converted into options to acquire approximately 3,149,012 shares of Macromedia
common stock at the completion of the merger.

     Alternatively, if the closing price of Macromedia common stock two trading
days before the Allaire stockholders' meeting is less than $15.00, then the
option conversion ratio will be the quotient of 0.2 multiplied by the closing
price of Macromedia common stock two trading days before the Allaire
stockholders' meeting, plus $3.00, all divided by the average of the closing
prices of Macromedia common stock during the five trading days ending on the
trading day before completion of the merger.

     For example, if the closing price of Macromedia common stock two trading
days before the Allaire stockholders' meeting is $14.50, and the five-day
closing average for Macromedia common stock is $14.00 per share, an option to
acquire 10,000 shares of Allaire common stock at $7.00 per share would be
exercisable for 4,210 shares of Macromedia common stock at an exercise price of
approximately $16.63 per share, computed as follows:

     - ((0.2 X $14.50) + $3.00) divided by $14.00 = 0.421, the option conversion
       ratio.

     - 10,000 shares X 0.421 = 4,210 shares; and

     - $7.00 / 0.421 = $16.63.

In this example, assuming that at the completion of the merger the number of
shares of Allaire common stock subject to outstanding options is the same as the
number on January 30, 2001, in the aggregate, the Allaire options would be
converted into options to acquire approximately 4,820,851 shares of Macromedia
common stock at the completion of the merger.

     Other than the change in the option conversion ratios described above, each
assumed Allaire option will continue to have the same vesting schedule and other
terms as set forth in the applicable stock option agreement between Allaire and
the option holder and, if applicable, in the Allaire stock option plan under
which the option was granted.

CONVERSION OF WARRANTS

     When the merger is completed, each warrant to purchase shares of Allaire
common stock will be assumed by Macromedia and converted into a warrant either
to purchase Macromedia common stock and cash or to acquire an amount of cash.
The consideration received upon exercise of this warrant will depend on the
consideration issued by Macromedia in exchange for shares of Allaire common
stock in the merger. Allaire has informed Macromedia that as of January 30,
2001, there were outstanding warrants to acquire 15,056 shares of Allaire common
stock.

     If the closing price of Macromedia common stock two trading days before the
Allaire stockholders' meeting is greater than or equal to $15.00, then upon
completion of the merger, each warrant to acquire Allaire common stock will be
converted into a warrant to acquire:

     - a number of shares of Macromedia common stock determined by multiplying
       0.2 by the number of shares of Allaire common stock previously subject to
       the warrant, plus

     - an amount of cash equal to $3.00 multiplied by the number of shares of
       Allaire common stock previously subject to the warrant; and

the exercise price per share of Macromedia common stock will be the aggregate
exercise price of the warrant immediately before the completion of the merger
divided by the number of shares of Macromedia common stock issuable upon
exercise of the warrant following completion of the merger.

     For example, if the closing price of Macromedia common stock two trading
days before the Allaire stockholders' meeting is greater than or equal to
$15.00, a warrant to acquire 1,000 shares of Allaire common stock at $3.50 per
share would be exercisable for 200 Macromedia shares and $3,000 of cash at an
exercise price of $17.50 per share of Macromedia common stock, computed as
follows:

     - 0.2 X 1,000 Allaire shares = 200 Macromedia shares;

     - $3.00 X 1,000 Allaire shares = $3,000; and

     - (1,000 X $3.50) / 200 Macromedia shares = $17.50 per share exercise
       price.

     If the closing price of Macromedia common stock two trading days before the
Allaire stockholders' meeting is less than $15.00, then each warrant to acquire
Allaire common stock will be converted into a warrant to acquire cash in
increments measured by the number of shares of Allaire common stock subject to
the warrant immediately before the completion of the merger, as follows:

     - the amount of cash per former share of Allaire common stock subject to
       the warrant will equal the sum of $3.00 plus an additional amount of cash
       equal to 0.2 multiplied by the closing price of Macromedia common stock
       two trading days before the Allaire stockholders' meeting; and

     - the exercise price per former share of Allaire common stock subject to
       the warrant will not change.

     For example, if the closing price of Macromedia common stock two trading
days before the Allaire stockholders' meeting is $14.50, then a warrant to
acquire 1,000 shares of Allaire common stock at $3.50 per share would be
exercisable for an aggregate exercise price of $3,500 to acquire $5,900 in cash,
computed as follows:

     - $3.00 + (0.2 X $14.50) = $5.90

     - $5.90 X 1,000 Allaire shares = $5,900

     Other than the change in the exercise price and the consideration issuable
by Macromedia upon exercise of the warrant, each assumed Allaire warrant will
continue to have the same terms as the applicable warrant between Allaire and
the warrant holder.

       Corporation in the merger agreement must be true and correct as of the

       then true and correct, this condition will be satisfied if the
       inaccuracies, or breaches of representations and warranties, taken
       together, do not cause a material adverse effect, as defined

       below, on Macromedia, other than with regard to the following
       representations and warranties, each of which must be materially correct

     - no material adverse effect on Macromedia has occurred and is continuing;
       and

     - Allaire has received a written opinion from its counsel that the merger
       constitutes a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
       Internal Revenue Code, but this requirement will not be a condition to

       share and Macromedia issues only cash in exchange for shares of Allaire
       common stock in the merger.

various conditions are satisfied or waived, including:

     - the representations and warranties of Allaire in the merger agreement
       must be true and correct as of the date of the merger agreement and as of
       the time of completion of the merger. However, if any of these
       representations and warranties are not then true and correct, this
       condition will be deemed satisfied if those inaccuracies, or breaches of
       representations and warranties, taken together, do not cause a material
       adverse effect on Allaire, other than with regard to the following
       representations and warranties, each of which must be materially correct
       upon the completion of the merger:

       - those concerning Allaire's capital stock;

       - those concerning Allaire's legal power to enter into the merger, board
         approval of the merger, lack of breach of laws or conflicts with
         Allaire's material agreements and lack of need for governmental
         approvals for the merger;

       - those concerning receipt by Allaire's board of directors from Credit
         Suisse First Boston of an opinion to the effect that the exchange ratio
         is fair to Allaire's stockholders from a financial point of view;

       - those concerning the actions by Allaire's board of directors to amend
         the Rights Agreement, dated December 8, 2000, between Allaire and Fleet

         application of corporate laws restricting business combinations from

     - Macromedia has received a written opinion from its counsel that the
       merger will constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section
       368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, but this requirement will not be a
       condition to the merger if the closing price of Macromedia's common stock
       two trading days before the Allaire stockholders' meeting is less than
       $15.00 per share and Macromedia issues only cash in exchange for shares
       of Allaire's common stock in the merger;

     - Allaire has received consents, approvals and waivers with regard to the
       merger from certain parties to other agreements with Allaire; and

     The term "material adverse effect" in the merger agreement means any
change, event, violation, inaccuracy, circumstance or effect that is or is
reasonably likely to be materially adverse to the business, assets,
capitalization, financial condition, operations or results of operations of a
party and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except that it
does not include:

     - changes in general economic conditions;

     - changes affecting generally the participants in the industries in which
       Macromedia and Allaire operate; or

     - changes in the trading prices of the capital stock of Macromedia or
       Allaire.

LIMIT ON OTHER NEGOTIATIONS; SUPERIOR OFFERS

     The merger agreement contains detailed provisions prohibiting Allaire from
seeking an alternative transaction regarding the acquisition of Allaire. Under
these "non-solicitation" provisions, Allaire has agreed that until the merger is
completed or until the merger agreement is terminated, neither Allaire nor any
of its affiliates will take any of the following actions and they will not
authorize or permit any of their officers, directors, employees, representatives
or agents to do so:

     - solicit, initiate or encourage any acquisition proposal, as described
       below;

     - participate in any negotiations or discussions of any acquisition
       proposal;

     - furnish any nonpublic information with respect to any acquisition
       proposal;

     - approve, endorse or recommend any acquisition proposal, except as
       described below with regard to a superior offer; or

     - enter into any letter of intent or any similar agreement contemplating or
       relating to an acquisition proposal.

     However, if Allaire receives an unsolicited, written, bona fide acquisition
proposal prior to the Allaire stockholders meeting that its board of directors
reasonably concludes, after consultation with a financial advisor of national
standing, may constitute a superior offer, as described below, Allaire may
furnish nonpublic information regarding itself and may enter into discussions
with the person who has made the acquisition proposal, if:

     - neither Allaire nor any representative of Allaire or its subsidiaries
       have violated the provisions of the merger agreement related to
       nonsolicitation;

     - Allaire's board of directors concludes in good faith, after consultation
       with outside legal counsel, that this action is required for the board to
       comply with its fiduciary obligations to Allaire's stockholders under
       applicable law;

     - prior to furnishing nonpublic information to, or entering into any
       discussion with, a person making the acquisition proposal, Allaire gives
       Macromedia written notice of the acquisition proposal, including the
       identity of the person making the acquisition proposal and the material
       terms and conditions of the acquisition proposal;

     - Allaire gives Macromedia two days advance written notice of its intention
       to furnish nonpublic information or enter into discussions regarding an
       acquisition proposal;

     - Allaire obtains a confidentiality agreement at least as protective as the
       confidentiality agreement it signed with Macromedia in connection with
       the merger; and

     - at the same time Allaire furnishes nonpublic information to a person
       making an acquisition proposal, it furnishes the same information to
       Macromedia if it has not already done so.

     An "acquisition proposal" is any proposal with respect to:

     - the acquisition of securities of Allaire that would result in any person
       or group beneficially owning 15% or more of the voting securities of
       Allaire or any of its subsidiaries;

     - a tender offer or exchange offer that would result in any person or group
       beneficially owning 15% or more of the voting securities of Allaire or
       any of its subsidiaries;

     - a merger, consolidation, business combination, or similar transaction
       involving Allaire and any person after which the holders of Allaire
       voting stock, immediately before the transaction, will not own 85% of the
       equity interests in the surviving entity immediately after the
       transaction;

     - the sale, lease, exchange, license, other than in the ordinary course of
       business, or disposition of any material assets of Allaire; or

     - the dissolution or liquidation of Allaire.

     A "superior offer" with respect to Allaire means an unsolicited, bona fide
written proposal from a third person to complete any of the following
transactions:

     - a merger or consolidation involving Allaire after which the stockholders
       of Allaire immediately preceding the transaction own less than 50% of the
       equity interests in the surviving entity immediately after the
       transaction; or

     - the acquisition by any person or group, including by way of a tender
       offer or an exchange offer or two-step transaction involving a tender
       offer followed with reasonable promptness by a merger involving Allaire,
       directly or indirectly, of 100% of the then outstanding shares of Allaire

on terms that the board of Allaire determines, in its reasonable judgment, after
consultation with a financial advisor of national standing, are more favorable
to Allaire's stockholders than the terms of the merger. An offer will not be a
superior offer if any financing required to complete the proposed transaction is
not committed, and evidence of the commitment provided to Macromedia, and if the
financing is not reasonably likely in the reasonable judgment of Allaire's
board, after consultation with its financial advisor, to be obtained by the
person making the offer on a timely basis.

     Allaire's board may, without breaching the merger agreement, withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation in favor of the merger if:

     - a superior offer is made and not withdrawn;

     - Allaire has provided written notice to Macromedia advising Macromedia
       that it has received a superior offer, including the identity of the
       person making the superior offer and the material terms and conditions of
       the superior offer;

     - Macromedia does not, within five written days of receipt of this written
       notice, make an offer that the board of Allaire determines by majority
       vote in its good faith judgment, after consultation with a financial
       advisor of national standing, is at least as favorable to Allaire's
       stockholders as the superior offer;

     - the board of Allaire reasonably concludes, after consultation with its
       outside counsel, that in light of the superior offer, the withholding,
       withdrawing, amending or modifying of its recommendation in favor of the
       merger is required for the board to comply with its fiduciary obligations
       to the Allaire stockholders under applicable law; and

     - Allaire has not violated the nonsolicitation provisions in the merger
       agreement.

     Allaire has agreed to provide Macromedia with two days prior notice (or
such lesser notice as the Allaire board receives) of any board meeting at which
Allaire is expected to consider any acquisition proposal to determine whether it
is a superior offer. Even if the board's recommendation is withheld, withdrawn,
amended or modified, Allaire must still call and convene the Allaire
stockholders meeting to consider approval of the merger with Macromedia.

     The merger agreement also does not prevent Allaire or the Allaire board
from taking and disclosing to Allaire's stockholders a position contemplated by
Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regarding
tender or exchange offers, but the Allaire board cannot recommend that the
Allaire stockholders tender their Allaire stock in response to a tender or
exchange offer, unless the board determines in its good faith judgment, after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of national standing,
that the tender or exchange offer constitutes a superior offer and that this

recommendation is required for the board to comply with its fiduciary
obligations to the Allaire stockholders under applicable law.

TERMINATION

     The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the completion
of the merger, whether before or after approval of the merger by the Allaire
stockholders:

     - by the mutual written consent of Macromedia and Allaire;

     - by either Macromedia or Allaire if:

       - the merger has not been completed by September 30, 2001, except that a
         party may not terminate the merger agreement if that party's action or
         failure to act resulted in the merger not being completed by that date;

       - a governmental authority has issued a final, non-appealable order,
         decree or ruling, or taken any other action, that would permanently
         prohibit the merger; or

       - the stockholders of Allaire fail to approve the merger agreement and
         the merger, except that Allaire may not terminate the merger agreement
         if the stockholder approval was not obtained either because of
         Allaire's action or failure to act, which constitutes a material breach
         of the merger agreement, or a breach by one of the Allaire stockholder
         parties to the voting agreements, described below;

     - by Macromedia if:

       - Allaire has breached any representation, warranty, covenant or
         agreement in the merger agreement and the breach would cause Allaire to
         fail to satisfy a closing condition, and the breach is not cured within
         30 days after written notice to Allaire if the breach is curable,
         except that Macromedia cannot terminate the merger agreement if it is
         at that time in material breach; or

       - at any time before the approval of the merger agreement and the merger
         by the Allaire stockholders, a triggering event, as defined below,
         occurs;

     - by Allaire if Macromedia has breached any representation, warranty,
       covenant or agreement in the merger agreement and the breach would cause
       Macromedia to fail to satisfy a closing condition, and the breach is not
       cured within 30 days after written notice to Macromedia if the breach is
       curable, except that Allaire cannot terminate the merger agreement if it
       is at that time in material breach.

     A "triggering event" means any of the following:

     - Allaire's board withdraws, amends or modifies adversely to Macromedia its
       recommendation to the Allaire stockholders to approve and adopt the
       merger agreement or the merger;

     - Allaire fails to include in this prospectus/proxy statement the
       recommendation of Allaire's board in favor of the approval of the merger
       agreement and the merger;

     - if an acquisition proposal, as defined above, is announced and Allaire's
       board does not publicly reaffirm its recommendation in favor of approval
       of the merger agreement and the merger within 10 business days after
       Macromedia requests that it do so;

     - Allaire's board approves or publicly recommends an acquisition proposal;

     - Allaire enters into a letter of intent or any similar agreement accepting
       an acquisition proposal;

     - Allaire materially breaches any of its obligations related to the calling
       and holding of the Allaire stockholders' meeting, its recommendation for
       approval of the merger agreement and the merger, the nonsolicitation of
       acquisition proposals, or the amendment to the Rights Agreement and the
       board's action to prevent certain laws against business combinations from
       applying to the merger agreement, the stock option agreement, the voting
       agreements or any of the transactions contemplated by these documents; or

     - Allaire fails to send a statement to Allaire stockholders within 10
       business days after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer,
       recommending rejection of the tender or exchange offer.

     Termination of the merger agreement will generally terminate the
obligations of the parties to perform their covenants in the merger agreement,
except that the parties must continue to comply with various miscellaneous
provisions, including continuing mutual confidentiality provisions, and, if
applicable, concerning termination fees and the payment of expenses, as
described below.

TERMINATION FEES; PAYMENT OF EXPENSES

     Allaire has agreed to pay Macromedia a termination fee of $10,350,000 if:

     - either Macromedia or Allaire terminates the merger agreement after the
       Allaire stockholders vote against approval of the merger agreement and
       the merger, but only if after the date of the merger agreement and before
       the Allaire stockholder vote, an acquisition proposal has been announced,
       and either Allaire enters into a letter of intent or similar agreement or
       completes a transaction in which majority control of Allaire's voting
       stock or more than 50% of its assets are acquired by a third party within
       12 months after termination of the merger agreement; or

     - before a stockholder vote is taken, a triggering event occurs and
       Macromedia terminates the merger agreement.

     Other than with regard to the termination fee, Macromedia and Allaire have
generally agreed that each party will bear its own costs and expenses whether or
not the merger is completed, except that:

     - if the merger agreement is permissibly terminated by Allaire for
       Macromedia's breach of any representation, warranty, obligation or
       agreement of Macromedia in the merger agreement, then Macromedia will pay
       Allaire's fees and expenses, including its fees of attorneys, accountant
       and financial advisors, incurred in connection with the merger agreement
       and the transactions contemplated by it, up to $1,000,000;

     - if the merger agreement is permissibly terminated by Macromedia in
       connection with Allaire's breach of any representation, warranty,
       obligation or agreement of Allaire in the merger agreement, then Allaire
       will pay Macromedia's fees and expenses, including its fees of attorneys,
       accountant and financial advisors, incurred in connection with the merger
       agreement and the transactions contemplated by it, up to $1,000,000;

     - if the merger agreement is permissibly terminated by Macromedia after a
       triggering event or by Macromedia or Allaire after the Allaire
       stockholders vote against approval of the merger agreement and the
       merger, Allaire will pay Macromedia's fees and expenses, including its
       fees of attorneys, accountants and financial advisors, incurred in
       connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by
       it, up to $1,000,000. If Macromedia was paid the $10,350,000 termination
       fee described above, the fees of its investment banker in connection with
       the merger shall not be included in the calculation of fees and expenses
       to be paid by Allaire; and

     - if litigation arises in connection with the merger agreement or the
       merger, then the prevailing party in that litigation may also recover its
       attorneys fees and costs of suit.

CONDUCT OF BUSINESS OF ALLAIRE

     In the merger agreement, Allaire agreed to conduct its business in the
ordinary course before the completion of the merger and not to take various
actions that could affect its business without the prior consent of Macromedia.
For instance, until the termination of the merger agreement or completion of the
merger, Allaire will not, except as previously disclosed to Macromedia:

     - waive any stock repurchase rights, accelerate, amend or change the
       vesting of options or repurchase rights of restricted stock, or reprice
       options granted to any employee, consultant or director, or pay cash in
       exchange for any options or take these actions with regard to warrants or
       other rights to acquire Allaire stock;

     - grant any severance or termination pay to any officer or employee, except
       under existing agreements or policies, or adopt any new severance plan;

     - purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of Allaire capital stock

       agreement;

     - issue, deliver, sell, authorize, pledge or encumber any shares of Allaire
       capital stock or securities convertible into, or subscriptions, rights,
       warrants or options to acquire any shares of its capital stock, or enter
       into other agreements obligating it to issue these types of securities,
       except for:

      - those issuable under existing options or warrant agreements or Allaire's
        employee stock purchase plan, and

      - options to acquire up to 1,000,000 shares of Allaire common stock
        granted to newly hired or newly promoted employees, and if the merger
        does not close by May 16, 2001, then this option limit will increase by
        150,000 shares for each month thereafter that the merger has not closed;

     - amend the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Allaire or any of its
       subsidiaries;

       licenses of Allaire intellectual property in the ordinary course of
       business consistent with past practices;

     - borrow any money or guarantee any indebtedness of another person or issue
       or sell any debt securities, options, warrants, calls or other rights to
       acquire debt securities of Allaire, enter into any "keep well" or other

       in the merger in exchange for Allaire common stock.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

     Allaire and Macromedia have agreed to work together in good faith to agree
upon mutually acceptable compensation arrangements for those Allaire employees
who will be offered employment with Macromedia in connection with the merger. In
this regard, to the extent that Macromedia's benefit plans permit it to do so,
Macromedia will allow these employees to participate in Macromedia's employee
benefits plans and will give each of these employees full credit for his or her
service with Allaire or one of its subsidiaries in determining eligibility,
vesting, benefit accrual and benefit levels under Macromedia's benefit plans.
Allaire has agreed that it will terminate its and its subsidiaries' 401(k)
retirement plans effective immediately before the termination of the merger.

INDEMNIFICATION OF ALLAIRE DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

     Macromedia has agreed to cause the corporation surviving the merger to
honor all of Allaire's obligations to indemnify any person who served as a
director or officer of Allaire for liabilities arising as a result of this
service. In addition, the surviving corporation's certificate of incorporation
will contain provisions releasing these persons from liability arising as a
result of service as directors and officers of Allaire which are at least as
favorable as those in Allaire's certificate of incorporation and bylaws.
Finally, for five years after the completion of the merger, Macromedia will
cause the corporation surviving the merger to maintain directors and officers
liability insurance for the former directors and officers of Allaire

on terms comparable to those in effect when the merger agreement was signed,
except that Macromedia and the surviving corporation will not be required to
spend more than 150% of the annual premium paid by Allaire for this coverage or
to provide coverage greater than that available for 150% of the current annual
premium paid by Allaire.

AMENDMENT OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     Macromedia and Allaire may amend the merger agreement by signing a written
agreement to do so, provided that they comply with applicable state law with
respect to amending the agreement. Macromedia and Allaire may each extend the
other's time to perform any obligation under the merger agreement, waive
inaccuracies in the other's representations and warranties and waive compliance
by the other with any of the agreements or conditions in the merger agreement.

                               RELATED AGREEMENTS

     This section of the prospectus/proxy statement describes agreements related
to the merger agreement, including the stock option agreement and the Allaire
stockholders' voting agreements. The following is not a complete statement of
all the provisions of these agreements. Detailed terms and conditions are
contained in these agreements. A copy of the stock option agreement is attached
to this document as Annex B and is incorporated by reference. A copy of the form
of voting agreement is attached to this document as Annex C and is also
incorporated by reference. For a complete presentation of the stock option
agreement or the voting agreements, please read the relevant agreement.

THE STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT

     The stock option agreement grants Macromedia the right to buy up to a
number of shares of Allaire common stock equal to 19.9% of the issued and
outstanding shares of Allaire common stock as of the date, if any, after which
the option is exercisable and on which Macromedia delivers an exercise notice to
Allaire, at an exercise price of $5.75 per share. Based on the number of shares
of Allaire common stock outstanding on January 30, 2001, the option would be
exercisable for approximately 5,507,549 shares of Allaire common stock.
Macromedia required Allaire to grant this stock option as a prerequisite to
entering into the merger agreement.

     The option is intended to increase the likelihood that the merger will be
completed. Certain aspects of the stock option agreement may have the effect of
discouraging persons who might be interested in acquiring all or a significant
interest in Allaire or its assets before completion of the merger. The option is
not currently exercisable.

     Until the option's termination, as described below, Macromedia may exercise
the option, in whole or part, and from time to time after any of the following:

     - a triggering event, as described above on page 54, occurs;

     - the board amends the Rights Agreement or takes any other action with
       regard to corporate laws impeding business combinations in connection
       with any acquisition proposal, as described above on page 54;

     - the public announcement of the acquisition by any person or group of more
       than 15% of the total outstanding voting securities of Allaire or any of
       its subsidiaries;

     - the public announcement of any tender offer or exchange offer that, if
       consummated, would result in any person or group owning 15% or more of
       the total outstanding voting securities of Allaire or any of its
       subsidiaries;

     - the public announcement of any proposal by a person reasonably able to
       consummate the announced transaction regarding a merger or other business
       combination after which, the Allaire stockholders immediately before the
       merger or business combination will own less than 85% of the surviving
       entity's equity interests;

     - the public announcement of any proposal by a person reasonably able to
       consummate the announced transaction regarding a sale, lease, exchange,
       transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of business),
       acquisition or disposition of any material assets of Allaire; or

     - a solicitation of Allaire's stockholders is commenced seeking to alter
       the composition of Allaire's board.

Macromedia is not required to terminate the merger agreement before exercising
the option.

     The option will terminate and will not be exercisable upon the earliest of
any of the following to occur:

     - completion of the merger;

     - termination of the merger agreement by mutual consent between Allaire and
       Macromedia;

     - permissible termination of the merger agreement by Allaire for breach of
       any Macromedia representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, if there
       has been no triggering event before that termination;

     - permissible termination of the merger agreement before the option becomes
       exercisable because:

       - the merger is not completed before September 30, 2001;

       - a governmental authority issued a final, non-appealable order, decree
         or ruling, or took any other action, that would permanently prohibit
         the merger;

       - the stockholders of Allaire fail to approve the merger agreement and
         the merger; or

     - under any other circumstances, 12 months after termination of the merger
       agreement.

     The amount of profit that Macromedia may realize under the option is
subject to a profit cap. This "profit cap" is $13,800,000, plus the exercise
price of the option multiplied by the number of shares of Allaire common stock
purchased by Macromedia pursuant to the option. If Allaire is required to pay a
termination fee upon termination of the merger agreement, as described above,
that payment will count toward the profit cap. If the sum of any termination fee
received by Macromedia, plus all proceeds received by Macromedia in connection
with any sales or other dispositions of the option or shares on exercise of the
option, plus any dividends received by Macromedia on its option shares, is
greater than the profit cap, then Macromedia must promptly remit the excess in
cash to Allaire.

     Allaire has certain rights to repurchase the option and the option shares
from Macromedia. If the merger agreement is permissibly terminated by Allaire
for Macromedia's breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
in the merger agreement, the option will terminate and Allaire may buy back any
Allaire common stock Macromedia acquired under the option and still holds at
$5.75 per share, the exercise price under the option. In addition, after the
first anniversary of the termination of the merger agreement until the twentieth
business day following the second anniversary of the termination of the merger
agreement, Allaire may buy all shares of Allaire common stock acquired by
Macromedia under the option which are still owned by Macromedia. If Allaire
exercises this right, it must pay Macromedia in cash an amount determined by
subtracting from the profit cap the sum of any termination fee paid to
Macromedia under the merger agreement, plus all proceeds received by Macromedia
in connection with any sales or other dispositions of the option or shares of
Allaire common stock purchased through the exercise of the option, plus any
dividends received by Macromedia on its option shares.

     In addition, Macromedia may require Allaire to repurchase the option if any
person becomes the owner of 50% of Allaire's voting stock or 50% of the voting
stock of any Allaire subsidiary or if any person enters into an agreement for a
merger or business combination with Allaire or any sale, lease, exchange,
transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of business), acquisition
or disposition of more than 50% of Allaire's assets. If Macromedia exercises
this right, the purchase price for the remainder of the unexercised option will
be calculated by subtracting $5.75, the exercise price of the option, from the
higher of:

     - the highest price paid by the other party for any Allaire shares in the
       transaction triggering the repurchase right, divided by the number of
       Allaire shares then outstanding, or

     - the average of the closing prices of Allaire common stock for the twenty
       trading days ending the trading day before date of the Macromedia
       request, and multiplying the difference by the number of shares of
       Allaire common stock which Macromedia could still acquire at that time
       under the option.

     The stock option agreement grants registration rights to Macromedia with
respect to the shares of Allaire common stock represented by the option. If
Macromedia makes a request for registration of any shares acquired under the
option, Allaire will have the right for 10 business days after receipt of this
request to repurchase from Macromedia all or any part of the shares to be
registered at a per-share price equal to the average of the closing prices of
Allaire common stock for the twenty trading days ending the trading day
immediately before Macromedia's registration request.

ALLAIRE STOCKHOLDERS' VOTING AGREEMENTS

     Macromedia required Allaire stockholders Joseph J. Allaire, Jeremy D.
Allaire, David J. Orfao and David A. Gerth to enter into voting agreements.
These voting agreements require these Allaire stockholders to vote all of the
shares of Allaire common stock beneficially owned by them in favor of the merger
and against any competing acquisition proposal or superior offer, each as
described above, and against any action or agreement that would result in a
breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation of
Allaire under the merger agreement or of the stockholder under his voting
agreement. The voting agreements apply only to the exercise of voting rights
attaching to Allaire shares and shall not limit the discretion of any
stockholder who is a director of Allaire with respect to his duties as a
director of Allaire.

     In addition, each Allaire stockholder who is a party to a voting agreement
agreed not to sell the Allaire stock and options owned, controlled or acquired,
either directly or indirectly, by that person until the termination of the
voting agreement or the record date for the Allaire stockholders' meeting.

     The Allaire stockholders' voting agreements will terminate upon the
earliest to occur of the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with
its terms or the completion of the merger.

     As of the record date, the Allaire stockholders who entered into voting
agreements collectively beneficially owned           shares of Allaire common
stock, which represented approximately        % of the outstanding Allaire
common stock. None of the Allaire stockholders who are parties to the voting
agreements were paid additional consideration in connection with them.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

     In addition to the employment agreements referenced under "The
Merger -- Interests of certain persons in the merger -- Employment arrangements"
on page 38, the following employees of Allaire have entered into employment
agreements with Macromedia: Daniel Smith, Donald Washburn and Edwin Smith. These
agreements will take effect on the day the merger is completed. Each employment
agreement sets forth the employee's position, reporting structure and
compensation with Macromedia. The employment agreements provide for two-year
service periods with Macromedia. In addition to salary and Macromedia's
assumption of options, the employees will be granted Macromedia options pursuant
to Macromedia's 1992 Equity Incentive Plan.

     Each of the employment agreements provides a severance package in the event
the employee's employment is terminated by Macromedia without cause within two
years of the effective date of his employment. The severance payments consist of
either 3-months base salary or 6-months base salary.

     Under the agreements, each employee was required to sign Macromedia's
standard proprietary information and inventions agreement. Further, all
employees entered into non-competition agreements with Macromedia prohibiting
them from directly competing with Macromedia for the longer of 2 years after
closing of the merger and one year after termination of their employment. The
employees also agreed not to solicit employees, consultants, suppliers or
customers of Macromedia for the longer of 2 years after closing of the merger
and one year after termination of their employment.

     Allaire employees Charles Teague, Simeon Simeonov, Adam Berrey and Patrick
Morley are expected to enter agreements similar to those summarized above.

               PROPOSAL TWO -- ADJOURNMENT OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

     If at the special meeting on March   , 2001, the number of shares of
Allaire common stock present or represented and voting in favor of approval of
the merger is insufficient to approve the merger under Delaware law, Allaire
management intends to move to adjourn the special meeting in order to enable the
Allaire board of directors to solicit additional proxies in favor of the merger.
In that event, Allaire will ask its stockholders to vote only upon the
adjournment proposal, and not the proposal regarding the approval and adoption
of the merger agreement and the merger.

     In this proposal, Allaire is asking you to authorize the holder of any
proxy solicited by the Allaire board of directors to vote in favor of adjourning
the special meeting, and any later adjournments, to a date or dates not later
than                     , 2001, in order to enable the Allaire board of
directors to solicit additional proxies in favor of the merger. If the
stockholders approve the adjournment proposal, Allaire could adjourn the special
meeting, and any adjourned session of the special meeting, to a date not later
than                     , 2001 and use the additional time to solicit
additional proxies in favor of the merger, including the solicitation of proxies
from stockholders that have previously voted against the merger. Among other
things, approval of the adjournment proposal could mean that, even if Allaire
had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against the
merger to defeat the merger proposal, Allaire could adjourn the special meeting
without a vote on the merger proposal for up to   days and seek during that
period to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to votes in
favor of the merger.

     Under Allaire's bylaws, the adjournment proposal requires the approval of a
majority of the votes cast on the proposal. Broker non-votes and abstentions
will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the adjournment proposal. No
proxy that is specifically marked "AGAINST" approval of the merger agreement
will be voted in favor of the adjournment proposal, unless it is specifically
marked to "GRANT" the discretionary authority to adjourn the special meeting to
a later date.

     The board of directors believes that if the number of shares of Allaire
common stock present or represented at the special meeting and voting in favor
of the merger is insufficient to approve the merger agreement, it is in the best
interests of the stockholders of Allaire to enable the board, for a limited
period of time, to continue to seek to obtain a sufficient number of additional
votes in favor of the merger to bring about its approval.

     THE ALLAIRE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR THE PROPOSAL TO
AUTHORIZE THE ADJOURNMENT OF THE SPECIAL MEETING TO A DATE OR DATES NOT LATER
THAN                     , 2001.

          UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information
has been prepared to give effect to the merger, to be accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting. This financial information reflects certain
assumptions deemed probable by Macromedia management regarding the merger. The
total estimated purchase price of the merger has been allocated on a preliminary
basis to assets and liabilities based on Macromedia management's best estimates
of their fair value, with the excess of the purchase price over the net tangible
and identifiable intangible assets acquired allocated to goodwill. The
adjustments to the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information
are subject to change pending a final analysis of the total purchase price and
the fair value of the assets and liabilities assumed. The impact of these
changes could be material.

     As a result of the differing fiscal years of Macromedia and Allaire,
results of operations and balance sheet information for different periods have
been combined. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet as of
December 31, 2000 gives effect to the merger as if it had occurred on December
31, 2000, and combines the historical consolidated balance sheet of Macromedia
as of December 31, 2000 and the historical consolidated balance sheet of Allaire
as of September 30, 2000.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of operations for the
year ended March 31, 2000 combines the historical consolidated statement of
operations of Macromedia for the year ended March 31, 2000 with the historical
consolidated statement of operations of Allaire for the year ended December 31,
1999 and excludes in-process research and development as it is a non-recurring
charge. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of operations for
the nine months ended December 31, 2000 combines the historical consolidated
statement of operations of Macromedia for the nine months ended December 31,
2000 with the historical consolidated statement of operations of Allaire for the
nine months ended September 30, 2000 and excludes in-process research and
development as it is a non-recurring charge.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information is based
on estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are preliminary
and have been made solely for purposes of developing this pro forma information.
Unaudited pro forma combined financial information is presented for illustrative
purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the combined financial
position or results of operations of future periods or the results that actually
would have been realized had the entities been a single entity during these
periods. This unaudited pro forma combined financial information is based upon
the respective historical consolidated financial statements of Macromedia and
Allaire and related notes incorporated in this prospectus/proxy statement by
reference and should be read in conjunction with those statements and the
related notes.

NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     On January 16, 2001, Macromedia signed a definitive merger agreement to
acquire all the outstanding common stock, options and warrants of Allaire. The
merger agreement was amended on January 29, 2001. Under the agreement,
Macromedia will issue 0.2 shares of its common stock and $3.00 in cash for each
Allaire share, unless the market value of Macromedia common stock is below
$15.00 per share. If the market value of Macromedia common stock is below $15.00
per share two trading days prior to the Allaire stockholders' meeting, all
consideration will be cash equal to 0.2 multiplied by the market value of the
Macromedia common stock plus $3.00 per share for each Allaire share. Macromedia
will assume Allaire options calculated on an exchange ratio based on an average
of the closing sales price of Macromedia common stock at the merger date.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements were
prepared assuming a market value of Macromedia common stock of $38.63. The fair
value of Macromedia common stock was determined as the average market price from
January 11 to January 18, 2001, which includes two trading days prior and two
trading days subsequent to the public announcement of the merger. The fair value
of the common stock options and warrants was estimated using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: risk-free
interest rate of 5.1%, expected life of 3.5 years, expected dividend rate of 0%,
and volatility of 73%.

     The merger will be accounted for using purchase accounting and accordingly
the purchase price will be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets
acquired and the liabilities assumed on the basis of their respective fair
values on the acquisition date. The assumed total purchase price for Allaire is
an initial estimate of the purchase price and is subject to change.
Additionally, the purchase price allocation is based upon a preliminary
valuation which could change when finalized upon closing of the acquisition,
based upon the facts and circumstances at that time. A change in the purchase
price or the allocation of the purchase price would affect the value assigned to
the tangible and intangible assets and therefore could have a material effect on
actual future results of Macromedia.

     The assumed total purchase price of approximately $363.7 million consists
of approximately 5,521,000 shares of Macromedia common stock with an estimated
fair value of $213.2 million, $82.8 million in cash, 3,242,000 shares of
Macromedia common stock issuable under outstanding vested and unvested stock
options and warrants with an estimated fair value of $62.3 million, and
estimated direct transaction costs of approximately $5.3 million. The common
shares to be issued in the transaction are calculated as Allaire common stock
outstanding of 27,605,000 as of January 12, 2001, multiplied by the exchange
ratio as stated in the merger agreement of 0.2 shares. The total options and
warrants to be assumed in the transaction are calculated as Allaire outstanding
warrants and options of 11,679,000 as of January 12, 2001, multiplied by a
calculated option exchange ratio of 0.2776, using Macromedia's assumed market
value. The total purchase price is expected to be allocated to tangible assets
and liabilities, identifiable intangible assets, goodwill, deferred compensation
and in-process research and development. Intangible assets, including goodwill,
will be amortized over three to five years. In addition, it is expected that
following the merger, the combined company will incur additional restructuring
costs, which cannot currently be estimated.

NOTE 2. UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED BALANCE SHEET

     The pro forma combined condensed balance sheet gives effect to the merger
as if it occurred on December 31, 2000 with respect to the balance sheet of
Macromedia, and on September 30, 2000 with respect to the balance sheet of
Allaire. Certain Allaire amounts have been reclassified to conform to
Macromedia's method of presentation. The following pro forma adjustments have
been made to the historical financial statements of Macromedia and Allaire based
upon assumptions made by Macromedia's management for the purpose of preparing
the unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet (in thousands):

     (a) Certain adjustments were made to Allaire's historical net assets as of
         September 30, 2000 to adjust the net assets to fair value. The table
         and notes below describe those accounts adjusted to reflect their fair
         value.

     (b) To reflect the excess of acquisition cost over the estimated fair value
         of the net assets acquired. Net assets acquired are summarized as
         follows:

NET ASSETS ACQUIRED
Fair value of net assets of Allaire.........................  $121,906
Intangible assets:
  Developed technology......................................    40,500

          Total net assets acquired.........................  $363,680
                                                              ========

        The pro forma adjustment for goodwill and other intangibles on the
        unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet is comprised of the
        developed technology, assembled workforce, tradename and goodwill
        amounts above.

        To determine the value of the developed technology, the expected future
        cash flows attributable to all existing technology were discounted,
        including application servers, design tools, and e-business application
        products. The net present value analysis took into account risks related
        to the characteristics and applications of the technology, existing and
        future markets, and assessments of the life cycle stage of the
        technology.

        The value of the purchased in-process research and development was
        determined by estimating the projected net cash flows related to the
        technology, including costs to complete the development of the
        technology and the future revenues to be earned upon commercialization
        of the application servers. These cash flows were discounted back to
        their net present value.

        The value of the assembled work force was derived by estimating the
        costs to replace the existing employees, including recruiting, hiring,
        training, and incentive costs for each category of employee.

        The value of the tradename was determined by considering the assumption
        that in lieu of a tradename, the company would be willing to pay a
        royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of such tradename.

        Deferred compensation was allocated for the intrinsic value related to
        unvested stock options assumed by Macromedia.

        Goodwill was determined based on the residual difference between the
        amount paid and the values assigned to identified tangible and
        intangible assets.

     (c)  To record cash issued to Allaire upon the merger.

     (d)  Accounts receivable, net is comprised of:

     The following table provides the closing prices per share of Macromedia
common stock and Allaire common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market
on January 12, 2001, the last full trading day preceding public announcement
that Macromedia and Allaire had entered into the merger agreement and February
            , 2001, the last full trading day for which closing prices were
available at the time of the printing of this prospectus/proxy statement.

     This table also provides the equivalent price per share of Allaire common
stock on those dates. The equivalent price per share is equal to the closing
price of a share of Macromedia common stock on that date multiplied by 0.2, the
number of shares of Macromedia common stock to be issued in exchange for each
share of Allaire common stock, plus $3.00.

     Macromedia and Allaire believe that Allaire common stock presently trades
on the basis of the value of the Macromedia common stock, discounted primarily
for the uncertainties associated with the merger. Apart from the publicly
disclosed information concerning Macromedia that is included and incorporated by
reference in this prospectus/proxy statement, Macromedia cannot state with
certainty what factors account for changes in the market price of the Macromedia
common stock.

     We urge you to obtain current market quotations for Macromedia common stock
and Allaire common stock. We cannot predict the market prices for either Allaire
common stock or Macromedia common stock at any time before completion of the
merger or the market price for Macromedia common stock after the completion of
the merger. Because the exchange ratio is fixed, the exchange ratio will not be
adjusted to compensate Allaire stockholders for decreases in the market price of
Macromedia common stock that could occur before the merger becomes effective. If
the market price of Macromedia common stock decreases or increases before the
consummation of the merger, the value of the Macromedia common stock to be
received in the merger in exchange for Allaire common stock would
correspondingly decrease or increase.

     Macromedia has never paid cash dividends on its shares of capital stock. On
December 11, 2000, the board of directors of Allaire declared a dividend on each
outstanding share of Allaire common stock of one right to purchase from Allaire
one one-thousandth of a share of Series A participating cumulative preferred
stock at a price of $55.00. Such rights are not exercisable until distribution
and will expire on December 8, 2010, unless earlier redeemed by Allaire. Under
the merger agreement, each of Macromedia and Allaire has agreed not to pay cash
dividends pending the consummation of the merger, without the written consent of
the other. If the merger is not consummated, the Allaire board presently intends
that it would continue its policy of retaining all earnings to finance the
expansion of its business. The Macromedia board presently intends to retain all
earnings for use in its business and has no present intention to pay cash
dividends before or after the merger.

                       COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF
                          MACROMEDIA COMMON STOCK AND
                              ALLAIRE COMMON STOCK

     This section of the prospectus/proxy statement describes the differences
between Macromedia common stock and Allaire common stock. While we believe that
the description covers the material differences between the two, this summary
may not contain all of the information that is important to you, including the
certificates of incorporation and bylaws of each company. You should read this
entire document and the other documents we refer to carefully for a more
complete understanding of the differences between Macromedia common stock and
Allaire common stock. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference
into this prospectus/proxy statement without charge by following the
instructions in the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information" on
page 2.

     After the merger, the holders of Allaire common stock will become
stockholders of Macromedia, unless they receive solely cash in exchange for
their shares of Allaire common stock. Because Macromedia and Allaire are both
Delaware corporations, the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, will
continue to govern the rights of the stockholders. The Allaire certificate of
incorporation and the Allaire bylaws currently govern the rights of the
stockholders of Allaire. As stockholders of Macromedia after the merger, the
Macromedia certificate of incorporation and the Macromedia bylaws will instead
govern their rights following the merger. The following paragraphs summarize the
material differences between the rights of Macromedia stockholders and Allaire
stockholders under the certificates of incorporation and bylaws of Macromedia
and Allaire, as applicable.

SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

     The Allaire bylaws provide that special meetings of the stockholders may be
called by the chairman of the board or the president, and shall be called by the
president or secretary at the request in writing of a majority of the directors.

     The Macromedia bylaws provide that special meetings of the stockholders may
be called by the president, and shall be called by the president or secretary at
the request in writing of a majority of the directors, or at the request in
writing of stockholders owning at least ten percent of the entire capital stock
of Macromedia issued and outstanding and entitled to vote.

ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT IN LIEU OF A STOCKHOLDER'S MEETING

     Allaire stockholders do not have the right to take action by written
consent.

     Macromedia stockholders have the right to take action by written consent of
the holders of outstanding shares of Macromedia so long as the action is signed
by holders having the minimum number of shares that would be necessary to
approve the action if the action were taken at a meeting at which all
outstanding shares of common stock were present and voting.

RECORD DATE FOR DETERMINING STOCKHOLDERS

     The Allaire bylaws and the Macromedia bylaws both provide that the board of
directors may fix a record date that shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10
days before the date of the stockholder meeting nor more than 60 days before any
other action to which the record date relates.

     The Allaire bylaws provide that if the board of directors does not fix a
record date in the manner described above, then:

     - the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to
       vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on
       the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is
       waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on
       which the meeting is held;

     - the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall
       be at the close of business on the same day on which the board of
       directors adopts the related resolution.

NOTICE OF BOARD NOMINATION AND OTHER STOCKHOLDER BUSINESS -- ANNUAL OR SPECIAL
MEETINGS

     The Allaire bylaws require that nominations of persons for election to the
board of directors and the proposal of business to be considered at an annual
meeting or special meeting of stockholders must generally be made by the board
of directors. If made by a stockholder, the nomination or proposal must be made
by advance written notice given to Allaire not less than 60 nor more than 90
days before the date of the annual meeting of stockholders. However, if the
annual meeting is to be held earlier than the second Tuesday in May, and less
than 70 days notice is given, or, in the case of a special meeting, then the
notice must be given by the stockholder by the 10th day following the earlier of
the mailing of the notice of the annual meeting or the first public announcement
of the meeting. In addition, certain other information regarding the business
proposed for discussion or the attributes of the person the stockholder proposes
to nominate for election or reelection must be included in the stockholder
notice to Allaire.

     The Macromedia bylaws do not contain a similar provision.

NUMBER OF DIRECTORS

     The Allaire bylaws provide that the number of directors shall be determined
by resolution of the board, but in no event shall be less than three.

     The Macromedia bylaws provide that the number of directors shall be
determined by resolution of the board or by the stockholders at the annual
meeting of the stockholders.

NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETINGS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The Allaire bylaws provide that the chairman of the board, the president or
one-third or more of the directors then in office may call a special meeting of
the board of directors. The bylaws require that written notice of the time and
place of these meetings be given to each director at least forty-eight hours
before the meeting if the notice is mailed, or at least 24 hours before the
meeting if notice is given by person, telegram, telecopy or telephone, unless
this notice requirement is waived in writing by that director.

     The Macromedia bylaws provide that the president, or the president and
secretary upon the written request of two directors, may call a special meeting
of the board of directors on two days' notice if the notice is given by mail, or
forty-eight hours' notice if the notice is given in person or by telegram.

INDEMNIFICATION

     The Allaire certificate of incorporation provides that Allaire shall
indemnify its directors and officers against all expenses, judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement reasonably incurred in connection with any action,
proceeding or suit brought against that person by reason of the fact that he or
she is or was a director or officer of Allaire, or is or was serving at the
request of Allaire as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or similar entity, provided that the person acted in good
faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to,
the best interests of Allaire, and, with respect to a criminal action, provided
that he or she had no reasonable cause to believe that the conduct was unlawful.
Any such expenses shall be paid by Allaire in advance of the final disposition
of the matter, provided that any amounts paid must be refunded if it is
determined that the director or officer was not entitled to indemnification by
Allaire.

     The Macromedia bylaws provide that its directors and officers shall be
indemnified to the full extent authorized by Delaware law against all expenses,
liabilities and losses reasonably incurred by that person in connection with any
action, proceeding or suit brought against that person by reason of the fact
that he or she is or was a director or officer of Macromedia, or is or was
serving at the request of Macromedia as a director or officer of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or similar entity, provided that
the person acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to
be in, or not opposed to,

the best interests of Macromedia, and, with respect to a criminal action,
provided that he or she had no reasonable cause to believe that the conduct was
unlawful. The Macromedia bylaws require Macromedia to pay all expenses incurred
by a director or officer in defending any proceeding within the scope of the
indemnification provisions as these expenses are incurred in advance of its
final disposition.

LIMITATION ON LIABILITY

     The Allaire certificate of incorporation provides that a director shall not
be personally liable to Allaire or its stockholders for monetary damages for
breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent that the
elimination or limitation of liability is not permitted by the DGCL, as the same
exists or may later be amended.

     The Macromedia certificate of incorporation provides that a director shall
not be personally liable to Macromedia or its stockholders for monetary damages
for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability

     - for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to Macromedia and its
       stockholders;

     - for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
       misconduct or knowing violations of law;

     - under section 174 of the DGCL; or

     - for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
       benefit.

INTERESTED DIRECTORS

     The Allaire bylaws require that in order for a transaction between Allaire
and an interested director or officer not to be void or voidable solely for this
reason, there must be full disclosure of material facts as to the interested
director's relationship or interest to the transaction as well as each of the
following:

     - approval by a majority of disinterested directors, even though the
       disinterested directors may be less than a quorum (common or interested
       directors may be counted in determining the quorum at such meeting);

     - approval by a good faith vote of the stockholders entitled to vote on the
       matter; and

     - the transaction must be fair to Allaire as of the time it is authorized,
       approved or ratified by the board of directors, a committee of the board,
       or the stockholders.

     The Macromedia bylaws do not contain a provision regarding interested
directors. Accordingly, transactions between Macromedia and its directors and
officers are governed only by the DGCL.

LIQUIDATION

     In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Allaire,
subject to the preferences of any outstanding preferred stock, the remaining
assets of Allaire available for distribution will be divided equally, on a share
for share basis, among the holders of the common stock of Allaire.

     The Macromedia certificate of incorporation does not contain a similar
provision.

AMENDMENT OF BYLAWS

     The Allaire bylaws provide that the board of directors may adopt new bylaws
or alter, amend or repeal the bylaws by an affirmative vote of a majority of the
directors present at any regular or special meeting of the board of directors at
which a quorum is present. The Allaire bylaws provide that the stockholders may
adopt new bylaws or alter, amend or repeal the bylaws by an affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the shares of the capital stock of Allaire issued
and outstanding and entitled to vote at any regular or special meeting of
stockholders. The Allaire bylaws also provide that, in order to amend, repeal or
adopt any provision inconsistent with the provisions of the bylaws relating to
nominations

of directors, proposals by stockholders and amendments to the bylaws, at any
meeting of stockholders, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least
two-thirds of the shares of capital stock of Allaire issued and outstanding and
entitled to vote shall be required.

     The Macromedia certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that the
board of directors or the stockholders may adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws.

STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

     Allaire has adopted a stockholder rights plan. Under the plan, each share
of Allaire common stock is accompanied by a right to purchase 0.001 shares of
Allaire's series A participating cumulative preferred stock for $55.00. The
rights trade with the Allaire common stock and are not currently exercisable.
The rights become exercisable, and begin to trade separately from the Allaire
common stock, only under specified circumstances, such as an unsolicited
proposal to acquire control of Allaire. The rights are designed to provide
protection from a number of tactics that may be used to gain control of Allaire
without offering a fair price to all stockholders. These tactics include partial
or two-tier tender offers, coercive stock accumulation programs and inadequate
offers.

     Macromedia has not adopted a stockholder rights plan.

                 SECURITY OWNERSHIP BY PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS,
                      MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF ALLAIRE

     The following table provides information regarding the beneficial ownership
of Allaire's common stock as of January 30, 2001 by:

     - each person known by Allaire to be the beneficial owner of more than 5%
       of its common stock;

     - Allaire's chief executive officer and its four other most highly
       compensated executive officers;

     - each director of Allaire; and

     - all executive officers and directors of Allaire as a group.

     Beneficial ownership is determined according to the rules of the Securities
and Exchange Commission. Except as indicated by footnotes and subject to
community property laws, where applicable, the persons named below have sole
voting and investment power with respect to all shares shown as beneficially
owned by them. The right to acquire column reflects beneficial ownership of:

     - Shares subject to options that may be exercised within 60 days after
       January 30, 2001 that Allaire would not have the right to repurchase; and

     - Shares subject to warrants that may be exercised within 60 days after
       January 30, 2001.

The right to acquire column does not include any shares for which Allaire's
right to repurchase will lapse as a result of the closing of the merger. For
more information on the lapse of this right of repurchase, please see "The
Merger -- Interests of certain persons in the merger" on page 38.

     The percentage beneficially owned by each person is based upon 27,676,127
shares of Allaire common stock outstanding as of January 30, 2001. The shares
that a person has the right to acquire are deemed to be outstanding solely for
purposes of calculating that person's percentage ownership.

     Jeremy Allaire, Joseph J. Allaire, David Gerth and David Orfao have entered
into voting agreements with Macromedia in which they agreed to vote all of their
shares of Allaire common stock in favor of the approval and adoption of the
merger agreement and the merger and have executed irrevocable proxies with
respect to their shares in favor of Macromedia.

     Unless otherwise noted below, the address of each person listed in the
table is c/o Allaire Corporation, 275 Grove Street, Newton, Massachusetts 02466.

                         ALLAIRE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

     Under SEC rules, Allaire stockholders may include proposals in Allaire's
proxy materials for its next annual meeting of stockholders or special meeting
in lieu of the annual meeting. In order to include any proposal, however,
Allaire stockholders must comply with those rules, which among other things
require the stockholder to submit the proposal to Allaire in writing. For
Allaire's 2001 annual meeting of stockholders, the deadline for any stockholder
to submit a proposal for inclusion in Allaire's proxy materials was December 17,
2000. Accordingly, Allaire will not include any stockholder proposals in its
proxy materials for its 2001 annual meeting.

     If the stockholders do not approve the merger agreement, Allaire will
publish in its proxy materials for its 2001 annual meeting of stockholders, or
in other SEC filings, the deadline for the submission of proposals for inclusion
in its proxy materials for its 2002 annual meeting of stockholders.

     In addition, in order for any Allaire stockholder to bring any item of
business before a meeting of Allaire stockholders, Allaire's bylaws require the
stockholder to give timely written notice to Allaire in accordance with Section
3.7 of those bylaws. To bring an item of business before Allaire's 2001 annual
meeting of stockholders, a stockholder must deliver the requisite notice of the
item to Allaire no earlier than February 9, 2001 and no later than March 11,
2001.

                                APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, Allaire stockholders may object
to the merger and demand in writing that Allaire pay the fair value of their
shares. Determination of fair value is based on all relevant factors, but
excludes any appreciation or depreciation resulting from the anticipation or
accomplishment of the merger. Stockholders who elect to exercise appraisal
rights must comply with all of the procedures to preserve those rights. A copy
of Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which sets forth the
appraisal rights, is attached as Annex E to this document.

     Section 262 sets forth the procedures a stockholder requesting appraisal
must follow. These procedures are complicated and must be followed completely.
Failure to comply with the procedures may cause your appraisal rights to
terminate. The following information is only a summary of the required
procedures and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of Section 262.
Please review Section 262 for the complete procedures. Neither Macromedia nor
Allaire will give you any notice other than as described in this document and as
required by the Delaware General Corporation Law.

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS. Section 262 requires generally requires the following:

     - WRITTEN DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL. You must deliver a written demand for
       appraisal to Allaire before the vote is taken at the Allaire
       stockholders' meeting. This written demand for appraisal must be separate
       from the proxy. In other words, failure to return the proxy or returning
       the proxy with a notation on it will not alone constitute demand for
       appraisal. Similarly, a vote against the merger will not satisfy your
       obligation to make written demand for appraisal. You should read the
       paragraphs below for more details on making a demand for appraisal.

     - REFRAIN FROM VOTING FOR THE MERGER PROPOSAL. You must not vote in favor
       of the merger agreement or the merger. If you return a properly executed
       proxy or otherwise vote in favor of the merger agreement or the merger,
       your right to appraisal will terminate, even if you previously filed a
       written demand for appraisal. You do not have to vote against the merger
       in order to preserve your appraisal rights.

     - CONTINUOUS OWNERSHIP OF ALLAIRE SHARES. You must continuously hold your
       shares of Allaire stock from the date you make the demand for appraisal
       through the closing of the merger.

REQUIREMENTS FOR WRITTEN DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL

     A written demand for appraisal of Allaire stock is only effective if it is
signed by, or for, the stockholder of record who owns the shares at the time the
demand is made. The demand must be signed as the stockholder's name appears on
its stock certificate(s). If you are a beneficial owner of Allaire stock but not
a stockholder of record, you must have the stockholder of record for your shares
sign a demand for appraisal on your behalf.

     If you own Allaire stock in a fiduciary capacity, such as a trustee,
guardian or custodian, you must disclose the fact that you are signing the
demand for appraisal in that capacity.

     If you own Allaire stock with one or more other persons, such as in a joint
tenancy or tenancy in common, all of the owners must sign, or have signed for
them, the demand for appraisal. An authorized agent, which could include one or
more of the owners, may sign the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of
record; however, the agent must expressly disclose who the stockholder of record
is and that he or she is signing the demand as that stockholder's agent.

     If you are a record owner, such as a broker, who holds Allaire stock as a
nominee for others, you may exercise a right of appraisal with respect to the
shares held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising that right
for other beneficial owners. In such a case, you should specify in the written
demand the number of shares as to which you wish to demand appraisal. If you do
not specify the number of shares, we will assume that your written demand covers
all the shares of Allaire stock that are in your name.

     If you are an Allaire stockholder, you should address the written demand to
Allaire Corporation, 275 Grove Street, Newton, Massachusetts 02466, Attention:
Secretary. It is important that Allaire receive all written demands before the
vote concerning the merger is taken. As explained above, this written demand
should be signed by, or on behalf of, the stockholder of record. The written
demand for appraisal should specify the stockholder's name and mailing address,
the number of shares of stock owned, and that the stockholder is thereby
demanding appraisal of such stockholder's shares.

     WRITTEN NOTICE. Within 10 days after the closing of the merger, Allaire
must give written notice that the merger has become effective to each
stockholder who has fully complied with the conditions of Section 262. Except as
required by law, Allaire will not notify stockholders of any dates by which
appraisal rights must be exercised.

     PETITION WITH THE CHANCERY COURT. Within 120 days after the closing of the
merger, either Allaire or any stockholder who has complied with the conditions
of Section 262 may file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery. This
petition should request that the chancery court determine the value of the
shares of Allaire stock held by all of the stockholders who are entitled to
appraisal rights. If you intend to exercise your rights of appraisal, you should
file a petition in the chancery court. Allaire has no intentions at this time to
file a petition. Because Allaire has no obligation to file a petition, if you do
not file such a petition within 120 days after the closing, you will lose your
rights of appraisal.

     WITHDRAWAL OF DEMAND. If you change your mind and decide you no longer want
an appraisal, you may withdraw your demand for appraisal at any time within 60
days after the closing of the merger. You may also withdraw your demand for
appraisal after 60 days after the closing of the merger, but only with the
written consent of Allaire. If you withdraw your demand for appraisal, you will
receive the merger consideration provided in the merger agreement.

     REQUEST FOR APPRAISAL RIGHTS STATEMENT. If you have complied with the
conditions of Section 262, you will be entitled to receive a statement from
Allaire setting forth the number of shares for which appraisal rights have been
exercised and the number of stockholders who own those shares. In order to
receive this statement, you must send a written request to Allaire within 120
days after the closing of the merger. After the merger, Allaire will have 10
days after receiving a request to mail the statement to the stockholder.

     CHANCERY COURT PROCEDURES. If you properly file a petition for appraisal in
the chancery court and deliver a copy to Allaire, Allaire will then have 20 days
to provide the chancery court with a list of the names and addresses of all
stockholders who have demanded appraisal and have not reached an agreement with
Allaire as to the value of their shares. The chancery court will then send
notice to all of the stockholders who have demanded appraisal. If the chancery
court decides it is appropriate, it has the power to conduct a hearing to
determine whether the stockholders have fully complied with Section 262 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law and whether they are entitled to appraisal
under that section. The chancery court may also require you to submit your stock
certificates to the Registry in Chancery so that it can note on the certificates
that an appraisal proceeding is pending. If you do not follow the chancery
court's directions, you may be dismissed from the proceeding.

     APPRAISAL OF CHANCERY SHARES. After the chancery court determines which
stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights, the chancery court will appraise
the shares of stock. To determine the fair value of the shares, the chancery
court will consider all relevant factors except for any appreciation or
depreciation resulting from the anticipation or accomplishment of the merger.
After the chancery court determines the fair value of the shares, it will direct
Allaire to pay that value to the stockholders who are entitled to appraisal. The
chancery court can also direct Allaire to pay interest, simple or compound, on
that value if the chancery court determines that interest is appropriate. In
order to receive the fair value for your shares, you must surrender your stock
certificates to Allaire.

     The chancery court could determine that the fair value of shares of Allaire
stock is more than, the same as, or less than the merger consideration. In other
words, if you demand appraisal rights, you could receive less consideration than
you would under the merger agreement.

     COSTS AND EXPENSES OF APPRAISAL PROCEEDING. The costs and expenses of the
appraisal proceeding may be assessed against Allaire and the stockholders
participating in the appraisal proceeding, as the chancery court deems equitable
under the circumstances. You can request that the chancery court determine the
amount of interest, if any, that Allaire should pay on the value of stock owned
by stockholders entitled to the payment of interest. You may also request that
the chancery court allocate the expenses of the appraisal action incurred by any
stockholder pro rata against the value of all of the shares entitled to
appraisal.

     LOSS OF STOCKHOLDER'S RIGHTS. If you demand appraisal, after the closing of
the merger you will not be entitled to:

     - vote your shares of stock, for any purpose, for which you have demanded
       appraisal;

     - receive payment of dividends or any other distribution with respect to
       your shares, except for dividends or distributions, if any, that are
       payable to holders of record as of a record date before the effective
       time of the merger; or

     - receive the payment of the consideration provided for in the merger
       agreement.

     However, you can regain these rights if no petition for an appraisal is
filed within 120 days after the closing of the merger, or if you deliver to
Allaire a written withdrawal of your demand for an appraisal and your acceptance
of the merger, either within 60 days after the closing of the merger or with the
written consent of Allaire. As explained above, these actions will also
terminate your appraisal rights. However, an appraisal proceeding in the
chancery court cannot be dismissed without the chancery court's approval. The
chancery court may condition its approval upon any terms that it deems just.

     IF YOU FAIL TO COMPLY STRICTLY WITH THESE PROCEDURES YOU WILL LOSE YOUR
APPRAISAL RIGHTS. CONSEQUENTLY, IF YOU WISH TO EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS,
WE STRONGLY URGE YOU TO CONSULT A LEGAL ADVISOR BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO EXERCISE
YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

               AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

     This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement") is made and entered
into as of January 16, 2001, and is amended and restated as of January 29, 2001,
among Macromedia, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Alaska Acquisition
Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned first-tier subsidiary of
Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Allaire Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("Company").

                                    RECITALS

     A. The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and Company
have approved this Agreement, and declared advisable the merger of Merger Sub
with Company (the "Merger") in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware ("Delaware Law"). Parent, Merger Sub and Company entered
into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 16, 2001
(the "Original Agreement"), setting forth the terms and conditions of the
Merger.

     B. For United States federal income tax purposes, the Merger is intended to
qualify as a "reorganization" pursuant to the provisions of Section 368 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), except in the event that
a Conversion Event (as defined in Section 1.6) occurs. For accounting purposes,
the Merger is intended to be accounted for as a purchase under United States
generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").

     C. Concurrently with the execution of the Original Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into the Original
Agreement, Company executed and delivered a Stock Option Agreement in favor of
Parent in substantially the form attached thereto as Exhibit A (the "Stock
Option Agreement"). The Board of Directors of Company has approved the Stock
Option Agreement.

     D. Concurrently with the execution of the Original Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into the Original
Agreement, certain stockholders of Company entered into Voting Agreements with
Parent in the form attached thereto as Exhibit B (the "Voting Agreements").

     E. Parent, Merger Sub and Company desire to clarify their agreement
concerning the Merger and have entered into this Agreement to supersede the
provisions of the Original Agreement in all respects, as of January 16, 2001,
the date of execution of the Original Agreement. Notwithstanding this amendment
and restatement of the Original Agreement, for all purposes hereunder, the date
of this Agreement is January 16, 2001, and all provisions hereunder have had,
and shall have, full and continuous effect from January 16, 2001.

     In consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the parties agree as
follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

     1.1  The Merger. Unless the Conversion Event occurs, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of
Delaware Law, at the Effective Time, Company shall be merged with and into
Merger Sub, the separate corporate existence of Company shall cease, and Merger
Sub shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger. If the Conversion
Event occurs, then upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, at the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Company, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation of the Merger. The corporation surviving the Merger shall be
referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation."

     1.2  Effective Time; Closing. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a
certificate of merger, in such appropriate form as determined by the parties,
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the

                                       A-1

relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the "Certificate of Merger") (the time of
such filing (or such later time as may be agreed in writing by Company and
Parent and specified in the Certificate of Merger) being the "Effective Time")
as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date. The closing of the Merger
(the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Fenwick & West LLP, 275
Battery Street, San Francisco, California, at a time and date to be specified by
the parties, which shall be no later than the second business day after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, or at such
other time, date and location as the parties hereto agree in writing (the
"Closing Date").

     1.3  Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware
Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time,
all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities
and duties of Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.

     1.4  Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws.

     (a) The Certificate of Merger shall provide that, at the Effective Time,
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be in
substantially the form of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Merger Sub as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that as of
the Effective Time, Article I of the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation shall read: "The name of the corporation is "Allaire
Corporation."

     (b) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended.

     1.5  Directors and Officers. The initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified. The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, until their
respective successors are duly appointed.

     1.6  Effect on Capital Stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Merger Sub, Company or the holders of any of the following
securities:

          (a) Conversion of Company Common Stock.

          (i) Except as provided in Section 1.6(a)(ii), each share of common
     stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Company ("Company Common Stock")
     issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than
     any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section
     1.6(b) and any "Dissenting Shares" (as defined and to the extent provided
     in Section 1.12(a)), will be canceled and extinguished and automatically
     converted (subject to Section 1.6(e)) into the right to receive (x) 0.20
     (the "Exchange Ratio") of a share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
     share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") and (y) $3.00 in cash (the "Cash
     Consideration"), upon surrender of the certificate representing such share
     of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 1.7. Unless
     otherwise stated or otherwise indicated by the context, all references in
     this Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement to "Company Common Stock"
     shall be deemed to include the associated preferred share purchase rights
     ("Rights") issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated as of December 8,
     2000, between Company and Fleet Bank, N.A., as Rights Agent (the "Rights
     Agreement"). No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued
     by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof, a cash payment shall be made
     pursuant to Section 1.7(e).

          (ii) If the Conversion Event occurs, then upon the Effective Time,
     each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
     to the Effective Time, other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be
     canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(b) and any Dissenting Shares, will be
     canceled and extinguished and automatically converted (subject to Section
     1.6(e)) into the right to receive an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest
     whole cent) equal to the sum of (x) the

                                       A-2

     amount of cash that is the product of (A) the Trigger Price (as defined
     below) multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio (the "Substitute Cash
     Consideration") plus (y) the Cash Consideration, upon surrender of the
     certificate representing such share of Company Common Stock in the manner
     provided in Section 1.7.

          (b) Cancellation of Company-Owned and Parent-Owned Stock. Each share
     of Company Common Stock held by Company or owned by Merger Sub, Parent or
     any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Company or of Parent
     immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished
     without any conversion thereof.

     Time, all options to purchase Company Common Stock then outstanding,
     whether under Company's 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, Company's 1998 Stock
     Incentive Plan or Company's 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (collectively, the
     "Company Option Plans"), pursuant to another Company compensatory plan or
     otherwise (each such option, whether issued pursuant to the Company Option
     Plans or otherwise, a "Company Option"), and each warrant outstanding to
     acquire Company Common Stock (the "Company Warrants") shall be assumed by
     Parent in accordance with Section 5.8 of this Agreement. Rights outstanding
     under Company's 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Company ESPP")
     shall be treated as set forth in Section 5.8 of this Agreement.

          (d) Capital Stock of Merger Sub.

          (i) Except as provided in Section 1.6(d)(ii), each share of common
     stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub ("Merger Sub Common
     Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
     shall continue to be outstanding as one validly issued, fully paid and
     nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share of the
     Surviving Corporation. Following the Effective Time, each certificate
     evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall evidence
     ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

          (ii) If the Conversion Event occurs, then each share of Merger Sub
     Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
     shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
     share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving
     Corporation. Following the Effective Time, each certificate evidencing
     ownership of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall evidence ownership of
     such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

          (e) Adjustments to Merger Consideration. The Exchange Ratio, the Cash
     Consideration and the Substitute Cash Amount, as applicable, shall be
     adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse
     stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
     securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock),
     reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change
     with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring on or
     after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

          (f) As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
     following meanings:

             (i) The "Conversion Event" shall occur if the product of (A) the
        Trigger Price multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio shall be less than
        the amount of the Cash Consideration.

             (ii) The term "Merger Consideration" means the aggregate amount of
        consideration per share of Company Common Stock issuable in the Merger,
        determined as the sum of (A) the Cash Consideration and (B) the fraction
        of a share of Parent Common Stock, determined by application of the
        Exchange Ratio, or the Substitute Cash Consideration, whichever is
        applicable under Section 1.6(a).

             (iii) The "Trigger Price" shall mean the closing sale price of
        Parent Common Stock during regular trading hours on the Nasdaq National
        Market on the day which is two trading days before the date fixed for
        the Company Stockholders' Meeting in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (as
        each such term is defined in Section 2.17).

                                       A-3

     1.7  Exchange of Certificates.

     (a) Exchange Agent. Parent shall select an institution reasonably
acceptable to Company to act as the exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the
Merger.

     (b) Exchange Fund. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance
with this Article I, the Merger Consideration (such shares of Parent Common
Stock or Substitute Cash Consideration and Cash Consideration together with any
cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto, are hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") issuable
pursuant to Section 1.6 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock.

     (c) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of a certificate or certificates ("Certificates") that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock which were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
1.6 and each holder of Dissenting Shares, (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form (that shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall contain such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration and (iii)
instructions for completion of exercise of rights under Delaware Law for
Dissenting Shares. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent for the Merger Consideration together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which their shares of
Company Common Stock were converted at the Effective Time, (including, if shares
of Parent Common Stock are issued to holders of Company Common Stock in the
Merger, payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that such
holders have the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.7(e) and any dividends
or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d)) and the Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding
Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate
purposes, to evidence only the ownership of the Merger Consideration (which, if
Parent Common Stock is issued to holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger,
shall include the full number of shares of such Parent Common Stock together
with the right to receive any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
Section 1.7(d)). No interest will be paid or accrued on any Cash Consideration,
Substitute Cash Consideration or cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock or on any unpaid dividends or distributions payable to holders of
Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of Company, the
Merger Consideration, including any certificate representing the proper number
of shares of Parent Common Stock, may be issued to a transferee if the
Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the
Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid.

     (d) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. In the event that
shares of Parent Common Stock are issued to the holders of Company Common Stock
in the Merger, no dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
date of this Agreement with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered
Certificates with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented
thereby until the holders of record of such Certificates shall surrender such
Certificates. If such shares of Parent Common Stock are issued, subject to
applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificates, the Exchange Agent
shall deliver to the holders of certificates representing whole shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly, the
amount of any cash payable with respect to a fractional share of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(e) and the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends

                                       A-4

or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect to
such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

     (e) Fractional Shares. In the event that Parent Common Stock is issued to
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock in the Merger:

          (i) as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the
     Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (A) the number of full shares
     of Parent Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section
     1.7(b), over (B) the aggregate number of full shares of Parent Common Stock
     to be distributed to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section
     1.7(c) (such excess, the "Excess Shares"). Following the Effective Time,
     the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of Company Common Stock, shall
     sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on the Nasdaq Stock Market
     in the manner set forth in paragraph (ii) of this Section 1.7(e).

          (ii) The sale of the excess shares by the Exchange Agent shall be
     executed on the Nasdaq Stock Market and shall be executed in round lots to
     the extent practicable. The Exchange Agent shall use all commercially
     reasonable efforts to complete the sale of the Excess Shares as promptly
     following the Effective Time as, in the Exchange Agent's reasonable
     judgment, is practicable consistent with obtaining the best execution of
     such sales in light of prevailing market conditions. Until the net proceeds
     of such sales have been distributed to the holders of Company Common Stock,
     the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of
     Company Common Stock. The Exchange Agent will determine the portion of such
     net proceeds to which each holder of Company Common Stock shall be
     entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds
     by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share
     interest to which such holder of Company Common Stock is entitled (after
     taking into account all shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to such
     holder) and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional
     share interests to which all holders of Company Common Stock are entitled.
     As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
     any, to be paid to holders of Company Common Stock with respect to
     fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall promptly pay such
     amounts to such holders of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
     terms of Section 1.7(c).

          (iii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (i) and (ii) of
     this Section 1.7(e), Parent may decide, at its option, exercised prior to
     the Effective Time, in lieu of the issuance and sale of Excess Shares and
     the making of the payments contemplated in such paragraphs, that Parent
     shall pay to the Exchange Agent an amount sufficient for the Exchange Agent
     to pay each holder of Company Common Stock the amount such holder would
     have received pursuant to Section 1.7(e)(ii) assuming that the sales of
     Parent Common Stock were made at a price equal to the average of the
     closing prices of the Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market for
     the five consecutive trading days immediately following the Effective Time
     and, in such case, all references herein to the cash proceeds of the sale
     of the Excess Shares and similar references shall be deemed to mean and
     refer to the payments calculated as set forth in this paragraph (iii). In
     such event, Excess Shares shall not be issued or otherwise transferred to
     the Exchange Agent pursuant to Sections 1.7(b) or (e).

     (f) Required Withholding. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required
to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable Legal Requirement
(as defined in Section 2.2(c)). To the extent such amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as
having been paid to the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been
paid.

     (g) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificates were converted

                                       A-5

pursuant to Section 1.6, including, if applicable, cash for fractional shares,
if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 1.7(e) and any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d); provided, however, that Parent
may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of such
Merger Consideration, cash and other distributions, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

     (h) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.7, neither the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any party
hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock or rights to
other Merger Consideration or of Company Common Stock for any amount properly
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar law.

     (i) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with the
provisions of this Section 1.7 shall thereafter look only to Parent for the
Merger Consideration to which they are entitled including, if applicable, any
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to which
they are entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(d) and, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section
1.7(e), in each case, without any interest thereon.

     1.8  No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All Merger
Consideration issued in accordance with the terms hereof (including any shares
of Parent Common Stock and cash paid in respect thereof pursuant to Section
1.7(d) and (e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If after the Effective Time Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article I.

     1.9  Restricted Stock. If any shares of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject
to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition providing that
such shares ("Company Restricted Stock") may be forfeited or repurchased by
Company upon any termination of the stockholders' employment, directorship or
other relationship with Company (and/or any affiliate of Company) under the
terms of any restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with Company
that does not by its terms provide that such repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition fully lapses upon consummation of the Merger, then
(i) the shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the conversion of such shares
of Company Common Stock in the Merger will continue to be unvested and subject
to the same repurchase options, risks of forfeiture or other conditions
following the Effective Time, and the certificates representing such shares of
Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends noting
such repurchase options, risks of forfeiture or other conditions and (ii) any
cash payable upon the conversion of such shares of Company Restricted Stock in
the Merger will be paid to each holder of such shares upon the vesting or lapse
of the right of repurchase thereof. Company shall take all actions that may be
necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, Parent is entitled
to exercise any such repurchase option or other right set forth in any such
restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement. A listing of the holders
of Company Restricted Stock, together with the number of shares and the vesting
schedule of Company Restricted Stock held by each, is set forth in Part 1.9 of
the Company Disclosure Letter.

     1.10  Tax and Accounting Consequences.

     (a) Unless the Conversion Event occurs, it is intended by the parties
hereto that the Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368 of the Code. Unless the Conversion Event

                                       A-6

occurs, the parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization"
within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States
Income Tax Regulations.

     (b) It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall be treated
for accounting purposes as a purchase.

     1.11  Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of Company
and Merger Sub will take all such lawful and necessary action. Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to perform all of its obligations relating to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

     1.12  Dissenters' Rights.

     (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary other
than Section 1.12(b), any shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who
has demanded and perfected appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with
Section 262 of Delaware Law and who, as of the Effective Time, has not
effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal or dissenters' rights ("Dissenting
Shares"), shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6, but instead shall be converted into the
right to receive only such consideration as may be determined to be due with
respect to such Dissenting Shares under Delaware Law. From and after the
Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to exercise
any of the voting rights or other rights of a stockholder of the Surviving
Corporation.

     (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.6(a), if any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock who demands appraisal of such shares under
Delaware Law shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or
otherwise) the right to appraisal, then, as of the later of the Effective Time
and the occurrence of such event, such holder's shares shall no longer be
Dissenting Shares and shall automatically be converted into and represent only
the right to receive Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.6(a) without
interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares
pursuant to Section 1.7.

                                   ARTICLE II

Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement have each been duly executed and
delivered by Company and, assuming the due execution and delivery by Parent and
Merger Sub, constitute the valid and binding obligations of Company, enforceable
against Company in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy and other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors
generally and general principles of equity.

material default) under, or impair Company's (or a subsidiary's) rights or alter
the rights or obligations of any third party under, or give to others any rights
of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of an Encumbrance on any of the material properties or assets of
Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to, any material note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise,
concession, or other instrument or obligation to which Company or any of its
subsidiaries is a party or by which Company or any of its subsidiaries or its or
any of their respective material properties are bound or affected. Part 2.4(b)
of the Company Disclosure Letter list all consents, waivers and approvals under
any of Company's or any of its subsidiaries' agreements, contracts, licenses or
leases required to be obtained in connection with the consummation of the

Parent or the Surviving Corporation as a result of the Merger.

     (c) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with any Governmental Entity or other person, is required
to be obtained or made by Company in connection with the execution and delivery

Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), and the securities or
antitrust laws of any foreign country, and (iv) such other consents,
authorizations, filings, approvals and registrations which if not obtained or
made would not be material to Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation or
have a material adverse effect on the ability of the parties hereto to
consummate the Merger.

to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing) contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to

arbitrator that seeks to restrain or enjoin the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or which could reasonably be expected, either

be material to Company, any of its subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation
following the Merger or have a material adverse effect on the ability of the

established, maintained and administered in material compliance with its terms
and conditions and with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutory or
regulatory laws that are applicable to such International Employee Plan.

the Effective Time,

                                      A-19

a Superior Offer, specifying all of the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Offer and identifying the person or entity making such Superior Offer,
(iii) Parent shall not have, within five business days of Parent's receipt of
the Notice of Superior Offer, made an offer that Company's Board of Directors by
a majority vote determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with a
financial advisor of national standing) to be at least as favorable to Company's
stockholders as such Superior Offer (it being agreed that the Board of Directors
of Company shall convene a meeting to consider any such offer by Parent promptly
following the receipt thereof), (iv) the Board of Directors of Company
reasonably concludes, after consultation with its outside counsel, that, in
light of such Superior Offer, the withholding, withdrawal, amendment or
modification of such recommendation is required in order for the Board of
Directors of

                                      A-30

Company to comply with its fiduciary obligations to Company's stockholders under
applicable law and (v) Company shall not have violated any of the restrictions
set forth in Section 5.4 or this Section 5.2. Company shall provide Parent with
at least two business days prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as provided
to the members of Company's Board of Directors) of any meeting of Company's
Board of Directors at which Company's Board of Directors is reasonably expected
to consider any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 5.4) to determine
whether such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer. Nothing contained in this
Section 5.2(c) shall limit Company's obligation to hold and convene the Company
Stockholders' Meeting (regardless of whether the recommendation of the Board of
Directors of Company shall have been withdrawn, amended or modified).

     For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Offer" shall mean an unsolicited,
bona fide written offer made by a third party to consummate any of the following
transactions: (i) a merger or consolidation involving Company pursuant to which
the stockholders of Company immediately preceding such transaction hold less
than 50% of the equity interest in the surviving or resulting entity of such
transaction or (ii) the acquisition by any person or "group" (as defined under
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder)
(including by way of a tender offer or an exchange offer or a two step
transaction involving a tender offer followed with reasonable promptness by a
cash-out merger involving Company), directly or indirectly, of ownership of 100%
of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of Company, on terms that the
Board of Directors of Company determines, in its reasonable judgment (after
consultation with a financial advisor of national standing) to be more favorable
to the Company stockholders than the terms of the Merger; provided, however,
that any such offer shall not be deemed to be a "Superior Offer" if any
financing required to consummate the transaction contemplated by such offer is
not committed (and Company provides Parent with written evidence of such
commitment) and is not likely in the reasonable judgment of Company's Board of
Directors (after consultation with its financial advisor) to be obtained by such
third party on a timely basis.

     (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Company or its Board
of Directors from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
provided, however, that the Board of Directors of Company shall not recommend
that the stockholders of Company tender their shares in connection with a tender
offer except to the extent that the Board of Directors determines in its good
faith judgment, after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor
of national standing, that the tender offer constitutes a Superior Offer and
that such recommendation is required in order for the Board of Directors of
Company to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under
applicable law.

     5.3  Confidentiality; Access to Information.

     (a) The parties acknowledge that Company and Parent have previously
executed a letter agreement, dated as of January 4, 2001 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), which Confidentiality Agreement will continue in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms.

     (b) Parent, on the one hand, and Company, on the other, will afford the
other party and the other party's accountants, counsel and other representatives
reasonable access to its properties, books, records and personnel during the
period prior to the Effective Time to obtain all information concerning the
business, including the status of product development efforts, properties,
results of operations and personnel, as the other party may reasonably request.
No information or knowledge obtained by a party in any investigation pursuant to
this Section 5.3 will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to
consummate the Merger.

     5.4  No Solicitation.

     (a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or
termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms, Company and its
subsidiaries will not, nor will they authorize or permit any of their respective
officers, directors, affiliates or employees or any investment banker, attorney
or other advisor or representative retained by any of them to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, encourage or induce the making, submission or
announcement of any Acquisition Proposal (as hereinafter defined),

                                      A-31

(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
person any nonpublic information with respect to, or take any other action to
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage in
discussions with any person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, except as
to the existence of these provisions, (iv) except as permitted by Section
5.2(c), approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (v) enter into
any letter of intent or similar document or any contract, agreement or
commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Proposal;
provided, however, that prior to the approval of this Agreement and the Merger
at the Company Stockholders' Meeting, this Section 5.4(a) shall not prohibit
Company from furnishing nonpublic information regarding Company and its
subsidiaries to, or entering into discussions with, any person or group who has
submitted (and not withdrawn) to Company an unsolicited, written, bona fide
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of Company reasonably concludes
(after consultation with a financial advisor of national standing) may
constitute a Superior Offer if (1) neither Company nor any representative of
Company and its subsidiaries shall have violated any of the restrictions set
forth in this Section 5.4, (2) the Board of Directors of Company concludes in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that such action
is required in order for the Board of Directors of Company to comply with its
fiduciary obligations to Company's stockholders under applicable law, (3) prior
to furnishing any such nonpublic information to, or entering into any such
discussions with, such person or group, Company gives Parent written notice of
the identity of such person or group and all of the material terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and of Company's intention to furnish
nonpublic information to, or enter into discussions with, such person or group,
and Company receives from such person or group an executed confidentiality
agreement containing terms at least as restrictive with regard to Company's
confidential information as the Confidentiality Agreement, (4) Company gives
Parent at least two business days advance notice of its intent to furnish such
nonpublic information or enter into such discussions, and (5) contemporaneously
with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such person or group, Company
furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic
information has not been previously furnished by Company to Parent). Company and
its subsidiaries will immediately cease any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood
that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding two sentences
by any officer, director or employee of Company or any of its subsidiaries or
any investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative of Company or
any of its subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.4 by
Company.

     For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any offer
or proposal (other than an offer or proposal by Parent) relating to, or
involving: (A) any acquisition or purchase by any person or "group" (as defined
under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder) of more than a 15% beneficial ownership interest in the total
outstanding voting securities of Company or any of its subsidiaries; (B) any
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person or
"group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder) beneficially owning 15% or more of the total outstanding
voting securities of Company or any of its subsidiaries; (C) any merger,
consolidation, business combination or similar transaction involving Company
pursuant to which the stockholders of Company immediately preceding such
transaction hold less than 85% of the equity interests in the surviving or
resulting entity of such transaction; (D) any sale, lease, exchange, transfer,
license (other than in the ordinary course of business), acquisition, or
disposition of any material assets of Company; or (E) any liquidation or
dissolution of Company.

     (b) In addition to the obligations of Company set forth in paragraph (a) of
this Section 5.4, Company as promptly as practicable shall advise Parent orally
and in writing of an Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic
information or other inquiry which Company reasonably believes could lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity of the person or group making any
such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. Company will keep Parent informed
as promptly as practicable in all material respects of the status and details
(including material amendments or proposed amendments) of any such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry.

                                      A-32

     5.5  Public Disclosure. Parent and Company will consult with each other,
and to the extent practicable, agree, before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statement with respect to the Merger, this Agreement
or an Acquisition Proposal and will not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by
law or any listing agreement with a national securities exchange. The parties
have agreed to the text of the joint press release announcing the execution of
this Agreement.

     5.6  Reasonable Efforts; Notification.

     (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using all commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish the
following: (i) causing the conditions precedent set forth in Article VI to be
satisfied, (ii) obtaining all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers,
consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities and

or proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (iii) obtaining all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iv) defending any suits,
claims, actions, investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity
vacated or reversed and (v) executing and delivering any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out
the purposes of, this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, neither Parent nor any of its affiliates shall be under any
obligation to make proposals, execute or carry out agreements or submit to
orders providing for the sale or other disposition or holding separate (through
the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any assets or categories of assets
of Parent or any of its affiliates or Company or any of its subsidiaries or the
holding separate of the shares of Company Common Stock (or shares of stock of
the Surviving Corporation) or imposing or seeking to impose any limitation on
the ability of Parent or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to conduct their
business or own such assets or to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of
ownership of the shares of Company Common Stock (or shares of stock of the
Surviving Corporation).

     (b) Each of Company and Parent will give prompt notice to the other of (i)
any notice or other communication from any person alleging that the consent of
such person is or may be required in connection with the Merger, (ii) any notice
or other communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Merger, (iii) any litigation relating to, involving or otherwise affecting
Company, Parent or their respective subsidiaries that relates to the
consummation of the Merger. Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any
representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming
untrue or inaccurate, or any failure of Company to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided, however, that no such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement. Parent shall give prompt notice to Company of any
representation or warranty made by it or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement
becoming untrue or inaccurate, or any failure of Parent or Merger Sub to comply
with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, or any material
adverse event involving its business or operations; provided, however, that no
such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement.

     5.7  Third Party Consents. As soon as practicable following the date
hereof, Parent and Company will each use all commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any consents, waivers and approvals under any of its or its subsidiaries'
respective agreements, contracts, licenses or leases required to be obtained in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

                                      A-33

     5.8  Stock Options; Warrants and ESPP.

     (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option, whether or not
then exercisable, will be assumed by Parent. Each Company Option so assumed by
Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same
terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Company Stock Option Plan, if
any, pursuant to which the Company Option was issued and any option agreement
between Company and the optionee with regard to the Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, any repurchase
rights or vesting provisions), except that (i) each Company Stock Option will be
exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number
of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Option
Exchange Ratio (as defined below), rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise price for the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company
Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded up
to the nearest whole cent. Continuous employment with Company or its
subsidiaries shall be credited to the optionee for purposes of determining the
vesting of all assumed Company Options after the Effective Time. For the
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Option Exchange Ratio" means, in the event
that the Conversion Event does not occur, the sum obtained by adding (x) the
Exchange Ratio plus (y) the quotient (rounded to the third decimal place)
obtained by dividing (i) the Cash Consideration by (ii) the average of the
closing sale prices of Parent Common Stock during regular trading hours on the
Nasdaq National Market on five trading days ending on the trading day
immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "Closing Price"); and if the
Conversion Event does occur, the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the sum of
(I) the Substitute Cash Consideration plus (II) the Cash Consideration by (B)
the Closing Price.

     (b) It is intended that Company Options assumed by Parent shall qualify
following the Effective Time as incentive stock options as defined in Section
422 of the Code to the extent Company Options qualified as incentive stock
options immediately prior to the Effective Time and the provisions of this
Section 5.8 shall be applied consistent with such intent.

     (c) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Warrant, whether or not
then exercisable, will be assumed by Parent. Each Company Warrant so assumed by
Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same
terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Company Warrant immediately
prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, any vesting
provisions), except that: if the Conversion Event does not occur, each Company
Warrant will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its
terms) to purchase (i) that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
(rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (A) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Warrant multiplied by (B)
the Exchange Ratio, plus (ii) an amount of cash equal to (C) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Warrant multiplied by (D)
the Cash Consideration (rounded to the nearest whole cent), at a per share of
Parent Common Stock (and pro rata portion of the aggregate cash receivable
pursuant to such assumed Company Warrant) exercise price equal to the aggregate
exercise price of the Company Warrant divided by the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to the assumed Company Warrant following such conversion;
and if the Conversion Event occurs, each Company Warrant will be exercisable (or
will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) on a per former share of
Company Common Stock basis to purchase an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest
whole cent) equal to the sum of (E) the Cash Consideration plus (F) the
Substitute Cash Consideration, at a per former share of Company Common Stock
exercise price equal to the per share of Company Common Stock exercise price of
such Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time.

     (d) If, at the Effective Time, there is an offering in effect under the
Company ESPP, all rights to purchase shares of Company Common Stock shall be
converted into rights to purchase a number of shares of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP.

                                      A-34

     5.9  Form S-8. Parent agrees to file a registration statement on Form S-8
for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to assumed Company
Options and with respect to the Company ESPP promptly, but in no event later
than five business days, following the Effective Time and shall maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement thereafter for so long as any of
such options or other rights remain outstanding.

     5.10  Indemnification.

     (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of Company
pursuant to any indemnification agreement between Company and any person who
served as a director of officer of Company at any time prior to the Effective
Time (the "Indemnified Parties") and any indemnification provisions under
Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws as in effect on the date
hereof. The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
will contain provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are
at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those contained in the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Company as in effect on the date
hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for
a period of five years from the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, unless such
modification is required by law.

     (b) For a period of five years after the Effective Time, Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect Company's existing officers' and
directors' liability insurance policy on terms comparable to those currently in
effect, provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation may substitute
therefor policies of comparable coverage containing terms and conditions that
are not substantively less advantageous to the beneficiaries thereof, and
provided, further, that in no event will Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend in excess of 150% of the annual premium currently paid by
Company for any such coverage (or to provide more than such coverage as is
available for such 150% of such annual premium).

     (c) This Section 5.10 shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is
intended to benefit the Surviving Corporation and each Indemnified Party, shall
be binding on all successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties. Parent hereby
guarantees to each person to whom the Surviving Corporation has obligations
under this Section 5.10 that the Surviving Corporation will fulfill those
obligations and agrees that each of those persons is an intended beneficiary of
that guarantee and has the right to enforce it against Parent, with regard to
himself or herself.

     5.11  Nasdaq Listing. Parent agrees to authorize for listing on the Nasdaq
Stock Market the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable, and those required to
be reserved for issuance, in connection with the Merger, effective upon official
notice of issuance.

     5.12  Rights Agreement; Takeover Statutes. The Board of Directors of
Company shall take all further action (in addition to that referred to in
Section 2.20) necessary (including redeeming the Rights immediately prior to the
Effective Time or amending the Rights Agreement) in order to render the Rights
inapplicable to the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement. If any Takeover Statute is or may
become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Stock Option Agreement, each of Parent and Company and their
respective Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such lawful
actions as are necessary to ensure that such transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement or the Stock
Option Agreement, as applicable, and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute and any regulations promulgated thereunder on such
transactions.

     5.13  Certain Employee Benefits. As soon as practicable after the execution
of this Agreement, Company and Parent shall confer and work together in good
faith to agree upon mutually acceptable employee benefit and compensation
arrangements (and terminate Company Employee Plans immediately prior to the
Effective Time if appropriate). Company shall take all action necessary in
advance of the

                                      A-35

Effective Time to terminate its and its subsidiaries' 401(k) plans effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time. To the extent that Company employees
become eligible to participate in any employee benefit plans or arrangements
maintained by Parent and such plans by their terms so permit, Parent will give
such employees full credit for purposes of eligibility (including service and
waiting period requirements), vesting, benefit accrual, and determination of the
level of benefits under any employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by
Parent, for such employee's service with Company or any of its subsidiaries to
the same extent recognized by either Company or its subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

     5.14  Company Affiliates; Restrictive Legend. Parent will give stop
transfer instructions to its transfer agent with respect to any Parent Common
Stock received pursuant to the Merger by any Company Affiliate, and there will
be placed on the certificates representing such Parent Common Stock, or any
substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:

     THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION TO
     WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED,
     APPLIES AND MAY BE TRANSFERRED ONLY (A) IN CONFORMITY WITH RULE 145(D)
     UNDER SUCH ACT, (B) IN ACCORDANCE WITH A WRITTEN OPINION OF COUNSEL,
     REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE ISSUER, IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE REASONABLY
     ACCEPTABLE TO THE ISSUER THAT THE TRANSFER IS EXEMPT FROM THE REGISTRATION
     AND PROSPECTUS DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
     AMENDED.

     5.15  Letter of Company's Accountants. Company shall use all reasonable
efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent a letter of PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, Company's independent accountants, dated no more than two business days
before the date on which the Registration Statement becomes effective (and
satisfactory in form and substance to Parent), that is customary in scope and
substance for letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection
with registration statements similar to the Registration Statement.

     5.16  Section 16. Provided that Company delivers to Parent the Section 16
Information (as defined below) in a timely fashion, the Board of Directors of
Parent, or a committee of two or more Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such
term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act), shall adopt
resolutions prior to the consummation of the Merger, providing that the receipt
by the Company Insiders (as defined below) of the Parent Common Stock upon
conversion of the Company Common Stock, and of options for Parent Common Stock
upon conversion of the Company Options, in each case pursuant to the
transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in
the Section 16 Information, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to
Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act. Such resolutions shall comply with the
approval conditions of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act for purposes of such
Section 16(b) exemption, including, but not limited to, specifying the name of
the Company Insiders, the number of securities to be acquired or disposed of for
each such person, the material terms of any derivative securities, and that the
approval is intended to make the receipt of such securities exempt pursuant to
Rule 16b-3(d).

     "Section 16 Information" shall mean information regarding the Company
Insiders, the number of shares of Company capital stock held by each such
Company Insider and expected to be exchanged for Parent Common Stock in
connection with the Merger, and the number and description of the Company
Options held by each such Company Insider and expected to be converted into
options for Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger. "Company
Insiders" shall mean those officers and directors of Company who will be subject
to the reporting requirement of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act with respect
to Parent and who are listed in the Section 16 Information.

     5.17  Continuity of Business Enterprise. Unless the Conversion Event
occurs, Parent will continue at least one significant historic business line of
Company, or use at least a significant portion of Company's historic business
assets in a business, in each case within the meaning of Reg. sec. 1.368-1(d).

                                      A-36

     5.18  Notices Regarding Dissenting Shares. Company shall give Parent (i)
prompt notice of any written demand for appraisal of any shares of Company
Common Stock together with the name and address of the stockholder who has taken
such action and the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such
stockholder, of any withdrawals of such demands, and of any other instruments
served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by Company relating to
stockholders' rights of appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
Delaware Law. Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demand for appraisal of
capital stock of Company or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

     Closing Date; provided, however, such Material Adverse Effect qualification
     shall be inapplicable with respect to the representations and warranties
     contained in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 (which representations shall be true and
     correct at the applicable times in all material respects), and (B) for
     those representations and warranties which address matters only as of a
     particular date (which representations shall have been true and correct
     (subject to the qualifications set forth in the preceding clause (A)) as of
     such particular date) (it being understood that, for purposes of
     determining the accuracy of such representations and warranties, any update
     of or modification to the Parent Schedules made or purported to have been
     made after the execution of this Agreement shall be disregarded). Company
     shall have received a certificate with respect to the foregoing signed on
     behalf of Parent by an authorized officer of Parent.

          (b) Agreements and Covenants. Parent and Merger Sub shall have
     performed or complied in all material respects with all agreements and
     covenants required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by
     them on or prior to the Closing Date, and Company shall have received a
     certificate to such effect signed on behalf of Parent by an authorized
     officer of Parent.

          (c) Material Adverse Effect. No Material Adverse Effect with respect
     to Parent shall have occurred since the date of this Agreement and be
     continuing.

          (d) Tax Opinion. Company shall have received an opinion of Foley, Hoag
     & Eliot LLP, dated as of the Closing Date, in form and substance reasonably
     satisfactory to Company, on the basis of the facts, representations and
     assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion, that the Merger will
     constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code
     and that each of Parent and Company will be a party to the reorganization
     within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, provided, however, that
     if the counsel to Company does not render such opinion, this condition
     shall nonetheless be deemed to be satisfied with respect to Company if
     counsel to Parent renders such opinion to Parent. The parties to this
     Agreement agree to make such reasonable representations as requested by
     such counsel for the purpose of rendering such opinions. If the Conversion
     Event occurs, this Section 6.2(d) shall not be a condition to the Merger,
     and shall be of no further force or effect.

     6.3  Additional Conditions to the Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub. The
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate and effect the Merger shall
be subject to the satisfaction at or prior to the Closing Date of each of the
following conditions, any of which may be waived, in writing, exclusively by
Parent:

          (a) Representations and Warranties. Each representation and warranty
     of Company contained in this Agreement (i) shall have been true and correct
     as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) shall be true and correct on and
     as of the Closing Date with the same force and effect as if made on and as
     of the Closing Date except (A) in each case, or in the aggregate, as does
     not constitute a Material Adverse Effect on Company as of the Closing Date;
     provided, however, such Material Adverse Effect qualification shall be
     inapplicable with respect to the representations and warranties contained
     in Sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.18, 2.19 and 2.20 (which representations shall
     be true and correct at the applicable times in all material respects), and
     (B) for those representations and warranties which address matters only as
     of a particular date (which representations shall have been true and
     correct (subject to the qualifications set forth in the preceding clause
     (A)) as of such particular date) (it being understood that, for purposes of
     determining the accuracy of such representations and warranties, any update
     of or modification to the Company Schedules made or purported to have been
     made after the execution of this Agreement shall be disregarded). Parent
     shall have received a certificate with respect to the foregoing signed on
     behalf of Company by the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer
     of Company.

          (b) Agreements and Covenants. Company shall have performed or complied
     in all material respects with all agreements and covenants required by this
     Agreement to be performed or complied with by it at or prior to the Closing
     Date, and Parent shall have received a certificate to such effect signed on
     behalf of Company by the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer
     of Company.

                                      A-38

          (c) Material Adverse Effect. No Material Adverse Effect with respect
     to Company shall have occurred since the date of this Agreement and be
     continuing.

          (d) Tax Opinion. Parent shall have received an opinion of Fenwick &
     West LLP, dated as of the Closing Date, in form and substance reasonably
     satisfactory to it, on the basis of the facts, representations and
     assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion, that the Merger will
     constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
     Code and that each of Parent and Company will be a party to the
     reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, provided,
     however, that if the counsel to Parent does not render such option, this
     condition shall nonetheless be deemed to be satisfied with respect to
     Parent if counsel to Company renders such opinion to Parent. The parties to
     this Agreement agree to make such reasonable representations as requested
     by such counsel for the purpose of rendering such opinions. If the
     Conversion Event occurs, this Section 6.3(d) shall not be a condition to
     the Merger, and shall be of no further force or effect.

          (e) Consents. Parent shall have been furnished with evidence
     reasonably satisfactory to it that Company has obtained the consents,
     approvals and waivers set forth in Part 6.3(e) of the Company Disclosure
     Letter.

          (f) Limit on Dissenters' Rights. As of the Closing Date, the aggregate
     number of Dissenting Shares shall not exceed seven and one-half percent of
     the number of issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                       TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

     7.1  Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after the requisite approvals of the
stockholders of Company:

          (a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by the Boards of
     Directors of Parent and Company;

          (b) by either Company or Parent if the Merger shall not have been
     consummated by September 30, 2001 for any reason; provided, however, that
     the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b) shall not
     be available to any party whose action or failure to act has been a
     principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to occur on or
     before such date and such action or failure to act constitutes a breach of
     this Agreement;

          (c) by either Company or Parent if a Governmental Entity shall have
     issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action, in any case
     having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
     prohibiting the Merger, which order, decree, ruling or other action is
     final and nonappealable;

          (d) by either Company or Parent, if the approval and adoption of this
     Agreement, and the approval of the Merger, by the stockholders of Company
     shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the
     required vote at a meeting of Company stockholders duly convened therefore
     or at any adjournment thereof; provided, however, that the right to
     terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(d) shall not be available
     to Company where the failure to obtain the Company stockholder approval
     shall have been caused by (i) the action or failure to act of Company and
     such action or failure to act constitutes a material breach by Company of
     this Agreement or (ii) a breach of any of the Voting Agreements by any
     party thereto other than Parent;

          (e) by Parent (at any time prior to the adoption and approval of this
     Agreement and the Merger by the required vote of the stockholders of
     Company) if a Triggering Event (as defined below) shall have occurred;

          (f) by Company, upon a breach of any representation, warranty,
     covenant or agreement on the part of Parent set forth in this Agreement, or
     if any representation or warranty of Parent shall have

                                      A-39

     become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in Section
     6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b) would not be satisfied as of the time of such
     breach or as of the time such representation or warranty shall have become
     untrue, provided that if such inaccuracy in Parent's representations and
     warranties or breach by Parent is curable by Parent, then Company may not
     terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(f) for 30 days after
     delivery of written notice from Company to Parent of such breach, provided
     Parent continues to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such
     breach (it being understood that Company may not terminate this Agreement
     pursuant to this paragraph (f) if such breach by Parent is cured during
     such 30-day period, or if Company shall have materially breached this
     Agreement); or

          (g) by Parent, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
     or agreement on the part of Company set forth in this Agreement, or if any
     representation or warranty of Company shall have become untrue, in either
     case such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b)
     would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such
     representation or warranty shall have become untrue, provided that if such
     inaccuracy in Company's representations and warranties or breach by Company
     is curable by Company, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement under
     this Section 7.1(g) for 30 days after delivery of written notice from
     Parent to Company of such breach, provided Company continues to exercise
     commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach (it being understood
     that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph (g)
     if such breach by Company is cured during such 30-day period, or if Parent
     shall have materially breached this Agreement).

     For the purposes of this Agreement, a "Triggering Event" shall be deemed to
have occurred if: (i) the Board of Directors of Company or any committee thereof
shall for any reason have withdrawn or shall have amended or modified in a
manner adverse to Parent its recommendation in favor of the adoption and
approval of the Agreement or the approval of the Merger; (ii) Company shall have
failed to include in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus the recommendation of the
Board of Directors of Company in favor of the adoption and approval of the
Agreement and the approval of the Merger; (iii) the Board of Directors of
Company fails publicly to reaffirm its recommendation in favor of the adoption
and approval of the Agreement and the approval of the Merger within 10 business
days after Parent requests in writing that such recommendation be reaffirmed at
any time following the public announcement of an Acquisition Proposal; (iv) the
Board of Directors of Company or any committee thereof shall have approved or
publicly recommended any Acquisition Proposal; (v) Company shall have entered
into any letter of intent or similar document or any agreement, contract or
commitment accepting any Acquisition Proposal; (vi) Company shall have
materially breached any of the provisions of Sections 5.2, 5.4 or 5.12; or (vii)
a tender or exchange offer relating to securities of Company shall have been
commenced by a person unaffiliated with Parent, and Company shall not have sent
to its securityholders pursuant to Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, within 10 business days after such tender or exchange offer is first
published sent or given, a statement disclosing that Company recommends
rejection of such tender or exchange offer.

     7.2  Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination. Any proper termination
of this Agreement under Section 7.1 will be effective immediately upon the
delivery of written notice of the terminating party to the other parties hereto.
In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1,
this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect, except (i) as set forth
in this Section 7.2, Section 7.3 and Article 8, each of which shall survive the
termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party
from liability for any willful breach of any covenant of this Agreement or for
any intentional or willful act or omission by a party which renders any
representations or warranties of such party untrue. No termination of this
Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive termination of
this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

                                      A-40

     7.3  Fees and Expenses.

     (a) Except as set forth in this Section 7.3, all fees and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by the party incurring such expenses whether or not the Merger is
consummated; provided, however, that Parent and Company shall share equally all
fees and expenses, other than attorneys' and accountants fees and expenses,
incurred in relation to the printing and filing with the SEC of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (including any preliminary materials related thereto) and
the Registration Statement (including financial statements and exhibits) and any
amendments or supplements thereto.

     (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or Company, as
applicable, pursuant to Section 7.1(d) or Section 7.1(e), Company shall
promptly, but in no event later than two days after the date of such
termination, pay Parent a fee equal to $10,350,000 in immediately available
funds (the "Termination Fee"); provided, that in the case of a termination under
Section 7.1(d) prior to which no Triggering Event has occurred, (i) such payment
shall be made only if (A) following the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement, a person has publicly announced an Acquisition
Proposal and (B) within 12 months following the termination of this Agreement a
Company Acquisition (as defined below) is consummated or Company enters into a
letter of intent or other agreement providing for a Company Acquisition and (ii)
such payment shall be made promptly, but in no event later than two days after
the consummation of such Company Acquisition or the entry by Company into such
agreement.

     (c) If this Agreement is terminated by Company under Section 7.1(f) then
Parent shall pay to Company no later than two days after demand by Company
therefor together with a statement from Company's Chief Financial Offer
certifying the amount thereof, Company's fees and expenses (including fees of
attorneys, accountants and financial advisors to Company) incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, up to an aggregate
amount of such fees and expenses not to exceed $1,000,000.

     (d) If this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent under either of Sections
7.1(e) or 7.1(g) or (B) by Company or Parent under Section 7.1(d), then in each
such case, Company shall pay to Parent no later than two days after demand by
Parent therefor together with a statement from Parent's Chief Financial Offer
certifying the amount thereof, Parent's fees and expenses (including fees of
attorneys, accountants and financial advisors to Parent) incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, up to an aggregate
amount of such fees and expenses not to exceed $1,000,000; provided, however,
that in the event that this Agreement is terminated and, pursuant to Section
7.3(b), Parent has received the full amount of the Termination Fee, Parent's
fees and expenses which are payable under this Section 7.3(d) shall not include
the fees of Parent's financial advisor Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc., incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     (e) Each of Parent and Company acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither Parent nor Company
would enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Parent or Company fails to pay
in a timely manner amounts due pursuant to Section 7.3(b), 7.3(c) or 7.3(d),
and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Company makes a claim for such
amounts that results in a judgment against the other for the amounts described
in Section 7.3(b), 7.3(c) or 7.3(d), the judgment debtor shall pay to judgment
creditor its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses as provided in Section 8.7(b)) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amounts described in Section 7.3(b), 7.3(c) and
7.3(d) (at the prime rate of The Chase Manhattan Bank in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made) from such date until the payment of such amount
(together with such accrued interest). Payment of the fees described in this
Section 7.3(b), 7.3(c) and/or 7.3(d) shall not be in lieu of damages incurred in
the event of breach of this Agreement as described in clause (ii) of Section
7.2.

     For the purposes of this Agreement, "Company Acquisition" shall mean any of
the following transactions (other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement); (i) a merger, consolidation,

                                      A-41

business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving Company pursuant to which the stockholders of Company
immediately preceding such transaction hold less than 50% of the aggregate
equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction, (ii)
a sale or other disposition by Company of assets representing in excess of 50%
of the aggregate fair market value of Company's business immediately prior to

a tender offer or an exchange offer or issuance by Company), directly or
indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial ownership
of shares representing in excess of 50% of the voting power of the then
outstanding shares of capital stock of Company.

     7.4  Amendment. Subject to applicable law, this Agreement may be amended by
the parties hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of each of Parent and Company.

     7.5  Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time any party
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto,
(ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such
party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of
such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. Delay in exercising any right under this
Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The words "include,"

fact, circumstance, event or other matter in question, the actual knowledge of
such fact, circumstance, event or other matter of (i) an individual, if used in
reference to an individual, or (ii) any officer or director of such party, if
used in reference to a person that is not an individual. Any such individual
will be deemed to have actual knowledge of a particular fact, circumstance,

individual's possession, including personal files of such individual, (y) such
fact, circumstance, event or other matter is reflected in one or more documents

reasonably be expected to be reviewed by an individual who has the duties and
responsibilities of such individual in the customary performance of such duties
and responsibilities or (z) such knowledge could be obtained from reasonable
inquiry of the persons employed by such party charged with administrative or
operational responsibility for such matters for such party.

     (c) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" when
used in connection with an entity means any change, event, violation,
inaccuracy, circumstance or effect (whether or not such change, event,

representation, warranty or covenant made by an entity in this Agreement) that
is or is reasonably likely to be materially adverse to the business, assets
(including intangible assets), capitalization, financial condition, operations
or results of operations of such entity taken as a whole with its subsidiaries,
except to the extent that any such change, event, violation, inaccuracy,
circumstance or effect directly and primarily results from (i) changes in
general economic conditions or changes affecting the industry generally in which
such entity operates (provided that such changes do not affect such entity in a
disproportionate manner) or (ii) changes in the trading prices for such entity's
capital stock.

the stock or other equity or partnership interests the holders of which are
generally entitled to vote for the election of the Board of Directors or other
governing body of such corporation or other legal entity.

     8.4  Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of
the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart.

     8.5  Original Agreement Superseded; Entire Agreement; Third Party
Beneficiaries. This Agreement amends and restates the Original Agreement, and
supersedes in their entirety the provisions of the Original Agreement. This
Agreement, its Exhibits and the documents and instruments and other agreements
among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the
Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter (a) constitute the
entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, it being understood that
the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the
Closing and shall survive any termination of this Agreement; and (b) are not
intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder,
except as specifically provided in Section 5.10.

     8.6  Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will
continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other
persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the
intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision
that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

     8.7  Other Remedies; Specific Performance; Fees.

     (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It
is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state
having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity.

     (b) If any action, suit or other proceeding (whether at law, in equity or
otherwise) is instituted concerning or arising out of this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereunder, the prevailing party shall recover, in
addition to any other remedy granted to such party therein, all such party's
costs and attorneys fees incurred in connection with the prosecution or defense
of such action, suit or other proceeding.

     8.8  Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof.

                             STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT

     This STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made and entered into as
of January 16, 2001, between Allaire Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("Company"), and Macromedia, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent").

                                    RECITALS

     A. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Company,
Parent and Alaska Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), are entering into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), that provides, among other things, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, for the merger of Merger Sub
and Company (the "Merger"). Capitalized terms used in this Agreement but not
defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger
Agreement.

     B. As a condition to Parent's willingness to enter into the Merger
Agreement, Parent has required that the Company agree, and the Company has
agreed, to grant to Parent an option to acquire shares of Company Common Stock
("Company Shares"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein.

     In consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants and
agreements set forth herein and in the Merger Agreement and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

     1. Grant of Option. Company hereby grants to Parent an irrevocable option
(the "Option"), exercisable following the occurrence of an Exercise Event (as
defined in Section 2(a)), to acquire up to a number of Company Shares equal to
19.9% of the Company Shares issued and outstanding as of the date, if any, upon
which an Exercise Notice (as defined in Section 2(b) below) shall have been
delivered (the "Option Shares"), in the manner set forth below by paying cash at
a price of $5.75 per share (the "Exercise Price"). All references in this
Agreement to Company Shares issued to Parent hereunder shall be deemed to
include any associated Rights.

     2. Exercise of Option; Maximum Proceeds.

     (a) For all purposes of this Agreement, an "Exercise Event" shall mean the
occurrence of any of (i) a Triggering Event (as such term is defined in the
Merger Agreement), (ii) the amendment by Company of the Rights Agreement or the
taking by Company of any corporate action which removes any applicable
restrictions under Section 203 of the Delaware Law or under any other Takeover
Statute, in each case, in connection with any Acquisition Proposal; (iii) (A)
the public announcement of an acquisition or purchase by any person or "group"
(as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder) of more than a 15% beneficial ownership interest in the
total outstanding voting securities of Company or any of its subsidiaries; (B)
the public announcement or commencement of any tender offer or exchange offer
that if consummated would result in any person or "group" beneficially owning
15% or more of the total outstanding voting securities of Company or any of its
subsidiaries; (C) the public announcement of a bona fide proposal or offer by a
person or entity reasonably able to consummate any of the following: a merger,
consolidation, business combination or similar transaction involving Company
pursuant to which the stockholders of Company immediately preceding such
transaction hold less than 85% of the equity interests in the surviving or
resulting entity of such transaction; or a sale, lease, exchange, transfer,
license (other than in the ordinary course of business), acquisition, or
disposition of any material assets of Company; or (iv) the commencement of a
solicitation within the meaning of Rule 14a-1(l) by any person or entity other
than Company or its Board

                                       B-1

of Directors (or any person or entity acting on behalf of Company or its Board
of Directors) seeking to alter the composition of Company's Board of Directors.

     (b) At any time following the occurrence of an Exercise Event, Parent may
deliver to the Company a written notice (an "Exercise Notice") specifying that
it wishes to exercise its rights to acquire Company Shares under the Option and
close a purchase of Option Shares and specifying the total number of Option
Shares it wishes to acquire. Unless such Exercise Notice is withdrawn by Parent,
the closing of a purchase of such Option Shares (a "Closing") shall take place
at the principal offices of Company upon such date (which shall be no earlier
than three business days following the delivery of the Exercise Notice) and at
such time prior to the termination of the Option as may be designated by Parent
in the Exercise Notice.

     (c) The Option shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) the
Effective Time (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), (ii)
termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(a) thereof, (iii)
termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f) thereof if prior
to such termination no Triggering Event shall have occurred; (iv) termination of
the Merger Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b), 7.1(c) or 7.1(d) thereof if
prior to such termination no Exercise Event shall have occurred or (v) 12 months
following the termination of the Merger Agreement under any other circumstances;
provided, however, that if the Option is exercisable but cannot be exercised by
reason of any applicable government order or because the waiting period related
to the issuance of the Option Shares under the HSR Act shall not have expired or
been terminated, or because any other condition to closing has not been
satisfied, then the Option shall not terminate until the tenth business day
after all such impediments to exercise shall have been removed or shall have
become final and not subject to appeal, and provided, further that if,
subsequent to exercise of the Option, but prior to any other termination of the
Merger Agreement, the Merger Agreement is terminated by Company pursuant to
Section 7.1(f) thereof, then (1) the Option, to the extent it has not been
exercised, shall terminate and (2) to the extent the Option has been exercised,
Company may repurchase for cash all Option Shares then held by Parent at a per
Option Share price equal to the Exercise Price.

     (d) If the sum of (i) any Termination Fee received by Parent under Section
7.3(b) of the Merger Agreement plus (ii) the proceeds received by Parent for any
sales or other dispositions of Option Shares (including pursuant to Company's
exercise of its rights to purchase Option Shares under Section 7(a) and Section
10 hereof) or the Option (including pursuant to Parent's exercise of its rights
to surrender the Option pursuant to Section 9 hereof), plus (iii) any dividends
or distributions received by Parent declared on Option Shares is, in the
aggregate, greater than the sum of (x) $13,800,000 plus (y) the product of (1)
the Exercise Price multiplied by (2) the number of Company Shares purchased by
Parent pursuant to the Option (the sum of clauses (x) and (y), the "Profit
Cap"), then all such proceeds received by Parent in excess of the Profit Cap
shall be promptly remitted in cash by Parent to Company.

     3. Conditions to Closing. The obligation of Company to issue Option Shares
to Parent hereunder is subject to the conditions that (a) any waiting period
under the HSR Act applicable to the issuance of the Option Shares hereunder
shall have expired or been terminated; (b) all material consents, approvals,
orders or authorizations of, or registrations, declarations or filings with, any
Governmental Entity, if any, required in connection with the issuance of the
Option Shares hereunder shall have been obtained or made, as the case may be;
and (c) no preliminary or permanent injunction or other order by any court of
competent jurisdiction prohibiting or otherwise restraining such issuance shall
be in effect. It is understood and agreed that at any time during which Parent
shall be entitled to deliver to Company an Exercise Notice, the parties will use
their respective reasonable efforts to satisfy all conditions to Closing, so
that a Closing may take place as promptly as practicable.

     4. Closing. At any Closing, (a) Company shall deliver to Parent a single
certificate in definitive form representing the number of Company Shares
designated by Parent in its Exercise Notice consistent with this Agreement, such
certificate to be registered in the name of Parent and to bear the legend set
forth in Section 10 hereof, against delivery of (b) payment by Parent to the
Company of the aggregate Exercise Price for the Company Shares so designated and
being purchased by delivery of a certified check, bank check or wire transfer of
immediately available funds.

                                       B-2

     5. Representations and Warranties of the Company. Company represents and
warrants to Parent that (a) Company is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has
the corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to carry out
its obligations hereunder; (b) the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Company and consummation by Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Company
and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Company are necessary to
authorize this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby; (c)
this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Company and constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of Company and, assuming this Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by Parent, is enforceable against Company in
accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy
and other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and general
principles of equity; (d) except for any filings, authorizations, approvals or
orders required under the HSR Act and the applicable blue sky laws of any state,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or by the Nasdaq Stock
Market, Company has taken all necessary corporate and other action to authorize
and reserve for issuance and to permit it to issue upon exercise of the Option,
and at all times from the date hereof until the termination of the Option will
have reserved for issuance, a sufficient number of unissued Company Shares for
Parent to exercise the Option in full and will take all necessary corporate or
other action to authorize and reserve for issuance all additional Company Shares
or other securities which may be issuable pursuant to Section 8(a) upon exercise
of the Option, all of which, upon their issuance and delivery in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and payment therefor by Parent, will be validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable; (e) upon delivery of the Company Shares
and any other securities to Parent upon exercise of the Option, Parent will
acquire such Company Shares or other securities free and clear of all
Encumbrances, excluding those imposed by Parent; (f) the execution and delivery
of this Agreement by Company do not, and the performance of this Agreement by
Company will not, (i) violate the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the
Company, (ii) conflict with or violate any order applicable to the Company or
any of its subsidiaries or by which they or any of their material property is
bound or affected or (iii) result in any breach of or constitute a default (or
an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default)
under, or give rise to any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a material Encumbrance on any
material property or assets of Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to,
any material contract or agreement to which Company or any of its subsidiaries
is a party or by which Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their
material property is bound or affected, except to the extent that any such
breach, default, right of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation
or creation of a material Encumbrance would not prevent or materially delay the
performance by Company of Company's obligations under this Agreement; and (g)
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Company does not, and the
performance of this Agreement by Company will not, require any consent,
approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with, or notification to, any
Governmental Entity, except pursuant to the HSR Act and except for any filings
required under the blue sky laws of any state and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder or by the Nasdaq Stock Market.

     6. Representations and Warranties of Parent. Parent represents and warrants
to Company that (i) the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and
the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and this
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer of
Parent and will constitute a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and,
assuming this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent, is
enforceable against Company in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy and other similar laws affecting the
rights of creditors generally and general principles of equity; and (ii) Parent
is acquiring the Option, and, if and when the Parent exercises the Option, it
will be acquiring the Option Shares issuable upon the exercise thereof for its
own account and not with a view to distribution or resale in any manner which
would be in violation of the Securities Act.

                                       B-3

     7. Registration Rights.

        (a) Following the termination of the Merger Agreement, Parent (sometimes
referred to herein as the "Holder") may by written notice (a "Registration
Notice") to Company (sometimes referred to herein as the "Registrant") request
the Registrant to register under the Securities Act all or any part of the
Option Shares acquired by the Holder pursuant to this Agreement (such Option
Shares, together with any other shares of the Company's capital stock issuable
in lieu of or with respect to such Option Shares, the "Registrable Securities")
in order to permit the public sale or other disposition of such shares in
accordance with the intended method of sale or other disposition stated by the
Holder; provided, however, that any such Registration Notice must relate to a
number of shares equal to at least 2% of the outstanding Company Shares and that
any rights to require registration hereunder shall terminate with respect to any
shares of the Company's capital stock that may be sold pursuant to Rule 144(k)
under the Securities Act or at such time as all of the Registrable Securities
may be sold in any three month period pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities
Act. Upon receipt of a Registration Notice, the Registrant will have the option
exercisable by written notice delivered to the Holder within ten business days
after the receipt of the Registration Notice, irrevocably to agree to purchase
all or any part of the Registrable Securities for cash at a price (the "Option
Price") equal to the product of (i) the number of Registrable Securities so
purchased and (ii) the per share average of the closing sale prices of the
Registrant's Common Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market for the twenty trading days
immediately preceding the date of the Registration Notice. Any such purchase of
Registrable Securities by the Registrant hereunder will take place at a closing
to be held at the principal executive offices of the Registrant or its counsel
at any reasonable date and time designated by the Registrant in such notice
within five business days after delivery of such notice. The payment for the
shares to be purchased will be made by delivery at the time of such closing of
the Option Price in immediately available funds.

     (b) If the Registrant receives a Registration Notice and does not elect to
exercise its option to purchase pursuant to Section 7(a), the Registrant shall
use all reasonable best efforts to effect, as promptly as practicable, the
registration under the Securities Act of the unpurchased Registrable Securities
requested to be registered in the Registration Notice; provided, however, that
(i) the Holder shall not be entitled to more than an aggregate of two effective
registration statements hereunder, and provided further, that if the Registrant
withdraws a filed registration statement at the request of the Holder (other
than as the result of a material adverse change in the Registrant's business or
prospects or the Holder's learning of new material information concerning the
Registrant), then such filing shall be deemed to have been an effective
registration for purposes of this clause (i), (ii) the Registrant will not be
required to file any such registration statement or maintain its effectiveness
during any period of time (not to exceed 45 days after a Registration Notice in
the case of clause (A) below or 60 days after a Registration Notice in the case
of clauses (B) and (C) below) when (A) the Registrant is in possession of
material non-public information which it reasonably believes would be
detrimental to be disclosed at such time and such information would have to be
disclosed if a registration statement were filed or effective at that time; (B)
the Registrant is required under the Securities Act to include audited financial
statements for any period in such registration statement and such financial
statements are not yet available for inclusion in such registration statement;
or (C) the Registrant determines, in its good faith, reasonable judgment, that
such registration would materially interfere with any financing, acquisition or
other material transaction involving the Registrant and (iii) the Registrant
will not be required to maintain the effectiveness of any such registration
statement for an aggregate period greater than 180 days. If consummation of the
sale of any Registrable Securities pursuant to a registration hereunder does not
occur within 180 days after the filing with the SEC of the initial registration
statement therefor, the provisions of this Section 7 shall again be applicable
to any proposed registration. The Registrant shall use all reasonable best
efforts to cause any Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this Section
7 to be qualified for sale under the securities or blue sky laws of such
jurisdictions as the Holder may reasonably request and shall continue such
registration or qualification in effect in such jurisdictions until the Holder
has sold or otherwise disposed of all of the securities subject to the
registration statement; provided, however, that the Registrant shall not be
required to qualify to do business in, or consent to general service of process
in, any jurisdiction by reason of this provision.
                                       B-4

     (c) The registration rights set forth in this Section 7 are subject to the
condition that the Holder shall provide the Registrant with such information
with respect to the Holder's Registrable Securities, the plan for distribution
thereof, and such other information with respect to the Holder as, in the
reasonable judgment of counsel for the Registrant, is necessary to enable the
Registrant to include in a registration statement all facts required to be
disclosed with respect to a registration thereunder, including the identity of
the Holder and the Holder's plan of distribution.

     (d) A registration effected under this Section 7 shall be effected at the
Registrant's expense, except for underwriting discounts and commissions and the
fees and expenses of counsel to the Holder, and the Registrant shall use all
reasonable best efforts to: (i) provide such documentation (including
certificates, opinions of counsel and "comfort" letters from auditors) as are
customary in connection with underwritten public offerings and as an underwriter
may reasonably require, (ii) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and
supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection
with such registration statements as may be necessary to comply with the
provisions of the Securities Act and (iii) furnish to the Holder and to any
underwriter of such securities such number of copies of the final prospectus and
such other documents as the Holder or underwriters may reasonably request. In
connection with any registration which the Holder requests be underwritten, the
Holder and the Registrant agree to enter into an underwriting agreement
reasonably acceptable to each such party, in form and substance customary for
transactions of this type with the underwriters participating in such offering.

     (e) Indemnification

     (i) The Registrant will indemnify the Holder, each of the Holder's
directors and officers and each person who controls the Holder within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, and each underwriter of the
Registrant's securities, with respect to any registration, qualification or
compliance which has been effected pursuant to this Agreement, against all
expenses, claims, losses, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereof), including any of the foregoing incurred in settlement of any action or
litigation, commenced or threatened (each, a "Damage Claim"), arising out of or
based on (A) any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material
fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or
other document, or any amendment or supplement thereto, incident to any such
registration, qualification or compliance, (B) any omission (or alleged
omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which
they were made, not misleading, or (C) any violation by the Registrant of any
rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, any federal or state securities law or any rule or
regulation promulgated under any of them applicable to the Registrant (each
matter in clause (A), (B) or (C), a "Violation"), in each case in connection
with any such registration, qualification or compliance, and the Registrant will
reimburse the Holder and, each of its directors and officers and each person who
controls the Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, and
each underwriter for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred in
connection with investigating, preparing or defending any such Damage Claim,
provided that the Registrant will not be liable in any such case to the extent
that any such Damage Claim arises out of or is based on any untrue statement or
omission or alleged untrue statement or omission, made in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to the Registrant by the Holder or
director or officer or controlling person or underwriter seeking
indemnification, and provided, further, that the indemnity agreement contained
in this Section 7(e)(i) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any
such Damage Claim if such settlement is effected without the consent of the
Registrant, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

     (ii) The Holder will indemnify the Registrant, each of the Registrant's
directors and officers and each underwriter of the Registrant's securities
covered by such registration statement and each person who controls the
Registrant within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against all
Damage Claims arising out of or based on any Violation in connection with any
such registration, qualification or compliance, and will reimburse the
Registrant, such directors, officers or control persons or underwriters for any
legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with
investigating, preparing or defending any such Damage Claim, in each case to the
extent, but only to the extent, that such Violation
                                       B-5

occurs in such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other
document in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished
to the Registrant by the Holder expressly for use therein, provided that in no
event shall any indemnity under this Section 7(e) exceed the gross proceeds of
the offering received by the Holder and provided, further that the indemnity
agreement contained in this Section 7(e)(ii) shall not apply to amounts paid in
settlement of any such Damage Claim if such settlement is effected without the
consent of the Holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

     (iii) Each party entitled to indemnification under this Section 7(e) (the
"Indemnified Party") shall give notice to the party required to provide
indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") promptly after such Indemnified Party
has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought, and shall
permit the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of any such claim or any
litigation resulting therefrom, provided that counsel for the Indemnifying
Party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or litigation, shall be
approved by the Indemnified Party (whose approval shall not unreasonably be
withheld), and the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at such
party's expense; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall pay such
expense if representation of the Indemnified Party by counsel retained by the
Indemnifying Party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing
interests between the Indemnified Party and any other party represented by such
counsel in such proceeding, and provided, further that the failure of any
Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Section 7(e) unless the failure
to give such notice is materially prejudicial to an Indemnifying Party's ability
to defend such action. No Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim
or litigation shall, except with the consent of each Indemnified Party, consent
to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as
an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or
litigation. No Indemnifying Party shall be required to indemnify any Indemnified
Party with respect to any settlement entered into without such Indemnifying
Party's prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld).

     (iv) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7(e) is held by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an Indemnified Party with
respect to any Damage Claim, then the Indemnifying Party, in lieu of
indemnifying the Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such Indemnified Party with respect to such Damage Claim in the
proportion that is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party in connection with the statements or omissions
that resulted in such Damage Claim, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the
untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact or the omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by the Indemnifying Party or by
the Indemnified Party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. In
any such case, (A) the Holder will not be required to contribute any amount in
excess of the aggregate public offering price of all such Registrable Securities
offered and sold by the Holder pursuant to such registration statement; and (B)
no person or entity guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from
any person or entity who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

     8. Adjustment Upon Changes in Capitalization; Rights Plans

     (a) In the event of any change in the Company Shares by reason of stock
dividends, stock splits, reverse stock splits, mergers (other than the Merger),
recapitalizations, combinations, exchanges of shares and the like, the type and
number of shares or securities subject to the Option and the Exercise Price
shall be adjusted appropriately, and proper provision shall be made in the
agreements governing such transaction so that Parent shall receive, upon
exercise of the Option, the number and class of shares or other securities or
property that Parent would have received in respect of the Company Shares if the
Option had been exercised immediately prior to such event or the record date
therefor, as applicable.

                                       B-6

     (b) Prior to such time as the Option is terminated, and at any time after
the Option is exercised (in whole or in part, if at all), the Company shall not
(i) amend (nor permit the amendment of) its Rights Agreement nor adopt (nor
permit the adoption of) a new stockholders rights plan that contains provisions
for the distribution or exercise of rights thereunder as a result of Parent or
any affiliate or transferee being the beneficial owner of shares of the Company
by virtue of the Option being exercisable or having been exercised (or as a
result of beneficially owning shares issuable in respect of any Option Shares),
or (ii) take any other action which would prevent or disable Parent from
exercising its rights under this Agreement or enjoying the full rights and
privileges possessed by other holders of Company Shares generally with respect
to the Option Shares obtained by the Holder upon exercise of the Option.

     9. Surrender of Option. If, at any time prior to the termination of the
Option, any person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) (an "Acquiring Person"): (a)
becomes the beneficial owner of more than a 50% interest in the total
outstanding voting securities of Company or any of its subsidiaries or (b) shall
have entered into an agreement with Company for, or shall have effected, the
acquisition of Company by merger, consolidation, business combination or similar
transaction involving Company, or any sale, lease, exchange, transfer, license
(other than in the ordinary course of business), acquisition or disposition of
more than 50% of the assets of Company, then, Parent may, at its sole option and
upon Parent's written request to Company, surrender the Option, to the extent
not previously exercised, to Company in exchange for the payment by Company to
Parent in immediately available funds of an amount equal to the product of: (x)
the excess, if any, of (i) the greater of (A) the highest price per share paid
or agreed to be paid by the Acquiring Person for any Company Shares in such
transaction (or, if there is no readily available per share price in such
transaction, the aggregate consideration paid or to be paid by the Acquiring
Person in such transaction, divided by the number of Company Shares then
outstanding (the value of any consideration other than cash to be determined, in
the case of consideration with a readily ascertainable market value, by
reference to such market value and, in any case where the market value of the
consideration is not so ascertainable, by agreement in good faith between Parent
and Company)) or (B) the average closing sale price of Company Common Stock on
the Nasdaq Stock Market during the 20 trading days ending with the trading day
immediately preceding the date of such request over (ii) the Exercise Price,
multiplied by (y) the total number of Option Shares as to which the Option has
not theretofore been exercised. Upon the delivery by Parent to Company of a
surrender request, each party shall take all actions necessary to consummate
such surrender transaction as expeditiously as possible. Upon exercise of its
right to surrender the Option or any portion thereof and full payment therefor
to Parent pursuant to this Section 9, any and all rights of Parent with respect
to the portion of the Option so surrendered shall be terminated.

     10. Repurchase of Shares. Company shall have the right to purchase for cash
(the "Repurchase Right") all, but not less than all, of the Option Shares then
beneficially owned by Parent at an aggregate price for all such shares
(regardless of the number of such shares) equal to the Adjusted Profit Cap.
Company's right to exercise the Repurchase Right shall expire on the twentieth
business day following the two year anniversary of the termination of the Merger
(the "Merger Termination Date"). In the event Company wishes to exercise the
Repurchase Right, Company shall send a written notice to Parent specifying a
date (not later than ten business days and not earlier than the second business
day following the date such notice is given) for the closing of such repurchase
(the "Repurchase Notice"), provided, however that Company may not repurchase any
Option Shares hereunder prior to the date that is one calendar year following
the date on which the Merger Agreement is terminated. The closing of the
repurchase of the Option Shares shall take place at the principal offices of
Company upon such specified date. Upon exercise of Company's right to repurchase
all outstanding Option Shares and full payment therefor to Parent pursuant to
this Section 10, any and all right of Parent to future exercises of the Option
shall be terminated. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if
application of the Adjusted Profit Cap formula below yields a number that is
less than zero, Company may exercise its Repurchase Right as provided in this
Section 10, and upon such exercise, Parent shall deliver all Option Shares it
holds to Company for cancellation, and neither Parent nor Company shall pay each
other any amount in connection with such exercise of the Repurchase Right.

                                       B-7

     For the purposes of this Agreement, the "Adjusted Profit Cap" means the
difference of (i) the Profit Cap minus (ii) the sum of (A) any Termination Fee
received by Parent under Section 7.3(b) of the Merger Agreement plus (B) the
proceeds received by Parent for any sales or other dispositions of Option Shares
(including pursuant to Company's exercise of its rights to purchase Option
Shares under Section 7(a) hereof) or the Option (including pursuant to Parent's
exercise to surrender the Option pursuant to Section 9 hereof), and any
dividends or distributions received by Parent declared on Option Shares, in each
case, through the date of the closing of the repurchase under this Section 10;
provided that the Adjusted Profit Cap shall never be less than zero.

     11. Restrictive Legends. Each certificate representing Option Shares issued
to Parent hereunder (other than certificates representing shares sold in a
registered public offering pursuant to Section 7) shall include a legend in
substantially the following form:

        THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED
        UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND MAY BE REOFFERED OR
        SOLD ONLY IF SO REGISTERED OR IF AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION IS
        AVAILABLE.

     12. Listing and HSR Filing. The Company, upon the request of Parent, shall
promptly file an application to list the Company Shares to be acquired upon
exercise of the Option for quotation on the Nasdaq Stock Market and shall use
its reasonable efforts to obtain approval of such listing as soon as
practicable. Promptly after the date hereof, upon request by Parent, each of the
parties hereto shall file with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice all required premerger
notification and report forms and other documents and exhibits required to be
filed under the HSR Act ("HSR Filings") to permit the acquisition of the Company
Shares subject to the Option at the earliest possible date. In the event that
Parent does not exercise its rights to acquire Company Shares hereunder before
the expiration of the period for which permission has initially been granted
pursuant to the HSR Act, the Company shall, upon request of Parent in connection
with Parent's election to exercise this option, promptly prepare and file all
additional HSR Filings to permit acquisition of the Company Shares subject to
the Option as soon as possible after delivery of the Exercise Notice and demand
by Parent for preparation and filing by Company of such additional HSR Filings.

     13. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. Except as set forth in Section 7, nothing contained in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any person other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever by reason of this Agreement.

     14. Specific Performance; Fees.

     (a) The parties hereto recognize and agree that if for any reason any of
the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable harm or
injury would be caused for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy.
Accordingly, each party agrees that in addition to other remedies the other
party shall be entitled to an injunction restraining any violation or threatened
violation of the provisions of this Agreement or the right to enforce any of the
covenants or agreements set forth herein by specific performance. In the event
that any action shall be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of the
Agreement, neither party will allege, and each party hereby waives the defense,
that there is an adequate remedy at law.

     (b) If any action, suit or other proceeding (whether at law, in equity or
otherwise) is instituted concerning or arising out of this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereunder, the prevailing party shall recover, in
addition to any other remedy granted to such party therein, all such party's
costs and attorneys fees incurred in connection with the prosecution or defense
of such action, suit or other proceeding.

     15. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Merger Agreement (including
the appendices and exhibits thereto) constitute the entire agreement between the
parties with respect to the subject matter
                                       B-8

hereof and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written

     16. Further Assurances. Each party will execute and deliver all such
further documents and instruments and take all such further action as may be
necessary in order to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

     17. Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will
continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other
persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the
intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision
that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

     18. Notices. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in

                                VOTING AGREEMENT

     This Voting Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into as of
January 16, 2001, between Macromedia, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"),
and the undersigned stockholder ("Stockholder") of Allaire Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ("Company").

                                    RECITALS

     A. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent, Company and
Alaska Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), are entering into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the "Merger Agreement") which provides for the merger of Merger Sub and
Company (the "Merger"). Pursuant to the Merger, shares of common stock of
Company, par value $0.01 per share ("Company Common Stock") will be converted
into shares of Parent Common Stock on the basis described in the Merger
Agreement. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings
set forth in the Merger Agreement.

     B. Stockholder is the record holder or beneficial owner of, or exercises
voting power over, such number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock as
is indicated on the final page of this Agreement.

     C. As a material inducement to enter into the Merger Agreement, Parent
desires Stockholder to agree, and Stockholder is willing to agree, to vote the
Shares (as defined below), and such other shares of capital stock of Company
over which Stockholder has voting power, so as to facilitate consummation of the
Merger.

     In consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the parties agree as
follows:

     1. Agreement to Vote Shares.

     1.1  Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement:

          (a) Shares. The term "Shares" shall mean all issued and outstanding
     shares of Company Common Stock owned of record or beneficially by
     Stockholder or over which Stockholder exercises voting power, in each case,
     as of the record date for persons entitled (i) to receive notice of, and to
     vote at the meeting of the stockholders of Company called for the purpose
     of voting on the matters referred to in Section 1.2, or (ii) to take action
     by written consent of the stockholders of Company with respect to the
     matters referred to in Section 1.2. Stockholder agrees that any shares of
     capital stock of Company that Stockholder purchases or with respect to
     which Stockholder otherwise acquires beneficial ownership or over which
     Stockholder exercises voting power after the execution of this Agreement
     and prior to the date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
     3 below shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement to
     the same extent as if they constituted Shares on the date hereof.

          (b) Subject Securities. The term "Subject Securities" shall mean: (i)
     all securities of Company (including all shares of Company Common Stock and
     all options, warrants and other rights to acquire shares of Company Common
     Stock) beneficially owned by Stockholder as of the date of this Agreement;
     and (ii) all additional securities of Company (including all additional
     shares of Company Common Stock and all additional options, warrants and
     other rights to acquire shares of Company Common Stock) of which
     Stockholder acquires beneficial ownership during the period from the date
     of this Agreement through the earlier of termination of this Agreement
     pursuant to Section 3 below or the record date for the meeting at which
     stockholders of Company are asked to vote upon approval of the Merger
     Agreement and the Merger.

                                       C-1

          (c) Transfer. Stockholder shall be deemed to have effected a
     "Transfer" of a security if Stockholder directly or indirectly: (i) sells,
     pledges, encumbers, transfers or disposes of, or grants an option with
     respect to, such security or any interest in such security; or (ii) enters
     into an agreement or commitment providing for the sale, pledge,
     encumbrance, transfer or disposition of, or grant of an option with respect
     to, such security or any interest therein.

     1.2  Agreement to Vote Shares. Stockholder hereby covenants and agrees
that, during the period commencing on the date hereof and continuing until the
first to occur of (i) such date and time as the Merger shall become effective in
accordance with the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement (the "Effective
Time") and (ii) termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, at
any meeting (whether annual or special and whether or not an adjourned or
postponed meeting) of the stockholders of Company, however called, or in
connection with any written consent of the stockholders of Company, Stockholder
will appear at the meeting or otherwise cause the Shares to be counted as
present thereat for purposes of establishing a quorum and vote or consent (or
cause to be voted or consented) the Shares:

          (1) in favor of the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and
     the approval of the Merger and the other actions contemplated by the Merger
     Agreement and any actions required in furtherance thereof; and

          (2) against approval of any proposal made in opposition to or in
     competition with the consummation of the Merger, including, without
     limitation, any Acquisition Proposal or Superior Offer (each as defined in
     the Merger Agreement) or any action or agreement that would result in a
     breach in any respect of any covenant, representation or warranty or any
     other obligation or agreement of Company under the Merger Agreement or of
     Stockholder under this Agreement.

     Stockholder further agrees not to enter into any agreement or understanding
with any person the effect of which would be inconsistent with or violative of
any provision contained in this Section 1.2.

     1.3.  Transfer and Other Restrictions.

     (a) Prior to the termination of this Agreement, Stockholder agrees not to,
directly or indirectly:

          (i) except pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement or as may be
     specifically required by court order, offer for sale, Transfer or otherwise
     dispose of, or enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or
     understanding with respect to or consent to the offer for sale Transfer or
     other disposition of any or all of the Subject Securities or any interest
     therein except as provided in Section 1.2 hereof;

          (ii) grant any proxy, power of attorney, deposit any of the Subject
     Securities into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or
     arrangement with respect to the Subject Securities except as provided in
     this Agreement or as may be specifically required by court order; or

          (iii) take any other action that would make any representation or
     warranty of Stockholder contained herein untrue or incorrect or have the
     effect of preventing or disabling Stockholder from performing its
     obligations under this Agreement.

     (b) To the extent Stockholder is, as of the date hereof, party to a
contract or agreement that requires Stockholder to Transfer Shares to another
person or entity (excluding a contract or agreement pledging Shares to Company),
Stockholder will not effect any such Transfer unless and until the transferee
agrees to be bound by and executes an agreement in the form of this Agreement
with respect to the Shares to be Transferred. Nothing herein shall prohibit
Stockholder from exercising (in accordance with the terms of the option or
warrant, as applicable) any option or warrant Stockholder may hold to acquire
capital stock of the Company; provided that the securities of the Company
acquired upon such exercise shall be deemed Shares.

     1.4  Irrevocable Proxy. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Stockholder agrees to deliver to Parent a proxy in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit I (the "Proxy"), which shall be irrevocable, with respect to the Shares,
subject to the other terms of this Agreement.

                                       C-2

     1.5  No Limitation on Discretion as Director. This Agreement is intended
solely to apply to the exercise by Stockholder of rights attaching to ownership
of the Shares, and nothing herein shall be deemed to apply to, or to limit in
any manner the discretion of Stockholder who is a director of the Company with
respect to, any action which may be taken or omitted by Stockholder acting in
Stockholder's fiduciary capacity as a director of the Company.

     2. Representations and Warranties of Stockholder.

     (a) On and as of the date hereof, Stockholder is the record or beneficial
owner of, or Stockholder exercises voting power over, the shares of Company
Common Stock indicated on the final page of this Agreement, which, on and as of
the date hereof, are free and clear of any Encumbrances that would adversely
affect the ability of Stockholder to carry out the terms of this Agreement. On
and as of the date hereof, the number of Shares set forth on the signature page
hereto are the only Shares held of record or beneficially owned by Stockholder
or over which Stockholder exercises voting power and, except as set forth on
such signature page, Stockholder holds no options or warrants to purchase or
rights to subscribe for or otherwise acquire any securities of the Company and
has no other interest in or voting rights with respect to any securities of the
Company.

     (b) Stockholder has the requisite capacity, power and authority to enter
into this Agreement and to consummate the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Stockholder
and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Stockholder, enforceable
against Stockholder in accordance with its terms, except (i) as the same may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or similar laws of
general application relating to or affecting creditors' rights, and (ii) for the
limitations imposed by general principles of equity. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and compliance with the provisions of this
Agreement will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation which would
result in the creation of any Encumbrance upon any of the Shares owned by
Stockholder under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or of any
agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree, or other instrument binding on
Stockholder or any Shares owned by Stockholder, except for any such conflicts,
violations, defaults or creation of any Encumbrances upon any Shares that would
not prevent or materially delay the performance by Stockholder of Stockholder's
obligations under this Agreement. No consent, approval, order or authorization
of any Governmental Entity is required by or with respect to Stockholder in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Stockholder or
the consummation by Stockholder of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except (i) for applicable requirements, if any, of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder, and
(ii) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals, orders or
authorizations would not prevent or materially delay the performance by
Stockholder of his, her or its obligations under this Agreement. If this
Agreement is being executed in a representative or fiduciary capacity, the
person signing this Agreement has full power and authority to enter into and
perform such Agreement. Prior to the approval of Company's Board of Directors of
this Agreement, Stockholder and Parent had no agreement, arrangement or
understanding with respect to the voting of any of Stockholder's securities of
the Company.

     3. Termination. This Agreement shall terminate and shall have no further
force or effect as of the first to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) such
date and time as the Merger Agreement shall have been validly terminated
pursuant to Article VII thereof.

     4. Miscellaneous.

     4.1  Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, then the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.

                                       C-3

     4.2  Binding Effect and Assignment. This Agreement and all of the
provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, but, except as
otherwise specifically provided herein, neither this Agreement nor any of the

                               IRREVOCABLE PROXY

     The undersigned stockholder (the "Stockholder") of Allaire Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ("Company"), hereby irrevocably appoints and constitutes
the members of the Board of Directors of Macromedia, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), and each such Board member (collectively, the
"Proxyholders"), the agents, attorneys-in-fact and proxies of the undersigned,
with full power of substitution and resubstitution, to the full extent of the
undersigned's rights with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock held of
record by or beneficially owned by the undersigned or over which the undersigned
exercises voting power, which shares are listed below (the "Shares"), and any
and all other shares or securities issued or issuable in respect thereof on or
after the date hereof and prior to the date this proxy terminates, to vote the
Shares as follows: the Proxyholders named above are empowered at any time prior
to termination of this proxy to exercise all voting and other rights (including,
without limitation, the power to execute and deliver written consents with
respect to the Shares) of the undersigned at every annual, special or adjourned
meeting of Company stockholders, and in every written consent in lieu of such a
meeting, or otherwise, (i) in favor of adoption of the Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the "Merger Agreement") among Parent, Alaska Acquisition Corporation, a
Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Macromedia, Inc. ("Merger
Sub") and Company, and the approval of the merger of Merger Sub and Company (the
"Merger"), and (ii) against approval of any proposal made in opposition to or in
competition with consummation of the Merger, including, without limitation, any
Acquisition Proposal or Superior Offer (each as defined in the Merger Agreement)
or any action or agreement that would result in a breach in any respect of any
covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of
Company under the Merger Agreement or of the Stockholder under that certain
Voting Agreement, dated as of January 16, 2001, by and between Parent and the
Stockholder (the "Voting Agreement").

     The Proxyholders may not exercise this proxy on any other matter. The
Stockholder may vote the Shares on all matters other than those set forth in the
immediately preceding paragraph. The proxy granted by the Stockholder to the
Proxyholders hereby is granted as of the date of this Irrevocable Proxy in order
to secure the obligations of the Stockholder set forth in Section 1 of the
Voting Agreement, and is irrevocable and coupled with an interest in such
obligations and in the interests in Company to be purchased and sold pursuant
the Merger Agreement.

     This proxy will terminate upon the termination of the Voting Agreement in
accordance with its terms. Upon the execution hereof, all prior proxies given by
the undersigned with respect to the Shares and any and all other shares or
securities issued or issuable in respect thereof on or after the date hereof are
hereby revoked and no subsequent proxies will be given until such time as this

undersigned hereunder shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of the
undersigned. The undersigned Stockholder authorizes the Proxyholders to file

of Company and with any Inspector of Elections at any meeting of the
stockholders of Company.

     This proxy is irrevocable and shall survive the insolvency, incapacity, or
death of the undersigned. Dated: January 16, 2001.

                     OPINION OF CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON

                   [LETTERHEAD OF CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON]

January 16, 2001

Board of Directors
Allaire Corporation
275 Grove Street
Newton, Massachusetts 02466

Members of the Board:

     You have asked us to advise you with respect to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of the common stock of Allaire
Corporation ("Allaire") of the Merger Consideration (as defined below) set forth
in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 16, 2001 (the "Merger
Agreement"), by and among Macromedia, Inc. ("Macromedia"), Alaska Acquisition
Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Macromedia ("Merger Sub"), and Allaire. The
Merger Agreement provides for, among other things, (i) the merger of Allaire
with and into Merger Sub or (ii) in the event of a Conversion Event (as defined
below), the merger of Merger Sub with and into Allaire pursuant to which Allaire
will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Macromedia (in either case, the
"Merger"). The Merger Agreement further provides, among other things, that each
outstanding share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Allaire
("Allaire Common Stock") will be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.20
(the "Exchange Ratio") of a share of the common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of Macromedia (the "Macromedia Common Stock") (the "Stock Consideration")
and (ii) $3.00 in cash (the "Cash Consideration" and, together with the Stock
Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"); provided, however, that if the
product of (a) the Exchange Ratio and (b) the closing sale price of a share of
Macromedia Common Stock during regular trading hours on the Nasdaq National
Market on the day which is two trading days before the date fixed for the
Allaire stockholders' meeting (the "Trigger Price") is less than the Cash
Consideration (a "Conversion Event"), the Merger Consideration shall equal the
sum of (x) an amount of cash equal to the product of (1) the Exchange Ratio and
(2) the Trigger Price and (y) the Cash Consideration.

     In arriving at our opinion, we have reviewed the Merger Agreement and
certain related documents, as well as certain publicly available business and
financial information relating to Allaire and Macromedia. We also have reviewed
certain other information relating to Allaire and Macromedia provided to or
discussed with us by Allaire and Macromedia, as well as publicly available
financial forecasts for Allaire and Macromedia discussed with us by Allaire and
Macromedia, and have met with the managements of Allaire and Macromedia to
discuss the businesses and prospects of Allaire and Macromedia. We also have
considered certain financial and stock market data of Allaire and Macromedia,
and we have compared those data with similar data for publicly held companies in
businesses we deemed similar to those of Allaire and Macromedia, and we have
considered, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of certain
other business combinations and other transactions that have recently been
effected. We also considered such other information, financial studies, analyses
and investigations and financial, economic and market criteria that we deemed
relevant.

     In connection with our review, we have not assumed any responsibility for
independent verification of any of the foregoing information and have relied on
such information being complete and accurate in all material respects. We have
reviewed and discussed with the managements of Allaire and Macromedia publicly
available financial forecasts relating to Allaire and Macromedia and have been
advised, and have assumed, that such forecasts represent reasonable estimates
and judgments as to the future financial performance of Allaire and Macromedia.
In addition, we have relied, without independent verification,

Board of Directors

upon the assessments of the managements of Allaire and Macromedia as to (i) the
existing and future technology and products of Allaire and Macromedia and the
risks associated with such technology and products, (ii) the potential cost
savings and synergies (including the amount, timing and achievability thereof)
and strategic benefits anticipated by the managements of Allaire and Macromedia
to result from the Merger, (iii) their ability to integrate the businesses of
Allaire and Macromedia and (iv) their ability to retain key employees of Allaire
and Macromedia. We also have assumed, with your consent, that, unless a
Conversion Event occurs, the Merger will be treated as a tax-free reorganization
for federal income tax purposes. In addition, we have not been requested to
make, and have not made, an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or
liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Allaire or Macromedia, nor have we been
furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals. Our opinion does not address
the relative merits of the Merger as compared to other business strategies that
might be available to Allaire, nor does it address the underlying business
decision of Allaire to proceed with the Merger. Our opinion is necessarily based
upon information available to us, and financial, economic, market and other
conditions as they exist and can be evaluated, on the date hereof. We are not
expressing any opinion as to what the value of the Macromedia Common Stock
actually will be if and when issued pursuant to the Merger or the prices at
which the Macromedia Common Stock will trade subsequent to the Merger. In
connection with our engagement, we were not requested to, and did not, conduct a
solicitation process seeking third party indications of interest in the possible
acquisition of all or any part of Allaire.

     We have acted as financial advisor to Allaire in connection with the Merger
and will receive a fee for our services, which is contingent upon the
consummation of the Merger. We and our affiliates have in the past provided
financial services to Allaire unrelated to the proposed Merger, for which
services we have received compensation. In the ordinary course of business, we
and our affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities of Allaire
and Macromedia for our and such affiliates' accounts and for the accounts of
customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in
such securities.

     It is understood that this letter is for the information of the Board of
Directors of Allaire in connection with its evaluation of the Merger and does
not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder
should vote to act on any matter relating to the Merger.

     Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the
date hereof, the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view,
to the holders of Allaire Common Stock.

                                      Very truly yours,

                                      CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION

                                                                         ANNEX E

                                APPRAISAL RIGHTS
                 DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATIONS LAW SECTION 262

SEC. 262. APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

     (a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of
stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this
section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through
the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied
with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the
merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to sec. 228 of
this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the
fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances
described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section,
the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a stock corporation
and also a member of record of a nonstock corporation; the words "stock"
and"share" mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words and also
membership or membership interest of a member of a nonstock corporation; and the
words "depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a
depository representing an interest in one or more shares, or fractions thereof,
solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.

     (b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or
series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be
effected pursuant to sec. 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to
sec. 251(g) of this title), sec. 252, sec. 254, sec. 257, sec. 258, sec. 263 or
sec. 264 of this title:

          (1) Provided, however, that no appraisal rights under this section
     shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which
     stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed
     to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote at
     the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or
     consolidation, were either (i) listed on a national securities exchange or
     designated as a national market system security on an interdealer quotation
     system by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or (ii) held
     of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no
     appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the
     constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require
     for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation
     as provided in subsection (f) of sec. 251 of this title.

          (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, appraisal rights
     under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series
     of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required
     by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to
     Sections 251, 252, 254, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for
     such stock anything except:

             a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from
        such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;

             b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts
        in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in
        respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the
        merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities
        exchange or designated as a national market system security on an
        interdealer quotation system by the National Association of Securities
        Dealers, Inc. or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

             c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository
        receipts described in the foregoing subparagraphs a. and b. of this
        paragraph; or

             d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and
        cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts
        described in the foregoing subparagraphs a., b. and c. of this
        paragraph.

                                       E-1

          (3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation
     party to a merger effected under sec. 253 of this title is not owned by the
     parent corporation immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall
     be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

     (c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that
appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of
incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a
constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of
the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision,
the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and
(e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

     (d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

          (1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights
     are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a
     meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to
     the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the
     record date for such meeting with respect to shares for which appraisal
     rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) hereof that
     appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the
     constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this
     section. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such
     stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of
     the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of
     such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably
     informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the
     stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's
     shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not
     constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must
     do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after
     the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or
     resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent
     corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in
     favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the
     merger or consolidation has become effective; or

          (2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to sec.228 or
     sec.253 of this title, each constituent corporation, either before the
     effective date of the merger or consolidation or within ten days
     thereafter, shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of
     stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights
     of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights
     are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of
     such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of
     this section; provided that, if the notice is given on or after the
     effective date of the merger or consolidation, such notice shall be given
     by the surviving or resulting corporation to all such holders of any class
     or series of stock of a constituent corporation that are entitled to
     appraisal rights. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective
     date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders
     of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder
     entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing
     of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting
     corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares. Such demand will be
     sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the
     stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the
     appraisal of such holder's shares. If such notice did not notify
     stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either
     (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the
     effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders
     of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are
     entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or
     consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send
     such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such
     effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more
     than 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice
     need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights
     and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's shares in accordance with
     this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of
     the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either
     notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be
     prima facie evidence of the facts stated
                                       E-2

     therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive
     either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record
     date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is
     given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date
     of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective
     date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the
     effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day
     next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

     (e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has
complied with subsections (a) and (d) hereof and who is otherwise entitled to
appraisal rights, may file a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a
determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective
date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder shall have the right to
withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered
upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of
the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the
requirements of subsections (a) and (d) hereof, upon written request, shall be
entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from
the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not
voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands
for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such
shares. Such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days
after such stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the
surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the
period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) hereof,
whichever is later.

     (f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a
copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which
shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in
Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their
shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been
reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be
filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be
accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so
ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the
hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or
resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses
therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at
least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as
the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication
shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the
surviving or resulting corporation.

     (g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the
stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to
appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an
appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to
submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation
thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder
fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to
such stockholder.

     (h) After determining the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the Court
shall appraise the shares, determining their fair value exclusive of any element
of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or
consolidation, together with a fair rate of interest, if any, to be paid upon
the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the
Court shall take into account all relevant factors. In determining the fair rate
of interest, the Court may consider all relevant factors, including the rate of
interest which the surviving or resulting corporation would have had to pay to
borrow money during the pendency of the proceeding. Upon application by the
surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate
in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, permit discovery
or other pretrial proceedings and may proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior
to the final determination of the stockholder entitled to an appraisal. Any
stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting
corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has
                                       E-3

submitted such stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery,
if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is
finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights
under this section.

     (i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares,
together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the
stockholders entitled thereto. Interest may be simple or compound, as the Court
may direct. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of
holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares
represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the
certificates representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as
other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving
or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

     (j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed
upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon
application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the
expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal
proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the
fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all
the shares entitled to an appraisal.

     (k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no
stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of
this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive
payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or
other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior
to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that
if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in
subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the
surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder's
demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either
within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as
provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written
approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal
shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court
of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the
Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems
just.

     (l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the
shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they
assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and
unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.

                                       E-4

               PART II -- INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS

ITEM 20. INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS

     As permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the
Registrant's Certificate of Incorporation includes a provision that eliminates
the personal liability of its directors to the Registrant or its stockholders
for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for
liability (i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the
corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or
which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under
section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law or (iv) for any transaction
from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.

     In addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, the Bylaws of the Registrant provide that: (i) the Registrant
is required to indemnify its directors and executive officers to the fullest
extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law; (ii) the Registrant
may, in its discretion, indemnify other officers, employees and agents as set
forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law; (iii) upon receipt of an
undertaking to repay such advances, if indemnification is determined to be
unavailable, the Registrant is required to advance expenses, as incurred, to its
directors and executive officers to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware
General Corporation Law in connection with a proceeding (except if a
determination is reasonably and promptly made by the Board of Directors by a
majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the
proceeding or, in certain circumstances, by independent legal counsel in a
written opinion that the facts known to the decision-making party demonstrate
clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that
such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
corporation); (iv) the rights conferred in the Bylaws are not exclusive and the
Registrant is authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with its
directors, officers, employees and agents; (v) the Registrant may not
retroactively amend the Bylaw provisions relating to indemnity; and (vi) to the
fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, a director or
executive officer will be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner he
or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Registrant, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had
no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful, if his or
her action is based on the record or books of account of the corporation or on
information supplied to him or her by officers of the corporation in the course
of their duties or on the advice of legal counsel for the corporation or on
information or records given or reports made to the corporation by independent
certified public accountants or appraisers or other experts.

     The Registrant's policy is to enter into indemnification agreements with
each of its directors and executive officers. The indemnification agreements
provide that directors and executive officers will be indemnified and held
harmless to the fullest extent permitted by law including against all expenses
(including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and settlement amounts paid or
reasonably incurred by them in any action, suit or proceeding, including any
derivative action by or in the right of the Registrant, on account of their
services as directors, officers, employees or agents of the Registrant or as
directors, officers, employees or agents of any other company or enterprise when
they are serving in such capacities at the request of the Registrant. The
Registrant will not be obligated pursuant to the agreements to indemnify or
advance expenses to an indemnified party with respect to proceedings or claims:
(i) initiated by the indemnified party and not by way of defense, except with
respect to a proceeding authorized by the Board of Directors and successful
proceedings brought to enforce a right to indemnification under the
indemnification agreement; (ii) for any amounts paid in settlement of a
proceeding unless the Registrant consents to such settlement; (iii) on account
of any suit in which judgment is rendered against the indemnified party for an
accounting of profits made from the purchase or sale by the indemnified party of
securities of the Registrant pursuant to the provisions of Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act and related laws; (iv) on account of conduct by a director that is
finally adjudged to have been in bad faith or conduct that the director did not
reasonably believe to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the
Registrant; (v) on account of any criminal action or proceeding arising out of
conduct that the director had reasonable

                                      II-1

cause to believe was unlawful; or (vi) if a final decision by a court having
jurisdiction in the matter shall determine that such indemnification is not
lawful.

     The indemnification agreements also provide for contribution in certain
situations in which the Registrant and a director or executive officer are
jointly liable but indemnification is unavailable, such contribution to be based
on the relative benefits received and the relative fault of the Registrant and
the director or executive officer. Contribution is not allowed in connection
with a Section 16(b) judgment, and adjudication of bad faith or conduct that a
director or executive officer did not reasonably believe to be in, or not
opposed to, the best interest of the Registrant, or a proceeding arising out of
conduct a director or executive officer had reasonable cause to believe was
unlawful.

     The indemnification agreements require a director or executive officer to
reimburse the Registrant for all expenses advanced only to the extent it is
ultimately determined that the director or executive officer is not entitled,
under Delaware law, the Bylaws, an indemnification agreement or otherwise to be
indemnified for such expenses. The indemnification agreements provide that they
are not exclusive of any rights a director or executive officer may have under
the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, other agreements, any
majority-in-interest vote of the stockholders or vote of disinterested
directors, Delaware law or otherwise.

     The indemnification provision in the Bylaws, and the indemnification
agreements entered into between the Registrant and its directors and executive
officers, may be sufficiently broad to permit indemnification of the
Registrant's executive officers and directors for liabilities arising under the
Securities Act.

     As authorized by the Bylaws, the Registrant, with approval by the Board,
has purchased director and officer liability insurance.

ITEM 22. UNDERTAKINGS

     (1) The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of
determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act"), each
filing of the Registrant's annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an
employee benefit plan's annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement
relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities
at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.

     (2) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Act may be
permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant
pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the "Certificate of
Incorporation"), and the bylaws, as amended (the "Bylaws"), of the Registrant,
the Delaware General Corporation Law or otherwise, the Registrant has been
advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such
indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is,
therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against
such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred
or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the
successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such
director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being
registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter
has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate
jurisdiction the question of whether such indemnification by it is against
public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final
adjudication of such issue.

     (3) The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes to respond to requests for
information that is incorporated by reference into the prospectus pursuant to
Item 4, 10(b), 11 or 13 of this Form S-4, within one business day of receipt of
such request, and to send the incorporated documents by first class mail or
other equally prompt means. This includes information contained in documents
filed subsequent to the effective date of the Registration Statement through the
date of responding to the request.

     (4) The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes to supply by means of a
post-effective amendment all information concerning a transaction, and the
company being acquired involved therein, that was not the subject of and
included in the Registration Statement when it became effective.
                                      II-3

                                   SIGNATURES

Registrant has duly caused this registration statement to be signed on its
behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of San
Francisco, State of California, on the 31st day of January, 2001.
