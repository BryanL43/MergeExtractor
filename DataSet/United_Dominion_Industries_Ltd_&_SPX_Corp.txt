We urge you to read the merger agreement
carefully.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     
As part of its strategic planning, VSI Holdings has continually reviewed
market trends and strategic opportunities for its marketing services,
organizational development and training services, and customer management
services.
It has also reviewed opportunities for expansion in areas related or
complementary to its core businesses.
In this vein, VSI Holdings has sought to
explore the ways in which it could enhance shareholder value.

     
In early 2000, at the direction of VSI Holdings' board of directors, VSI
Holdings' senior management began to examine and explore the company's ability
and capacity to grow in a meaningful way in its core markets in light of current
market trends.
Among the trends that the board considered were:

     - continued consolidation of suppliers within the automotive industry;

     - increasing customer demand for large suppliers with a broad spectrum of
       resources, services and products, the ability able to provide services
       globally and the capacity to make significant investments in advanced
       technologies; and

     - increasing competition from companies specializing in services such as
       customer relationship management, database management and e-business.

     
The VSI Holdings board considered various alternatives, including remaining
independent, expanding and seeking a strategic affiliation, including a sale and
merger.
The board considered the potential risks and costs associated with these
alternatives and determined that a strategic alliance, including a sale and
merger, with another company would facilitate the company's growth strategy and
accelerate the achievement of its strategic objectives.
Accordingly, the board
directed management to identify entities that might be interested in a strategic
affiliation with VSI Holdings, or in acquiring VSI Holdings, and that fit the
criteria outlined by the board.
These criteria included:

     - the ability to provide VSI Holdings with a significant asset base and
       global presence;

     - the prospects for growth and perceived ability to enhance shareholder
       value; and

     - the ability to provide VSI Holdings' shareholders with diversification
       and greater liquidity.

     VSI Holdings' management identified eight entities that it believed
satisfied these criteria and would provide an opportunity to implement VSI
Holdings' growth strategy and accelerate the achievement of its strategic
objectives.
Management contacted these eight entities regarding the possibility
of a strategic alliance with VSI Holdings.
As part of this process, which
occurred during the summer of 2000, members of VSI Holdings' management met with
and made presentations to each of those potential partners.

     
On August 14, 2000, the VSI Holdings' board reviewed the status and results
of those presentations.
As part of that review, management gave a presentation
to the board summarizing the status of the strategic affiliation process, its
discussions with potential partners and its evaluation of the potential
partners.
It also presented a proposed timetable for the strategic affiliation
process.
After discussion, VSI Holdings' board of directors instructed
management to continue the strategic affiliation process by conducting further
discussions with the potential partners to better assess their interest in
pursuing a strategic affiliation with VSI Holdings.

     
VSI Holdings then notified the potential partners of VSI Holdings' interest
in receiving preliminary, non-binding indications of interest for a strategic
affiliation.
Further discussions between VSI Holdings'

management and the potential partners were held between September and November
2000 and, in connection with those discussions, the potential partners received
additional material regarding VSI Holdings.

     
Following these discussions and initial due diligence by the potential
partners, three of these potential partners, including SPX, responded with
considered and defined non-binding indications of interest.

     
On December 14, 2000, VSI Holdings management reviewed the three
indications of interest with the board of directors.
Based on this review, the
board instructed management to invite SPX to conduct detailed due diligence at
VSI Holdings' headquarters.
VSI Holdings' board of directors selected SPX for
the reasons described under -- Reasons for the Merger and because:

     - SPX's preliminary indication of value for VSI Holdings was higher than
       the value indicated in the other two indications of interest;

     - SPX was willing to acquire the outstanding stock of VSI Holdings with SPX
       stock as part of the consideration in a transaction that could provide
       VSI Holdings shareholders with an opportunity for additional enhancements
       to shareholder value, while each of the other two potential partners
       expressed a strong preference for an asset purchase transaction using
       only cash as consideration and with less favorable tax consequences to
       VSI Holdings' shareholders;

     - SPX expressed a strategic vision that was more compatible with VSI
       Holdings' strategic objectives and a stronger commitment to a strategic
       affiliation with VSI Holdings;

     - SPX was larger and more diversified and could provide VSI Holdings with
       access to a more diversified customer base; and

     - SPX could provide significant shareholder liquidity through the large
       public trading market for its stock.

     
Shortly after being notified of VSI Holdings' interest in pursuing a
strategic affiliation with SPX, SPX's management received approval to commence
further due diligence regarding a transaction with VSI Holdings.
The due
diligence, which commenced in December 2000 and continued until the signing of
the merger agreement, included presentations by, and meetings with, VSI
Holdings' senior management.

     
On January 10, 2001, Steve Toth, Jr., the Chairman and CEO of VSI Holdings,
met with Tom Riordan, President, Service Solutions, of SPX, to discuss various
aspects of a proposed transaction, though no definitive agreement was reached.

In addition, in January, VSI Holdings retained McDonald Investments to provide a
fairness opinion and investigate whether a business combination with SPX would
be fair from a financial point of view to shareholders of VSI Holdings.

     
On January 19, 2001, Mr. Toth and three other executive officers of VSI
Holdings traveled to SPX's headquarters in Muskegon, Michigan and met with John
Blystone, the Chairman and CEO of SPX, to review and discuss SPX's strategic
plan and the proposed transaction.

     
On February 12, 2001, at a special meeting of VSI Holdings' board of
directors, Mr. Toth updated VSI Holdings' directors on the status of the
discussions with SPX.
Following discussions regarding the reasons for entering
into a strategic affiliation with SPX, VSI Holdings' board of directors advised
management to continue its negotiations with SPX.
At this meeting, McDonald
Investments made a presentation of the results of various financial analyses
undertaken by it with respect to a business combination with SPX.

     
Between February 13 and February 24, 2001, representatives of VSI Holdings
and SPX and their respective advisors continued negotiating toward a definitive
agreement.

     
On February 25, 2001, Messrs. Toth and Riordan met to continue discussions
on terms of the proposed transaction, including deal structure and value.
At
that time they also discussed the compatibility of VSI Holdings' interests in
Advanced Animations, Inc., its indirect investment interests in OZ Entertainment
Company and certain other assets and property with the strategic objectives of
the

combined entity following the proposed business combination of VSI Holdings and
SPX.
After Mr. Riordan suggested that Advanced Animations, the indirect
investment interests in OZ Entertainment and the other property and interests
did not constitute "core assets" and were unlikely to have any significant role
in the combined entity's strategic plan, Mr. Toth expressed a desire to
personally acquire those interests after the proposed business combination with
SPX was completed if SPX ever decided to dispose of those interests.
Mr. Toth
was desirous of acquiring Advanced Animations, the indirect investment interests
in OZ Entertainment and the other property and interests because of his
previously existing significant personal investments in OZ Entertainment.

     
In early March, following further discussions regarding SPX's interest in
divesting Advanced Animations, the indirect investment interests in OZ
Entertainment and the related property and interests following the completion of
the proposed business combination of VSI Holdings and SPX, Mr. Toth engaged his
own legal advisors to represent him in connection with a proposal to acquire
those interests.

     
On March 13, 2001, VSI Holdings' board of directors met to review the
proposed transaction with SPX and to consider and vote upon the proposed
transaction.
Representatives of VSI Holdings' senior management and their
advisors discussed with, and made presentations to, VSI Holdings' board of
directors regarding the rationale for the proposed transaction, the proposed
terms of the transaction, certain legal and tax considerations, and the terms
and provisions contained in a proposed form of merger agreement that had been
previously distributed to VSI Holdings' directors.
In addition, at this meeting,
McDonald Investments made a presentation of the results of its various financial
analyses and advised VSI Holdings' board of directors that, as of that date, the
aggregate consideration to be received by VSI Holdings shareholders in the
proposed business combination with SPX was fair from a financial point of view.

The VSI Holdings' board then discussed the presentations given by VSI Holdings'
management, financial advisors and legal counsel at this and other of its
meetings and unanimously (with all directors present and no directors
abstaining):

     - approved the proposed business combination with SPX;

     - determined that the business combination with SPX was fair and in the
       best interests of VSI Holdings and its shareholders;

     - recommended that VSI Holdings' shareholders vote FOR the business
       combination with SPX;

     - instructed senior management, with the assistance of VSI Holdings'
       advisors, to promptly finish negotiating the transaction documents; and

     - authorized VSI Holdings' officers to execute definitive transaction
       documents upon the conclusion of satisfactory negotiations.

     
In taking the foregoing actions, VSI Holdings' board of directors
considered the factors described below under -- Reasons for the Merger.
The
board did not assign any relative or specific weights to any of those factors,
and individual directors may have given differing weights to different factors.

     
During the period of March 13 to March 23, 2001, the management and
advisors of VSI Holdings and SPX worked to finalize the transaction documents.

On March 23 and 24, 2001, VSI Holdings' management discussed the proposed merger
and transaction documents with the members of VSI Holdings' board of directors.

Effective as of March 24, 2001, the members of VSI Holdings' board of directors
executed a written consent resolution approving the proposed merger and
transaction documents.
On March 24, 2001, the parties executed the merger
agreement.
At the same time, as contemplated by the merger agreement, (1) SPX,
Mr. Toth and certain persons and entities related to him entered into the
indemnity and restriction agreement and (2) SPX, Mr. Toth and an entity
controlled by him entered into an asset purchase and merger agreement providing
for the sale of Advanced Animations, the indirect investment interests in OZ
Entertainment, VSI Holdings' interest in its corporate jet and property and
interests related to those entities.
See below -- Interests of Directors and
Officers in the Merger, -- Indemnity and Restriction Agreement, -- Asset
Purchase Agreement and -- Advanced Animations Merger Agreement.

     
On March 26, 2001, before the opening of trading of SPX common stock and
VSI Holdings common stock, the parties issued a joint news release announcing
the signing of the merger agreement and the proposed merger of VSI Holdings and
SPX.

REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     Certain matters discussed below are forward-looking statements involving
substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ
materially from targets or projected results.
Factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially include, among others, those factors described in
Risk Factors.
Many of these factors are beyond the ability of SPX or VSI
Holdings to predict or control.
We caution you not to put undue reliance on
forward-looking statements.
These statements have been made as of the date of
this proxy statement-prospectus, and you should not infer that there has been no
change in the affairs of SPX or VSI Holdings since that date that would warrant
a modification of any forward-looking statement made in this proxy
statement-prospectus.
SPX and VSI Holdings disclaim any intent or obligation to
update publicly these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise.

     VSI Holdings' Reasons for the Merger

     VSI Holdings' board of directors believes that VSI Holdings will become
more competitive and grow faster if it combines with SPX and becomes part of a
larger, more significantly diversified and capitalized entity.

     VSI Holdings' board of directors and management anticipate that being part
of a larger entity will provide VSI Holdings with a global scope and the
capabilities to more effectively meet customer demands in an industry where size
is becoming an increasingly more significant factor.
Indeed, the board and
management expect the merger to provide VSI Holdings with the potential to
undertake significantly larger, global projects not currently available to it
because of its smaller capitalization.
Consequently, VSI Holdings' board of
directors believes that, following the combination with SPX, VSI Holdings will
have the potential to realize greater long-term positive operating and financial
results than it would on a stand-alone basis.

     
During its deliberations, VSI Holdings' board of directors consulted with
management, legal and financial advisors, and considered a number of factors,
including those described in the preceding paragraph and the following:

     - the premium over the current trading price for VSI Holdings common stock
       represented by the consideration to be paid to VSI Holdings shareholders
       on a per share basis;

     - the increased liquidity to VSI Holdings' shareholders given (1) the fact
       that they may elect to receive a combination of cash and SPX common
       stock, and (2) the public ownership and significantly higher daily
       trading volume of SPX common stock;

     - the opportunity for VSI Holdings shareholders, through their receipt of
       SPX shares, to participate in a larger, more diversified entity and to
       participate in the combined company's perceived greater potential for
       growth and further enhancements of shareholder value;

     - that VSI Holdings had contacts with a number of potential bidders,
       including SPX, and that no other party expressed a greater commitment or
       was expected to yield a better acquisition value or more strategic
       benefits to VSI Holdings and its shareholders; and

     - the financial presentation of McDonald Investments to VSI Holdings' board
       of directors and the oral opinion of McDonald Investments to the effect
       that, as of March 13, 2001 and based upon the qualifications and
       assumptions made and matters considered by McDonald Investments described
       in its written opinion dated March 30, 2001, the consideration to be paid
       in the consolidation to the holders of VSI Holdings common stock is fair
       to VSI Holdings shareholders from a financial point of view.

     VSI Holdings' board of directors also considered the following factors:

     - the creative and innovative forces, and financial discipline, associated
       with SPX's management and business practices and the perceived potential
       of those practices to create further enhancements of shareholder value;

     - the role of the transaction in implementing and accelerating VSI
       Holdings' long-term external growth strategy by strengthening VSI
       Holdings' current market position within the automotive industry and the
       expectation that the merger would provide VSI Holdings with access to
       SPX's existing customer base and distribution network;

     - the financial condition, cash flows and results of operations of VSI
       Holdings and SPX, both on a historical and prospective basis and the
       ability of SPX's operations to provide significant revenue
       diversification;

     - the ability of VSI Holdings' senior managers to influence and participate
       in the management of VSI Holdings' operations in a meaningful way
       following the proposed combination with SPX; and

     - that VSI Holdings shareholders are only expected to recognize gain for
       U.S. tax purposes to the extent that they receive cash consideration.

     
In the course of its deliberations, VSI Holdings' board of directors also
considered a number of other items and factors, including the factors described
under -- Background of the Merger and the following:

     - the belief of management that a consolidation with SPX fit both VSI
       Holdings' long-term external growth strategy and the criteria for a
       strategic affiliation established by the board of directors;

     - the terms of the merger agreement regarding VSI Holdings' right to
       consider and negotiate other transaction proposals, as well as the
       possible effects of the termination fees;

     - the current and historical trading prices, values and volume of VSI
       Holdings common stock and SPX common stock, current and historical
       trading multiples of other comparable companies, and information
       regarding the value and prospects of VSI Holdings as an independent,
       stand-alone entity;

     - VSI Holdings' knowledge and review of the financial condition, results of
       operations and business prospects of SPX;

     - the terms and conditions of the merger and the representations,
       warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties and the conditions to
       their respective obligations, including the condition that VSI Holdings'
       shareholders approve the transaction; and

     - the impact of the merger on VSI Holdings' shareholders and employees.

     VSI Holdings' board of directors also identified and considered a variety
of potentially negative factors in its deliberations, including the following:

     - the risk that VSI Holdings shareholders might not realize the anticipated
       long-term and short-term benefits of the merger;

     - the restrictions that the merger agreement placed on VSI Holdings during
       the period between signing the merger agreement and closing the merger,
       including the parties' agreement to a fixed-exchange ratio for the
       consideration to be paid by SPX;

     - the difficulties and costs associated with undertaking a business
       combination and integrating the operations of two sizeable companies;

     - as described under -- Interests of Directors and Officers in the Merger
       below, and by virtue of certain indemnification rights, change of control
       arrangements, stock options, stock grants and positions to be held in the
       combined company, certain members of VSI Holdings' board of

directors and management might have interests in the merger that are different
than those of other VSI Holdings shareholders;

     - the possible distraction of management from day-to-day operations and
       possible concerns of employees regarding their employment status; and

     - the other risks described under Risk Factors above.

     VSI Holdings' board of directors believed that the potential benefit of the
merger outweighed these potentially negative factors and that the merger would
enable VSI Holdings' shareholders to realize greater value than VSI Holdings
could deliver to them alone.
Based on the consideration of these and other
relevant matters, at its meeting on March 13, 2001, VSI Holdings' board of
directors unanimously (with all directors present and no directors abstaining):

     - approved the merger with SPX;

     - determined that the merger was fair and in the best interest of VSI
       Holdings and its shareholders;

     - recommended that VSI Holdings' shareholders vote FOR the merger;

     - instructed senior management, with the assistance of VSI Holdings'
       advisors, to promptly finish negotiating the transaction documents; and

     - authorized VSI Holdings' officers to execute definitive transaction
       documents upon the conclusion of negotiations satisfactory to senior
       management.

     
The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by VSI Holdings' board
is not intended to be exhaustive, but is believed to include all material
factors that the board considered.
In reaching its decision to approve the
proposed consolidation with SPX, the board did not assign any relative or
specific weights to any of these factors, and individual directors may have
given differing weights to different factors.

     
SPX's Reasons for the Merger

     The merger with VSI Holdings complements the strategy of SPX's Service
Solutions segment.
A key component of this strategy is to provide a
comprehensive portfolio of professional services to Service Solutions' customer
base.
Historically, Service Solutions has focused on the service and maintenance
function of the transportation industry.
SPX anticipates that the merger with
VSI Holdings will allow Service Solutions to expand its customer base by
leveraging VSI Holdings' customer relationships.
VSI Holdings' capabilities in
marketing services, customer relationship management, organizational assessment
and event planning also bolster Service Solutions' existing professional
services capabilities, which are focused on information authoring, training
development and information technology.
Once the merger is finalized, SPX will
cross-market the combined professional services of VSI Holdings and Service
Solutions to new customers outside the automotive industry.
Many of the
competencies shared by Service Solutions and VSI Holdings can be applied to
industries such as pharmaceuticals, healthcare and financial services.
Finally,
the emerging competencies of VSI Holdings in areas such as e-Learning, e-CRM and
web development offer Service Solutions the opportunity to gain a presence in a
rapidly emerging set of markets.
SPX will also review VSI Holdings' business and
identify areas to reduce structural cost, improve operating efficiencies and
leverage technology.


INTERESTS OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS IN THE MERGER

     When you consider the recommendation of VSI Holdings' board of directors
that you vote in favor of the merger, you should be aware that a number of VSI
Holdings directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that
are different from, or in addition to, your interests as a shareholder.
These
interests are described below.
In each case, VSI Holdings' board of directors
was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in
approving the merger.

     
Indemnification.  
Under the merger agreement, the indemnification and
exculpation provisions contained in SPX's certificate of incorporation and
bylaws must be at least as favorable to VSI Holdings' directors and executive
officers as the indemnification and exculpation provisions contained in VSI
Holdings' articles of incorporation and bylaws.
Moreover, for a period of six
years after the completion of the merger, those provisions may not be altered in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of VSI Holdings'
directors and executive officers.
In addition, SPX has agreed:

     - to indemnify VSI Holdings' directors and executive officers against any
       liabilities arising out of the merger agreement or under the Securities
       Exchange Act; and

     - to use its best efforts to obtain and maintain in effect for a period of
       six years after the completion of the merger VSI Holdings' current
       directors' and officers' liability insurance for the present directors
       and officers of VSI Holdings, subject to limitations described in the
       merger agreement.

     
Stock options.  
The approval of the merger by the shareholders of VSI
Holdings will be a "change of control" for purposes of the stock options issued
under VSI Holdings' 1997 Independent Directors Stock Option Plan.
Consequently,
all unvested options that are issued under that plan will vest and become
exercisable prior to the merger.
As of the date of this proxy
statement-prospectus, there are a total of 60,000 unvested options issued and
outstanding under that plan, each with an exercise price of $3.25 per share.

     
The following table sets forth certain information concerning the unvested
VSI Holdings stock options currently held by each of VSI Holdings' directors and
named executive officers under the 1997 Independent Directors Stock Option Plan.

* Absent accelerated vesting, these non-qualified stock options would be subject
  to vesting in annual increments of 50% on each of May 1, 2001 and May 1, 2002.
  
These options would expire at 12:00 a.m. on May 23, 2005.

     
VSI Holdings has also granted options under its 1997 Incentive Stock Option
Plan and 1997 Nonqualified Stock Option Plan.
These plans do not provide for
accelerated vesting of the options granted under them.
Pursuant to the merger
agreement, VSI Holdings has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
agreements from the holders of all VSI Holdings stock options for the
cancellation of their options in exchange for cash and on terms specified by
SPX.
Upon completion of the merger, those VSI Holdings stock options that are
not cancelled will be adjusted and will become options to purchase shares of SPX
common stock.
The options to purchase SPX common stock that replace any unvested
VSI Holdings stock options that are neither cancelled nor subject to accelerated
vesting in connection with the merger will be unvested and will vest in
accordance with the terms of the unvested VSI Holdings stock option.
See The
Merger -- Treatment of VSI Holdings Stock Options; Restricted Stock below.

     Stock Grants.  
As a result of the merger, all unvested stock grants made
under the VSI Holdings restricted stock plan will vest and will be exchanged in
the merger for either the all stock consideration or the combination
consideration at the holder's election.
The 66,438 shares of VSI Holdings common
stock

that are the subject of those grants will be converted into merger consideration
upon completion of the merger.
None of these shares are held by directors or
named executive officers of VSI Holdings.

     
Retention and Employment Agreements.  
In connection with the merger, SPX
has entered into retention and employment agreements with 21 "key employees" of
VSI Holdings, including Steve Schultz, VSI Holdings' Executive Vice
President-Sales.
Those agreements will only become effective upon the completion
of the merger.

     
Under each agreement, the employee will agree to continue his or her
employment as an at-will employee and will receive a stated base salary and an
opportunity to earn a bonus equal to a stated percentage of his or her base
salary in accordance with SPX's Economic Value Added Incentive Compensation
Plan.
Many of these key employees will also be eligible to receive SPX stock
options under the SPX Stock Compensation Plan and to participate in the SPX
Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the other SPX employee benefit programs.

     
Each retention and employment agreement provides that employment may be
terminated at any time with or without cause.
Each employee will also be subject
to certain confidentiality, non-solicitation and non-competition provisions.

Each VSI Holdings employee who signs a retention and employment agreement will
also be agreeing to the cancellation of all of his or her vested and unvested
VSI Holdings stock options.

     
Repayment of Indebtedness Owed to Executive Officers.  
Pursuant to the
merger agreement, SPX has agreed to repay the indebtedness of VSI Holdings and
its subsidiaries to certain of VSI Holdings' executive officers and their
affiliates outstanding at the time the merger is completed.
The following table
sets forth certain information regarding that indebtedness as of the date of the
merger agreement.

     Other Matters.  
Steve Toth, Jr., VSI Holdings' Chairman and CEO, also has
interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to your
interests as a shareholder because he is a party to, and his interest in the
transactions contemplated by, the indemnity and restriction agreement, the asset
purchase agreement and the Advanced Animations merger agreement.
For a
description of those agreements and Mr. Toth's interests therein, you should
refer to -- Indemnity and Restriction Agreement, -- Asset Purchase Agreement and
- -- Advanced Animations Merger Agreement below.


VSI HOLDINGS BOARD APPROVAL AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE MERGER

     VSI Holdings' board of directors believes that the merger agreement is fair
to, and in the best interests of, VSI Holdings and its shareholders.
It has
unanimously adopted the merger and recommends that VSI Holdings shareholders
vote for its approval.


THE MERGER; EFFECTIVE TIME

     The merger agreement provides that upon completion of the merger, VSI
Holdings will merge with and into SPX.
SPX will be the surviving corporation in
the merger and will continue its corporate existence under Delaware law.
The
corporate existence of VSI Holdings will cease as a result of the merger.
On the
closing date of the merger, SPX and VSI Holdings will file certificates of
merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and the Georgia Secretary of State.

The merger will be effective at the time of the filing of the certificates of
merger.


MERGER CONSIDERATION

     Upon completion of the merger and subject to the limitations and proration
procedure as described below, the outstanding shares of VSI Holdings common
stock held by each VSI Holdings shareholder will be automatically canceled and
converted into the right to receive one of the following forms of consideration
(determined as of the effective time of the merger):

     - stock consideration equal to 0.043 shares of SPX common stock for each
       share of VSI Holdings common stock held by the VSI Holdings shareholder;
       or

     - a combination of cash consideration in the form of a cash payment equal
       to $4.35 per share for 45% of the shares of VSI Holdings common stock
       held by the VSI Holdings shareholder and stock consideration equal to
       0.043 shares of SPX common stock for the remaining 55% of the shares of
       VSI Holdings common stock held by the shareholder.


ELECTION OF FORM OF CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OF SHARES

     Using the enclosed form of election and letter of transmittal, you may
specify whether you would like to have your shares of VSI Holdings common stock
converted into the right to receive the all stock consideration, or a
combination of cash and stock consideration.
The number of shares of VSI
Holdings common stock converted to the right to receive cash consideration in
accordance with the combination cash and stock election may be adjusted in order
to preserve the intended tax-free nature of the transaction as described below.

     
THE FORM OF ELECTION AND LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL MUST BE RETURNED TO
EQUISERVE TRUST COMPANY, N.A., THE EXCHANGE AGENT, BY THE ELECTION DEADLINE,
WHICH WILL BE 5:00 P.M. EASTERN DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME           , 2001 (OR, IF
THE MEETING OF VSI HOLDINGS SHAREHOLDERS TO APPROVE THE MERGER IS POSTPONED, TWO
BUSINESS DAYS BEFORE THE DATE OF THE MEETING).
Any shares of VSI Holdings common
stock held by VSI Holdings shareholders who did not return the election form
before that time will automatically be converted into the right to receive the
all stock consideration.

     
At the effective time of the merger, VSI Holdings common stock will
automatically convert into the right to receive the merger consideration.
If you
elect the all stock consideration, each share of VSI Holdings common stock that
you hold will be converted into the right to receive the stock consideration of
0.043 shares of SPX common stock.
If you elect a combination of cash and stock
consideration, each share of VSI Holdings common stock that you hold will be
converted into a combination of cash and SPX common stock.

     
If you elect the combination consideration and there is no need to adjust
the proportion of cash and SPX common stock in the combination consideration,
then 45% of your VSI Holdings shares will be converted to cash at the rate of
$4.35 per share and 55% of your VSI Holdings shares will be converted to SPX
common stock at the rate of 0.043 SPX shares for each VSI Holdings share.

However, the merger agreement permits SPX to reduce the amount of cash and
increase the amount of SPX stock paid to VSI Holdings shareholders electing the
combination consideration if the sum of the cash to be paid by SPX upon
conversion of VSI Holdings shares that VSI Holdings shareholders elect to
convert to cash plus the amount of related party debt of VSI Holdings to be
assumed by SPX is greater than the non-stock consideration permitted under
Section 3.02 of Rev. Proc. 77-37, 1977-2 C.B. 568.

     
In Rev. Proc. 77-37, 1977-2, C.B. 568, the Internal Revenue Service has set
forth its guidelines for determining whether the Internal Revenue Service will
issue a ruling as to the tax consequences of a corporate reorganization.
Section
3.02 of Rev. Proc. 77-37 states that the "continuity of interest" requirement,
which must be satisfied in order for a merger to qualify as a reorganization for
purposes of Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
will be satisfied for purposes of issuing a ruling if, as of the effective date
of a merger, at least 50% of the value of all of the formerly outstanding stock
of a target company is exchanged for stock of the acquiring company.
Thus,
Section 3.02 of Rev. Proc. 77-37 permits no more than 50% of the total
consideration paid by an acquiring corporation

in a merger to be in the form of cash consideration.
For this purpose, the cash
consideration paid by SPX in the merger will include:

     - any cash paid by SPX upon conversion of VSI Holdings shares;

     - any cash paid for fractional shares; and

     - the amount of related party debt of VSI Holdings assumed by SPX.

     
The total consideration paid by SPX will equal the cash consideration plus
the aggregate value, as of the closing date, of all SPX shares issued upon
conversion of VSI Holdings shares.

     
If the cash consideration to be paid by SPX would exceed 50% of the total
consideration to be paid by SPX, then SPX will, on a pro rata basis among VSI
Holdings shareholders electing the combination consideration, reduce the
proportion of VSI Holdings shares converted to cash and increase the proportion
of VSI Holdings shares converted to SPX shares to the extent necessary to cause
the cash consideration to equal 50% of the total consideration paid by SPX.

     
As of April 16, 2001, the amount of VSI Holdings related party debt to be
assumed by SPX is $11,805,396.
Based on this amount and assuming a per share
market price for SPX common stock on the closing date of $92.00, if all VSI
Holdings shareholders elect the combination consideration and if all holders of
VSI Holdings options with an exercise price less than $4.35 exercise those
options prior to the effective time of the merger, the percentage of VSI
Holdings shares that are actually converted to cash will be reduced from 45% to
43.394% and the percentage converted to SPX shares will be increased from 55% to
56.606%.
To the extent that the price of SPX common stock on the closing date is
higher or lower than $92.00 and to the extent that the amount of VSI Holdings
related party debt assumed by SPX is more or less than $11,805,396, the
adjustment required, if any, to the proportion between cash consideration and
stock consideration paid to VSI Holdings shareholders electing the combination
consideration will be affected.


EXCHANGE AGENT; PROCEDURES FOR EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; FRACTIONAL SHARES

     Immediately prior to the completion of the merger, SPX will deposit all of
the merger consideration with the exchange agent, who will distribute it to VSI
Holdings shareholders.
Pursuant to the merger agreement, SPX has appointed
EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. to act as exchange agent for the merger.

     
In addition to allowing you to elect between the all stock consideration
and the combination cash and stock consideration, the form of election and
letter of transmittal contains instructions on how to surrender VSI Holdings
stock certificates to the exchange agent and receive the merger consideration.

Upon completion of the merger, each certificate that previously represented
shares of VSI Holdings common stock will represent only the right to receive the
merger consideration into which the shares of VSI Holdings common stock were
converted in the merger and any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of SPX
common stock.
After a holder surrenders his or her certificates, any unpaid
dividends and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of SPX common stock payable
as described below will be paid to the holder without interest.

     
VSI Holdings shareholders will not receive interest on any cash
consideration they receive.
No dividend or distribution with respect to shares
of SPX common stock will be payable on or with respect to any fractional share,
and fractional share interests will not entitle their owners to vote or to any
other rights of an SPX stockholder.
In lieu of any fractional share of SPX
common stock, SPX will pay to each former VSI Holdings shareholder who otherwise
would be entitled to receive a fractional share of SPX common stock an amount in
cash equal to $101.17 multiplied by the fractional share of VSI Holdings common
stock to which the holder would otherwise be entitled.
SPX will not pay declared
dividends or distributions to persons entitled to receive certificates for
shares of SPX common stock until they surrender their VSI Holdings stock
certificates for SPX common stock, at which time SPX will pay the dividends or
distributions.
In no event will the persons entitled to receive these dividends
be entitled to interest on them.


TREATMENT OF VSI HOLDINGS STOCK OPTIONS; RESTRICTED STOCK

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, VSI Holdings has agreed to use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain agreements from the holders of VSI Holdings
stock options for the cancellation of those options in exchange for cash and on
terms specified by SPX.
Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding and
unexercised option to purchase VSI Holdings' common stock, whether vested or
unvested, will be automatically converted into an option to purchase a number of
shares of SPX common stock equal to the number of shares of VSI Holdings common
stock covered under the VSI Holdings stock option multiplied by 0.043 at a per
share price equal to the exercise price specified in the VSI Holdings stock
option divided by 0.043.
Each newly issued SPX stock option will contain terms
that are substantially similar to those governing the original VSI Holdings
stock option.

     
Any unvested restricted shares of VSI Holdings common stock awarded to
employees, directors or consultants pursuant to any of VSI Holdings' plans or
arrangements and outstanding at the effective time of the merger will become
fully vested and treated as outstanding shares of VSI Holdings common stock.
If
you hold VSI Holdings restricted stock, it will be included in the election you
make on the form of election.

     
SPX will file any required registration statements (on Form S-8 or other
appropriate form) with respect to each VSI Holdings stock option converted into
an SPX stock option as well as the shares of SPX common stock underlying the
option.
SPX will keep the registration statements current as long as the options
remain outstanding.


GOVERNANCE FOLLOWING THE MERGER

     After the merger is completed, the directors and officers of SPX will
remain the directors and officers of SPX until their successors are duly
elected, appointed or qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of
SPX.

     
Upon completion of the merger, SPX's certificate of incorporation and
bylaws will remain unchanged and will constitute the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation.

       were made on that date, unless they were originally stated to be true as

       on that date, unless their failure to be true would not reasonably have a
       material adverse effect on the other party; and

     - the other party has performed all obligations and complied with all
       covenants required by the merger agreement in all material respects.

     
VSI Holdings also has the right not to complete the merger if:

REGULATORY APPROVALS

SPX and VSI Holdings may not complete the merger until:

     - notifications are given to the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust
       Division of the United States Department of Justice;

In connection with the merger, on April 9, 2001, VSI Holdings filed and, on
April 10, 2001, SPX filed a Pre-Merger Notification and Report Form under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust
Division of the United States Justice Department.
At any time before or after
the merger, the Antitrust Division or the Federal Trade Commission could, among
other things, seek

to enjoin the completion of the merger or seek the divestiture of substantial
assets of SPX or VSI Holdings.
Although SPX and VSI Holdings believe that the
merger is legal under the United States antitrust laws, there can be no
assurance that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made
or, if a challenge is made, that it would not be successful.


TERMINATION OF THE MERGER

     SPX and VSI Holdings may agree to terminate the merger agreement at any
time.
In addition, either party may terminate the merger agreement, whether
before or after approval by the VSI Holdings shareholders, if:

     - the merger is not completed by June 30, 2001, subject to an extension by
       SPX or VSI Holdings:

             (1) to a date not later than July 30, 2001 in order to cure a
        breach of a representation, warranty or covenant, obtain the opinion of
        tax counsel regarding the treatment of the merger for federal income tax
        purposes, or to call and hold the meeting of VSI Holdings shareholders,
        or

             (2) to a date not later than August 31, 2001, in the event this
        prospectus-proxy statement has not been declared effective in time to
        hold the meeting of VSI Holdings shareholders on or prior to June 30,
        2001;

     - VSI Holdings shareholders do not approve the merger agreement at the
       meeting called to vote on the merger proposal;

     - a law or regulation makes the merger illegal, or any order of injunction
       permanently prohibits the merger; or

     - the other party breaches, in any material respect, its representations,
       warranties or covenants, the breach constitutes a material adverse effect
       on the other party and the breach is not reasonably cured by the
       applicable closing deadline.

     
VSI Holdings may terminate the merger agreement if, prior to approval of
the merger agreement by VSI Holdings' shareholders, VSI Holdings' board of
directors determines in good faith, with the advice of its independent financial
advisors, that it has received a takeover proposal from another party that
constitutes a superior transaction to the transaction with SPX.

     
SPX may terminate the merger agreement if VSI Holdings' board of directors:

     - withdraws or modifies, or resolves to withdraw or modify, in a manner
       adverse to SPX, its approval of the merger agreement or recommendation
       that VSI Holdings shareholders vote in favor of the merger agreement;

     - approves or recommends, or resolves to approve or recommend, to VSI
       Holdings shareholders a takeover proposal from another party that
       constitutes a superior transaction to the transaction with SPX; or

     - does not call, or resolves not to call, the special meeting of VSI
       Holdings shareholders within a reasonable time after the SEC declares the
       registration statement effective.


EFFECT OF TERMINATION

     VSI Holdings will be required to pay SPX a fee of $9 million in the event
the merger agreement is terminated:

     - due to VSI Holdings' failure to obtain shareholder approval at the
       meeting called for that purpose;

     - by SPX if the only reason that the merger has not been completed is due
       to VSI Holdings' failure to obtain the previously mentioned opinion of
       counsel regarding the effect of the reorganization for federal income tax
       purposes where SPX has obtained a letter from nationally recognized tax
       counsel stating that it would execute and deliver the opinion on behalf
       of VSI Holdings, SPX has

       delivered the opinion of its own tax counsel to VSI Holdings, and SPX and
       VSI Holdings have delivered the tax representations certificates required
       of them; or

     - by SPX as a result of a breach by VSI Holdings in any material respect of
       any of its representations, warranties or covenants under the merger
       agreement, if (1) the breach constitutes a VSI Holdings material adverse
       effect, as defined in the merger agreement, and (2) SPX has given written
       notice to VSI Holdings of the breach promptly after learning of it and
       VSI Holdings has not reasonably cured the breach on or prior to the
       applicable closing deadline.

     
In addition, VSI Holdings will be required to pay the fee in the event
that:

     - after the date of the merger agreement and prior to the termination of
       the merger agreement a third party makes known to VSI Holdings a bona
       fide takeover proposal, as defined in the merger agreement, makes a
       takeover proposal directly to VSI Holdings' shareholders or publicly
       announces its intention (whether conditional or unconditional) to make a
       takeover proposal, and thereafter:

             (1) SPX terminates the merger agreement after the VSI Holdings
        board of directors has withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to SPX
        the board's approval or recommendation of the approval of the merger
        agreement by the VSI Holdings shareholders or approves or recommends a
        superior transaction (as defined in the merger agreement); or

             (2) VSI Holdings terminates the merger agreement if, prior to the
        approval of the merger agreement by the VSI Holdings shareholders, the
        VSI Holdings board of directors determines in good faith by majority
        vote, with respect to any takeover proposal received by VSI Holdings
        after the date of the merger agreement that it constitutes a superior
        transaction (as defined in the merger agreement) and is in the best
        interest of VSI Holdings and its shareholders and the board of directors
        of VSI Holdings has received the advice of McDonald Investments as to
        whether the takeover proposal constitutes a superior transaction.

     
The fee is intended to compensate SPX for fees and expenses that it
incurred prior to termination, the preparation of the agreement and the
transaction contemplated by the agreement.
In addition, if the merger agreement
is terminated, SPX may not hire or solicit for employment any officer or key
management employee of VSI Holdings.

     
VSI Holdings will not be liable for any breach or breaches of any
representation, warranty or covenant unless SPX terminates the merger agreement
as a result of the breach or breaches.
Furthermore, any liability of VSI
Holdings for breaches of representations and warranties will be limited to the
lesser of the actual damages incurred by SPX as a direct result of the breaches
or $9 million.
In the case of any breaches of covenants by VSI Holdings, VSI
Holdings' liability will be limited to payment of the $9 million termination
fee.

     
SPX will not be liable for any breach or breaches of any representation,
warranty or covenant unless VSI Holdings terminates the merger agreement as a
result of the breach or breaches.
Furthermore, any liability of SPX for breaches
of representations, warranties or covenants will be limited to the lesser of the
actual damages incurred by VSI Holdings as a direct result of the breaches or $9
million, except in the case of willful breaches of material covenants that
result in the merger not closing, in which case this limit will not apply.


INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE

     Under the merger agreement, SPX has agreed to indemnify the current and
former officers, directors, agents and employees of VSI Holdings and its
subsidiaries (other than Advanced Animations) for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the effective time of the merger.
SPX has further agreed that the
indemnification and exculpation provisions in the SPX certificate of
incorporation and bylaws will be at least as favorable to those persons as the
provisions currently applicable to them and will not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years after the merger in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of these individuals.

     
The merger agreement also provides that, for six years after the effective
time of the merger, SPX will obtain and maintain liability insurance covering
acts or omissions occurring prior to the effective time of the merger for those
persons who were covered by VSI Holdings' directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy.
These policies will continue under the same terms and in
amounts no less favorable than those in effect on the date of the merger
agreement.
SPX, however, will not be required to pay more than 300% of the
amount paid by VSI Holdings in 2000 to maintain that insurance, and, in the
event that the annual premiums exceed 300%, SPX will obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding that amount.


INDEMNITY AND RESTRICTION AGREEMENT

     Contemporaneously with the execution of the merger agreement, Steve Toth,
Jr., individually, as well as several entities owned and/or controlled by Mr.
Toth, his wife and their daughter executed and delivered to SPX an indemnity and
restriction agreement.
The agreement is attached to this proxy
statement-prospectus as Appendix B, and we urge you to read it carefully.
Mr.
Toth is the Chairman and CEO of VSI Holdings and is the beneficial owner, or is
deemed to share control, of approximately 27,905,755 shares of VSI Holdings
common stock.
In the indemnity and restriction agreement, Mr. Toth agreed to pay
or reimburse SPX for certain losses, fees and expenses related to certain
specifically enumerated matters, as more particularly set forth in the
agreement.
In addition, Mr. Toth agreed to pay all legal fees and expenses
(including investment banking fees) that VSI Holdings incurs in connection with
the merger in excess of $1.5 million.
To secure Mr. Toth's indemnification
obligations, Mr. Toth agreed to escrow 64,248 shares of SPX common stock that he
will receive as stock consideration for the merger.
After one year, the escrow
agent will release to Mr. Toth the lesser of 32,124 shares and the amount
obtained by subtracting the number of shares representing the value of contested
claims, if any, plus any other fees and expenses to be reimbursed by Toth under
the indemnity and restriction agreement from 32,124 shares.
After two years, the
escrow agent will release the balance of the pledged stock less any claimed
amounts.
Mr. Toth and the entities that signed the agreement also agreed that
they would not, in any 90-day period and for a period of one year from the date
of the agreement, sell, transfer or dispose of 25% or more of the aggregate
shares of SPX common stock that they receive in the merger.
Finally, Mr. Toth
agreed not to compete with SPX or solicit employees or customers of SPX for a
five-year period.


OPINION OF VSI HOLDINGS' FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     Introduction

     VSI Holdings asked McDonald Investments to render an opinion to VSI
Holdings' board as to the fairness to VSI Holdings' shareholders of the merger
consideration from a financial point of view.
On March 13, 2001, McDonald
Investments delivered its oral opinion that, as of that date and based upon and
subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications contained in its
opinion, the merger consideration was fair to VSI Holdings' shareholders from a
financial point of view.

VSI Holdings retained McDonald Investments to serve as an advisor to its
board and not as an advisor to or agent of any of VSI Holdings' shareholders.

McDonald Investments prepared its opinion for VSI Holdings' board, and that
opinion is directed only to the fairness of the merger consideration to VSI
Holdings' shareholders from a financial point of view.
McDonald Investments'
opinion does not address the merits of VSI Holdings' decision to engage in the
merger or other business strategies considered by VSI Holdings' board, nor does
it address the board's decision to proceed with the merger.
McDonald

Investments' opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any VSI Holdings
shareholder as to how that shareholder should vote at VSI Holdings' special
meeting of shareholders.

     
VSI Holdings retained McDonald Investments solely to render the fairness
opinion.
McDonald Investments did not participate in the negotiations between
the parties regarding the merger consideration.
VSI Holdings imposed no
restrictions or limitations on McDonald Investments with respect to the
investigations made or the procedures followed by McDonald Investments in

       trading markets for certain of those other companies' securities; and

     - publicly available information about the nature and terms of other
       business combination transactions that McDonald Investments considered
       relevant to its analysis of this transaction.


McDonald Investments also met with officers and employees of VSI Holdings to
discuss VSI Holdings' business and prospects and other matters that McDonald
Investments believed were relevant.

     
You should note that in rendering its opinion, McDonald Investments relied
upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and other information
provided to it or publicly available.
McDonald Investments also assumed and
relied upon the accuracy of representations and warranties of VSI Holdings and
SPX contained in the merger agreement.
McDonald Investments was not engaged to
verify, and did not independently attempt to verify, any of the information.

McDonald Investments also relied upon VSI Holdings' management as to the
reasonableness and achievability of the financial and operating projections, as
well as the assumptions and bases for those projections, and assumed that they
reflected the best currently available estimates and judgment of VSI Holdings'
management.
VSI Holdings did not engage McDonald Investments to assess the
reasonableness or achievability of those projections or the assumptions
underlying them and expressed no view on those matters.
McDonald Investments did
not conduct a physical inspection or appraisal of any of the assets, properties
or facilities of either VSI Holdings or SPX, nor was it furnished with any
evaluation or appraisal of those assets, properties or facilities.
McDonald
Investments also assumed that the conditions to the merger in the merger
agreement would be satisfied and that the merger would be completed on a timely
basis in the manner contemplated by the merger agreement.

     
McDonald Investments' opinion is based on economic and market conditions
and other circumstances existing on the date of its opinion.
McDonald
Investments' opinion does not address any matters subsequent to its date,
including the value of SPX's common stock when it is issued to VSI Holdings'
shareholders.
McDonald Investments' opinion is limited to the fairness, as of
the date of the opinion, from a financial point of view of the merger
consideration and does not address VSI Holdings' underlying business decision to
effect the merger or any other terms of the merger.

     
You should understand that, although subsequent developments may affect its
opinion, McDonald Investments does not have to update, revise or reaffirm its
opinion.

     
McDonald Investments' Analysis

     McDonald Investments developed several analyses to evaluate the merger
consideration.
These were a leveraged buyout analysis, a discounted cash flow
analysis, a comparable public company analysis and a comparable merger and
acquisition analysis.
The following is a brief summary of the analyses performed
by McDonald Investments to arrive at its opinion.
The results determined from
any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual values or
predictive of future results or values and are inherently subject to substantial
uncertainty.

     
Leveraged Buyout Analysis.  
McDonald Investments performed a leveraged
buyout analysis to determine the price a hypothetical financial buyer could
afford to pay under prevailing market conditions.
For purposes of this analysis,
McDonald Investments used VSI Holdings' results for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2000 and management's financial projections for fiscal years 2001
through 2005.
McDonald Investments based this analysis on the following
assumptions:

     -  a market rate of interest on revolving debt of 8.0%, a market rate of
        return on senior term debt of 8.0% and a market rate of return on
        subordinated debt of 12.0%;

     -  maximum senior debt determined by the current market conditions for
        asset based loans;

     -  expected internal rate of return of 29.8% for the equity investor; and

     -  expected internal rate of return of 20.0% for the subordinated debt
        lender.

     
This methodology implied a valuation of between $1.93 and $2.52 per share,
as compared to the $4.35 per share merger consideration.

     
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.  
McDonald Investments performed a discounted
cash flow analysis to calculate VSI Holdings' implied present value per share
based on management's projections for fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year 2005.

Using this information, McDonald Investments calculated the free cash flows VSI
Holdings could generate through fiscal year 2005.
McDonald Investments also
calculated an estimated terminal value for VSI Holdings at the end of 2005 based
on a terminal multiple of 6.5 times earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA.
These future cash flows and terminal
value were discounted using a discount rate of 15.1%.
In deriving the discount
rate, McDonald Investments calculated a weighted average cost of capital for VSI
Holdings utilizing the capital asset pricing model.
The sum of the present value
of the free cash flows and terminal values less outstanding debt plus existing
cash yielded implied prices per share ranging from $2.67 per share to $3.57 per
share, as compared to the merger consideration of $4.35 per share.

     
Inherent in any discounted cash flow valuation are the use of a number of
assumptions, including the accuracy of management's projections, and the
subjective determination of an appropriate terminal value and discount rate to
apply to the projected cash flows of the entity under examination.
Variations in
any of these assumptions or judgments could significantly alter the results of a
discounted cash flow analysis.

     
Comparable Public Company Analysis.  
McDonald Investments' comparable
public company analysis involves an analysis of publicly traded companies that
it considered to be comparable to VSI Holdings with regard to industry,
operations, performance and/or markets served.
This analysis is based on the
theory that the market value of a company can be estimated by deriving market
multiples from publicly traded companies that relate their stock prices to
earnings, cash flows or other measures of the target company.
No company used as
a comparison in this analysis is identical to VSI Holdings.

     
McDonald Investments selected public companies that, in its estimation,
were reasonably similar in scope of operations to VSI Holdings.
The companies
selected were TeleTech Holdings, Inc., APAC Customer Services, Inc., SITEL
Corp., Aegis Communications Group, Boron, LePore & Associates, Inc., RMH
Teleservices, Inc., Access Worldwide Communications, Inc. and Innotrac
Corporation.
This group includes companies with market values of between $9.1
million and $926.5 million.

     
The data and ratios McDonald Investments compared included, among other
things:

     -  enterprise value to latest twelve months sales;

     -  enterprise value to latest twelve months EBITDA;

     -  enterprise value to latest twelve months EBIT;

     -  market value to book value;

     -  current stock price to earnings per share for the latest twelve months;

     -  current stock price to estimated earnings per share for fiscal 2001;

     -  current stock price to estimated earnings per share for fiscal 2002; and

     -  current stock price to estimated earnings growth for fiscal 2002.

     
Enterprise value is defined as market value, plus the book value of debt,
less cash and cash equivalents.
Market value is defined as current stock price
multiplied by outstanding shares.
McDonald Investments applied the valuation
multiples, reflecting the average and median multiples of the comparable
companies.
The table below illustrates the range of valuation multiples, as well
as the average and median multiples, for the comparable group resulting from
this analysis.
It also shows the valuation multiples for VSI Holdings implied by
the merger consideration.

This method implied a valuation of between $2.67 and $3.27 per share, as
compared to the merger consideration of $4.35 per share.

     
Comparable Merger and Acquisition Analysis.  
McDonald Investments analyzed
information related to seven selected merger and acquisition transactions for
which public information was available.
They conducted this analysis to
determine relevant valuation multiples for transactions considered similar to
the merger.
No transaction used as a comparison in this analysis is identical to
the merger.
McDonald Investments identified transactions of companies and
industries related to VSI Holdings, including marketing and advertising
companies that utilize in-person, telephonic and on-line means to provide
services to their customers.
After reviewing the transactions where financial
information was available, McDonald Investments applied the median transaction
multiples resulting from this analysis to VSI Holdings' latest twelve months
sales, EBIT and EBITDA figures to derive an implied valuation for VSI Holdings.

This methodology implied a valuation of between $4.46 and $5.65 per share, as
compared to the merger consideration of $4.35 per share.

     Conclusion

     This summary describes the principal elements of McDonald Investments'
presentation to VSI Holdings' board on March 13, 2001 and its written opinion
dated March 30, 2001.
The preparation of a fairness opinion involves various
determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial
analysis and the application of these methods to the particular circumstances.
A
fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description.
Each of the
analyses conducted by McDonald Investments was carried out to provide a
different perspective on the transaction and add to the total mix of information
available.
McDonald Investments did not form a conclusion as to whether any
individual analysis, considered in isolation, supported or failed to support an
opinion as to fairness from a financial point of view.
Rather, in reaching its
conclusion, McDonald Investments considered the results of the analyses in light
of each other and ultimately reached its opinion based upon the results of all
analyses taken as a whole.
McDonald Investments did not place particular
reliance or weight on any individual analysis, but instead concluded that its
analyses, taken as a whole, supported its determination.
Accordingly,
notwithstanding the separate factors summarized above, McDonald Investments
believes that you must consider its analyses as a whole and that selecting
portions of its analysis and the factors considered by it, without considering
all analyses and factors, could create an incomplete or misleading view of the
evaluation process underlying its opinion.
In performing its analyses, McDonald
Investments made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance,
business and economic conditions and other matters.
The analyses performed by
McDonald Investments are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future
results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by
those analyses.

     
Engagement Letter.  
Under the terms of an engagement letter dated January
16, 2001, VSI Holdings agreed to pay McDonald Investments a fee for its services
in rendering its fairness opinion of $350,000 upon oral delivery of a fairness
opinion to VSI Holdings' board, provided, however, that if the merger agreement
was not executed prior to March 15, 2001, the amount of McDonald Investments'
fee for rendering its opinion would be increased by $150,000, and if the merger
agreement had not been executed prior to May 15, 2001, McDonald Investments' fee
for rendering its opinion would have been increased by an additional $150,000.

VSI Holdings has also agreed to reimburse McDonald Investments promptly for all
out-of-pocket expenses, including the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses
of counsel, incurred by McDonald Investments in connection with its engagement,
whether or not the merger is consummated, and to indemnify McDonald Investments
and related persons against liabilities in connection with its engagement,
including liabilities under federal securities laws.
The terms of the fee
arrangement with McDonald Investments were negotiated at arm's-length between
VSI Holdings and McDonald Investments.

     
In the ordinary course of business, McDonald Investments may actively trade
the securities of VSI Holdings and SPX for its own account and for the accounts
of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position
in those securities.

     
McDonald Investments, as part of its investment banking services, is
regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection
with mergers, acquisitions, underwritings, sales and distributions of listed and
unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other
purposes.
VSI Holdings selected McDonald Investments based on its experience in
transactions similar to the merger and its reputation in the retail and
investment communities.


NO DISSENTERS' RIGHTS

     Under Georgia law, VSI Holdings shareholders are not entitled to
dissenters' rights of appraisal in connection with the merger.


ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     SPX will account for the merger using the purchase method of accounting.


CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

     The following discussion of federal income tax consequences is for general
information only and is based on existing law as of the date of this proxy
statement-prospectus.
We urge VSI Holdings shareholders to consult their tax
advisors to determine the particular tax consequences to them of the merger,
including the applicability and effect of federal, state, local, foreign and
other tax laws.

     
The following summary, based upon current law, is a general discussion of
certain material federal income tax consequences of the merger to SPX, VSI
Holdings and VSI Holdings shareholders and assumes that the merger is
consummated as described in this proxy statement-prospectus.
This summary is
based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, applicable Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder, and administrative rulings and judicial
authority, all as of the date of this proxy statement-prospectus, and all of
which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.
Any change could
affect the continuing validity of this summary.
This summary applies to VSI
Holdings shareholders who hold their VSI Holdings common stock as capital
assets.
It does not discuss all aspects of income taxation that a particular VSI
Holdings shareholder may find relevant in light of his or her specific
circumstances, or in light of special treatment that he or she might be subject
to under the federal income tax laws (for example, foreign persons, dealers in
securities, banks and other financial institutions, insurance companies,
tax-exempt organizations, and shareholders who acquired their VSI Holdings
common stock pursuant to the exercise of options or otherwise as compensation or
through a tax-qualified retirement plan).
In addition, this summary does not
discuss any aspect of state, local, foreign or other tax laws.

     
Neither SPX nor VSI Holdings has sought, and neither SPX nor VSI Holdings
intends to seek, a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service as to the
anticipated tax consequences of the merger.
Gardner, Carton & Douglas, counsel
to SPX, has advised SPX, and Miller, Canfield, Paddock and Stone, P.L.C.,
counsel to VSI Holdings, has advised VSI Holdings, that, assuming the merger is
consummated as contemplated in this proxy statement-prospectus, the material
U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to SPX, VSI Holdings and VSI
Holdings shareholders are described below.

     
The Merger.  
It is a condition to the consummation of the merger that SPX
receive an opinion of its counsel, Gardner, Carton & Douglas, and that VSI
Holdings receive an opinion of its counsel, Miller, Canfield, Paddock and Stone,
P.L.C., that the merger will qualify as a reorganization for federal income tax
purposes within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.
The
opinions of Gardner, Carton & Douglas and Miller, Canfield, Paddock and Stone,
P.L.C. will be expressly based upon the accuracy of certain assumptions and the
truth and accuracy of certain representations contained in the merger agreement
or made to them by SPX and VSI Holdings.
As a reorganization for federal income
tax purposes within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code,
it is the opinion of counsel to VSI Holdings that the merger will result in the
following general federal income tax consequences to VSI Holdings and its
shareholders:

          1.
VSI Holdings will be a party to a reorganization within the meaning
     of Section 368(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.

          
2. VSI Holdings will recognize neither gain nor loss solely as a
     result of the consummation of the merger.

          
3. VSI Holdings shareholders who receive solely SPX common stock in
     exchange for their VSI Holdings common stock in the merger will not
     recognize any gain or loss pursuant to Section 354 of the Internal Revenue
     Code, except that those VSI Holdings shareholders may recognize gain to the
     extent cash is received in lieu of fractional share interests in SPX common
     stock.

          
4. VSI Holdings shareholders who receive SPX common stock and cash in
     exchange for their VSI Holdings common stock in the merger will recognize
     any gain that is realized by them under the applicable rules of the
     Internal Revenue Code to the extent of the cash received by them in the
     merger in accordance with the rules of Section 356 of the Internal Revenue
     Code.

          
5.
The tax basis of the SPX common stock received by each VSI Holdings
     shareholder who exchanges his or her VSI Holdings common stock solely for
     SPX common stock in the merger will be the same as the tax basis of the
     shares of VSI Holdings common stock surrendered in exchange therefor
     (reduced by any amount allocable to a fractional share interest for which
     cash is received).

          
6.
The tax basis of the SPX common stock received by each VSI Holdings
     shareholder who exchanges his or her VSI Holdings common stock for SPX
     common stock and cash in the merger will be the same as the tax basis of
     the shares of VSI Holdings common stock surrendered in exchange therefor,
     reduced by the amount of any cash received and increased by the amount of
     any gain recognized on the exchange.

          
7. Provided that the VSI Holdings common stock is held as a capital
     asset on the date of the exchange, the holding period of SPX common stock
     received by a VSI Holdings shareholder tax free in the merger will include
     the period during which the VSI Holdings shareholder held the VSI Holdings
     common stock exchanged therefor.

          
8.
As to each VSI Holdings shareholder who exchanges his or her shares
     of VSI Holdings common stock solely for shares of SPX common stock in the
     merger, the cash received by that VSI Holdings shareholder in lieu of a
     fractional share interest of SPX common stock will be treated as having
     been received as a distribution in full payment in exchange for the
     fractional share interest of SPX common stock that the VSI Holdings
     shareholder would otherwise be entitled to receive and will qualify as
     capital gain or loss (assuming the shares of VSI Holdings common stock were
     a capital asset in that VSI Holdings shareholder's hands at the time the
     merger is completed), provided that the cash payment for fractional shares
     (a) will not constitute separately bargained for consideration, and (b)
     will not exceed 5% of the total consideration received by the VSI Holdings
     shareholders in the merger.

     
As a reorganization for federal income tax purposes within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, it is the opinion of counsel to SPX
that the merger will result in the following general federal income tax
consequences to SPX:

          1.
SPX will be a "party to a reorganization" within the meaning of
     Section 368(b) of the Internal Revenue Code;

          2.
No gain or loss will be recognized by SPX in the merger pursuant to
     Section 1032 of the Internal Revenue Code; and

          3.
SPX's basis in the assets acquired from VSI Holdings will be the
     same as the basis of the assets in the hands of VSI Holdings immediately
     before the merger increased by any gain recognized by VSI Holdings in the
     merger pursuant to Section 362(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, and the
     holding period of the assets acquired by SPX will include the holding
     period thereof when held by VSI Holdings immediately before the merger
     pursuant to Section 1223(2) of the Internal Revenue Code.

     
Other Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.  
Generally, gain
recognized by a shareholder of VSI Holdings as described in paragraph 4 above,
will be capital gain, provided that the exchange of VSI Holdings common stock
for SPX common stock does not have the effect of a distribution of a dividend
under the rules of Section 356 of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to the
shareholder.
This capital gain would be long-term capital gain if the
shareholder has held the stock for more than 12 months.
However, because this is
dependent upon individual circumstances, counsel has declined to give an opinion
on this matter.
Therefore, VSI Holdings shareholders who elect the combination
consideration should consult their tax advisors to determine the character of
any gain that they recognize as a result of the merger.

     
Although it is the opinion of counsel that neither VSI Holdings nor SPX
will recognize gain or loss solely as a result of the consummation of the
merger, other transactions described elsewhere in this proxy

statement-prospectus, including the transactions contemplated in the asset
purchase agreement and the Advanced Animations merger agreement, will be taxable
transactions.

     
Backup Withholding.  
To prevent "backup withholding" of federal income tax
on any payments of cash to a VSI Holdings shareholder in the merger, a VSI
Holdings shareholder must, unless an exception applies under the applicable law
and regulations, provide the payor of the cash with his or her correct taxpayer
identification number on a Substitute Form W-9 and certify under penalties of
perjury that the number is correct and that he or she is not subject to backup
withholding.
The form of election and letter of transmittal mailed to VSI
Holdings shareholders will include a Substitute Form W-9.
If the VSI Holdings
shareholder does not provide the correct taxpayer identification number and
certifications, a $50 penalty may be imposed on him or her by the Internal
Revenue Service, and any cash received by him or her may be subject to backup
withholding at a rate of 31%.


RESALE OF SPX COMMON STOCK ISSUED IN THE MERGER; AFFILIATES

     This proxy statement-prospectus does not cover any resales of the SPX
common stock that VSI Holdings shareholders will receive in the merger, and SPX
has not authorized anyone to use this proxy statement-prospectus in connection
with a resale.

     VSI Holdings shareholders who are not deemed to be "affiliates" of VSI
Holdings under the Securities Act at the time of VSI Holdings' special meeting
can freely transfer any SPX shares that they receive in the merger.
Affiliates
of VSI Holdings may only sell their shares in transactions permitted by Rule 145
or another applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act.
VSI Holdings' affiliates for this purpose generally include
individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
control with, VSI Holdings.
These affiliates would typically not include
shareholders who are not officers, directors or principal shareholders of VSI
Holdings.

ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT

     At the time of the execution of the merger agreement, Steve Toth, Jr. and
PII Ventures, L.L.C., an entity owned and controlled (directly and indirectly)
by Mr. Toth, entered into an asset purchase agreement with SPX.
Immediately
following the merger, PII Ventures will purchase certain assets of SPX acquired
from VSI Holdings in accordance with the merger.
Mr. Toth is the Chairman and
CEO of VSI Holdings and is the beneficial owner, or is deemed to share control,
of approximately 27,905,755 shares of VSI Holdings.
Accordingly, he is familiar
with the assets PII Ventures will purchase under the asset purchase agreement.

The assets that SPX will sell to PII Ventures consist of: (1) all of its limited
partnership interests in K.C. Investors, L.P.; (2) all of its membership
interests in Corporate Eagle Five, L.L.C.; (3) all of its stock in the OZ
Entertainment Company; and (4) the Agency of Record Marketing Agreement between
OZ Entertainment and Visual Services, Inc. PII Ventures will pay SPX $3,690,000
in cash.
SPX is selling the assets to PII Ventures on an "as is, where is"
basis, without any representations, warranties or guaranties with respect to
fitness, merchantability or otherwise.
PII Ventures will assumes all liabilities
related to the assets it purchases from SPX.

     
In addition, SPX and PII Ventures have agreed to enter into a merger
agreement providing for the merger of Advanced Animations, Inc., currently a
wholly owned subsidiary of VSI Holdings, with and into PII Ventures.
PII
Ventures will pay SPX $16,750,000 in cash for Advanced Animations.
That merger
would occur simultaneously with the closing of the asset purchase.

See -- Advanced Animations Merger Agreement below.

     
The asset purchase agreement, which was the result of arm's-length
negotiations between SPX and Mr. Toth, includes representations and warranties
by SPX to PII Ventures including: corporate existence, corporate authorization
and enforceability and no conflict.
The asset purchase agreement also contains
the following representations and warranties by PII Ventures to SPX:
enforceability, no conflict and full disclosure.
These representations and
warranties will survive the closing of the sale of the assets indefinitely.

     
The obligations of SPX and PII Ventures to complete the sale of assets to
PII Ventures are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of closing conditions, as
provided in more detail in the asset purchase agreement.
In particular, SPX and
PII Ventures have the right not to consummate the sale if all of the covenants
and conditions precedent to the merger agreement have not been satisfied.

     
SPX and PII Ventures may agree to terminate the asset purchase agreement at
any time.
Either SPX or PII Ventures may terminate the agreement if the other
party fails to fulfill any of its covenants, or breaches any of its
representations and warranties.
In addition, either party may, under certain
circumstances, terminate the asset purchase agreement if the sale of the assets
is not completed within 10 days of the closing deadline for the merger
agreement.

     
Finally, SPX agreed to indemnify PII Ventures, and PII Ventures and Mr.
Toth agreed to indemnify SPX, for certain losses incurred in connection with
certain excluded liabilities and assumed liabilities, respectively, and the
breach or violation of any representation, warranty or covenant.


ADVANCED ANIMATIONS MERGER AGREEMENT

     Simultaneously with the closing of the asset purchase agreement, Advanced
Animations will be merged with and into PII Ventures.
Advanced Animations is
currently a wholly owned subsidiary of VSI Holdings, but following the merger
will be wholly owned by SPX.
As consideration for the merger, PII Ventures will
pay SPX $16,750,000 in cash.
SPX is selling Advanced Animations to PII Ventures

PENDING ACQUISITION

     On March 12, 2001, SPX announced that it had entered into an agreement for
a wholly owned subsidiary to acquire United Dominion Industries Limited.
United
Dominion is a diversified manufacturer of proprietary engineered products in
four business segments -- flow technology, machinery, specialty engineered
products, and test instrumentation.
It has annual sales of $2.4 billion and
approximately 14,000 employees in 20 countries.
The common stock of United
Dominion is listed on the NYSE and the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol
"UDI".

     
SPX will issue approximately 9.2 million shares in exchange for the shares
of United Dominion in an all-stock transaction.
SPX will also assume
approximately $876 million in United Dominion debt.
United Dominion shareholders
will receive SPX shares based on a fixed exchange ratio of 0.2353 of an SPX
share per United Dominion share, which was valued at $25 per United Dominion
share based on the average closing price of a share of SPX common stock for the
five-day period ended Friday, March 9, 2001, the day before the merger agreement
between SPX and United Dominion was entered into.
There is no collar on the
fixed exchange ratio.
The board of directors of both companies unanimously
approved the agreement.

     
The combination of SPX and United Dominion will create a company with
approximately $5 billion in pro forma annual revenues and enhanced
value-creation opportunities.
SPX also will gain additional international reach
as United Dominion derives approximately 33% of its revenues from sources
outside the United States.
United Dominion brings to SPX 18 businesses, many of
which have leading market shares or product lines in key areas.
SPX's business
segments will be reconfigured to some extent, and United Dominion's business
will be operated within the following four business segments: technical products
and systems, industrial products and services, flow technology and service
solutions.

     
The United Dominion acquisition will be a taxable transaction to the
shareholders of United Dominion and is to be implemented as a court-approved
plan of arrangement (similar to a merger) under Canadian corporate law, is
subject to approval by United Dominion shareholders, approval of the Ontario
Court, antitrust clearance and customary closing conditions, and is expected to
close, assuming satisfaction of all of the foregoing, on or about May 24, 2001.

If the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, United Dominion
will be required to pay SPX a break-up fee of $40 million.
United Dominion has
scheduled a combined annual and special shareholders meeting for May 17, 2001 to
vote on the merger agreement.
For more information regarding the United Dominion
acquisition, please refer to SPX's current reports on Form 8-K filed on March
12, April 12 and April 13, 2001.

     
Following the United Dominion acquisition, SPX will review each business
unit and identify areas to reduce structural cost, improve operating
efficiencies and leverage technology.
SPX expects to achieve a minimum of $30
million of annualized cost savings in the first full year following the
acquisition.
These include savings associated with the elimination of duplicate
corporate office costs, consolidation of purchasing initiatives and
rationalization of duplicate facilities, among others.

     
In connection with the United Dominion acquisition, SPX has obtained
commitments for $780 million in incremental term facilities consisting of a
two-year term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount equal to $250
million and an increase in SPX's existing tranche C term facility from $300
million to $830 million.
The incremental term facilities will bear interest at
either the ABR rate or the Eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin.
The
proceeds of these borrowings will be used to refinance a like amount of United
Dominion's outstanding indebtedness.
SPX intends, immediately prior to the
completion of the United Dominion acquisition, to enter into a restated credit
agreement to reflect the addition of the $780 million in incremental term
facilities.
The restated credit agreement will contain affirmative covenants,
negative covenants, financial covenants, repayment provisions, representations
and warranties, and events of default substantially similar to the terms
contained in SPX's existing credit agreement.

     
Alternatively, SPX may, in connection with the United Dominion acquisition,
issue notes in a public offering or a private placement for approximately $250
million, in which case the $780 million in incremental term facilities will be
reduced by an equivalent amount.

incorporated under the laws of Georgia.
The rights of VSI Holdings shareholders
are governed by the Georgia Business Corporation Code and VSI Holdings'
governing documents, which consist of its articles of incorporation and bylaws.

If the merger is consummated, the holders of VSI Holdings common stock will
become holders of SPX common stock (other than holders who elect, and receive,
only cash for their shares).
As SPX stockholders, their rights will be governed
by the General Corporation Law of Delaware and SPX's governing documents, which
consist of its certificate of incorporation and bylaws and shareholders rights
plan.
In certain respects the rights of SPX stockholders differ from those of
VSI Holdings shareholders.

     
This summary is intended to highlight the material differences between the

comparison with the rights of VSI Holdings shareholders under applicable Georgia
laws or VSI Holdings' governing documents.
It is not intended to be a complete

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS AND NOMINATION OF DIRECTORS

     SPX's bylaws provide that for a matter to be properly brought before an
annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must give timely notice of the
matter in writing to the secretary of SPX not less than 120 days nor more than
150 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual
meeting.
The bylaws also specify requirements for a stockholder's notice to be
in proper form.

     
Under SPX's bylaws, nominations for the election of directors may be made
by the SPX board of directors, a committee appointed by the board or any
stockholder entitled to vote in the elections of directors.
A stockholder may
nominate someone for election as a director at a meeting only if he or she has
given written notice of his or her intent to make a nomination to SPX's
secretary.
Stockholders must submit their nominations for an election to be held
at an annual meeting by 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the
immediately preceding annual meeting.
Stockholder nominations for an election to
be held at a special meeting of the stockholders must be made at the close of
business on the tenth day following the date on which notice of the special
meeting was first given to stockholders.
The bylaws also specify requirements
for a stockholder's nomination to be in proper written form.

     
Unlike SPX's governing documents, VSI Holdings' governing documents do not
specify any advance notice of shareholder proposals or director nominations.
In
addition, neither the Delaware law nor the Georgia law contains requirements as
to these issues.


DIRECTORS

     Both the Delaware law and the Georgia law provide that a board of directors
may have one or more directors.
The exact number of directors is fixed by or in
the manner provided in the bylaws, unless the certificate or articles of
incorporation fixes the number.
In that case, an amendment to the certificate or
articles of incorporation is required to change the number of directors.

     
The SPX certificate of incorporation provides for the number of directors
to be fixed by or pursuant to the bylaws.
The SPX bylaws provide that, except as
otherwise fixed pursuant to the certificate of incorporation relating to the
rights of the holders of any preferred stock, the number of directors will be
fixed from time to time by the SPX board, but cannot be less than three.
At
present, there are seven directors on SPX's board.

     
The VSI Holdings bylaws provide that its board may have up to nine
directors.
Currently, seven directors serve on VSI Holdings' board.

     
Under the Delaware law, the directors of a corporation may, by the
certificate of incorporation, an initial bylaw or a bylaw adopted by a vote of
the stockholders, be divided into one, two or three classes.
The SPX certificate
of incorporation provides that the directors, other than those who may be
elected by the holders of preferred stock, will be classified into three
classes, as nearly equal in number as possible.
The Georgia law also provides
for a classified board when this type of provision is in the articles of
incorporation or in a bylaw adopted by the shareholders.
VSI Holdings' governing
documents do not provide for a classified board of directors.

     
Under the Delaware law and the Georgia law, cumulative voting in the
election of directors is not available unless it is specifically provided for in
the certificate or articles of incorporation.
SPX's certificate of incorporation
does not provide for cumulative voting, and VSI Holdings' articles of
incorporation specifically disallow it.


DIRECTOR VACANCIES

     Under the Delaware law, a majority of directors then on the board may fill
vacancies and newly created directorships, unless otherwise provided in the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws.
The certificate of incorporation may
direct that a particular class of stock is to elect the director, in which case
any other directors elected by that class, or a sole remaining director so
elected, may fill the vacancy.
SPX's governing documents provide that a majority
of the remaining directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, will fill
any board vacancies, including those resulting from an increase in the number of
directors.

     
Under the Georgia law, unless the articles of incorporation or a bylaw
adopted by the shareholders provides otherwise, vacancies and newly created
directorships may be filled by the shareholders, by the board of directors or,
if the directors constitute less than a quorum, by a majority of the directors
remaining in office.
If, however, the director was elected by a voting group,
the shareholders of the voting group or the remaining directors elected by the
voting group will fill the vacancy.
VSI Holdings' bylaws provide that VSI
Holdings board vacancies, including those from any increase in the number of
directors, are filled by the majority of the directors then in office, even if
less than a quorum, or by the shareholders at a special meeting of shareholders
called for that purpose.


REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS

     Under the Delaware law, the holders of a majority of the shares then
entitled to vote at an election of directors may remove any or all directors,
with or without cause.
If a corporation has a classified board, however,
stockholders can remove directors only for cause unless the certificate of
incorporation provides otherwise.
In addition, under the Delaware law, when a
corporation's certificate of incorporation provides that holders of a series or
class, voting as a series or class, are entitled to elect one or more directors,
then only the holders of that series or class may remove those directors without
cause.
The Delaware law does not permit directors to remove other directors.

     
SPX's governing documents provide that, subject to certain rights of
holders of preferred stock, any director may be removed from office only for
cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80% of the combined
voting power of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote in the election
of directors, voting together as a single class.

     
Under the Georgia law, shareholders may remove a director with or without
cause, unless the articles of incorporation or a bylaw adopted by the
shareholders only allow removal for cause.
Under VSI Holdings' bylaws, a
majority vote of the shareholders present or represented by proxy at a special
meeting may remove a director with or without cause.


SPECIAL MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS

     Both the Delaware law and the Georgia law provide that the board or any
other person authorized in the corporation's certificate or articles of
incorporation or bylaws may call a special meeting of shareholders.
In addition,
the Georgia law provides that a special meeting of shareholders may also be
called by the holders of at least 25%, or a greater or lesser percentage as the
articles of incorporation or bylaws provide, of all votes entitled to be cast on
any issue proposed to be considered at a special meeting.

     
Under the SPX governing documents, only the chairman, the president or a
majority of the board may call special meetings of the stockholders.
The VSI
Holdings bylaws allow a special meeting to be called by the chairman of the
board, the president, the board of directors or the holders of at least one-
tenth of all the shares entitled to vote at the special meeting.


QUORUM FOR SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING

     VSI Holdings' bylaws require the holders of a majority of the shares issued
and outstanding to be present in person or by proxy to establish quorum.
SPX's
bylaws provide that the holders of one-third of the stock issued and outstanding
and entitled to vote at the meeting must be present in person or by proxy to
establish a quorum.


CORPORATE ACTION WITHOUT A SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING

     Under the Delaware law and the Georgia law, shareholders can act by written
consent in lieu of voting at a shareholders' meeting.
The Delaware law permits a
corporation to eliminate stockholder action by written consent in its
certificate of incorporation.
SPX's certificate of incorporation prohibits
stockholders from acting by written consent in lieu of a meeting.
VSI Holdings'
bylaws allow for shareholder action by written consent without a meeting,
without prior notice and without a vote.


PREFERRED STOCK

     SPX's certificate of incorporation and VSI Holdings' articles of
incorporation both authorize the issuance of preferred stock.
SPX has authorized
the issuance of 3,000,000 preferred shares and VSI Holdings has authorized the
issuance of 2,000,000 preferred shares.
Neither company has issued any preferred
shares.


STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING

     SPX common stock is listed on the NYSE and the Pacific Exchange under the
symbol "SPW".
VSI Holdings common stock is listed on the AMEX under the symbol
"VIS".


FUNDAMENTAL CORPORATE CHANGES

     The Delaware law requires that the holders of a majority of the outstanding
voting shares of the acquiring and target corporations approve statutory
mergers.
It does not provide explicitly for share exchanges.
The Delaware law
does not require a stockholder vote of the surviving corporation in a merger,
unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise, if:

     - the merger agreement does not amend the surviving corporation's
       certificate of incorporation;

     - each share of the surviving corporation outstanding before the merger is
       equal to an identical outstanding or treasury share of the surviving
       corporation after merger; and

     - the number of shares to be issued by the surviving corporation in the
       merger does not exceed 20% of the shares outstanding immediately prior to
       the merger.

     
The Georgia law requires that holders of a majority of the voting shares of
the acquiring and target corporations approve statutory mergers and share
exchanges.
It contains an exception to its voting requirements for mergers and
share exchanges where:

     - the articles of incorporation of the surviving corporation will not
       differ from its articles of incorporation before the merger;

     - each shareholder of the surviving corporation whose shares were
       outstanding immediately before the merger will hold the same number and
       type of shares immediately after the merger; and

     - the number and kind of shares outstanding immediately after the merger,
       plus the number and kind of shares issuable as a result of the merger, do
       not exceed the total number and kind of shares of the surviving
       corporation authorized by its articles of incorporation immediately
       before the merger.

     
Both the Delaware law and the Georgia law require that a sale of all or
substantially all of a corporation's assets be approved by a majority of the
outstanding voting shares of the corporation transferring the assets.


BUSINESS COMBINATIONS WITH SUBSTANTIAL SHAREHOLDERS

     
Unless specified conditions are met, business combinations by corporations
with interested shareholders are subject to a moratorium of three years under
the Delaware law and five years under the Georgia law.
Prohibited business
combinations include a merger with, disposition of assets to, or the issuance of
stock to, the interested shareholder, or specified transactions that have the
effect of increasing

the proportionate amount of the outstanding securities held by an interested
shareholder.
The law considers the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting
power of a company an interested shareholder.

     
The Delaware law prohibits a corporation from engaging in a business
combination with an interested stockholder for three years following the date
that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless:

     - prior to that date, the corporation's board approved either the business
       combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming
       an interested stockholder;

     - upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder
       becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at
       least 85% of the corporation's voting stock; or

     - on or subsequent to that date, the board approves the business
       combination and the stockholders authorize it at an annual or special
       meeting, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least
       two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested
       stockholder.

     
The Delaware law permits a corporation to opt-out of this business
combination statute.
SPX's governing documents do not exclude SPX from the
restrictions imposed by the Delaware law.

     
Under the SPX certificate of incorporation, a substantial stockholder is
any stockholder who directly or indirectly beneficially owns 10% or more of the
voting power, an affiliate who within the previous two years directly or
indirectly beneficially owned 10% of more of the voting power, or an assignee of
these beneficial owners and affiliates.
SPX's certificate of incorporation
requires that a supermajority of SPX stockholders approve certain business
combinations with substantial stockholders.
Except as described below, 80% of
the voting power of the SPX stockholders, voting together as a single class,
must approve the following business combinations:

     - a merger of SPX or any of its subsidiaries with either a substantial
       stockholder or a corporation that is, or after the merger would be, an
       affiliate or associate (each as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of
       1934) of a substantial stockholder;

     - a sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition
       to or with any substantial stockholder, its affiliate or associate, of
       assets or a subsidiary of SPX, in each case having an aggregate fair
       market value of $10 million or more;

     - the issuance or transfer by SPX or a subsidiary of any securities of SPX
       or any of its subsidiaries to a substantial stockholder, or its affiliate
       or associate, in exchange for cash, securities or other consideration
       having an aggregate fair market value of $10 million or more;

     - the adoption of any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution
       of SPX proposed by or on behalf of any substantial stockholder, or its
       affiliate or associate; or

     - any reclassification of securities (including any reverse stock split),
       recapitalization of SPX, a merger or consolidation of SPX with a
       subsidiary, or any other transaction (whether or not involving a
       substantial stockholder) that directly or indirectly increases the
       proportionate share of the outstanding shares of any class of equity or
       convertible securities of SPX or any of its subsidiaries that a
       substantial stockholder, or its affiliate or associate, directly or
       indirectly owns.

     
The 80% vote requirement does not apply:

     - to business combinations where SPX stockholders do not receive any cash
       or other consideration, solely in their capacities as stockholders, and
       the business combination has been approved by two-thirds of the SPX
       directors who were in office before the substantial stockholder became a
       substantial stockholder and who are not affiliates or representatives of
       the substantial stockholder, or

     - to all other business combinations that two-thirds of the continuing
       directors then in office have approved and that satisfy all of the
       following conditions:

             -- The aggregate amount of cash and the fair market value as of the
                date of the consummation of the business combination of the
                consideration other than cash to be received per share by SPX
                common stockholders is at least equal to the highest of the
                following:

                   (1) the highest per share price (including any brokerage
              commissions, transfer taxes and soliciting dealers' fees) paid to
              acquire any SPX shares beneficially owned by the substantial
              stockholder that were acquired within the two-year period
              immediately prior to the first public announcement of the proposal
              of the business combination or in the transaction in which it
              became a substantial stockholder, whichever is higher, plus
              interest compounded annually from the date when the substantial
              stockholder became a substantial stockholder through the
              consummation date of the business combination at the prime rate of
              interest of Harris Trust and Savings Bank from time to time in
              effect in Chicago, Illinois, less the aggregate amount of any cash
              dividends paid, and the fair market value of any non-cash
              dividends paid, per share of SPX common stock from the date when
              the substantial stockholder became a substantial stockholder
              through the consummation date of the business combination in an
              amount up to but not exceeding the amount of the interest; or

                   (2) the fair market value per share of SPX common stock on
              the date the business combination was first publicly announced or
              on the date on which the substantial stockholder became a
              substantial stockholder, whichever is higher; or

                   (3) the higher of the two numbers referred to in clause (2)
              above, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
              highest per share price (including any brokerage commissions,
              transfer taxes and soliciting dealers' fees) paid in order to
              acquire any shares of SPX common stock beneficially owned by the
              substantial stockholder that were acquired within the two-year
              period immediately prior to the date when the business combination
              was announced, and the denominator of which is the fair market
              value per share of SPX common stock on the first day in the
              two-year period on which the substantial stockholder beneficially
              owned any shares of SPX common stock.

             
-- The consideration that SPX stockholders will receive will be in
                cash or in the same form as the substantial stockholder has
                previously paid for shares of the same stock.
If the substantial
                stockholder has used multiple forms of consideration, then the
                form of consideration for the business combination will be cash
                or the form used to acquire the largest number of shares that
                the substantial stockholder previously acquired.

             
-- Except as approved by at least two-thirds of the directors who
                were in office when the substantial stockholder became a
                substantial stockholder and who are not affiliates or
                representatives of the substantial stockholder, between the time
                that a substantial stockholder becomes a substantial stockholder
                and the consummation of the business combination, there has been
                no failure to declare and pay periodic dividends with respect to
                any preferred stock outstanding and no reduction in the annual
                rate of dividends paid on SPX common stock (with certain
                exceptions).

             
-- After becoming a substantial stockholder, the substantial
                stockholder must not have received any loans, advances,
                guarantees, pledges or other financial assistance or any tax
                credits or other tax advantages from SPX or any of its
                subsidiaries, whether in anticipation of or in connection with
                the business combination or otherwise.

             
-- A proxy or information statement describing the proposed
                business combination and complying with the requirements of the
                Exchange Act has been mailed to public stockholders of SPX at
                least 30 days prior to the consummation of the business

              combination, whether or not the proxy or information statement is
              required to be mailed pursuant to the Exchange Act.

     
The provision of the Georgia law governing business combinations with
substantial shareholders is similar to the Delaware law provision.
Georgia
corporations may adopt a provision requiring that certain business combinations
be approved by a special vote of the board of directors and/or the shareholders
unless certain fair pricing criteria are met.
They may also adopt a provision
requiring a supermajority vote for business combinations with interested
shareholders.
VSI Holdings' governing documents do not contain these types of
provisions.

     
Under the Georgia law, an interested shareholder may avoid the prohibition
against effecting significant transactions with the corporation if the board of
directors, prior to the time the shareholder becomes an interested shareholder,
approves the transaction or the transaction by which the shareholder becomes an
interested shareholder.


INDEMNIFICATION

     Delaware and Georgia have similar laws relating to indemnification by a
corporation of its officers, directors, employees and other agents.
Under the
Delaware law, a corporation may indemnify directors, officers, employees and
agents for actions taken in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed
to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe
the person's conduct was unlawful.
The Delaware law provides that a corporation
may advance expenses of defense (upon receipt of a written undertaking from the
person seeking the advance to reimburse the corporation if indemnification is
not appropriate) and must reimburse a successful defendant for expenses,
including attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably incurred.
The law permits a
corporation to have liability insurance for its directors and officers.
Under
the Delaware law, a corporation may not indemnify for any claim, issue or matter
as to which a person has been adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction,
after exhaustion of all appeals, to be liable to the corporation, unless and
only to the extent that a court determines that the person is entitled to
indemnity for the expenses.

     
The SPX certificate of incorporation provides that SPX will indemnify
directors and officers of SPX and those serving at the request of SPX as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or entity to the
fullest extent authorized by the Delaware law.
This includes the right to be
reimbursed by SPX for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance
of its final disposition.
The SPX certificate of incorporation provides that the
indemnification rights provided therein are not exclusive of any other right to
which persons seeking indemnification may be entitled under any law, bylaw,
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.
The
certificate of incorporation authorizes SPX to purchase and maintain insurance
on behalf of its directors and officers.

     
The Georgia law provides that a corporation may indemnify a director if he
or she acted in good faith and reasonably believed that his or her actions were
in the corporations' best interests.
The law also allows a corporation to
advance expenses upon receiving written confirmation that the relevant standard
of conduct (good faith and reasonable belief) has been met.
Under the Georgia
law, the corporation may purchase and maintain liability insurance for its
directors and officers.

     
VSI Holdings' governing documents provide indemnification for directors,
officers, agents or employees of the corporation or persons who served as
directors, officers, agents, employees, partners or trustees of another
corporation or enterprise at the corporation's request.
VSI Holdings' governing
documents provide that the right of indemnification is not exclusive of any
other right to which persons seeking indemnification may be entitled under the
articles of incorporation, any other bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders or
law.

     VSI Holdings' articles of incorporation provide indemnification in a
derivative suit if the person is successful on the merits or if he or she acted
in good faith in the transaction that is the subject of the suit and under a
reasonable belief that he or she was advancing the corporation's best interests.

VSI Holdings

will pay the expenses reasonably incurred in defense of the derivative suit
(including attorneys' fees but excluding amounts paid in settlement), except
where the person has been found guilty of negligence or misconduct in the
performance of his duty to VSI Holdings.
A plea of guilty or nolo contendere
will not be deemed to be guilt of negligence or misconduct.

     VSI Holdings' articles of incorporation provide indemnification in a
nonderivative suit if the person is successful on the merits or if he or she
acted in good faith in the transaction that is the subject of the suit and under
a reasonable belief that he or she was acting in the corporation's best
interests.
VSI Holdings will pay the expenses reasonably incurred by the person
in defending the nonderivative suit, including attorneys' fees, amounts paid in
settlement, judgements and fines.

     
A court may determine whether a person has met the good faith and
reasonable belief standard or the determination may be made by a majority of the
VSI Holdings directors who were not parties to the action, by independent legal
counsel in a written opinion or by the VSI Holdings shareholders.
A court, the
board of directors or the VSI Holdings shareholders may also prorate
indemnification amounts based on whether or not a person has met the good faith
and reasonable belief standard for all matters.

     
VSI Holdings may advance any payment of indemnification expenses.
The board
of directors must authorize the specific advance payment, and the person
receiving the payment must promise in writing that he or she will repay any
expenses advanced unless it is ultimately determined that he or she is entitled
to indemnification.

     
VSI Holdings may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person
who holds or who has held any position whether or not the corporation would have
power to indemnify him against that liability.
Insurance purchases and any type
of indemnification payment must be reported in writing to the VSI Holdings
shareholders with the next notice of the annual meeting or within six months,
whichever is sooner.


LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

     Through provisions in the certificate of incorporation, the Delaware law
generally allows a corporation to limit a director's personal liability to the
corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of his or her
fiduciary duty.
The provisions may not, however, eliminate or limit the
liability of a director:

     -  for any breach of his or her duty of loyalty to the corporation or its
        stockholders;

     -  for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional
        misconduct or a knowing violation of law;

     -  under Section 174 of the Delaware law concerning unlawful dividends and
        stock repurchases and redemptions; or

     -  for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
        benefit.


The provision does not eliminate or limit the liability of a director for any
act or omission occurring prior to the date when the provision becomes
effective.
These limitation of liability provisions do not affect the
availability of nonmonetary remedies like injunctive relief or rescission.

     
The SPX certificate of incorporation provides for the limiting of
directors' liability.
It also provides that any repeal or modification of this
provision by the SPX stockholders will not adversely affect any right or
protection of a director of SPX that exists at the time of the repeal or
modification.

     
The Georgia law permits a corporation to limit director liability in its
articles of incorporation.
VSI Holdings' articles of incorporation do not
contain this type of provision.


DIVIDENDS

     The Delaware law permits a corporation to declare and pay dividends out of
surplus.
If there is no surplus, a corporation can pay dividends out of the net
profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or for the
preceding fiscal year as long as the amount of capital of the corporation
following the declaration and payment of the dividend is not less than the
aggregate amount of the capital represented by the issued and outstanding stock
of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets.
The SPX
certificate of incorporation permits SPX to pay dividends to common stockholders
only after it has paid dividends to preferred stockholders who are entitled to
dividends.

     
Under the Georgia law, a corporation may make distributions to its
shareholders subject to any restrictions imposed in its articles of
incorporation, except that a corporation may not make a distribution if, after
giving it effect:

     -  the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in
        the usual course of business, or

     -  the corporation's total assets would be less than the sum of its total
        liabilities plus, unless the articles of incorporation permit otherwise,
        the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were to be dissolved
        at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon
        dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to
        those receiving the distribution.

     
The VSI Holdings articles of incorporation permit the payment of dividends
to common shareholders out of any funds of the corporation legally available for
distribution as dividends, subject to the rights of any preferred shareholders.


REDEMPTION AND REPURCHASE OF STOCK

     The Delaware law generally allows a corporation to redeem or repurchase its
shares if the redemption or repurchase would not impair the capital of the
corporation.
A Delaware corporation may also redeem or repurchase shares having
a preference upon the distribution of any of its assets, or shares of common
stock, if there are no shares of preferred stock, if the shares will be retired
upon acquisition, and provided that, after the reduction in capital made in
connection with the retirement of shares, the corporation's remaining assets are
sufficient to pay any debts not otherwise provided for.

     
A Georgia corporation may acquire its own shares.
Reacquired shares are
considered authorized but unissued shares, unless the articles of incorporation
provide that the shares become treasury shares or prohibit the reissuance of
reacquired shares.
If the reissuance is prohibited, the number of authorized
shares will be reduced by the number of shares reacquired.

     
The VSI Holdings and SPX governing documents do not address the redemption
and repurchase of common stock.


NO DISSENTERS' RIGHTS

     Under both the Delaware law and the Georgia law, a shareholder who
participates in specified major corporate transactions may be entitled to
dissenters' or appraisal rights pursuant to which the shareholder may receive
cash in the amount of the fair value of his or her shares in lieu of the
consideration he or she would otherwise receive in the transaction.

     
Under the Delaware law, appraisal rights are generally available to
stockholders entitled to vote with respect to mergers and consolidations.

Stockholders do not, however, have appraisal rights with respect to a merger or
consolidation by a corporation when the corporation's shares are either listed
on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000
stockholders so long as the stockholders are not required to accept anything
other than shares of the surviving corporation, shares of any other corporation
that are either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by
more than 2,000 holders, cash in lieu of fractional shares or a combination of
the foregoing.
Delaware law permits a corporation to expand these statutory
rights pursuant to its certificate of incorporation, but SPX has not done so.

     
Under the Georgia law, dissenters' rights are available in the following
corporate actions:

     -  a merger, if shareholder approval is required for the merger and the
        shareholder is entitled to vote on the merger, or if the corporation is
        a subsidiary that is merged with its parent;

     -  a share exchange in which the corporation's shares will be acquired, if
        the shareholder is entitled to vote on the share exchange;

     -  a sale or exchange of all or substantially all of a corporation's
        assets, if a shareholder vote is required, other than a sale pursuant to
        a court order or a sale for cash the proceeds of which will be
        distributed to the shareholders within one year;

     -  an amendment of the articles of incorporation that adversely affects
        rights relating to the shareholder's shares; or

     -  any corporate action taken pursuant to a shareholder vote to the extent
        the articles of incorporation, bylaws or a resolution of the board of
        directors provide that voting or non-voting shareholders are entitled to
        dissent and obtain payment for their shares.

     
The Georgia law provides that if a shareholder is entitled to exercise
dissenters' rights, those rights constitute the shareholder's exclusive remedy
in the absence of fraud or failure to comply with certain procedural
requirements.

     
Dissenters' rights are not available under the Georgia law when the
affected shares are listed on a national securities exchange or held of record
by more than 2,000 shareholders unless:

     -  the articles of incorporation or a resolution of the board of directors
        approving the transaction provide otherwise; or

     -  in a plan of merger or share exchange, the shareholders are required to
        accept anything other than shares of the surviving corporation or
        another publicly held corporation that at the effective date of the
        merger or share exchange are either listed on a national securities
        exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 shareholders, except for
        payments in lieu of fractional shares.


SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE SUITS

     Under the Delaware law and the Georgia law, a shareholder may only bring a
derivative action on behalf of the corporation if he or she was a shareholder at
the time of the transaction in question or if the stock was transferred to him
or her by operation of law.
In addition, the Georgia law requires that the
shareholder fairly and adequately represent the corporation's interests in
enforcing its rights.


DISSOLUTION

     Under the Delaware law, a corporation may be dissolved in two ways.
First,
a majority of the board along with a majority of the voting stockholders can
approve a dissolution.
Second, the vote of 100% of the voting stockholders can
approve a dissolution.
A Delaware corporation's certificate of incorporation can
impose a supermajority voting requirement for a dissolution initiated by the
board of directors.
The SPX certificate of incorporation does not impose any
supermajority vote requirement for dissolution.

     
Dissolution under the Georgia law requires the approval of the board of
directors, unless the board elects not to make a recommendation because of a
conflict of interest or other special circumstances, and a majority of the
stockholders entitled to vote.
Under Georgia law, the articles of incorporation
may require a greater vote or voting by groups for dissolution.
The VSI Holdings
articles of incorporation do not impose any supermajority vote requirement for
dissolution.


PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS

     Under both the Delaware law and the Georgia law, preemptive rights are not
available to stockholders unless specifically authorized by the certificate or
articles of incorporation.
Both the SPX certificate of

incorporation and the VSI Holdings articles of incorporation provide that
shareholders will not have any preemptive rights.


SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLANS

     SPX entered into a rights agreement with The Bank of New York, as rights
agent, on June 25, 1996, as amended October 22, 1997.
Under the SPX rights
agreement, the board declared a dividend of one right for each outstanding share
of SPX common stock held of record on June 25, 1996.
Each SPX right entitles its
holder to purchase, upon the occurrence of certain specified events, one
one-thousandth of a share of SPX series A junior participating preferred stock,
at an exercise price of $200, subject to adjustment.
At no time do the holders
of SPX rights have any voting rights.

     
The SPX rights will no longer be exercisable after the earlier of June 25,
2006, the redemption of the rights or the exchange of the rights for SPX common
stock.
The description and terms of the SPX rights are set forth in the SPX
rights agreement.
In general, pursuant to the rights agreement, upon the
occurrence of specified triggering events, for example, the acquisition by any
person (other than SPX or any of its subsidiaries) of the beneficial ownership
of securities representing 20% or more of the outstanding SPX common stock
without the prior approval of SPX's board, each holder of an SPX right will have
the right to receive, upon exercise of the SPX right, that amount of SPX common
stock having a market value equal to two times the exercise price of the SPX
right.

     
The SPX rights agreement further provides that if SPX is acquired in a
merger or other business combination or sells more than 50% of its assets and
the transaction is not approved by SPX's board, the SPX stockholders will have
the right to receive, with respect to each SPX right, common stock of the
acquiring company having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the
SPX right.
Under certain circumstances, SPX may redeem the rights for a
redemption price of $.01 per right.

     
VSI Holdings has not adopted any shareholder rights plan.


INTERESTED DIRECTOR TRANSACTIONS

     Under both the Delaware law and the Georgia law, contracts or transactions
in which a corporation's director has an interest are not void or voidable
because of that interest, so long as specified conditions are met, for example,
obtaining required approvals and fulfilling the requirements of good faith and
full disclosure.
The conditions are substantially similar under the Delaware law
and the Georgia law.
The SPX certificate of incorporation requires disclosure of
the interest to the board or board committee that will vote on the
interested-director transaction.
Similarly, the VSI Holdings bylaws require
disclosure of the interest to the board of directors or shareholders voting on
the interested-director transaction.


AMENDMENT OF CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

     Under the Delaware law, a corporation may amend its certificate of
incorporation if, among other things, the amendment is approved by a majority of
the outstanding stock entitled to vote approves the amendment.
If, however, the
provision of the certificate of incorporation requires an affirmative vote of
directors or stockholders greater than that normally provided for by the
Delaware law, that provision of the certificate of incorporation may not be
amended or repealed without that greater vote.

     
The SPX certificate of incorporation provides that the holders of at least
80% of the voting shares of SPX must approve the amendment of Articles Eighth
(number, classification and power of directors), Ninth (stockholder meetings)
and Fifteenth (business combinations) of the certificate of incorporation.
In
addition, a majority of the voting shares can amend Article Fifteenth (business
combinations) if at least two-thirds of the directors who are not affiliates or
representatives of the substantial stockholder (as defined in the section above
entitled Business Combinations with Substantial Stockholders) and who were
directors before the substantial stockholder became a substantial stockholder
approve the amendment.

     
Under the Georgia law, articles of incorporation may be amended if the
board recommends the amendment and the shareholders approve the amendment by a
majority vote of the shares eligible to vote.
The VSI Holdings articles of
incorporation do not alter these requirements.


AMENDMENT OF BYLAWS

     Under the Delaware law, the stockholders have the power to adopt, amend or
repeal bylaws unless the certificate of incorporation also confers that power
upon the directors.
SPX's certificate of incorporation, with limited exceptions,
expressly authorizes the board of directors to adopt, amend and repeal the
bylaws.
The SPX bylaws provide that, subject to the provisions of the SPX
certificate of incorporation, a majority of the board or a majority of the
stockholders entitled to vote at a meeting may alter the bylaws.
The SPX
certificate of incorporation provides that at least 80% of the voting power of
all SPX shares must amend or repeal specified sections of the SPX bylaws dealing
with aspects of stockholder action and the election and removal of directors.

     
Under the Georgia law, the board of directors may generally amend or repeal
bylaws, unless this power is reserved to shareholders in the articles of
incorporation or if the bylaw involved provides for staggered terms for the
directors, which only the shareholders may create or eliminate.
VSI Holdings'
governing documents provide that its board of directors has the power to alter,
amend or repeal the bylaws, unless that power is modified or divested by a vote
of a majority of the shareholders.
VSI Holdings' shareholders have not modified
or divested the board's authority to amend the VSI Holdings bylaws.


CONSIDERATION OF NON-STOCKHOLDER CONSTITUENCIES

     Under the Delaware law, a board of directors may consider the impact of its
decisions on constituencies other than stockholders.
Non-stockholder
constituencies may include creditors, customers, employees, and perhaps the
community generally.
The board may only consider the interests of other
constituencies, however, if there are rationally related benefits to
stockholders or there is some reasonable relationship to general stockholder
interests.
SPX's certificate of incorporation also provides that in determining
whether an acquisition proposal is in the best interests of SPX and its
stockholders, the SPX board must consider all factors it deems relevant,
including:

     - the consideration offered, not only in relation to the then current
       market price, but also in relation to the then current value of SPX in a
       freely negotiated transaction and in relation to the board's estimate of
       the future value of SPX as an independent entity; and

     - the social, legal and economic effects on employees, suppliers, customers
       and the communities in which SPX is located, as well as on the long term
       business prospects of SPX.

     VSI Holdings' governing documents do not contain a non-stockholder
constituencies provision.

                                 
LEGAL MATTERS

     Gardner, Carton & Douglas, Chicago, Illinois, will pass on the validity of
the shares of SPX common stock to be issued in connection with the merger.

                      
WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION

     SPX and VSI Holdings file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy
statements and other information with the SEC.
You may read and copy any
reports, statements or other information that the companies file at the SEC's
public reference rooms in Washington, D.C., New York, New York and Chicago,
Illinois.
Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for further information on the
public reference rooms.

     1.3  Merger Consideration.  
(a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement
and any applicable backup or other withholding requirements, each of the issued
and outstanding shares (the "Company Shares") of common stock, $.01 par value,
of the Company (the "Company Stock") outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (except for Company Shares to be cancelled as set forth in
Section 1.3(d) shall be converted, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, into the right to receive the
Purchaser Stock Consideration or the combination of Purchaser Stock
Consideration and Cash Consideration, without any interest thereon, as specified
in Section 1.5 hereof, subject to payment of cash in lieu of any fractional
share as hereinafter provided (the "Merger Consideration").
For purposes hereof,
the following terms have the following respective meanings:

          "Cash Consideration" means a per Company Share amount in cash equal to
     $4.35.

          
"Outstanding Company Shares" means the Company Stock outstanding
     immediately prior to the Effective Time, including, without limitation,
     restricted shares referred to in Section 1.10(b), but excluding Company
     Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 1.3(d).

          
"Purchaser Rights" means Rights to purchase Series A Junior
     Participation Preferred Stock of Purchaser distributed to holders of
     Purchaser Stock pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated June 25, 1996, as
     amended, between the Purchaser and Bank of New York, as Rights Agent.

          
"Purchaser Stock" means the common stock, $10 per share, of Purchaser
     and associated Purchaser Rights.
For clarification, each reference herein
     to Purchaser Stock shall include the associated Purchaser Rights.

          
"Purchaser Stock Consideration" means .043 of a share of Purchaser
     Stock.
In the event that between the date of this Agreement and the
     Effective Time, the issued and outstanding shares of Purchaser Stock shall
     have been affected or changed into a different number of shares or a
     different class of shares as a result of a stock split, reverse stock
     split, stock dividend, spin-off, extraordinary dividend, recapitalization,
     reclassification, subdivision, combination of shares or other similar
     transaction, or there shall have been a record date declared for any such
     matter, the Purchaser Stock Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted
     as mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and the Company.

          
(b)  No fractional shares of Purchaser Stock shall be issued pursuant
     to the Merger nor will any fractional share interest involved entitle the
     holder thereof to vote, to receive dividends or to exercise any other
     rights of a shareholder of Purchaser.
In lieu thereof, any holder of
     Company Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of
     Purchaser Stock pursuant to the provisions hereof shall receive an amount
     in cash pursuant to Section 1.5(g) hereof.

          (c)  Each share of Purchaser Stock and any and all shares of Preferred
     Stock of Purchaser, if any, outstanding immediately prior to the Merger
     shall remain issued and outstanding.

          
(d)  
Any shares of Company Stock owned by Purchaser, or any other
     wholly owned subsidiaries of Purchaser or held in the treasury of the
     Company immediately prior to the Merger shall be cancelled and retired at
     the Effective Time and shall cease to exist and no Purchaser Stock or other
     consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.
                                       A-2

          (e)  
On and after the Effective Time, holders of certificates
     representing shares of Company Stock (the "Certificates") immediately prior
     to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the
     Company, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each
     Company Share held by them.

     
1.4  Election Procedure.  
Each holder of Company Shares (other than holders
of Company Shares to be cancelled as set forth in Section 1.3(d)) shall have the
right to submit a request specifying either that such holder's Company Shares
shall be converted into the Purchaser Stock Consideration or that such holder's
Company Shares shall be converted into a combination of Cash Consideration and
Purchaser Stock Consideration, without interest, in the Merger in accordance
with the following procedure:

          (a)  Each holder of Company Shares may specify in a request made in
     accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.4 (herein called an
     "Election") to either: (i) convert one-hundred percent (100%) of the
     Company Shares owned by such holder into the right to receive the Purchaser
     Stock Consideration in the Merger (a "Stock Election"), or (ii) convert
     forty-five percent (45%) of the Company Shares owned by such holder into
     the right to receive the Cash Consideration in the Merger, and fifty-five
     percent (55%) of the Company Shares owned by each such holder into the
     right to receive the Purchaser Stock Consideration in the Merger (a
     "Cash/Stock Election").
A Form of Election shall be included with each copy
     of the Prospectus/Proxy Statement (as defined in Section 1.15) mailed to
     stockholders of the Company in connection with the meeting of stockholders
     called to consider the Company Proposals (as defined in Section 1.15).
     
Purchaser and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to
     mail or otherwise make available the Form of Election to all persons who
     become holders of Company Shares during the period between the record date
     for such stockholder meeting and the Election Deadline (as defined in
     Section 1.4(d)).

          (b)  
Purchaser shall prepare a form (the "Form of Election"), which
     shall be in form and substance acceptable to the Company, pursuant to which
     each holder of Company Shares at the close of business on the Election
     Deadline may make an Election and which shall be mailed to the Company's
     stockholders in accordance with Section 1.4(a) so as to permit the
     Company's stockholders to exercise their right to make an Election prior to
     the Election Deadline.

          (c)  
Holders of record of Company Shares who hold such shares as
     nominees, trustees, or in other representative capacities may submit
     multiple Forms of Election, provided that such representative certifies
     that each Form of Election covers all Company Shares held by such
     representative for a particular beneficial owner.

          
(d)  Not later than the filing of the Prospectus/Proxy Statement (as
     defined below) with the SEC (as defined below), as contemplated in Section
     1.15(a) hereof, the Purchaser shall appoint a bank acceptable to the
     Company as the person to receive Forms of Election and to act as exchange
     agent under this Agreement, which bank shall be acceptable to the Company
     (the "Exchange Agent").
Any Company stockholder's Election shall have been
     made properly only if the Exchange Agent shall have received, by 5:00 p.m.
     local time in the city in which the principal office of such Exchange Agent
     is located, on the date of the Election Deadline, a Form of Election
     properly completed and signed and accompanied by certificates for the
     Company Shares to which such Form of Election relates (or by an appropriate
     guarantee of delivery of such certificates, as set forth in such Form of
     Election, from a member of any registered national securities exchange or
     of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or a commercial
     bank or trust company in the United States provided such certificates are
     in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time required in such
     guarantee of delivery).
Failure to deliver Company Shares covered by such a
     guarantee of delivery within the time set forth on such guarantee shall be
     deemed to invalidate any otherwise properly made Election.
As used herein,
     "Election Deadline" means the date announced by Purchaser (which date shall
     be agreed upon by the Company), as the last day on which Forms of Election
     will be accepted; provided, that such date shall be a business day no
     earlier than ten (10) business days prior to the Effective Time and no
     later than the date on which the Effective Time occurs.
In the event this
     Agreement shall have been terminated prior to the Effective Time, the
     Exchange Agent shall

                                       A-3

     immediately return all Election Forms and certificates for Company Shares
     to the appropriate Company stockholders.

          
(e)  Any Company stockholder may at any time prior to the Election
     Deadline change his Election by written notice received by the Exchange
     Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a revised Form of
     Election properly completed and signed.

          
(f)  Any Company stockholder may, at any time prior to the Election
     Deadline, revoke his Election by written notice received by the Exchange
     Agent prior to the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election
     Deadline of his certificates for Company Shares, or of the guarantee of
     delivery of such certificates, previously deposited with the Exchange
     Agent.
All Elections shall be revoked automatically if the Exchange Agent
     is notified in writing by Purchaser or the Company that this Agreement has
     been terminated.
Any Company stockholder who shall have deposited
     certificates for Company Shares with the Exchange Agent shall have the
     right to withdraw such certificates by written notice received by the
     Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline and thereby revoke his
     Election as of the Election Deadline if the Merger shall not have been
     consummated prior thereto.

          
(g)  Purchaser shall have the right to make rules, not inconsistent
     with the terms of this Agreement, governing the validity of the Forms of
     Election, the manner and extent to which Elections are to be taken into
     account in making the determinations prescribed by Section 1.5, the
     issuance and delivery of certificates for Purchaser Stock into which
     Company Shares are converted in the Merger and the payment of cash for
     Company Shares converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration
     in the Merger.

     
1.5  Issuance of Purchaser Stock Consideration and Payment of Cash
Consideration; Proration.  
The manner in which each Company Share (except
Company Shares to be cancelled as set forth in Section 1.3(d)) shall be
converted into the Purchaser Stock Consideration or the right to receive a
combination of Purchaser Stock Consideration and Cash Consideration at the
Effective Time shall be as set forth in this Section 1.5.

          (a)  As is more fully set forth below, the number of Company Shares to
     be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in the Merger
     pursuant to this Agreement shall not exceed the lesser of (i) 45% of all
     Outstanding Company Shares, or (ii) the maximum number of Company Shares
     permissible under Sec. 3.02 of Rev. Proc. 77-37, 1977-2, C.B. 568,
     including for this purpose only as Company Shares the amount of the debt
     being repaid pursuant to Section 5.10 (the "Maximum Cash Amount").

          (b)  
If Stock Elections and Cash/Stock Elections received providing
     for the conversion of Company Shares in the Merger into Purchaser Stock
     Consideration is greater than the amount of the Outstanding Company Shares
     minus the Maximum Cash Amount (the "Minimum Stock Amount"), each Company
     Share as to which the holder has elected to have converted into Purchaser
     Stock Consideration shall be converted in the Merger into the Purchaser
     Stock Consideration.

          (c)  
If Cash/Stock Elections are received providing for the conversion
     of Company Shares in the Merger into Cash Consideration in an amount less
     than the Maximum Cash Amount, each Company Share covered by a Cash/Stock
     Election that is to be converted in the Merger into Cash Consideration
     shall be converted in the Merger into the right to receive the Cash
     Consideration.

          
(d)  
If Cash/Stock Elections are received providing for conversion of
     Company Shares into Cash Consideration in an amount that is more than the
     Maximum Cash Amount, each Non-Electing Company Share (as defined in Section
     1.5(f)) and each Company Share for which a Stock Election has been received
     shall be converted in the Merger into the Purchaser Stock Consideration,
     and the Company Shares for which Cash/Stock Elections have been received
     shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and
     Purchaser Stock Consideration in the following manner:

             (1)  The Exchange Agent will distribute to each holder of Company
        Shares as to which a Cash/Stock Election has been made the Cash
        Consideration for a fraction of such Company

                                       A-4

        Shares, the numerator of which fraction shall be the Maximum Cash Amount
        and the denominator of which shall be the aggregate number of Company
        Shares covered by Cash/Stock Elections that have elected to be converted
        into Cash Consideration.

             (2)  Company Shares covered by a Cash/Stock Election and not fully
        converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration as set forth
        in clause (1) above shall be converted in the Merger into the right to
        receive a number of shares of Purchaser Stock equal to the Purchaser
        Stock Consideration for each such Company Share to offset the reduction
        in Cash Consideration affected pursuant to clause (1) above.

          (e)  
If Non-Electing Company Shares are not converted under Section
     1.5(d), the Exchange Agent shall convert each Non-Electing Company Share
     into the Purchaser Stock Consideration.

          
(f)  
For the purposes of this Section 1.5, Outstanding Company Shares
     as to which an Election is not in effect at the Election Deadline shall be
     called "Non-Electing Company Shares."
If Purchaser shall determine that any
     Election is not properly made with respect to any Company Shares, such
     Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the Company Shares
     covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be
     Non-Electing Company Shares.
The Purchaser and the Exchange Agent shall
     have no obligation to notify any person of any defect in any Form of
     Election submitted to the Exchange Agent.

          
(g)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
     certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Purchaser Stock
     shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no
     dividend or distribution with respect to Company Shares shall be payable on
     or with respect to any fractional share and such fractional share interests
     shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
     stockholder of Purchaser.
In lieu of any such fractional share of Purchaser
     Stock, Purchaser shall pay to each former stockholder of the Company who
     otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of Purchaser
     Stock an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) $101.17 by (ii) the
     fractional interest in a share of Purchaser Stock to which such holder
     would otherwise be entitled.
If more than one Certificate shall be
     surrendered for the account of the same holder, the number of shares of
     Purchaser Stock to be issued to such holder in exchange for the
     Certificates shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of
     shares represented by all Certificates surrendered for the account of such
     holder.
Any payment received by a holder of Company Shares with respect to
     fractional share interest is merely intended to provide a mechanical
     rounding off of, and not separately bargained for, consideration.

          
(h)  The Exchange Agent shall make all computations contemplated by
     this Section 1.5 and all such computations shall be conclusive and binding
     on the holders of Company Shares absent manifest error.

     
1.6 Issuance of Purchaser Stock Consideration.  
(a) Immediately prior to
the Effective Time, Purchaser shall (i) deliver to the Exchange Agent, in trust
for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares, certificates representing an
aggregate number of shares of Purchaser Stock as nearly as practicable equal to
the number of shares to be converted into Purchaser Stock as determined in
Section 1.5 and (ii) deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit
of the holders of Company Shares, an amount in cash equal to the cash to be paid
in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.5(g).

          
(b) As soon as practicable on the day of the Closing (but after the
     Effective Time), each holder of Company Shares converted into Purchaser
     Stock Consideration pursuant to Section 1.3(a), upon surrender to the
     Exchange Agent with a properly completed Letter of Transmittal (to the
     extent not previously surrendered with a Form of Election) of one or more
     Certificates for such Company Shares for cancellation, shall be entitled to
     receive (and the Exchange Agent shall deliver) certificates representing
     the number of shares of Purchaser Stock into which such Company Shares
     shall have been converted in the Merger and a bank check in an amount equal
     to any cash in lieu or fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.5(g).

                                       
A-5

          (c) No dividends or distributions that have been declared, if any,
     will be paid to persons entitled to receive certificates for shares of
     Purchaser Stock until such persons surrender their certificates for Company
     Shares, at which time all such dividends and distributions shall be paid.
     
In no event shall the persons entitled to receive such dividends be
     entitled to receive interest on such dividends.
If any certificate for such
     Purchaser Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the
     certificate for Company Shares surrendered in exchange therefor is
     registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the person
     requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or
     other taxes required by reason of issuance of certificates for such
     Purchaser Stock in a name other than the registered holder of the
     certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
     Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
     
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party
     hereto shall be liable to a holder of Company Shares for any Purchaser
     Stock or dividends thereon delivered to a public official pursuant to any
     applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

     
1.7 Payment of Cash Consideration.  
Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, Purchaser shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit
of the holders of Company Shares, an amount in cash equal to the Cash
Consideration to be paid to holders of Company Shares to be converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration as determined in Section 1.5.
As soon as
practicable on the day of the Closing (but after the Effective Time), the
Exchange Agent shall distribute to holders of Company Shares converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration and determined in Section 1.5, upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent (to the extent not previously surrendered with a
Form of Election) of one or more Certificates for such Company Shares for
cancellation, a bank check for an amount equal to the Cash Consideration times
the number of Company Shares so converted.
In no event shall the holder of any
such surrendered certificates be entitled to receive interest on any of the Cash
Consideration to be received in the Merger.
If such check is to be issued in the
name of a person other than the person in whose name the certificates for the
Company Shares surrendered for exchange therefor are registered, it shall be a
condition of the exchange that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to
the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of issuance of
such check to a person other than the registered holder of the certificates
surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of
Company Shares for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

     
1.8  Letters of Transmittal.  
Purchaser will instruct the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of record of Certificates who has not previously surrendered
such holder's Certificates with a validly executed Form of Election as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, (i) a Letter of Transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to such holder's Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as shall be agreed upon by the Company prior to the Effective Time)
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration (the "Letter of Transmittal").

     
1.9  Missing Certificates.  
If any holder of Company Shares convertible
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration is unable to deliver the
certificate which represents such shares, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to
such holder the Merger Consideration to which the holder is entitled for such
shares upon presentation of the following: (a) evidence to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Purchaser that any such certificate has been lost,
wrongfully taken or destroyed; (b) such security or indemnity as may be
reasonably requested by the Purchaser to indemnify and hold harmless the
Purchaser and the Exchange Agent; and (c) evidence satisfactory to the Purchaser
that such person is the owner of the shares theretofore represented by each
certificate claimed to be lost, wrongfully taken or destroyed and that the
holder is the person who would be entitled to present such certificate for
payment pursuant to this Agreement.

     
1.10  Options.

                                       
A-6

          (a)  
At the Effective Time, unless such options are otherwise
     cancelled pursuant to Section 1.10(d), Purchaser shall cause each holder of
     a then outstanding and unexercised option whether vested or unvested (the
     "Company Options"), to receive, by virtue of the Merger and without any
     action on the part of the holder thereof, options exercisable for shares of
     Purchaser Stock ("Purchaser Replacement Options") having substantially the
     same terms and conditions as the Company Options (including such terms and
     conditions as may be incorporated by reference into the agreements
     evidencing the Company Options pursuant to the plans or arrangements
     pursuant to which such Company Options were granted) except that the per
     share exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon exercise shall
     be divided and multiplied, respectively, by the Purchaser Stock
     Consideration, and rounded to the nearest whole cent or number,
     respectively.
Each Company Option or portion thereof, that is not vested
     pursuant to its original terms will remain unvested and all Purchaser
     Replacement Options will vest in accordance with the original terms of the
     Company Option; provided, however, that it is acknowledged for
     clarification purposes only, that all options that are outstanding under
     the Company's 1997 Independent Directors Stock Option Plan will become
     vested in accordance with the provisions of the plan prior to the Effective
     Time.
Purchaser shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that any Company
     Options that qualified as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the
     Code prior to the Effective Time continue to so qualify after the Effective
     Time.
Purchaser shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
     issuance a sufficient number of shares of Purchaser Stock for delivery upon
     the exercise of Purchaser Replacement Options after the Effective Time.

          
(b)  
At the Effective Time, any unvested restricted Company Shares
     awarded to employees, directors or consultants pursuant to any of the

     Outstanding Company Shares for purposes of this Article 1.

          (c)  
Promptly after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall file or cause
     to be filed all registration statements on Form S-8 or other appropriate
     form as may be necessary in connection with the purchase and sale of
     Purchaser Stock contemplated by the Purchaser Replacement Options
     subsequent to the Effective Time, and shall maintain the effectiveness of
     such registration statements (and maintain the current status of the
     prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as any of the
     Purchaser Replacement Options registered thereunder remain outstanding.
As
     soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall qualify under
     applicable state securities laws the issuance of such shares of Purchaser
     Stock issuable upon exercise of Purchaser Replacement Options.
Purchaser's
     Board of Directors shall take all actions necessary on the part of
     Purchaser to enable the acquisition of Purchaser Stock and Purchaser
     Replacement Options and subsequent transactions in Purchaser Stock after
     the Effective Time pursuant to Purchaser Replacement Options by persons
     subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Securities
     Exchange Act (as defined below) to be exempt from the application of
     Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, to the extent permitted
     thereunder.

          
(d)  
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable
     best efforts to obtain consents, releases and amendments to option
     agreements from holders of Company Options to the cancellation thereof in
     exchange for cash, all in accordance with terms to be specified by
     Purchaser.
For the purpose of this Agreement, "Company Stock Option Plans"
     means and includes the Company's 1997 Incentive Stock Option Plan, the
     Company's 1997 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan, and the Company's
     Independent Directors Stock Option Plan.

     1.11  Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.  
At and after the Effective
Time until the same have been duly amended, (i) subject to Section 5.9(a), the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be identical to
the Certificate of Incorporation of Purchaser in effect at the Effective Time
and (ii) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be identical to the

     in any material respect and to provide the Company with the information
     needed to correct such inaccuracy or omission.
Purchaser will furnish the
     Company with such supplemental information as may be necessary in order to

     Registration Statement at least such amount of time prior to each filing
     thereof as is customary in transactions of the type contemplated hereby.

     and of any supplements or amendments thereto, and Purchaser will furnish
     the Company with copies of all documents.
Except for the Prospectus/Proxy
     Statement or the preliminary prospectus/proxy statement, and except as
     otherwise required by law, neither Purchaser nor the Company shall

having a "Company Material Adverse Effect" means such state of facts, event,
change or effect that (a) has had, or is reasonably likely to have, a material

character of the property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the
business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except
where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing would
not be reasonably likely to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.
For the
purposes of this Agreement, any reference to a state of facts, event, change or
effect having a "Purchaser Material Adverse Effect" means any such state of
facts, event, change or effect that (a) has had, or is reasonably likely to
have, a material adverse effect on the business, results of operation, prospects
or financial condition of the Purchaser and the Purchaser Subsidiaries taken as
a whole or (b) would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the legality, binding nature or enforceability of this Agreement against the

Material Adverse Effect: (i) general business or economic conditions, (ii)
conditions generally affecting the industry in which the Purchaser competes,

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in

     even if the Company has not performed or complied with all agreements,
     covenants and obligations required by this Agreement to be so performed or
     complied with unless the failure to perform or comply with such agreements,
     obligations and covenants shall have had, or shall be reasonably likely to
     have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

          
(c)  Certificates and Other Deliveries.  
The Company shall have
     delivered, or caused to be delivered, to Purchaser (i) a certificate

     the date the Prospectus/Proxy Statement is first mailed to stockholders of
     the Company, substantially in the form of Exhibit 6.3(d) attached hereto,
     which opinion shall not have been withdrawn or modified in any material
     respect, and again dated as of the Closing Date.
For purposes of rendering
     its opinion, the Purchaser's tax counsel may rely on the statements and

6.4  Frustration of Conditions.

on the failure of any condition set forth in this Article VI to be satisfied if
such failure was caused by such party's failure to comply with or perform any of
its covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement.

                          TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT

     7.1  Termination.  
This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the stockholders of the
Company:

          (a)  
By mutual written consent of Purchaser and the Company.

          (b)  
By either Purchaser or the Company if:

             (i)  the Merger shall not have been consummated on or prior to June
        30, 2001 (the "Initial Closing Deadline"), provided that the Company or
        Purchaser, as applicable, may elect to extend the Initial Closing
        Deadline by notice to the Purchaser or Company, as applicable, for such
        period as may be appropriate, but not later than July 30, 2001, in
        connection with (1) Company's or Purchaser's efforts to cure any breach
        of any representation, warranty or covenant under this Agreement as to
        which it has been given notice by Purchaser or Company, as applicable,
        pursuant to this Agreement (including but not limited to Section
        7.1(c)), (2) obtaining the tax opinion referred to in Section 6.2(d),
        (3) obtaining the tax opinion referred to in Section 6.3(d), or (4)
        calling and holding the Company's stockholder meeting to consider the
        Company Proposals and to schedule and consummate the closing; and
        provided further that the Company or Purchaser, as applicable, may elect
        to extend the Initial Closing Deadline by notice to Purchaser or the
        Company, as applicable, for such period as may be appropriate, but not
        later than August 31, 2001, if the Registration Statement has not been
        declared effective at a time sufficient to allow the Company's
        stockholders meeting to consider the Company Proposals prior to the
        Initial Closing Deadline (the Initial Closing Deadline, as so extended
        by the Company or Purchaser, is referred to herein as the "Closing
        Deadline"), provided, however, that the right to terminate this
        Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)(i) shall not be available to
        any party whose failure to perform any of its obligations under this
        Agreement results in the failure of the Merger to be consummated by such
        time;

             (ii)  after the Company has called, given notice of, duly convened
        and held a meeting as required pursuant to Section 4.4, the vote of the
        Company's stockholders taken at such meeting or at any adjournment or
        postponement thereof, shall be insufficient to approve the Company
        Proposals; or

             (iii)  any Governmental Authority shall have issued an order,
        decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently enjoining,
        restraining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and
        such order, decree or ruling or other action shall have become final and
        nonappealable.

          
(c)  
By Purchaser if the Company shall have breached in any material
     respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants under this
     Agreement, such breach shall constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect,
     Purchaser shall have given written notice to the Company of such breach
     promptly after learning of the same, and such breach shall not be
     reasonably cured on or prior to the Closing Deadline.

          
(d)  
By the Company if the Purchaser shall have breached in any
     material respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants under
     this Agreement, and such breach shall constitute a Purchaser Material
     Adverse Effect, the Company shall have given written notice to the
     Purchaser of such breach promptly after learning of the same, and such
     breach shall not be reasonably cured on or prior to the Closing Deadline.

          
(e)  
By Purchaser if (i) the Board of Directors of the Company shall
     have withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Purchaser its approval or
     recommendation of the Company Proposals, or approved or recommended any
     Company Superior Transaction (as defined below) or failed within a
     reasonable time after the Registration Statement is declared effective by
     the SEC, to call the Company stockholder meeting to consider the Company
     Proposals or to mail the Prospectus/
                                       A-32

     Proxy Statement to its stockholders, or (ii) the Board of Directors of the
     Company shall have resolved to take any of the foregoing actions.

          
(f)  
By the Company if, prior to the approval of the Company Proposals
     by the stockholders of the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company
     determines in good faith by majority vote, with respect to any Company
     Takeover Proposal received by the Company after the date hereof, that the
     Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Transaction and is
     in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders and the Board of
     Directors of the Company has received the advice of its independent
     financial advisors as to whether the Company Takeover Proposal constitutes
     a Company Superior Transaction.
For purposes hereof, a "Company Superior
     Transaction" means a Company Takeover Proposal which the Board of Directors
     of the Company determines in good faith, by majority vote, is more
     favorable to the Company and its stockholders than the Merger.
Nothing in
     this Agreement shall prevent or limit the Company from providing
     information to, or discussing or negotiating with, any third person
     concerning any Company Takeover Proposal.
For purposes hereof, a "Company
     Takeover Proposal" means any proposal with respect to any recapitalization,
     merger, consolidation, or other business combination involving the Company,
     or the acquisition of 50% or more of the outstanding capital stock of the
     Company or any Significant Subsidiary (as defined in Regulation 12b-2
     promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act) of the Company or the
     acquisition of 50% or more of the assets of the Company and the Company
     Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single transaction or series of
     related transactions.

     
The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the preceding
     paragraphs shall give written notice of such termination to the other party
     in accordance with Section 8.5 hereof.

     
7.2  Effect of Termination and Abandonment.  
(a)
In the event of
termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this
Article 7, this Agreement (other than Sections 7.2, 8.1, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7,
8.8, 8.9, 8.10, 8.11, 8.12, 8.13, 8.14, 8.15 and 8.16) shall become void and of
no effect with no liability on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its
directors, officers, employees, agents, legal or financial advisors or other
representatives); provided, however, that no such termination shall relieve any
party hereto from any liability for any breach of this Agreement prior to
termination.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) in no event shall the Company be
liable or responsible for any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
unless the Purchaser terminates the Agreement on the basis of such breach and
(i) in the case of breaches of any representation or warranty the Company's
liability shall be limited to the lesser of the actual damages incurred by the
Purchaser as a direct result of such breaches and $9,000,000 and (ii) in the
case of a breach of a covenant, the Company's liability shall be limited to
payment of the Termination Fee as provided in Section 7.2(b); and (b) in no
event shall the Purchaser be liable or responsible for any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant unless the Company terminates the Agreement
on the basis of such breach and (i) in the case of breaches of any
representation, warranty or covenant the Purchaser's liability shall be limited
to the lesser of the actual damages incurred by the Company as a direct result
of such breaches and $9,000,000; provided, however, that the foregoing
limitation shall in no event apply in connection with any willful breach of a
material covenant in this Agreement resulting in the failure of the closing of
the Merger.
If this Agreement is terminated as provided herein, each party shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to redeliver all documents, work papers
and other material (including any copies thereof) of any other party relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby, whether obtained before or after the
execution hereof, to the party furnishing the same.

          
(b)  
In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any of
     the following:

             (i)  by Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i), but only if all of
        the following conditions are fully satisfied: (w) the only reason that
        the Effective Time has not occurred by the Closing Deadline is the
        failure of the Company's tax counsel to deliver the tax opinion
        contemplated in Section 6.2(d), (x) Purchaser has delivered a written
        confirmation from a nationally recognized tax counsel that it would
        execute and deliver the tax opinion contemplated in Section 6.2(d), (y)
        the Purchaser Tax Opinion Certificate and the Company Tax Opinion
        Certificate have been

                                       A-33

        delivered in substantially the forms agreed upon at the date of this
        Agreement, and (z) Purchaser has delivered to the Company the tax
        opinion of its tax counsel contemplated in Section 6.3(d); or

             (ii)  pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(ii); or

             (iii)  by Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.1(c) as a result of a
        breach by the Company of a covenant of the Company in this Agreement; or

             (iv)  after the date of this Agreement and prior to termination of
        this Agreement a bona fide Company Takeover Proposal shall have been
        made known to the Company or has been made directly to its stockholders
        generally or any person shall have publicly announced an intention
        (whether or not conditional) to make a bona fide Company Takeover
        Proposal (a "Competing Company Takeover Proposal"), and thereafter this
        Agreement is (x) terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(e)(i) and within six
        months of such termination the Company or any of the Company
        Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement as to such Competing
        Company Takeover Proposal, (y) terminated by Purchaser pursuant to
        Section 7.1(e), or (z) terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
        7.1(f),

     then the Company shall promptly pay Purchaser a fee equal to $9,000,000
     (the "Purchaser Termination Fee"), payable by wire transfer of same day
     funds.
The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
     Section 7.2(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
     this Agreement and that, without these agreements, Purchaser would not
     enter into this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no fee shall be
     paid pursuant to this Section 7.2(b) if Purchaser shall be in material
     breach of its obligations hereunder.
Purchaser acknowledges that payments
     made under this Section 7.2(b) shall constitute its exclusive remedy with
     respect to any termination of this Agreement that gives rise to such
     payment obligation.
The parties further acknowledge and agree that if the
     Termination Fee shall be payable by the Company to the Purchaser as
     provided in this Agreement that the Company shall have no other or further
     liability or responsibility to Purchaser for any breach of this Agreement
     or otherwise and the Purchaser's sole remedy shall be payment of the
     Termination Fee.

     (c)  
In the event of any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this
Article 7, Purchaser shall not hire or solicit for employment any officer or key
management employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.
For the
purposes of this Agreement, the term "key management employee" has the meaning
set forth in Section 7.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

                                   
ARTICLE 8

                                 MISCELLANEOUS

Unless (i) otherwise expressly provided in this

rules and regulations of, any applicable securities exchange, (iii) necessary to
secure any required Consents as to which the other party has been advised or
(iv) consented to in writing by Purchaser and the Company, any information or

regarding the nature and extent of the disclosure.
Nothing contained herein
shall preclude disclosures to the extent necessary to comply with accounting,
SEC and other disclosure obligations imposed by applicable Law.
To the extent
required by such disclosure obligations, Purchaser or the Company, after
consultation with the other party, may file with the SEC a Report on Form 8-K
pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act with respect to the Merger.
In
connection with any filing with the SEC of a proxy statement or amendment
thereto under the Securities Exchange Act, the Company or Purchaser, after
consultation with the other party, may include any information required to be
included therein with respect to the Merger with respect to the other party, and
thereafter distribute said proxy statement.
Purchaser and the Company shall
cooperate with the other
                                       A-34

and provide such information and documents as may be required in connection with
any such filings.
In the event the Merger is not consummated, each party shall
return to the other any documents furnished by the other and all copies thereof
any of them may have made and will hold in absolute confidence any information
obtained from the other party except to the extent (i) such party is required to
disclose such information by Law or such disclosure is necessary or desirable in
connection with the pursuit or defense of a claim, (ii) such information was
known by such party prior to such disclosure or was thereafter developed or
obtained by such party independent of such disclosure or (iii) such information
becomes generally available to the public other than by breach of this Section
8.1.
Prior to any disclosure of information pursuant to the exception in clause
(i) of the preceding sentence, the party intending to disclose the same shall so
notify the party which provided the name in order that such party may seek a
protective order or other appropriate remedy should it choose to do so.

This Agreement may be amended, modified
or supplemented only by a written agreement between the Company and Purchaser.

     
8.3  Waiver of Compliance; Consents.  
Any failure of a party or Purchaser
to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be
waived by the other party, only by a written instrument signed by the party
granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict
compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.
Whenever this Agreement requires or permits consent by or on behalf of
any party hereto, such consent shall be given in writing in a manner consistent
with the requirements for a waiver of compliance as set forth in this Section
8.3.

     8.4  Survival.  
The respective representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the Company and Purchaser contained herein or in any certificates

Article 8, which shall survive beyond the Effective Time in accordance with
their terms.

Terms used herein but not defined herein
shall have the meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement (defined below).

                                  
WITNESSETH:

     WHEREAS, The Holders own, in the aggregate, 27,905,755 shares of common
stock, $0.01 par value per share, of VSI Holdings, Inc., a Georgia corporation
(the "Company");

     
WHEREAS, Toth, through CLT, Toth Trust I and Toth Trust II, is deemed to

$0.01 par value per share, of the Company;

     WHEREAS, Mrs. Toth is deemed to control, and Toth is deemed to share,
through Child Trust and Spouse Trust, voting and dispositive powers, of
12,722,996 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company;

     WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger
by and among the Company and Purchaser dated as of the date hereof (the "Merger
Agreement"), the Company shall be merged with and into Purchaser (the "Merger");

     WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each of the Holders
shall be issued shares of Purchaser Stock in exchange for their respective
shares of the Company, in the amounts as determined as of the Effective Time;

     WHEREAS, as an inducement to Purchaser to consummate the Merger, and as a
condition to such merger, the Holders are entering into this Agreement.

     
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants
and agreements set forth below, the parties hereto agree as follows:

     
1.  INDEMNIFICATION.

          
(a) Effective only if the Effective Time shall occur, Toth will pay or
     reimburse each of Purchaser and its respective officers, directors,
     employees, agents, successors and assigns ("Purchaser Group") from and
     against and in respect of any Reimbursable Expenses, related to or arising
     out of any matter set forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto (a "Liability");
     provided, however, that any such Reimbursable Expense shall be paid and
     reimbursed solely out of the assets held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to
     the Stock Pledge and Escrow Agreement (the "Escrow Fund"); and provided
     further that Toth shall, except for his obligations hereunder, have no
     personal liability or obligation of any kind in respect of the Reimbursable
     Expenses and the Purchaser Group's sole recourse and remedy in respect of
     the Reimbursable Expenses shall be to the Escrow Fund.
For purposes hereof,
     "Reimbursable Expenses" shall mean and include only the amount of any
     damages (including incidental and consequential damages), losses,
     deficiencies, liabilities, costs, claims, penalties and expenses (including
     attorneys' and accountants' fees and the costs of investigation and defense
     and of enforcing or preserving their respective rights hereunder or with
     respect to a Liability).

                                       
B-1

          (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1(a) to the contrary,
     the aggregate amount of any Reimbursable Expenses that may be claimed by
     the Purchaser Group pursuant to the terms of Section 1(a) shall be limited
     to $6,500,000 (the "Limit"); provided, however, that the foregoing
     limitation shall be reduced on the first anniversary of the Effective Date
     so that any remaining responsibilities of Toth is no greater than (the
     "Lower Limit"): (a) $3,250,000 or (b) the aggregate amount claimed against
     the Purchaser Group with respect to any Liabilities then being contested
     plus the amount of any claims by the Purchaser Group for Reimbursable
     Expenses that may then be pending against the Escrow Fund (the "First
     Anniversary Pending Claims").

          (c) In the event that any claim or demand not pending on the date
     hereof and related to a Liability is asserted against or sought to be
     collected from the Purchaser Group by a third party (a "New Claim"), the
     Purchaser Group shall promptly notify Toth of the New Claim, specifying the
     nature of such claim or demand and the amount or the estimated amount
     thereof to the extent then feasible (which estimate shall not be conclusive
     of the final amount of such claim and demand) (the "Claim Notice");
     provided that the failure to provide such Claim Notice will not affect the
     payment and reimbursement obligations of Toth unless Toth is prejudiced
     thereby.
Toth's payment and reimbursement obligation as to any New Claim
     shall expire on the second anniversary of this Agreement; provided,
     however, that the expiration of such obligation shall have no effect on
     Toth's continuing obligation to pay or reimburse for Reimbursable Expenses
     relating to claims pending as of such second anniversary date which shall
     continue to be subject to the reimbursement or payment obligations set
     forth in this Agreement.

          
(d)
In determining the amount of any Reimbursable Expense which
     Purchaser Group is entitled to reimbursement or payment pursuant to Section
     1(a), there shall be subtracted an amount equal to (i) any net tax benefit
     (federal, State, local or foreign) realized by the Purchaser Group in
     connection with or by reason of such Reimbursable Expense, and (ii) all
     insurance proceeds actually received by the Purchaser Group by reason of
     such Reimbursable Expense (net of any retrospective or prospective
     insurance premium adjustments related to such claim charged to the
     Purchaser Group).

          
(e)  Payment of Reimbursable Expenses shall be due and payable on the
     date Purchaser Group incurs such Reimbursable Expense.
Toth shall pay to
     the Purchaser, within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Claim Notice,
     the amount of any claim for payment or reimbursement made pursuant to a
     Claim Notice.

          (f)  
Purchaser shall have the right to control the conduct of any
     litigation, action, suit, claim, proceeding or investigation related to a
     Liability; provided, however, no such claim shall be settled, adjusted or
     compromised, or the defense thereof terminated, without the prior consent
     of Toth, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
The Purchaser
     Group shall defend any claim, demand, action, lawsuit or proceeding in a
     commercially reasonable manner.

          
(g)  Toth shall pay, or reimburse the Purchaser Group, for any and all
     legal, consulting and investment banking fees, expenses and other fees
     incurred by the Company (including, without limitation, the fees of
     Deloitte & Touche and McDonald Investments) related to the negotiation of
     the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger in excess of
     $1,500,000.

     
2.  ESCROW OF PURCHASER STOCK.  
In order to secure the payment of Toth's
obligations under Section 1, Toth shall, on the Effective Date, pledge and
deposit that number of shares of Purchaser Stock (the "Pledged Stock") equal to
the Limit (based upon a per share price of the Purchaser Stock equal to $101.17)
with an escrow agent to be selected by Purchaser that is reasonably acceptable
to Toth (the "Escrow Agent"), to be governed in accordance with the Stock Pledge
and Escrow Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A
("Stock Pledge and Escrow Agreement").
The Escrow Agent shall, on the first
anniversary of the Effective Date (or the first business day thereafter if such
date is not a business day), tabulate the First Anniversary Pending Claims and,
if after subtracting the number of shares representing the value of the First
Year Claims (based upon a per share price (the "Applicable Price") of the
Purchaser Stock equal to $101.17) from the Pledged Stock (valued at the
                                       B-2

Applicable Price), the amount remains is greater than the Lower Limit, the
Escrow Agent shall release that amount of the remaining Pledged Stock as exceeds
the Lower Limit.
The Pledged Stock held under the Escrow Agreement shall be the
sole and exclusive source of repayment and/or reimbursement of Reimbursable
Expenses.

     
3.  RESTRICTION ON PURCHASER STOCK.

          
(a)  The Holders hereby agree that, for one (1) year from the
     Effective Date, they shall not sell, transfer or dispose of twenty-five
     percent (25%) or more of any Purchaser Stock received by each of them in
     the aggregate, during any ninety (90) day period.

          (b)  
Purchaser agrees that at all times during the one (1) year period
     after the Effective Date it will meet the information and reporting
     requirements of Rule 144(c) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933,
     as amended.

          (c)  
Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations, any Holder may sell,
     transfer or dispose of any shares of Purchaser Stock to any other person or
     entity in any transaction other than on the open market; provided that the
     transferee agrees to be bound by the restrictions in Section 3(a) as to the
     transferred shares of Purchaser Stock.

          
(d)  
The foregoing limitations shall automatically expire without
     notice or other action upon the first to occur of any of the following: (i)
     Purchaser shall effect or announce any intention to effect any "Rule 13e-3
     transaction" (as defined in Rule 13e-3 promulgated under the Securities
     Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), (ii) Purchaser shall enter into any
     letter of intent or definitive agreement with respect to any business
     combination or similar transaction in which the Purchaser shall not be the
     surviving corporation, (iii) Purchaser shall effect or announce any
     intention to effect a dissolution and liquidation of Purchaser, or (iv) any
     person or entity shall commence any tender offer, exchange offer or
     comparable transaction for all or any portion of the outstanding shares of
     Purchaser Stock.

     
4.  NONCOMPETITION AND NONSOLICITATION.

          
(a)  Toth agrees that for a period of five (5) years from the date
     hereof he will not, without the express written authorization of Purchaser,
     enter employment with, or directly or indirectly own an interest in, or
     manage, operate, control, or participate in the business of, any
     organization doing business anywhere in the world, whose business is in
     competition with that of the Purchaser or its respective subsidiaries or
     affiliates including without limitation the business of the Company as
     conducted immediately prior to the Merger; provided, however, that Toth
     shall be permitted to conduct the business of Advanced Animations, Inc.
as
     it is conducted as of the date hereof, and to conduct the business
     associated with assets and liabilities acquired pursuant to that certain
     Asset Purchase Agreement by and among Purchaser, PII Ventures, L.L.C. and
     Toth dated as of the date hereof, as such business is conducted as of the
     date hereof.
It is understood that while such authorization may be withheld
     for any reason in the sole discretion of Purchaser, such authorization
     shall not be unreasonably withheld.

          (b)  Toth further agrees that for a period of five (5) years from the
     date hereof he will not, without the express written authorization of
     Purchaser, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, divert or attempt to divert
     from Purchaser or its subsidiaries or affiliates, any customer or
     prospective customer of the Purchaser or its subsidiaries or affiliates
     (including without limitation any customer or prospective customer of the
     Company immediately prior to the Merger); or (ii) solicit, divert or
     attempt to, divert from the Purchaser or its subsidiaries or affiliates, or
     attempt to hire or hire on his behalf on or behalf of any other person or
     entity whatsoever, any employee or prospective employee of the Purchaser or
     its subsidiaries or affiliates who was an employee or prospective employee
     as of the time of the expiration of his obligations hereunder or was
     engaged by the Company, Purchaser or their respective subsidiaries or
     affiliates within six (6) months of such expiration.

                                       
B-3

          (c)  
Toth acknowledges and agrees that the above restrictions on his
     ability to compete with the Purchaser and its subsidiaries and affiliates,
     are reasonable in light of the Company's and Purchaser's significant
     business interests.
Toth acknowledges and agrees that he has received
     sufficient consideration to support his obligations under this Agreement.
     
Toth further acknowledges that his agreement to be bound by this Section 4

     Agreement and this Agreement.

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL

Board of Directors
VSI Holdings, Inc.
41000 Woodward Avenue
Bloomfield Hills, MI 48304

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point
of view, to the shareholders of VSI Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") of the
consideration to be received by the holders of the issued and outstanding shares
of the Company's Common Stock, $0.01 par value (the "Common Stock"), pursuant to
the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of March 24, 2001 (the "Agreement") by
and between the Company and SPX Corporation ("SPX").

     
You have advised us that, under the terms of the Agreement, and subject to
the terms and conditions set forth therein, at the effective time, the Company
will be merged with SPX (the "Merger") and the separate corporate existence of
the Company will cease.
Holders of the Company's Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will have the
right to receive, at the election of each holder, either (i) .043 of a share of
SPX's common stock per share of the Company's Common Stock held by that holder
(the "Purchaser Stock Consideration") or (ii) a combination of (a) the Purchaser
Stock Consideration for 55% of such holder's shares of the Company's Common
Stock and (b) $4.35 in cash, without any interest thereon, per share of the
Company's Common Stock for 45% of such holder's shares of the Company's Common
Stock (the "Cash/Stock Consideration").
We refer to the Purchaser Stock
Consideration and the Cash/Stock Consideration as the "Merger Consideration.
"

The Agreement further provides that the aggregate number of shares of the
Company's Common Stock to be converted into cash may not exceed 45% of the
Company's Common Stock.

     
McDonald Investments Inc., as part of its investment banking business, is
customarily engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive
biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private
placements and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes.

     
In connection with rendering this opinion, we have reviewed and analyzed,
among other things, the following: (i) the Agreement, including the exhibits and
schedules thereto; (ii) the Asset Purchase Agreement dated March 24, 2001 by and
among SPX Corporation, PII Ventures, L.L.C. and Steve Toth, Jr. (the "Asset
Purchase Agreement"); (iii) the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 24,
2001 by and between PII Ventures L.L.C. and Advanced Animations, Inc. ("Advanced
Animations Merger Agreement"); (iv) certain publicly available information
concerning the Company, including the Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company
for each of the years in the four year period ended September 30, 2000 and the
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company for the quarters ended December
31, 1999, March 31, 2000, June 30, 2000, and December 31, 2000; (v) certain
other internal information, primarily financial in nature, including
projections, concerning the business and operations of the Company furnished to
us by the Company for purposes of our analysis; (vi) certain publicly available
information concerning the trading of, and the trading market for, the Company's
Common Stock and SPX's common stock; (vii) certain publicly available
information concerning SPX, including the Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the
Company for each of the years in the four year period ended December 31, 2000
and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of SPX for the quarters ended March 31,
2000, June 30, 2000, and September 30, 2000; (viii) certain publicly available
information with respect to certain other companies that we believe to be
comparable to the Company or to SPX and the trading markets for

                                       C-1

certain of such other companies' securities; and (ix) certain publicly available
information concerning the nature and terms of certain other transactions that
we consider relevant to our inquiry.
We have also met with certain officers and
employees of the Company to discuss the business and prospects of the Company,
as well as other matters we believe relevant to our inquiry.

     
In our review and analysis and in arriving at our opinion, we have assumed
and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and other
information provided us or publicly available and have assumed and relied upon
the representations and warranties of the Company and SPX contained in the
Agreement.
We have not been engaged to, and have not independently attempted to,
verify any of such information.
We have also relied upon the management of the
Company as to the reasonableness and achievability of the financial and
operating projections (and the assumptions and bases therefor) provided to us
and, with your consent, we have assumed that such projections reflect the best
currently available estimates and judgments of such respective management of the
Company.
We have not been engaged to assess the reasonableness or achievability
of such projections or the assumptions on which they were based and express no
view as to such projections or assumptions.
In addition, we have not conducted a
physical inspection or appraisal of any of the assets, properties or facilities
of either the Company or SPX nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation
or appraisal.
We have also assumed that the conditions to the Merger as set
forth in the Agreement would be satisfied and that the Merger would be
consummated on a timely basis in the manner contemplated by the Agreement.
We
have had no independent discussions with SPX's management and have not had
access to any non-public information about SPX.

     
It should be noted that this opinion is based on economic and market
conditions and other circumstances existing on, and information made available
as of, the date hereof and does not address any matters subsequent to such date
including the value of SPX's common stock at the time of issuance thereof to the
holders of the Company's Common Stock.
In addition, our opinion is, in any
event, limited to the fairness, as of the date hereof, from a financial point of
view, to the Company's stockholders, of the Merger Consideration to be received
pursuant to the Merger, and does not address the Company's underlying business
decision to effect the Merger or any other terms of the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated thereby (including the Asset Purchase Agreement
and the Advanced Animations Merger Agreement).
It should be noted that although
subsequent developments may affect this opinion, we do not have any obligation
to update, revise or reaffirm our opinion.

     
In the ordinary course of our business, we may actively trade securities of
both the Company and SPX for our own account and for the accounts of customers
and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such
securities.

     
It is understood that this opinion is directed to the Board of Directors
and senior management of the Company and may not be disclosed, summarized,
excerpted from or otherwise publicly referred to without our prior written
consent.
Our opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of
the Company as to how such stockholder should vote at the stockholders' meeting
held in connection with the Merger.

     
We have received a fee for our services in rendering this Opinion, and the
Company has agreed to indemnify us against certain liabilities, including
liabilities arising under the federal securities laws.

     
Based upon and subject to the foregoing and such other matters as we
consider relevant, it is our opinion that as of the date hereof, the Merger
Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the stockholders of
the Company.
                                          
Very truly yours,
                                          /s/
McDonald Investments Inc.

                    INFORMATION NOTE REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS

ITEM 20.  
INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.

     
Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
authorizes and empowers SPX to indemnify the directors, officers, employees and
agents of SPX against liabilities incurred in connection with, and related
expenses resulting from, any claim, action or suit brought against any such
person as a result of his or her relationship with SPX, provided that those
persons acted in good faith and in a manner that person reasonably believed to
be in, and not opposed to, the best interests of SPX in connection with the acts
or events on which the claim, action or suit is based.
The finding of either
civil or criminal liability on the part of those persons in connection with the
acts or events is not necessarily determinative of the question of whether those
persons have met the required standard of conduct and are, accordingly, entitled
to be indemnified.
The foregoing statements are subject to the detailed
provisions of Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware.

     
SPX's Certificate of Incorporation provides that directors and officers of
SPX and those serving at the request of SPX as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation or entity will be indemnified by SPX to the fullest
extent authorized by Delaware law.
The indemnification right includes the right
to be paid by SPX the expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance
of its final disposition.
The indemnification rights conferred by SPX's
Certificate of Incorporation are not exclusive of any other right to which
persons seeking indemnification may be entitled under any law, bylaw, agreement,
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.
SPX is authorized
to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of its directors and officers.

     
In the merger agreement, SPX has agreed that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective
time of the merger now existing in favor of the current or former directors or
officers of VSI Holdings or any of its subsidiaries as provided in VSI Holdings'
Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws or in any agreement will survive the merger
and continue in full force and effect.
SPX will indemnify those persons to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law and will use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain and maintain in effect, or cause the surviving corporation to
obtain and maintain in effect, VSI Holdings' current directors' and officers'
liability insurance covering those persons who are currently covered by VSI
Holdings' insurance policy, provided that SPX will not be required to pay an
annual premium for that insurance in excess of 300% of the annual premiums
currently paid by VSI Holdings, but in that case must purchase as much coverage
as possible for that amount.

EXHIBITS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES

          (a)  Exhibits.

     
The Exhibits to this registration statement are listed in the Index to

          (b)  Financial Statement Schedules

     None.


ITEM 22.  
UNDERTAKINGS

     The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of
determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each filing of the
registrant's annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an
employee benefit plan's annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in the
registration statement will be deemed to be a new registration statement
relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities
at that time will be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.

                                       
II-1

     The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes as follows: that prior to any
public reoffering of the securities registered hereunder through use of a
prospectus which is part of this registration statement, by any person or party
who is deemed to be an underwriter within the meaning of Rule 145(c), the issuer
undertakes that such reoffering prospectus will contain the information called
for by the applicable registration form with respect to reofferings by persons
who may be deemed underwriters, in addition to the information called for by the
other items of the applicable form.

     
The registrant undertakes that every prospectus (i) that is filed pursuant
to the paragraph immediately preceding, or (ii) that purports to meet the
requirements of section 10(a)(3) of the Act and is used in connection with an
offering of securities subject to Rule 415, will be filed as a part of an
amendment to the registration statement and will not be used until such
amendment is effective, and that, for purposes of determining any liability
under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment will be
deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered
therein, and the offering of such securities at that time will be deemed to be
the initial bona fide offering thereof.

     
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act
of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the
registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant
has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is,
therefore, unenforceable.
In the event that a claim for indemnification against
such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred
or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the
successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such
director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being
registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter
has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate
jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public
policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of
such issue.

     
The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to respond to requests for
information that is incorporated by reference into the prospectus pursuant to
Items 4, 10(b), 11 or 13 of this Form, within one business day of receipt of
such request, and to send the incorporated documents by first class mail or
other equally prompt means.
This includes information contained in the documents
filed subsequent to the effective date of the registration statement through the
date of responding to the request.

     
The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to supply by means of a
post-effective amendment all information concerning a transaction, and the
company being acquired involved therein, that was not the subject of and
included in the registration statement when it became effective.

                                       
II-2

                                   SIGNATURES

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the
Registrant has duly caused this Registration Statement to be signed on its
behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of Muskegon
and State of Michigan on the 16th day of April, 2001.

Coverage of the Real Estate under all insurance policies of
Seller and its Affiliates shall cease as of the Closing Date, provided, however,
that Seller shall not cancel, or cause to be cancelled, coverage of the Real
Estate under any insurance policies maintained by, and in the sole name of,
Advanced Animations.
From and after the Closing Date, Buyer will be responsible
for obtaining and maintaining all insurance coverages with respect to the Real
Estate.
Buyer shall have no rights with respect to any insurance policies of
Seller.

     7.4.
Third Party Consents.
To the extent that Seller's rights under any
agreement, contract, commitment, lease, Authorization or other Acquired Asset to
be assigned to Buyer hereunder may not be assigned without the consent of
another Person which has not been obtained, this Agreement shall not constitute
an agreement to assign the same if an attempted assignment would constitute a
breach thereof or be unlawful, and Seller and Buyer shall use reasonable
commercial efforts to obtain any such required consent as soon as reasonably
possible.
If any such consent shall not be obtained or if any attempted
assignment would be ineffective or would impair Buyer's rights under the
Acquired Asset in question so that Buyer would not in effect acquire the benefit
of substantially all such rights, Seller, to the maximum extent permitted by
law, shall, if Buyer so requests, cooperate with Buyer in any reasonable
arrangement designed to provide such benefits thereunder to Buyer.
With respect
to, and to the extent of, any transfer, subcontract or assignment of the
contracts, agreements or commitments made to Buyer by Seller hereunder, Buyer
hereby agrees to assume, perform, discharge when due, and indemnify Seller from
and against, all obligations and liabilities of Seller with respect to the
applicable underlying contract, agreement or commitment.

     7.5.
Further Assurances.
Seller, from time to time after the Closing, at
Buyer's request, will execute, acknowledge and deliver to Buyer such other
instruments of conveyance and transfer and will take such other actions and
execute and deliver such other documents, certifications and further assurances
as Buyer may reasonably require in order to vest more effectively in Buyer, or
to put Buyer more fully in possession of, any of the Acquired Assets, including
the vesting of all assets of Advanced Animations pursuant to the Advanced
Animations Merger and the filing of all necessary documentation with the State
of Georgia and the State of Michigan, or to better enable Buyer to complete,
perform or discharge any of the Assumed Liabilities at the Closing.
Each of the
Parties will cooperate with the other and execute and deliver to the other
Parties such other instruments and documents and take such other actions as may
be reasonably requested from time to time by any other Party as necessary to
carry out, evidence and confirm the intended purposes of this Agreement.

     
7.6 Approvals for Advanced Animations Merger.
The Seller or VSI Sub shall
obtain and present to the Buyer at the Closing, all appropriate and required
Shareholder and Director approval of the Advanced Animations Merger.
Buyer shall
obtain and present to Seller at the Closing, all appropriate and required member
or limited liability company approval of the Advanced Animations Merger.

before the Closing: (i) by unanimous consent of Buyer and SPX; (ii) by Seller if
there is a breach of or failure by Buyer to perform in any material respect any

this Agreement or any of the conditions precedent set forth in Articles VIII and

ARTICLE XIV.

     14.1.

From and after the Closing, Seller will
reimburse, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its employees, agents,
successors and assigns ("Buyer Group") from and against and in respect of any
damages, losses, deficiencies, liabilities, costs and expenses (a "Loss")
incurred or suffered by any member of the Buyer Group that result from, relate
to or arise out of: (i) Seller's failure fully to pay or satisfy any of the
Excluded Liabilities in accordance with their terms; (ii) Seller's failure to
pay and report the Taxes associated with the Advanced Animations Merger which
the Seller recognizes is not a tax free merger under the Code; and (iii) any
breach or violation of any representation or warranty or nonfulfillment of any
agreement or covenant on the part of Seller under this Agreement.

     
14.2.
Indemnification by Buyer.
From and after the Closing, Buyer and Toth,
jointly and severally, will reimburse, indemnify and hold harmless Seller and
its officers, directors, employees, agents, successors or assigns ("Seller

breach or violation of any representation or warranty or non-fulfillment of any
agreement or covenant on the part of Buyer under this Agreement.

     14.3.

All covenants and all
representations and warranties made by the Parties in this Agreement or in any
Schedule furnished hereunder shall survive the Closing and remain

                                      -11-

in effect indefinitely.
Notwithstanding any investigation or audit conducted
before or after the Closing Date or the decision of any Party to complete the
Closing, each Party shall be entitled to rely upon the representations and
warranties set forth herein and therein.

     
14.4 Method of Asserting Claims, Etc.
In the event that any claim or demand
for which Seller would be liable to the Buyer Group is asserted against or
sought to be collected from the Buyer Group by a third party, the Buyer Group
shall Promptly notify Seller of such claim or demand, specifying the nature of
such claim or demand and the amount or the estimated amount thereof to the
extent then feasible (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount
of such claim and demand) (the "Claim Notice").
Seller shall have twenty days
from the personal delivery or mailing of the Claim Notice (the "Notice Period")
to notify the Buyer Group, (A) whether Seller disputes its liability to the
Buyer Group with respect to such claim or demand and (B) notwithstanding any
such dispute, whether it desires, at its sole cost and expense, to defend the
Buyer Group against such claim or demand.

          
(a)
In the event that Seller notifies the Buyer Group within the
     Notice Period that it desires to defend the Buyer Group against such claim
     or demand then, except as hereinafter provided, Seller shall have the right
     to defend the Buyer Group by appropriate proceedings, in which proceedings
     Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to settle or prosecute by them
     to a final conclusion in such a manner as to avoid any risk, to the extent
     reasonably possible, of the Buyer Group becoming subject to liability for
     any other matter; provided, however, Seller shall not, without the prior
     written consent of the Buyer, consent to the entry of any judgment against
     the Buyer Group or enter into any settlement or compromise which does not
     include, as an unconditional term thereof, the giving by the claimant or
     plaintiff to the Buyer Group of a release, in form and substance reasonably
     satisfactory to the Buyer, as the case may be, from all liability in
     respect of such claim or litigation.
If any of the Buyer Group desires to
     participate in, but not control, any such defense or settlement, it may do
     so at its sole cost and expense.
If, in the reasonable opinion of the
     Buyer, any such claim or demand or the litigation or resolution of any such
     claim or demand involves an issue or matter which could have a materially
     adverse effect on the business, operations, assets or properties of the
     Buyer Group, then the Buyer Group shall have the right to control the
     defense or settlement of any such claim or demand and its reasonable costs
     and expenses shall be included as part of the indemnification obligation of
     Seller hereunder; provided, however, that the Buyer Group shall not settle
     any such claim or demand without the prior written consent of Seller which
     consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
If the Buyer Group should elect
     to exercise such right, Seller shall have the right to participate in, but
     not control, the defense or settlement of such claim or demand at its sole
     cost and expense.

          
(b) If Seller elects not to defend the Buyer Group against such claim
     or demand, whether by not giving Buyer timely notice as provided above or
     otherwise, then the amount of any such claim or demand, or if the same be
     defended by Seller or by the Buyer Group (but none of the Buyer Group shall
     have any obligation to defend any such claim or demand), then that portion
     thereof as to which such defense is unsuccessful, in each case shall be
     conclusively deemed to be a liability of Seller hereunder, unless Seller
     shall have disputed its liability to the Buyer Group hereunder.

          
(c) In the event the Buyer Group should have a claim against Seller
     hereunder that does not involve a claim or demand being asserted against or
     sought to be collected from it by a third Party, Buyer shall Promptly send
     a Claim Notice with respect to such claim to Seller; provided that the
     failure to provide such Claim Notice will not affect the indemnification
     obligations of Seller unless Seller is prejudiced thereby.
If Seller does
     not notify the Buyer within the Notice Period that it disputes such claim,
     the amount of such claim shall be conclusively deemed a liability of Seller
     hereunder.

          
(d) All claims for indemnification by Seller Group under this
     Agreement shall be asserted and resolved under the procedures set forth
     above substituting in the appropriate place "Seller Group" for "Buyer
     Group" and "Buyer" for "Seller".

     
14.5.
Payment.
Upon the determination of liability under this Article XIV,
the appropriate Party shall pay to the other, as the case may be, within ten
(10) days after such determination, the amount of any claim for indemnification
made hereunder.

                                      -12-

     14.6.
Limitations.
Anything to the contrary in this Article XIV
notwithstanding:

          (a) Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify the Buyer Group or
     otherwise have liability to Buyer Group and neither Buyer nor Toth shall
     have any obligation to indemnify Seller Group or otherwise have any
     liability to Seller Group for consequential damages, special damages,
     incidental damages, indirect damages, punitive damages, lost profits or
     similar items.

          
(b) The Party entitled to indemnification shall take all reasonable
     steps to mitigate indemnifiable liabilities and damages upon and after
     becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be expected to give rise
     to any liabilities and damages that are indemnifiable hereunder.

          
(c)
To the extent that Seller discharges any claim for indemnification
     hereunder, Seller shall be subrogated to all rights of the Buyer Group
     against third parties.

     
14.7.
Exclusive Remedy.
The Parties acknowledge that their sole remedy
after the Closing for any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement (but specifically excluding the Overall Merger
Agreement and the Indemnity and Restriction Agreement) shall be the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article XIV.
In addition, each
Party acknowledges that all of its obligations in this Agreement to indemnify
any other Party are subject to and shall be in accordance with this Article XIV.

                                   
ARTICLE XV.

any, due as a result of the purchase, sale or transfer of the Acquired Assets in
accordance herewith (but for Excluded Liabilities and Taxes (except transfer
taxes set forth in Section 3.4) associated with the Advanced Animations Merger

     15.4.
Waiver.
Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived at any
time by the Party entitled to the benefit thereof by a written instrument duly
executed by such Party.
The waiver by either Party of a breach of any provision
of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any
subsequent breach.
