Morgan and Goldman Sachs began contacting parties about their interest in participating in the go-shop process.', 'During the go-shop period, representatives of J.P.\\xa0Morgan and Goldman Sachs contacted 10 potential strategic acquirors (including Party A and Party B).', 'Of such contacted parties, two potential strategic acquirors executed acceptable confidentiality agreements.', 'During the go-shop period, VMware provided confidential information in response to due diligence inquiries made by these two potential strategic acquirors.', 'At 11:59 p.m. Pacific time on July\\xa05, 2022, the go-shop period expired without any party submitting a proposal to acquire VMware.', 'VMware’s Reasons for the Transactions; Recommendation of the VMware Board of Directors At its May\\xa026, 2022 meeting held to evaluate the transactions, the VMware board of directors unanimously (i)\\xa0determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the transactions are fair to, and in the best interests, of VMware and the VMware stockholders, (ii)\\xa0determined that it is in the best interests of VMware and the VMware stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the merger agreement, (iii)\\xa0approved the execution and delivery by VMware of the merger agreement, the performance by VMware of its covenants and agreements contained therein and the consummation of the transactions upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement and (iv)\\xa0resolved to recommend that the VMware stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement.', 'The VMware board of directors recommends that VMware stockholders vote: 1.“FOR” the merger agreement proposal; 2.“FOR” the merger-related compensation proposal; and 3.“FOR” the adjournment proposal.', 'In evaluating the transactions and the merger agreement and arriving at its determination, the VMware board of directors consulted with VMware’s senior management, representatives of VMware’s financial advisors, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan and VMware’s outside legal counsel, Gibson Dunn, and considered a number of substantive factors, both positive and negative, and potential benefits and detriments of the transactions to VMware and its stockholders.', 'The VMware board of directors believed that, taken as a whole, the following factors supported its decision to approve the transactions:•Merger Consideration.', 'The value of the merger consideration to be received by VMware stockholders in relation to the market prices of VMware common stock prior to the VMware board of directors’ approval of the merger agreement.•Premium to Trading Price of VMware Common Stock.', 'The fact that the implied value per share of VMware common stock of $142.50 assuming a cash election and no proration, the implied value per 52\\n\\nshare of VMware common stock of $136.88 assuming a stock election and no proration and a blended value per share of VMware common stock of $139.69 (assuming proration of 50% cash and 50% equity based on the treatment of VMware common stock, stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units pursuant to the merger agreement), each calculated as of May\\xa020, 2022 (the last trading day prior to market speculation regarding the transactions), represented a premium of 49%, 43% and 46%, respectively, over the closing price per share of VMware common stock of $95.71 on May\\xa020, 2022.', 'The VMware board of directors also considered the fact that the implied value per share of VMware common stock of $142.50 assuming a cash election and no proration, the implied value per share of VMware common stock of $132.10 assuming a stock election and no proration and a blended value per share of VMware common stock of $137.30 (assuming proration of 50% cash and 50% equity based on the treatment of VMware common stock, stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units pursuant to the merger agreement), each calculated as of May\\xa024, 2022, represented a premium of 49%, 38% and 43%, respectively, over the closing price per share of VMware common stock of $95.71 on May\\xa020, 2022.•Uncertainty of Future Common Stock Market Price.', 'The uncertainty of VMware’s future stock market price if VMware remained independent.', 'The VMware board of directors considered VMware’s business, assets, financial condition, results of operations, management, competitive position and prospects, as well as current industry, economic and stock and credit market conditions.', 'The VMware board of directors also considered VMware’s long range plan and the initiatives and the potential execution risks associated with such plan.', 'In connection with these considerations, the VMware board of directors considered the attendant risk that if VMware remained independent, VMware common stock might not trade at levels equal to or greater than the value of the merger consideration in the near term, over an extended period of time or at all.•Negotiations with Broadcom.', 'The benefits that VMware and its advisors were able to obtain during its negotiations with Broadcom.', 'The VMware board of directors believed that the consideration reflected in the merger agreement was the best transaction that could be obtained by VMware stockholders at the time, and that there was no assurance that a more favorable opportunity to sell VMware would arise later or through any alternative transaction.', '•Stockholder Election Opportunity.', 'The fact that VMware stockholders would have the right to elect to receive the merger consideration either in cash or shares of Broadcom common stock, subject to proration.•Significant Portion of Merger Consideration in Cash.', 'The fact that 50% of the merger consideration will be paid in cash, giving VMware stockholders the opportunity to immediately realize value for a significant portion of their investment and providing certainty of value.', 'The VMware board of directors also considered the fact that VMware stockholders would be able to reinvest the cash consideration received in the transactions in shares of Broadcom common stock if they desired to do so.•Participation in Potential Upside.', 'The benefits of Broadcom that could result from the transactions, including the potential to realize synergies.', 'The VMware board of directors also considered the fact that, since a portion of the merger consideration will be paid in shares of Broadcom common stock, VMware stockholders will benefit from an approximately 12% pro forma continuing equity ownership in Broadcom (based on share data of VMware and Broadcom on May\\xa024, 2022) and have the opportunity to participate in any future earnings or growth of Broadcom and future appreciation in the value of Broadcom common stock following the transactions should they determine to retain the shares of Broadcom common stock payable in the transactions.•Fixed Exchange Ratio for Stock Portion of Merger Consideration.', 'The fact that because the stock consideration is based on a fixed exchange ratio of 0.25200 of a share of Broadcom common stock, VMware stockholders receiving a portion of the merger consideration in shares of Broadcom common stock will have the opportunity to benefit from any increase in the trading price of shares of Broadcom common stock between the announcement of the merger agreement and the completion of the transactions and that the cash portion of the merger consideration will limit the impact of a decline in the trading price of Broadcom common stock on the aggregate value of the merger consideration.53\\n\\n•Tax Treatment.', 'The fact that the transactions are intended to qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment, as described in greater detail under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.”•Expected Cost Synergies.', 'The expectation that Broadcom will recognize anticipated cost synergies following consummation of the transactions, which VMware stockholders will benefit from as continuing stockholders of Broadcom.', 'The VMware board of directors also considered that there could be no assurance that any particular amount of such synergies would be achieved following completion of the transactions or the timeframe in which they would be achieved.•Financial Analyses and Opinion of Goldman Sachs.', 'The oral opinion of Goldman Sachs rendered to the VMware board of directors, subsequently confirmed by delivery of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated May\\xa026, 2022, that, as of the date of such written opinion and based upon and subject to the various limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the aggregate merger consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Broadcom and its affiliates) of shares of VMware common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.', 'The opinion is more fully described in the section titled “—Opinion of Goldman Sachs” and the full text of the opinion is attached as Annex\\xa0D to this proxy statement/prospectus.', 'The VMware board of directors considered that Goldman Sachs, in connection with delivering its opinion, performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses described in the section titled “—Opinion of Goldman Sachs.”•Financial', 'Analyses and Opinion of J.P. Morgan.', 'The oral opinion of J.P. Morgan rendered to the VMware board of directors on May\\xa026, 2022, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion, dated May\\xa026, 2022, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth in its opinion, the merger consideration to be paid to holders of VMware common stock in the transactions was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.', 'The opinion is more fully described in the section titled “—Opinion of J.P. Morgan” and the full text of the opinion is attached as Annex\\xa0E to this proxy statement/prospectus.', 'The VMware board of directors considered that J.P. Morgan, in connection with delivering its opinion, performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses described in the section titled “—Opinion of J.P. Morgan.”•Likelihood of Consummation.', 'The likelihood that the transactions would be completed, in light of, among other things, the conditions to the transactions, the absence of a financing condition, and the efforts required to obtain regulatory approvals.•Board Representation.', 'The fact that one member of the VMware board of directors, to be mutually agreed by VMware and Broadcom, will join the Broadcom board of directors.•Terms of the Merger Agreement.', 'The terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including:•the representations, warranties and covenants of the parties, the conditions to the parties’ obligations to complete the transactions and their ability to terminate the merger agreement;•the provisions of the merger agreement that permit VMware, during a 40-day go-shop period, to solicit alternative proposals from third parties;•the provisions of the merger agreement that allow VMware to engage in negotiations with, and provide information to, a third party that makes a written bona fide acquisition proposal following the go-shop period that did not result from a breach of VMware’s non-solicitation obligations, if the VMware board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a transaction that is superior to the transactions and VMware complies with certain procedural requirements;•the provisions of the merger agreement that allow the VMware board of directors to change its recommendation in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement in response to a superior proposal and terminate the merger agreement in order to accept a superior proposal if the VMware board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that an acquisition proposal is a superior proposal and, after consultation 54\\n\\nwith its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the VMware board of directors’ fiduciary duties (including taking into account any modifications to the terms of the merger agreement that are proposed by Broadcom and, in connection with the termination of the merger agreement, payment to Broadcom of a $750\\xa0million termination fee for termination during the go-shop period or a $1.5\\xa0billion termination fee for termination following the go-shop period), subject to VMware’s compliance with certain procedural requirements;•the provisions of the merger agreement that allow the VMware board of directors to change its recommendation in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement (other than in response to the receipt of a written bona fide acquisition proposal, which is subject to the preceding sub-bullet above) if the VMware board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its directors’ fiduciary duties (including taking into account any modifications to the terms of the merger agreement that are proposed by Broadcom), subject to VMware’s compliance with certain procedural requirements;•the belief of the VMware board of directors that the payment of either the $1.5\\xa0billion termination fee or the $750\\xa0million termination fee, as applicable, were not likely to unduly discourage competing third-party proposals or reduce the price of such proposals and that the lower $750\\xa0million termination fee would make it more likely for potential acquirors to consider making a superior proposal, that such termination fees and provisions are customary for transactions of this size and type, and that the sizes of the respective termination fees were reasonable in the context of comparable transactions; •the fact that upon termination of the merger agreement in certain circumstances, Broadcom would be required to pay to VMware a $1.5\\xa0billion termination fee that would help offset some of the costs of the transaction; and•the ability of VMware to specifically enforce the terms of the merger agreement.•Timing Considerations.', 'The belief of the VMware board of directors that the benefits of soliciting interest from other potential parties were outweighed by a number of risks, including that such solicitation would further increase market speculation and jeopardize or, at a minimum, delay the transactions.', 'The VMware board of directors also observed that VMware had the right to solicit alternative proposals during the go-shop period and that VMware retained the ability to consider unsolicited proposals after the go-shop period until the meeting of the VMware stockholders to vote on the merger agreement proposal and to enter into an agreement with respect to an acquisition proposal under certain circumstances (concurrently with terminating the merger agreement and paying the $1.5\\xa0billion termination fee or the $750\\xa0million termination fee, as applicable).•Strategic Benefits.', 'The VMware board of directors considered that the transactions are expected to provide a number of significant strategic opportunities, including the following (not necessarily listed in order of relative importance): •the transaction would synergistically combine VMware’s proven technology offerings with Broadcom’s broader capabilities.', 'Broadcom would facilitate a diversity of service offerings, client relationships, geographies and end markets and offer enterprise customers greater choice, value and flexibility to address complex IT infrastructure challenges;•the complementary nature of each company’s solutions and platforms; and•the expectation that the transactions would result in a company with increased capabilities and world-class products in core market segments that will be uniquely positioned to serve, facilitate and power the markets of the future.•Broadcom’s Business and Reputation.', 'The results of the due diligence investigation that VMware’s senior management conducted with the assistance of its advisors on Broadcom with respect to certain 55\\n\\nmatters and Broadcom’s business reputation and capabilities of Broadcom and its management.', 'The VMware board of directors also considered Broadcom’s strong track record as an experienced acquirer, which is likely to facilitate an effective and timely integration of VMware’s business and operations.•Financing Strength of Broadcom.', 'The fact that Broadcom has obtained committed debt financing for the transactions from reputable financial institutions and likelihood that Broadcom would be able to finance the transactions given Broadcom’s financial resources and financial profile.•Availability of Appraisal Rights.', 'The fact that appraisal rights would be available to holders of VMware common stock under Delaware law and that there was no condition in the merger agreement relating to the maximum number of shares of VMware common stock that could exercise appraisal rights.•MSD Stockholders and SL Stockholders Voting Agreements.', 'The support of the transactions by the MSD stockholders and the SL stockholders, as evidenced by the execution of the voting agreements.', 'The VMware board of directors also considered certain potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the transactions, including the following: •Fixed Stock Ratio of Merger Consideration.', 'The fact that because the stock portion of the merger consideration is a fixed exchange ratio of shares of Broadcom common stock to VMware common stock, VMware stockholders could be adversely affected by a decrease in the trading price of Broadcom common stock during the pendency of the transactions and the fact that the merger agreement does not provide VMware with a termination right or other similar protection relating to the trading price of Broadcom common stock.', 'The VMware board of directors determined that this structure was appropriate and the risk acceptable in view of factors such as:•the VMware board of directors’ review of the relative intrinsic values and financial performance of Broadcom and VMware; and •the fact that VMware stockholders may elect cash consideration, subject to proration, which limits the impact of a decline in the trading price of Broadcom common stock on the value of the merger consideration.•Possible Failure to Achieve Synergies.', 'The risk that the potential benefits and synergies sought in the transactions will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period, and the risk associated with the integration by Broadcom of VMware.•Smaller Ongoing Equity Participation in Broadcom by VMware Stockholders.', 'The fact that because only 50% of the merger consideration will be in the form of Broadcom common stock, VMware stockholders will have a smaller ongoing equity participation in Broadcom (and, as a result, a smaller opportunity to participate in any future earnings or growth of Broadcom and future appreciation in the value of Broadcom common stock following the completion of the transactions) than they have in VMware.•Risk of Non-Completion.', 'The possibility that the transactions might not be completed, including as a result of the failure to obtain regulatory approvals or the failure of VMware stockholders to approve the merger agreement proposal, and the effect the resulting public announcement of the termination of the merger agreement may have on:•the trading price of VMware common stock; and•VMware’s business and operating results, particularly in light of the costs incurred in connection with the transactions.•Possible Deterrence of Competing Offers.', 'The risk that various provisions of the merger agreement, including the requirement that VMware must pay to Broadcom a termination fee of either $750\\xa0million if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances during the go-shop period or $1.5\\xa0billion if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances following the expiration of the go-shop period, may discourage other parties potentially interested in an acquisition of, or combination with, VMware from pursuing that opportunity.56\\n\\n•Possible Disruption of the Business and Costs and Expenses.', 'The possible disruption to VMware’s business that may result from the transactions, the resulting distraction of VMware’s management and potential attrition of VMware’s employees, as well as the costs and expenses associated with completing the transactions.•Restrictions on Operation of VMware’s Business.', 'The requirement that VMware conduct its business in a commercially reasonable manner and in all material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice prior to completion of the transactions.', '•Impact of Announcement.', 'The uncertainty about the effect of the transactions, regardless of whether the transactions are completed, on VMware’s employees, customers and other parties, may impair VMware’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel, and could cause customers, suppliers and others to seek to change existing business relationships with VMware, and the potential for litigation arising in connection with the transactions.', '•Need to Obtain Required Regulatory Clearances.', 'The fact that completion of the transactions would require approval, or expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods, under the HSR Act and other applicable non-U.S. antitrust laws.•Other Risks.', 'The risks described under “Risk Factors” beginning on page 25.', 'The VMware board of directors concluded that the potentially negative factors associated with the transactions were significantly outweighed by the potential benefits that it expected the VMware stockholders would achieve as a result of the transactions, including the belief of the VMware board of directors that the transactions would maximize the immediate value of VMware stockholders’ shares and minimize the risks and uncertainty affecting the future prospects of VMware, including the potential execution risks associated with its stand-alone financial plan.', 'Accordingly, the VMware board of directors unanimously (i)\\xa0determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the transactions are fair to, and in the best interests, of VMware and the VMware stockholders, (ii)\\xa0determined that it is in the best interests of VMware and the VMware stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the merger agreement, (iii)\\xa0approved the execution and delivery by VMware of the merger agreement, the performance by VMware of its covenants and agreements contained therein and the consummation of the transactions upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement and (iv)\\xa0resolved to recommend that the VMware stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement.', 'In addition, the VMware board of directors was aware of and considered the interests that VMware’s directors and executive officers may have with respect to the transactions that differ from, or are in addition to, the interests of stockholders of VMware generally, as described under “—Interests of VMware’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions.', '”The', 'foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the VMware board of directors is not exhaustive, but VMware believes it includes all the material factors considered by the VMware board of directors.', 'In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the transactions and the complexity of these matters, the VMware board of directors did not consider it practicable to, and did not attempt to, quantify or otherwise assign relative or specific weight or values to any of these factors.', 'Rather, the VMware board of directors viewed its position and recommendation as being based on an overall analysis and on the totality of the information presented to and factors considered by it.', 'In addition, in considering the factors described above, individual directors may have given different weights to different factors.', 'The VMware board of directors based its unanimous recommendation on the totality of the information presented.', 'This explanation of VMware’s reasons for the transactions and other information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors described under “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”Certain', 'Financial Projections Utilized by the VMware Board of Directors and VMware’s Financial AdvisorsWhile VMware has from time to time provided limited financial guidance to investors, VMware’s management does not, as a matter of course, otherwise publicly disclose forecasts or internal projections as to future performance due to, among other things, the inherent difficulty of predicting financial performance for future periods and the likelihood that the underlying assumptions and estimates may not be realized.', 'In connection with the

Morgan and such affiliates have received customary compensation.', 'Such services during such period for Broadcom have included acting as joint lead arranger and bookrunner on its revolving credit facility in January 2021 and joint lead bookrunner on an offering of debt securities in January 2021.', 'Such services during such period for VMware have included acting as joint lead arranger and bookrunner on a revolving credit facility in November 2021, joint lead bookrunner on an offering of debt securities in July 2021, and financial advisor to VMware on the VMware spin-off in November 2021.', 'Such services during such two-year period for Silver Lake and Silver Lake portfolio companies have included extending loans and providing debt syndication, equity underwriting, debt underwriting, private bank lending and capital raising and/or financial advisory services, for which J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have received customary compensation, and, in the case of such services provided to Silver Lake, in amounts not material to J.P. Morgan.', 'In addition, J.P. Morgan’s commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of VMware and Silver Lake portfolio companies, for which it receives customary compensation or other financial benefits.', 'During the two year period preceding delivery of its opinion, the aggregate fees recognized by J.P. Morgan from VMware were approximately $45\\xa0million, from Broadcom were approximately $13\\xa0million, and from Silver Lake and its portfolio companies were approximately $128\\xa0million.', 'In the ordinary course of their businesses, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of VMware or Broadcom for their own accounts or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, they may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.', 'Interests of VMware’s Directors and Executive Officers in the TransactionsWhen considering the recommendation of the VMware board of directors with respect to the transactions, you should be aware that VMware’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the transactions that 75\\n\\nare different from, or in addition to, those of VMware stockholders more generally.', 'The VMware board of directors was aware of these interests during its deliberations on the merits of the transactions and considered them in deciding to recommend that VMware stockholders vote to adopt the merger agreement.', 'As described below, the interests of VMware non-employee directors and executive officers include the following:•accelerated vesting of restricted stock units held by non-employee directors and conversion of time-based restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units held by executive officers into Broadcom restricted stock units and the “double trigger” accelerated vesting of such converted awards; •a seat on Broadcom’s board of directors for one VMware director, to be mutually agreed by VMware and Broadcom, following the closing of the transactions; •potential severance benefits in the event of certain qualifying terminations of employment upon or following the closing of the transactions; and•the right to indemnification and liability insurance coverage that will survive the closing of the transactions.', 'VMware’s executive officers (all of whom are named executive officers for purposes of the discussion below) are the following: Raghu Raghuram, Zane Rowe, Sumit Dhawan, Jean-Pierre Brulard and Amy Fliegelman Olli.', 'Patrick Gelsinger and Sanjay Poonen are also deemed to be named executive officers, but because they separated from employment with VMware on February\\xa012, 2021 and August\\xa06, 2021, respectively, they will not receive any benefit that is payable or that may become payable that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the transactions other than the merger consideration in respect of any shares of VMware common stock that they own, and they are not included in the disclosure below.', 'Certain AssumptionsExcept as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in this section, the following assumptions were used:•A per share price of VMware common stock of $130.09, which is the average closing price of VMware common stock on the New York Stock Exchange over the first five business days following the first public announcement of the transactions on May\\xa026, 2022; •The effective time of the second merger is July\\xa013, 2022; and•The employment of each VMware executive officer was terminated by VMware without cause or by the executive officer for good reason, in either case, immediately following the effective time of the second merger.', 'Treatment of VMware Equity AwardsVMware’s non-employee directors and executive officers hold certain time-based VMware restricted stock unit awards and performance-based VMware restricted stock unit awards.', 'No executive officers or non-employee directors hold any outstanding stock options.', 'Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the second merger, outstanding VMware restricted stock unit awards and performance-based VMware restricted stock unit awards will be treated as follows, subject to all required withholding taxes: •each outstanding VMware restricted stock unit award held by a non-employee director will become vested and will be cancelled in exchange for the right of the holder to receive, in respect of each share of VMware common stock subject to such award, a payment equal to 50% of the cash consideration and 50% of the stock consideration;•each outstanding time-based VMware restricted stock unit award that is not held by a non-employee director will be converted into a Broadcom restricted stock unit award based on an equity award exchange ratio calculated as (i)\\xa0the sum of (1) 50% of the stock consideration and (2) 50% of the cash consideration divided by (ii)\\xa0the Broadcom trading price; and76\\n\\n•each outstanding performance-based VMware restricted stock unit award will be converted into a Broadcom restricted stock unit award using the same formula described in the above bullet, provided that (i)\\xa0for each such award granted under the VMware operating performance stock unit plan, performance goals will be deemed achieved (1) at the actual level with respect to performance periods completed prior to the closing of the transactions, or (2) at target level with respect to performance periods not completed prior to the closing of the transactions; and (ii)\\xa0for each such award that was granted under the VMware TSR performance stock unit plan, performance will be measured at the closing of the transactions based on the actual level of achievement of the applicable performance goals based on the value of merger consideration (with the value of the stock consideration calculated for such purpose based on the Broadcom trading price).Pursuant to the VMware, Inc.', 'Change in Control Retention Plan (referred to as the CIC Plan) as described below, if a VMware executive officer’s employment is terminated by VMware without “cause” or due to the executive officer’s resignation for “good reason”, in each case, within 12 months following a change in control of VMware, all such equity awards then held by such executive officer would fully vest upon such termination of employment.', 'These “double trigger” vesting provisions applicable to VMware equity awards held by executive officers will continue to apply to such awards after such awards are converted to Broadcom restricted stock unit awards at the effective time of the second merger.', 'See the section titled “Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to VMware’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Transactions” below for the estimated value of each VMware named executive officer’s unvested VMware equity awards.', 'Based on the assumptions described above under “—Certain Assumptions,” the estimated aggregate value of the unvested VMware equity awards held by non-employee directors is $2,071,683.Change in Control Retention PlanEach VMware executive officer is eligible to receive change in control benefits pursuant to the CIC Plan upon an involuntary termination without cause or a resignation for good reason, in each case, within 12 months following a change in control of VMware (each such term as defined in the CIC Plan).', 'The transactions constitute a change in control for purposes of the CIC Plan.', 'Upon a qualifying termination under the CIC Plan, subject to execution of a release of claims in favor of VMware, each executive officer is eligible to receive:•a lump sum payment equal to 1.5 times (or 2.0 times for Mr.\\xa0Raghuram) the sum of the executive officer’s highest annual base salary and highest target annual bonus, in each case measured during the protected period (as defined in the CIC Plan);•a lump sum payment equal to the value of 18 months (or 24 months for Mr.\\xa0Raghuram) of health insurance premiums, which are equal to 150% of the monthly cost required to obtain continuation coverage for the executive officer and their covered dependents; and•full accelerated vesting of outstanding equity awards.', 'The CIC Plan does not provide for any tax gross-ups.', 'In the event the executive officer would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the benefits to the executive officer will be reduced to the extent that such benefits do not trigger the excise tax unless the executive officer would retain greater value (on an after-tax basis) by receiving all benefits and paying applicable excise, income and payroll taxes.', 'See the section titled “—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to VMware’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Transactions” below for an estimate of the value of the payments and benefits that each of VMware’s named executive officers would receive under the CIC Plan upon a qualifying termination of employment immediately following the effective time of the second merger.', 'Board Seat on the Broadcom Board of DirectorsPursuant to the merger agreement, one member of the VMware board of directors, to be mutually agreed by VMware and Broadcom, will be added to Broadcom’s board of directors.77\\n\\nPotential Employment Arrangements with BroadcomAny of VMware’s executive officers who become officers or employees or who otherwise are retained to provide services to Broadcom or Broadcom Merger Subs may, prior to, on, or following the closing of the transactions, enter into new individualized compensation arrangements with Broadcom or Broadcom Merger Subs and may participate in cash or equity incentive or other benefit plans maintained by Broadcom or Broadcom Merger Subs.', 'As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, no new individualized compensation arrangements between VMware’s executive officers and Broadcom or Broadcom Merger Subs have been established.', 'Indemnification and Insurance Under the merger agreement, for a period of six years after the effective time of the second merger, the entity into which VMware converted in connection with its conversion into a limited liability company (referred to as the VMware Converted LLC) must, and Broadcom must cause VMware Converted LLC to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and the organizational documents of VMware or its subsidiaries, or any indemnification agreements in existence as of the date of the merger agreement that were provided to Broadcom prior to the date of the merger agreement, each current and former director and officer of VMware and its subsidiaries against any costs and expenses in connection with any actual or threatened claims in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the effective time of the second merger, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the effective time of the second merger, in connection with such person serving as an officer, director, employee or agent of another corporation or of a limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity if such service was at the request of VMware.', 'In addition, for a period of six years following the effective time of the second merger, Broadcom is required to maintain in effect the provisions in the organizational documents of VMware and any indemnification agreements in existence as of the date of the merger agreement that were provided to Broadcom (except to the extent such agreement provides for an earlier termination) regarding elimination of liability, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of expenses that are in existence as of the date of the merger agreement.', 'At or prior to the effective time of the second merger, VMware is required to purchase a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance “tail” insurance policy for a period of six years after the effective time of the second merger with respect to matters arising at or prior to the effective time of the second merger, and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance prior to the date of the merger agreement.', 'For a more detailed

table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC’s Regulation\\xa0S-K, which requires disclosure of information about the compensation that is payable or that may become payable to each named executive officer of VMware that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the transactions.', 'For additional details regarding the terms of the payments and benefits described below, see the discussion under the caption “—Interests of VMware’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions” above.', 'The amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the table.', 'As a result, the amount, if any, that a named executive officer actually receives in the transactions may materially differ from the amounts set forth in the table.', 'For purposes of calculating the amounts set forth in the table, the following assumptions were used:•A per share price of VMware common stock of $130.09, which is the average closing price of VMware common stock on the New York Stock Exchange over the first five business days following the first public announcement of the transactions on May\\xa026, 2022; 78\\n\\n\\nFinancing of the TransactionsThe transactions are not conditioned upon any financing arrangements or contingencies.', 'Broadcom anticipates that the funds needed to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be derived from a combination of cash on hand and third party debt financing.', 'In connection with its entry into the merger agreement, Broadcom entered into a debt commitment letter on May\\xa026, 2022 with certain financial institutions, which was amended, restated and superseded in its entirety by an amended and restated commitment letter entered into by Broadcom on June\\xa022, 2022 (such amended and restated commitment letter, referred to as the debt commitment letter) with certain financial institutions pursuant to which such financial institutions committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions of the debt commitment letter, a senior unsecured bridge facility in aggregate principal amount of approximately $32\\xa0billion.', 'The availability of the bridge facility is conditioned on the consummation of the transactions in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement (subject to certain customary exceptions and qualifications) and certain other customary conditions.', 'Broadcom expects to replace the commitments in respect of the bridge facility prior to the consummation of the transactions with the proceeds of the issuance of one or more series of senior unsecured debt securities and/or other incurrences of indebtedness (or commitments in respect thereof).Accounting Treatment of the Transactions', 'The transactions will be accounted for as a business combination, with Broadcom using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification 805, Business Combinations, and, accordingly, will generally result in the recognition of VMware assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value.', 'However, as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the valuation studies necessary to estimate the fair values of the assets acquired (including intangible assets, such as completed technology, customer relationships and customer lists, and trademarks and trade names) and liabilities assumed have been performed based on publicly available benchmarking information as well as a variety of other assumptions, including market participant assumptions, as there are limitations to the type of information that can be exchanged between Broadcom and VMware at this time.', 'Until the transactions are complete, Broadcom will not have complete access to all the relevant information.', 'Differences between these preliminary estimates and the final acquisition accounting will occur and there can be no assurances that the final valuations will not result in material changes to this preliminary purchase price allocation.', 'The excess of the consideration transferred over the identifiable net assets acquired reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information will be allocated to goodwill.', 'A final determination of these fair values will reflect appraisals prepared by independent third-parties and will be based on the actual tangible and intangible assets and liabilities that exist as of the acquisition date.', 'The actual allocation of the consideration transferred may differ from the allocation assumed in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and may result in adjustments to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.', 'Material U.S. Federal Income Tax ConsequencesThe following general discussion addresses the material U.S. federal income tax considerations to U.S. holders (as defined below) of VMware common stock that exchange their VMware common stock for the merger consideration in the transactions.', 'The discussion is based on the Code, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, administrative rulings, published positions of the IRS and judicial decisions, all as currently in effect and all of which are subject to change and to differing interpretations (possibly with retroactive effect), and any such change or interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion.', 'This discussion applies only to U.S. holders that hold their VMware common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section\\xa01221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment).', 'This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal taxation that may be relevant to a particular holder in light of his, her or its individual circumstances or to holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, including:•banks or other financial institutions,•mutual funds,•tax exempt organizations,•governmental agencies or instrumentalities,80\\n\\n•insurance companies,•dealers in securities or non-U.S. currency,•traders in securities who elect to apply a mark-to-market method of accounting, •entities or arrangements

liable for the alternative minimum tax,•holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar,•holders who received their VMware common stock through the exercise of employee stock options, through a tax-qualified retirement plan or otherwise as compensation,•holders that hold (or that held, directly or constructively, at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the disposition of such holder’s VMware common stock pursuant to the transactions) 5% or more of VMware common stock (by vote or value), •holders required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income as a result of such income being recognized on an “applicable financial statement,” and•holders who hold VMware common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion transaction or other integrated investment.', 'In addition, this discussion does not address any state, local or foreign tax considerations of the transactions, nor does it address the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (including the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered into pursuant thereto or in connection therewith) or any U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to the U.S. federal income tax.', 'For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of VMware common stock who is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:(i)an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;(ii)a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;(iii)an estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income regardless of its source; or(iv)a trust that (A) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and all substantial decisions of which are subject to the control of one or more “United States persons” (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) or (B) has a valid election in effect to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.', 'If a partnership, including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holds shares of VMware common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.', 'Accordingly, such partners and partnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the particular tax considerations of the transactions to them.81\\n\\nEach holder of VMware common stock should consult his, her or its tax advisor with respect to the particular tax considerations of the transactions to such holder.', 'Holders of VMware common stock that are not U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the possibility that, in the event the applicable withholding agent is unable to determine whether any cash consideration paid to them in the transactions should be treated as a dividend for applicable U.S. federal income tax purposes, such withholding agent may withhold U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on the entire amount of any cash consideration payable to such non-U.S. holder in the transactions, and such non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the possible desirability and timing of selling any shares of VMware common stock or Broadcom common stock that they own.', 'In GeneralThe obligation of VMware to complete the transactions is conditioned upon the delivery by Gibson Dunn, counsel to VMware (or other nationally recognized tax counsel or Big 4 accounting firm as may be reasonably acceptable to VMware) of the Tax Opinion.', 'In addition, in connection with the filing of the registration statement of which this document is a part, Gibson Dunn has delivered an opinion to VMware that the transactions will qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment.', 'Each of these tax opinions is or will be based on factual representations contained in officer’s certificates provided by Broadcom and VMware, representations and covenants contained in the merger agreement, and on certain customary factual assumptions, all of which must continue to be true and accurate as of the consummation of the transactions.', 'If any of the representations, covenants or assumptions upon which the tax opinions are or will be based is inconsistent with the actual facts, the U.S. federal income tax considerations of the transactions could be materially different from those discussed below.', 'None of these opinions is binding on the IRS or the courts, and neither Broadcom nor VMware intends to request a ruling from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax considerations of the transactions.', 'Consequently, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of those set forth below.', 'Accordingly, and on the basis of the opinion delivered in connection herewith, the U.S. federal income tax considerations of the transactions to U.S. holders generally are as follows.', 'U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Transactions to U.S. HoldersThe U.S. federal income tax considerations of the transactions to a U.S. holder generally will depend on whether the U.S. holder exchanges its VMware common stock for cash consideration, stock consideration or a combination of cash consideration and stock consideration.', 'Exchange Solely for CashThe exchange of shares of VMware common stock solely for cash generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of VMware common stock surrendered.', 'Such gain or loss will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder’s holding period with respect to the VMware common stock surrendered is more than one year at the effective time of the second merger.', 'Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including individuals, generally are subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates.', 'The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.', 'If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of shares of VMware common stock at different times or different prices, such U.S. holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of VMware common stock.', 'In certain circumstances, if a U.S. holder actually or constructively owns Broadcom common stock after the transactions, the cash consideration received could be treated as having the effect of a distribution of a dividend under the tests set forth in Section\\xa0302 of the Code, in which case such U.S. holder may have dividend income up to the amount of the cash consideration received.', 'Because the possibility of dividend treatment depends primarily upon the particular circumstances of a U.S. holder, including the application of certain constructive ownership rules, U.S. holders that actually or constructively own Broadcom common stock should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing rules to their particular circumstances.', 'U.S. holders electing to receive solely cash consideration in the transactions may be subject to proration (as described in the section titled “The Merger Agreement—Effects of the Transactions—Proration and Allocation of Merger Consideration.”), which may result in the receipt of a portion of the

time-based VMware restricted stock unit award that is not held by a non-employee director will be converted into a Broadcom restricted stock unit award based on an equity award exchange ratio calculated as the sum of (i) 50% of the stock consideration and (ii) 50% of the cash consideration divided by the Broadcom trading price; and•each outstanding performance-based VMware restricted stock unit award will be converted into a Broadcom restricted stock unit award using the same formula described in the above bullet, provided that (i)\\xa0for each such award granted under the VMware operating performance stock unit plan, performance goals will be deemed achieved (1) at the actual level with respect to performance periods completed prior to the closing of the transactions, or (2) at target level with respect to performance periods not completed prior to the closing of the transactions; and (ii)\\xa0for each such award that was granted under the VMware TSR performance stock unit plan, performance will be measured at the closing of the transactions based on the actual level of achievement of the applicable performance goals based on the value of merger consideration (with

transfer or other disposition to any person or group of more than 20% of the consolidated assets of VMware and its subsidiaries (measured by fair market value).A “superior proposal” for purposes of the merger agreement means a bona fide, written acquisition proposal by a third party which the VMware board determines in good faith (after consultation with VMware’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors) to be more favorable to VMware’s stockholders from a financial point of view than the transactions, taking into account all relevant factors (including all the terms and conditions of such proposal or offer (including the transaction consideration, conditionality, timing, certainty of financing and/or regulatory approvals and likelihood of consummation) and the merger agreement

which the VMware board has determined in good faith after consultation with VMware’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors is a superior proposal, but only if the VMware board has determined in good faith after consultation with VMware’s outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law.', 'Prior to making a change of recommendation for any reason set forth above, VMware must provide Broadcom four business days’ prior written notice advising Broadcom that it intends to make a change of recommendation.', 'The notice must specify in reasonable detail the reasons for such change of recommendation due to an intervening event (as defined below), or the material terms and conditions of the acquisition proposal (including a copy of any proposed definitive agreement) for any change of recommendation due to a superior proposal.', 'In each case, VMware must cause its representatives (including executive officers) to negotiate in good 107\\n\\nfaith (to the extent Broadcom desires to negotiate) any proposal by Broadcom to amend the merger agreement in a manner that would eliminate the need for the VMware board to make a change of recommendation, and the VMware board must make all of the required determinations regarding its fiduciary duties again at the end of such four business day negotiation period (after in good faith taking into account the amendments to the merger agreement proposed by Broadcom).', 'With respect to any change of recommendation in response to a superior proposal, if there is any material amendment, revision or change to the terms of the then-existing superior proposal (including any revision to the amount, form or mix of

of the merger agreement (or if known, the material consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable to the VMware board as of the date of the merger agreement), except that in no event will the following events, changes or developments constitute an “intervening event”: (a) the receipt, existence or terms of an acquisition proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof or (b) changes in the market price or trading volume of shares of VMware common stock or Broadcom common stock or any other securities of VMware, Broadcom or their respective subsidiaries, or any change in credit rating or the fact that VMware meets or exceeds internal or published estimates, projections, forecasts or predictions for any period (except that the facts or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such changes may be taken into account to the extent not otherwise excluded).Nothing in the merger agreement prohibits VMware or the VMware board from (a) disclosing to

describes VMware’s receipt of an acquisition proposal, the terms thereof and the identity of the person making such acquisition proposal, and the operation of the merger agreement with respect thereto or (d) making any disclosure to the stockholders of VMware, if the VMware board determines in good faith (after consultation with VMware’s outside legal counsel) that the failure to so disclose would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the VMware board under applicable law; provided that, in each case, any such disclosure also includes an express reaffirmation of

rights to seek an appraisal of their shares must do ALL of the following:•you must not vote in favor of approval of the merger agreement proposal.', 'Because a proxy that is signed and submitted but does not otherwise contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of approval of the merger agreement proposal, if you submit a proxy and wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you must instruct the proxy to vote your shares against approval of the merger agreement proposal or abstain from voting your shares on the approval of the merger agreement proposal; •you must deliver to VMware a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the approval of the merger agreement proposal at the special meeting and be a stockholder of record at the time of the making of such demand; •you must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the effective time of the second merger; and •you or the surviving company in the third merger (or any other stockholder that has properly demanded appraisal rights and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights) must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the effective time of the second merger.', 'The surviving company is under no obligation to file any such petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery and has no intention of doing so.', 'Accordingly, it is the obligation of the VMware stockholders to initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of shares of VMware common stock within the time prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.', '154\\n\\nVoting, virtually or by proxy, against, abstaining from voting on or failing to vote on the approval of the merger agreement proposal will not constitute a written demand for appraisal as required by Section 262 of the DGCL.', 'The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote.', 'Who May Exercise Appraisal Rights.', 'A demand for appraisal must be executed by or on behalf of the stockholder of record.', 'The demand should set forth, fully and correctly, the stockholder’s name as it appears on the stock certificates (or in the stock ledger).', 'The demand must reasonably inform VMware of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends to demand appraisal of his, her or its common stock.', 'Non-record owners may not directly make appraisal demands to VMware.', 'The non-record owner must, in such cases, have the owner of record, such as a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, submit the required demand in respect of those shares of common stock.', 'A record owner, such as a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, who holds shares of VMware common stock as a nominee for others, may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the shares of VMware common stock held for one or more non-record owners, while not exercising this right for other non-record owners.', 'In that case, the written demand should state the number of shares of VMware common stock as to which appraisal is sought.', 'Where no number of shares of VMware common stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of VMware common stock held in the name of the record owner.', 'IF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES IN BANK OR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS,

jointly with one or more other persons, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, demand for appraisal must be executed by or for you and all other joint owners.', 'An authorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner and expressly disclose the fact that, in making the demand, such person is acting as agent for the record owner.', 'If you hold shares of VMware common stock through a broker who in turn holds the shares through a central securities depository

the second merger has become effective within 10 days after the effective time of the second merger to each stockholder that did not vote in favor of the merger agreement and delivered a written

proceeding or join in such a proceeding as a named party will have the right to withdraw such demand and to accept the merger consideration in accordance with the merger agreement for his, her or its shares of common stock.', 'Within 120 days after the effective time of the second merger, but not later, any stockholder that has complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, or the

Section 262 of the DGCL, you should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of your appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.', 'Within 120 days after the effective time of the second merger, any stockholder that has complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to receive from the surviving company in the third merger, upon written request, a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the approval of the merger agreement proposal and with respect to which VMware has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of those shares.', 'The surviving company in the third merger must mail this statement within the later of 10 days of receipt by the surviving company in the third merger of the request therefor or 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal.', 'If you are the non-record owner of shares of stock held in a voting trust or by a nominee on your behalf, you may, in your own name, file an appraisal petition or request from the surviving company in the third merger the statement described in this paragraph.', 'If a petition for appraisal is duly filed, and a copy of the petition is delivered to the surviving company in the third merger, the surviving company in the third merger will then be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to provide the Delaware Register in Chancery with a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all holders who have demanded an appraisal of their shares.', 'The Delaware Court of Chancery will then determine which stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights and may require the stockholders demanding appraisal who hold certificated shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings and the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to any stockholder who fails to comply with this direction.', 'Where proceedings are not dismissed or the demand for appraisal is not successfully withdrawn, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted as to the shares of VMware common stock owned by such stockholders in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings.', 'The Delaware Court of Chancery will thereafter determine the fair value of the shares of VMware common stock at the effective time of the second merger held by all stockholders who have properly perfected appraisal rights, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the second merger.', 'Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective time of the second merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective time of the second merger and the date of payment of the judgment.', 'When the value is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, with interest thereon, if any, to the stockholders entitled to receive the same, upon surrender by such stockholders of their stock certificates or, in the case of book-entry shares, forthwith.', 'In determining the fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors.', 'In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.”', 'The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other factors which could be ascertained as of the date of the merger which throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation.', 'Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.”', 'In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation.', 'In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 of the DGCL to mean that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”', 'An opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL.', 'The fair value of your shares as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be greater than, the same as, or less than the value of the merger consideration.', 'Broadcom and the surviving company in the third merger do 156\\n\\nnot anticipate offering more than the merger consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights and reserve the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of VMware common stock is less than the merger consideration.', 'If no party files a petition for appraisal within 120 days after the effective time of the second merger, then all stockholders will lose the right to an appraisal, and will instead receive the merger consideration described in the merger agreement, without interest thereon.', 'The Delaware Court of Chancery may determine the costs of the appraisal proceeding and may tax those costs against the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems to be equitable under the circumstances.', 'However, costs do not include attorneys and expert witness fees.', 'Each stockholder is responsible for its own attorneys and expert witnesses expenses, although, upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including reasonable attorneys’ fees
