                      JOINT PROXY STATEMENT AND PROSPECTUS

                 Subject to completion, dated February 23, 2001

[graphic]                                                              [graphic]

                  MERGER PROPOSED-YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

   iVillage Inc. and Women.com Networks, Inc. have agreed on a merger
transaction involving our two companies. We believe that the merger will
create the largest and most comprehensive destination for women. Before we can
complete the merger, we must obtain the approval of both of our companies'
stockholders. We are sending you this joint proxy statement/prospectus to ask
you to vote on a proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby and related matters.

   In the merger, stockholders of Women.com will be entitled to receive 0.322
of a share of iVillage common stock plus a nominal cash amount (subject to
adjustment as described below) in return for each share of Women.com common
stock they own. Outstanding shares of iVillage common stock will remain
unchanged in the merger. The exchange ratio of 0.322 of a share of iVillage
common stock and the cash payment for each share of Women.com common stock are
subject to downward adjustment in the event that Women.com does not have
specified amounts of working capital and cash as of March 31, 2001 and
immediately before the closing of the merger, if after such date.

   Pursuant to the merger, Women.com stockholders as of the record date will
also receive the right to purchase iVillage common stock and warrants in
connection with the rights offering described in this joint proxy statement/
prospectus. If the merger is completed, Hearst Communications, Inc., the
holder of approximately 46% of the outstanding shares of Women.com common
stock, has agreed to purchase up to 9,324,000 shares of iVillage common stock
and a warrant to purchase up to 2,100,000 shares of iVillage common stock for
an aggregate purchase price of up to $20.0 million, as reduced by the amount
of common stock and warrants purchased by other Women.com stockholders in the
rights offering. When the merger, the rights offering and the Hearst
Communications investment are completed, iVillage stockholders will own
approximately 55% of iVillage's outstanding common stock and former Women.com
stockholders, including Hearst Communications, will own approximately 45% of
iVillage's outstanding common stock.

   As a result of the merger, Women.com will become a wholly owned subsidiary
of iVillage. The shares of iVillage common stock issued to stockholders of
Women.com as a result of the merger will be listed on the Nasdaq National
Market under the trading symbol "IVIL."

   Women.com will hold a special meeting of its stockholders to consider and
vote on the merger proposal. iVillage will hold a special meeting of its
stockholders to consider and vote on two proposals. The first proposal is to
approve and adopt the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement, including the merger, the issuance of shares of iVillage
common stock to be received by stockholders of Women.com pursuant to the
merger agreement, the issuance of shares of iVillage common stock and warrants
to purchase iVillage common stock to Hearst Communications pursuant to a
securities purchase agreement and the issuance of shares of iVillage common
stock and warrants to purchase iVillage common stock pursuant to the rights
offering to Women.com stockholders. The second proposal is to increase the
authorized number of shares of iVillage common stock from 65,000,000 to
200,000,000. Completion of the merger requires Women.com and iVillage
stockholder approval.

   Your vote is very important. Whether or not you plan to attend your
stockholder meeting, please take the time to vote by completing the enclosed
proxy card and mailing it to us or follow the telephone or Internet voting
instructions at the bottom of your proxy card. Returning the proxy or voting
by telephone or Internet does not deprive you of your right to attend your
stockholder meeting and to vote your shares in person. The dates, times and
places of the stockholders' meetings are as follows:

For iVillage Stockholders:                           For Women.com Stockholders:
 Thursday, March 29, 2001                             Thursday, March 29, 2001

          []                                                    []

   This joint proxy statement/prospectus gives you detailed information about
the merger we are proposing, and it includes our merger agreement as Annex A-1
and an amendment to the merger agreement as Annex A-2. You can get more
information about our companies from publicly available documents we have
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We encourage you to read
carefully this entire document, including all its annexes, and we especially
encourage you to read the "Risk Factors" section beginning on page 16.

   We enthusiastically support this combination of our companies, and join with
the other members of our boards of directors in recommending that you vote for
the merger and all of the related proposals.

           Rights Offering of up to 9,324,000 shares of Common Stock
        and Warrants to purchase up to 2,100,000 shares of Common Stock

   In connection with, and subject to the closing of, the proposed merger
between Women.com Networks, Inc. and a wholly-owned subsidiary of iVillage,
iVillage is offering to the stockholders of Women.com rights to purchase up to
an aggregate of 9,324,000 shares of iVillage's common stock and warrants to
purchase up to an aggregate of 2,100,000 shares of iVillage's common stock at
a cash subscription price of $_______ per right. The rights are not
transferable and will not be listed for trading on any stock exchange.

   If you owned Women.com common stock on February 27, 2001, the record date
for the rights offering, you will receive, at no cost, one right for each
share of Women.com's common stock that you owned on the record date. Each
right will entitle the holder to purchase ________ of a share of iVillage's
common stock and a warrant to purchase __________ of a share of iVillage's
common stock for a cash subscription price of $________ per right. iVillage is
not issuing fractional rights and iVillage will not pay cash in lieu of
fractional rights. If the merger is completed, Hearst Communications, Inc.,
the holder of approximately 46% of the outstanding shares of Women.com common
stock, has agreed to purchase up to 9,324,000 shares of iVillage common stock
and a warrant to purchase up to 2,100,000 shares of iVillage common stock for
an aggregate purchase price of up to $20.0 million, except that the number of
shares of common stock and warrants, and the purchase price payable by Hearst
Communications, will be reduced by the number of shares of common stock and
warrants, if any, purchased by other Women.com stockholders in the rights
offering.

   The warrants will have an exercise price of $0.01 per share and will be
exercisable at any time after the date of issuance until December 31, 2004 but
only if the average closing price of iVillage's common stock has exceeded
$3.75 per share on any fifteen consecutive trading days. The holder of a
warrant will have 30 days after notification in writing from iVillage of the
satisfaction of this condition in which to exercise the warrant. iVillage's
common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "IVIL."
On February __, 2001, the closing price for iVillage's common stock was $___
per share.

   The rights are exercisable beginning on the date of this prospectus. The
rights will expire if they are not properly exercised by 5:00 p.m., New York
City time, on March 29, 2001, the date of the Women.com and iVillage special
stockholder meetings. If you wish to participate in the rights offering,
iVillage recommends that you follow the instructions set forth in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus under the caption "The Rights Offering" and that
you submit all subscription documents and payments to the subscription agent
at least 10 days before the deadline. All subscriptions will be held in escrow
by iVillage's subscription agent, Continental Stock Transfer and Trust
Company, until accepted by iVillage. iVillage, in its sole discretion, may
extend the period for exercising the rights. Rights not exercised by the
expiration date of the rights will expire and will have no value. You should
carefully consider whether or not to exercise your rights before the
expiration date of the rights.

   The rights offering is conditioned on the closing of the merger. If the
merger does not close for any reason, the rights offering will be canceled and
all subscription payments will be returned, without interest. Neither the
iVillage board of directors nor the Women.com board of directors makes any
recommendation to you about whether you should exercise any rights.

   Investing in iVillage's common stock and the warrants involves a high degree
of risk. Before exercising any rights, you should read carefully the
information set forth under "Risk Factors" beginning on page 16.

                   NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
                           To Be Held March 29, 2001

To the Stockholders of Women.com Networks, Inc.:

   A special meeting of stockholders of Women.com Networks, Inc. will be held
on March 29, 2001, at ____ a.m., local time, at [__________], for the
following purpose:

   o To consider and vote on a proposal to approve and adopt the merger
     agreement among iVillage Inc., Stanhope Acquisition Sub, LLC, which is a
     newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary of iVillage, and Women.com
     Networks, Inc., and the transactions contemplated by the merger
     agreement, including the merger.

   Holders of record of shares of Women.com common stock at the close of
business on February 27, 2001 will be entitled to vote at the special meeting
or any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting.

   The Women.com board of directors has determined that the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated by it are fair to and in the best interests
of Women.com and its stockholders and has declared the advisability of the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by it. Accordingly, the
Women.com board of directors recommends that stockholders vote to approve and
adopt the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, including the merger, at the special meeting.

   Women.com stockholders will have the right to dissent from the merger and
obtain payment in cash of the fair value of their shares of common stock under
applicable provisions of Delaware law. In order to perfect dissenters' rights,
Women.com stockholders must give written demand for appraisal of their shares
before the taking of the vote on the merger at the special meeting and must
not vote in favor of the merger. A copy of the applicable Delaware statutory
provisions is included as Annex D to the attached joint proxy statement/
prospectus and a summary of these provisions can be found under "The Merger-
Rights of Dissenting Women.com Stockholders" in the attached joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

   Please take the time to vote by completing and mailing the enclosed proxy
card or following the telephone or Internet voting instructions at the bottom
of your proxy card. A postage-prepaid envelope has been provided for your
convenience if you wish to vote by mail. If your shares are held in "street
name" at a brokerage firm, you must instruct your broker how to vote your
shares. Returning your proxy or voting by telephone or Internet does not
deprive you of your right to attend the special meeting and to vote your
shares in person.

   It is important that you sign, date and return the proxy card in the
enclosed envelope or vote by telephone or Internet so that your shares of
Women.com common stock will be represented, whether or not you plan to attend
the special meeting. If you do not return your card or vote by telephone or
Internet, or if you do not instruct your broker how to vote any shares of
Women.com common stock held for you in "street name," your shares of Women.com
common stock will not be voted at the special meeting, and this will have the
same effect as voting against the merger.

   Regardless of the number of shares of Women.com common stock you hold, your
vote is very important.

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q:      What will happen in the merger?

A:      The boards of directors of iVillage and Women.com have approved a
        transaction whereby iVillage will acquire Women.com. To accomplish this
        transaction, a subsidiary of iVillage will merge into Women.com,
        resulting in Women.com becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of iVillage.
        iVillage common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the
        trading symbol "IVIL."

Q:      What will I receive in the merger?

A:      If the merger is completed, Women.com stockholders will receive 0.322
        of a share of iVillage common stock (subject to downward adjustment as
        described below) for each share of Women.com common stock they own. In
        addition, Women.com stockholders will receive a cash payment per share
        equal to one percent of the product of the average high and low prices
        of a share of iVillage common stock on the Nasdaq National Market on
        the closing date of the merger multiplied by 0.322 (subject to downward
        adjustment as described below). iVillage will not issue fractional
        shares of common stock. Instead of fractional shares, you will receive
        cash based on the closing price of iVillage common stock on the closing
        date.

        To illustrate the foregoing, if you own 100 shares of Women.com common
        stock and the average high and low per share price on the Nasdaq
        National Market on the closing date is $1.75, you will receive 32
        shares of iVillage common stock, a cash payment of $0.56 in exchange
        for your shares of Women.com common stock and an additional cash
        payment for your 0.2 fractional share.

        Except as described below, the number of shares of iVillage common
        stock to be issued for each share of Women.com common stock is fixed
        and will not be adjusted based upon changes in the value of these
        shares. As a result, the value of the shares you receive in the merger
        will not be known at the time you vote on the merger and may go up or
        down as the market price for iVillage common stock goes up or down.
        Women.com is not permitted to withdraw from the merger or resolicit the
        vote of its stockholders based solely on changes in the value of the
        iVillage common stock.

        iVillage's stock price has been volatile, and economic and market
        circumstances are subject to change. As an example, the following table
        sets forth the high and low closing sale prices per share of iVillage
        common stock on the Nasdaq National Market during the indicated months
        of 2000 and 2001.

                                                                        Closing Sale
                                                                         Prices per
                                                                          Share of
                                                                          iVillage
                                                                        Common Stock
                                                                       -------------

                                                                       -----   -----

Q:      Are the 0.322 exchange ratio and the amount of the per share cash
        payment subject to adjustment?

A:      Yes. The 0.322 exchange ratio and the per share cash payment will not
        be increased, but they could be decreased. The exchange ratio of 0.322
        of a share of iVillage common stock and the cash payment for each share
        of Women.com common stock are subject to a downward adjustment in the
        event that Women.com does not have specified amounts of working capital
        and cash as of March 31, 2001 and immediately before the closing of the
        merger if after such date. For a detailed description of the terms
        governing adjustment of the exchange ratio and cash payment, see the
        section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled "The Merger
        Agreement - Merger Consideration."

Q:      Why are iVillage and Women.com proposing the merger?

A:      We believe the merger offers the opportunity to create the world's
        largest and most comprehensive destination for women on the Web. We
        view the merger as a unique opportunity to combine the two top women's
        online media/Web properties to create the most comprehensive
        destination to meet the everyday needs of women online.

        Please read the more detailed description of our reasons for the merger
        on pages 38 through 42.

Q:      What will happen to shares of iVillage common stock in the merger?

A:      Each share of iVillage common stock outstanding will remain outstanding
        as a share of iVillage common stock. Your percentage ownership of
        iVillage's outstanding common stock will decrease as a result of the
        issuance of iVillage common stock in the merger and pursuant to the
        securities purchase agreement with Hearst Communications and the rights
        offering to other Women.com stockholders.

Q:      Will I receive dividends on my shares of iVillage common stock after
        the merger?

A:      iVillage does not currently intend to pay cash dividends on its common
        stock.

Q:      What do I need to do now?

A:      After carefully reading and considering the information contained in
        this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the annexes, please
        respond by completing, signing and dating your proxy card and returning
        it in the enclosed postage-paid envelope as soon as possible so that
        your shares may be represented at your stockholder meeting. You may
        also vote by using the toll-free telephone number included on your
        proxy card or by Internet in the manner described on your proxy card.
        To assure that we obtain your vote, please return your completed proxy
        card or vote by telephone or Internet even if you currently plan to
        attend your stockholder meeting in person.

Q:      What happens if I don't indicate how to vote my proxy?

A:      If you mail your properly signed proxy but do not include instructions
        on how your shares are to be voted, your shares will be voted FOR
        approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the
        merger and related matters and, if you are an iVillage stockholder,
        your shares will also be voted FOR approval of the proposal to increase
        the number of authorized shares of iVillage common stock.

Q:      What happens if I don't return a proxy card and don't vote by telephone
        or Internet?

A:      Not returning your proxy card or not voting by telephone or Internet
        will have the same effect as voting against the merger and the merger
        agreement and, if you are an iVillage stockholder, as also voting
        against the proposal to increase the number of authorized shares of
        iVillage common stock.

Q:      How do I vote my shares if my shares are held in "street name"?

A:      You should contact your broker. Your broker can give you directions on
        how to instruct the broker to vote your shares. Your broker may not be
        able to vote your shares unless the broker receives appropriate
        instructions from you.

Q:      What if I plan to attend my stockholder meeting in person?

A:      We recommend that you send in your proxy or vote by telephone or
        Internet anyway. You may still attend the meeting and vote in person.

Q:      What vote does my board of directors recommend?

A:      The Women.com board of directors recommends that Women.com stockholders
        vote FOR the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
        merger agreement, including the merger. The iVillage board of directors
        recommends that iVillage stockholders vote FOR the merger agreement and
        the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the
        merger, the issuance of shares of iVillage common stock in the merger,
        the issuance of iVillage common stock and warrants to purchase iVillage
        common stock pursuant to the securities purchase agreement with Hearst
        Communications and the rights offering to other Women.com stockholders.

        shares of iVillage common stock to Women.com stockholders is a
        condition to the merger. The iVillage board of directors also
        recommends that iVillage stockholders vote FOR the amendment to
        iVillage's amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Approval
        of the last proposal is not a condition to the merger.

Q:      Can I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy or voted by
        telephone or Internet?

A:      Yes. You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at
        your special meeting as follows:

    o  You can revoke your proxy.

    o  You can submit a new proxy or change your vote by telephone or
       Internet.

    o  You can attend the special meeting and vote in person.

        If you choose the first or second method, you must submit your notice
        of revocation or your new proxy

        before the applicable stockholder meeting. If your shares are held in
        an account at a brokerage firm, you should contact your brokerage firm
        to change your vote.

A:      We plan to complete the merger after all the conditions to the merger,
        including obtaining the approvals of our stockholders at the
        stockholder meetings, are fulfilled. We currently expect to complete
        the merger by March 31, 2001.

Q:      Will I have appraisal rights as a result of the merger?

A:      Women.com stockholders will have appraisal rights under Delaware law.
        In order to exercise your appraisal rights, you must follow the
        requirements of Delaware law. A copy of the applicable Delaware
        statutory provisions is included as Annex D to this joint proxy

        stockholders are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with
        the merger.

Q:      Should I send in my stock certificates now?

A:      No. If you are an iVillage stockholder DO NOT send in your stock

                QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE RIGHTS OFFERING
                       (FOR WOMEN.COM STOCKHOLDERS ONLY)

Q:      Why is iVillage conducting this rights offering?

A:      In connection with the proposed combination of the businesses of
        Women.com and iVillage, Hearst Communications, the holder of
        approximately 46% of the outstanding shares of Women.com common stock,
        agreed to purchase up to 9,324,000 shares of iVillage's common stock
        and warrants to purchase up to 2,100,000 shares of iVillage's common
        stock for a total purchase price of $20.0 million. As a condition of
        Hearst Communications' obligation to purchase the shares of iVillage's
        common stock and the warrants, iVillage must offer rights to all of the
        other stockholders of Women.com to purchase their pro rata portion of
        the shares and warrants offered to Hearst Communications. Hearst
        Communications will purchase the number of shares of iVillage common
        stock and warrants to purchase iVillage common not subscribed for by
        other Women.com stockholders in the rights offering.

Q:      What is a rights offering?

A:      The rights offering is a distribution of rights on a pro rata basis to
        all of Women.com's stockholders who held shares of Women.com's common
        stock on February 27, 2001, the record date of the rights offering.
        "Pro rata" means the proportion of the total number of shares of
        Women.com's outstanding common stock that you and the other
        stockholders of Women.com hold on the record date.

Q:      May I exercise rights for less than my pro rata portion?

A:      Yes. You are not required to subscribe for any rights and, if you
        choose to subscribe, you are not required to subscribe for your entire
        pro rata portion of rights.

Q:      What is a right?

A:      Each right entitles a Women.com stockholder to purchase _________ of a
        share of iVillage's common stock and a warrant to purchase __________
        of a share of iVillage's common stock for a subscription price of
        $_________ per right. iVillage has granted to each Women.com
        stockholder on the record date one right for each outstanding share of
        Women.com common stock held by such stockholder.

Q:      What if my rights result in fractional shares?

A:      If your rights would allow you to purchase a fraction of a share or a
        warrant to purchase a fraction of a share, you may exercise your rights
        only by rounding down to and paying for the nearest whole share, or
        paying for any lesser number of whole shares. You may not purchase
        fractional shares or receive a warrant exercisable for a fraction of a
        share and iVillage will not pay cash in lieu of such fractional shares.

Q:      What happens if the merger does not close?

A:      If the merger does not close for any reason, then the rights offering
        will be canceled and all subscription payments will be returned,
        without interest.

Q:      May iVillage stockholders participate in the rights offering?

A:      No. The rights are only being offered to the stockholders of Women.com
        who held shares of Women.com common stock as of the record date, which
        is February 27, 2001.

Q:      How soon must Women.com stockholders act?

A:      The rights expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 29, 2001,
        the date of the Women.com and iVillage special stockholder meetings.
        The subscription agent must actually receive all required documents and
        payments before that time and date.

Q:      Is participation in the rights offering recommended by the iVillage or
        Women.com boards of directors?

A:      Neither iVillage's board of directors nor Women.com's board of
        directors makes any recommendation to you about whether you should
        exercise any rights. You should decide whether to subscribe for the
        rights based on your own assessment of your best interests in
        consultation with your financial and legal advisors.

Q:      Is my participation in the rights offering a condition of the merger?

A:      No. The extent of your participation, or your decision not to
        participate, in the rights offering will not affect the closing of the
        merger. If the merger is completed, Hearst Communications has agreed to
        purchase up to 9,324,000 shares of iVillage common stock and a warrant
        to purchase up to 2,100,000 shares of iVillage common stock for an
        aggregate purchase price of up to $20.0 million, except that the number
        of shares of common stock and warrants, and the purchase price payable
        by

        Hearst Communications, will be reduced by the  number of shares of
        common stock and warrants, if any, purchased by other Women.com
        stockholders in the rights offering.

Q:      How are Women.com stockholders affected if they do not exercise any
        rights?

A:      You are not required to exercise any rights or otherwise take any
        action in response to this rights offering. If you do not exercise any
        rights, the number of shares of iVillage common stock which you will
        receive in exchange for your Women.com common stock upon the closing of
        the merger will not change, but your percentage ownership of iVillage's
        total outstanding common stock after the merger will be lower than if
        you had exercised your rights in full.

Q:      What forms and payment are required to exercise rights?

A:      As a record holder of Women.com common stock on February 27, 2001, you
        are receiving with this joint proxy statement/prospectus a subscription
        agreement and instructions on how to exercise rights. The subscription
        agreement must be properly filled out and delivered with full payment
        (by wire transfer, certified or cashier's check or personal check) to
        the subscription agent before expiration of the rights. The
        instructions also describe an alternate procedure called "Notice of
        Guaranteed Delivery," which allows an extra three days to deliver the
        subscription agreement if full payment is received before the
        expiration date and a securities broker or qualified financial
        institution signs the form to guarantee that the subscription agreement
        will be timely delivered.

Q:      What if a broker, bank or other nominee is the record holder of my
        shares?

A:      If you wish to purchase shares, please promptly contact the broker,
        bank or other company holding your shares. Your broker or other nominee
        holder is the record holder of the shares you own and must exercise the
        subscription agreement on your behalf for rights you wish to exercise
        or arrange for a subscription agreement issued in your name. The
        broker, bank or other nominee has been requested to contact you for
        instructions on exercising your rights.

Q:      May Women.com stockholders transfer rights?

A:      No. The rights are not transferable and may not be sold.

Q:      Will I be able to trade my rights on Nasdaq?

A:      No. The rights will not be listed for trading on Nasdaq or any other
        stock exchange.

Q:      Must all holders of rights pay the subscription price in cash?

A:      All Women.com stockholders granted rights who wish to participate in
        the rights offering must timely pay the subscription price by wire
        transfer, certified or cashier's check drawn on a U.S. bank, or
        personal check that clears before expiration of the rights.

Q:      Will my money be returned if the rights offering is canceled?

A:      Yes. The subscription agent will hold all funds it receives in escrow
        until the rights offering is completed or terminated. If the rights
        offering is not completed, the subscription agent will return all
        subscription payments promptly, without interest.

Q:      Will Women.com stockholders be charged a commission or fee if they
        exercise their rights?

A:      iVillage is not charging any fee or sales commission to issue rights to
        you or to issue shares of iVillage common stock or warrants to you if
        you exercise rights. If you exercise rights through a broker or other
        holder of your shares, you are responsible for paying any fees that
        person may charge.

Q:      May I change or cancel my exercise of rights after I send in the
        required forms?

A:      No. All exercises of rights are irrevocable unless the conditions to
        completion of the rights offering are not satisfied or waived before
        the subscription period ends. For a description of the conditions to
        the closing of the rights offering, see the section of this joint proxy
        statement/prospectus entitled "The Rights Offering - Conditions to the
        Offering."

Q:      To whom do Women.com stockholders direct additional questions?

A:      If you have questions about the rights offering or need additional
        copies of offering documents, you should call Continental Stock
        Transfer and Trust Company, the subscription agent, at the toll free
        number (888) 509-5587.

     approximately 32.6% if no Women.com stockholders participate in the
     rights offering and no additional shares of iVillage common stock are
     purchased by Hearst Communications as a result of a shortfall in
     Women.com's cash or working capital as of March 31, 2001 or immediately

Communications and the rights offering to other Women.com stockholders. The
iVillage board of directors also recommends that you vote FOR the proposal to
amend iVillage's amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase
the number of authorized shares of iVillage common stock. The approval of the
last proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger.

Opinion of Women.com's Financial Advisor (Page 42)

   Salomon Smith Barney, Women.com's financial advisor, rendered an oral
opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the Women.com board of
directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the Women.com
stockholders of the merger consideration, including the benefits to be derived
from the Hearst Communications investment following the completion of the
merger. We have attached this opinion, dated February 5, 2001, as Annex B to
this document. You should read this opinion completely to understand the
procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations of
the review undertaken.

Opinion of iVillage's Financial Advisor (Page 47)

   Allen & Company Incorporated, iVillage's financial advisor, delivered a
written opinion to the iVillage board of directors as to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to iVillage of the ratio to exchange shares of
Women.com common stock for shares of iVillage common stock in the merger. We
have attached this opinion, dated February 5, 2001, as Annex C to this
document. You should read this opinion completely to understand the procedures
followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations of the review
undertaken.

Conditions to the Merger (Page 66)

   iVillage and Women.com will complete the merger when all of the conditions
to completion of the merger are satisfied or waived. For a detailed
description of the conditions to completion of the merger, see the section
entitled "The Merger Agreement - Conditions to the Merger." The merger will
become effective when iVillage and Women.com file a certificate of merger with
the Delaware Secretary of State.

   Assuming approval of the merger by the stockholders of iVillage and
Women.com and the satisfaction or waiver of all other conditions of the merger
agreement, iVillage and Women.com expect to complete the merger by March 31,
2001.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (Page 68)

   iVillage and Women.com can agree at any time to terminate the merger
agreement without completing the merger, even if Women.com and iVillage
stockholders have approved the merger. Also, either of us can decide, without
the consent of the other, to terminate the merger agreement under certain
circumstances. For a detailed description of the circumstances in which the
merger agreement may be terminated by iVillage and Women.com, see the section
entitled "The Merger Agreement - Termination."

Termination Fees (Page 68)

   If iVillage terminates the merger agreement because Women.com withdraws or
modifies its recommendation or approval of the merger, or because the
Women.com stockholders do not approve the merger, Women.com is obligated to
pay iVillage a termination fee of $1.0 million.

   If Women.com terminates the merger agreement because the iVillage
stockholders do not approve the merger, iVillage is obligated to pay Women.com
a termination fee of $1.0 million.

"No Solicitation" Provisions (Page 63)

   Women.com has generally agreed not to initiate or engage in discussions with
another party regarding a business combination with that party while the
merger is pending. However, Women.com may consider a superior proposal, may
furnish information of Women.com to a person making a superior proposal and
participate in discussions of such proposal in its exercise of its fiduciary
duties if but only if Women.com's board of directors reasonably determines in
good faith, based on the written advice of independent outside legal counsel,
that it is required to do so to comply with its fiduciary duties to
Women.com's stockholders. For a detailed description of these restrictions on
Women.com's ability to initiate or engage in discussions with another party
regarding a business combination, see "The Merger Agreement -- Competing
Acquisition Proposals for Women.com."

Rights of Dissenting Stockholders (Page 57)

   iVillage Stockholders. Under Delaware law, iVillage stockholders are not
entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger.

   Women.com Stockholders. Under Delaware law, Women.com stockholders are
entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger. If you do not wish
to accept cash and shares of iVillage common stock as payment for your shares
of Women.com common stock in the merger, you will have the right under
Delaware law to have the fair value of your shares of Women.com common stock
determined by the Delaware Chancery Court. This right to appraisal is subject
to a number of restrictions and technical requirements. Generally, in order to
exercise your appraisal rights you must:

   o send a written demand to Women.com for appraisal in compliance with
     Delaware General Corporation Law before the vote on the merger;

   o not vote in favor of the merger; and

   o continuously hold your Women.com common stock, from the date you make the
     demand for appraisal through the closing of the merger.

   Merely voting against the merger will not protect your rights to an
appraisal, which requires following all the steps provided under Delaware law.
Delaware law requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in
further detail in the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus
entitled "The Merger -- Rights of Dissenting Women.com Stockholders" and are
attached as Annex D to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

   If you vote for the merger, you will waive your rights to seek appraisal of
your shares of Women.com common stock under Delaware Law.

Accounting Treatment (Page 55)

   iVillage intends to account for the merger as a "purchase" for financial
accounting purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America.

Material Federal Income Tax Consequences (Page 55)

   Women.com Stockholders. Women.com and iVillage have structured the merger
so that, in general, the merger should be a taxable transaction for United
States federal income tax purposes. In that case, the stockholders of
Women.com will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes equal to
the difference between (i) the amount of cash received plus the fair market
value of the iVillage stock on the date of the merger, and (ii) the tax basis
in the Women.com stock exchanged therefor. However, it is possible that the
Internal Revenue Service may assert that the merger will constitute a
"reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code which would result in the
stockholders of Women.com not recognizing gain or loss for federal income tax
purposes in the merger.

   iVillage Stockholders. Because shares of iVillage common stock remain
unchanged, the merger will not cause you to recognize any gain or loss for
U.S. federal income tax purposes.

   This tax treatment may not apply to some stockholders. Determining the
actual tax consequences of the merger to you may be complicated. These
consequences will depend on your specific situation and on variables not
within our control. You should consult your own tax advisor for a full
understanding of the merger's tax consequences for you.

Women.com received a letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. stating that
Women.com had failed to maintain a minimum per share bid price of $1.00 over
the last 30 consecutive trading days, which is required for continued lisiting
on the Nasdaq National Market. According to this letter, unless Women.com
is in compliance with the continued listing requirements by achieving a minimum
per share bid price of $1.00 by March 28, 2001, Women.com's common stock will be
subject to delisting.

Regulatory Approvals (Page 56)

   iVillage and Women.com do not believe that there are any material regulatory
or governmental approvals required to consummate the merger.

                      UNAUDITED COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA

   We have set forth below information concerning net loss per share from
continuing operations, cash dividends declared and book value per share data
for Women.com and iVillage on both historical and pro forma bases and on a per
share equivalent pro forma basis for Women.com. We have derived the pro forma
net loss per share from continuing operations from the Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 123.
Women.com has not declared any cash dividends since the completion of its
initial public offering in October 1999 and iVillage has not declared any cash
dividends since the completion of its initial public offering in March 1999.
iVillage's management does not expect to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable
future after the completion of the merger. Basic and diluted net loss per share
from continuing operations and the book value per share for the pro forma
presentation is based upon outstanding shares of iVillage common stock, adjusted
to include the estimated number of shares of iVillage common stock to be issued
in the merger for outstanding shares of Women.com common stock at the time the
merger is completed and upon completion of the rights offering. The per share
equivalent pro forma data for shares of Women.com common stock is based on the
assumed conversion of each of the shares of Women.com common stock into shares
of iVillage common stock and issuance of all the shares of common stock in
connection with the rights offering.

   You should read the information set forth below in conjunction with the
respective audited and unaudited financial statements of iVillage and
Women.com included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the Unaudited
Pro Forma Combined Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes
thereto beginning on page 123. See "Where You Can Find More Information"

                                  RISK FACTORS

   In addition to the other information contained in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, you should carefully consider the following risk factors
before you decide how to vote on the proposed transactions and, if you are a
Women.com stockholder, whether to participate in the rights offering.

Risks Relating to the Merger

   Women.com stockholders may receive fewer shares of iVillage common stock or
iVillage may abandon the merger if Women.com does not have specified amounts
of cash and working capital on March 31, 2001 or at the closing of the merger.

   The number of shares of iVillage common stock that a Women.com stockholder
will receive for each share of Women.com common stock he or she holds will be
reduced if Women.com has less than $20.0 million of cash or less than $12.0
million of working capital on March 31, 2001, or an adjusted amount immediately
before the closing of the merger if after such date. The merger agreement
provides that if there is a shortfall in these amounts and such shortfall does
not exceed $4.0 million, the exchange ratio will be adjusted downward so that
the aggregate number of iVillage shares issued to Women.com stockholders will be
decreased by the number of shares of iVillage common stock equal to the greater
of the shortfall of cash or working capital, divided by $1.875. If the shortfall
in cash or working capital is more than $4.0 million on March 31, 2001, or if,
as of the day prior to the closing of the merger, cash is less than the amount
on hand as of March 31, 2001 less $166,666 per day for every day elapsed since
March 31, 2001, or working capital is materially less than the difference
between the amount of working capital as of March 31, 2001 less the reduction in
Women.com's cash since March 31, 2001, iVillage may terminate the merger and the
rights offering. As of December 31, 2000, Women.com had $30.1 million of cash
and $29.4 million of working capital. There can be no assurance that Women.com
will have at least $20.0 million of cash and at least $12.0 million of working
capital on March 31, 2001.

   Because the number of shares of iVillage common stock to be issued to
Women.com stockholders in the merger will not be adjusted to reflect changes
in the market price of iVillage common stock, if the market price of iVillage
common stock declines, the value of the merger consideration received by
Women.com stockholders will be reduced.

   Each Women.com stockholder will receive a fixed number of shares of iVillage
common stock in exchange for each share of Women.com common stock that the
stockholder owns except as described in the preceding risk factor. The
exchange ratio will not be adjusted based on changes in the market prices of
either iVillage or Women.com common stock. The value of the iVillage shares
that Women.com stockholders will receive in the merger will not be known until
the final exchange ratio is determined and the merger is completed. The value
of the iVillage shares that Women.com stockholders will receive in the merger
will change as the market price of iVillage common stock goes up or down prior
to the completion of the merger. In recent years, and particularly in recent
months, the stock market in general, and the securities of Internet companies
in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These
market fluctuations have, and may in the future, adversely affect the market
price of iVillage common stock. In addition, events or circumstances specific
to iVillage could cause the price of its common stock to decline. The market
price of iVillage common stock on and after the date of the merger could be
lower than the market price on the date of the merger agreement, the current
market price or the market price on the date of the Women.com special
stockholder meeting. Women.com stockholders should obtain recent market
quotations of iVillage common stock and Women.com common stock before they
vote on adoption of the merger agreement and before they decide whether to
participate in the rights offering.

   If iVillage does not successfully integrate the business and technology of
Women.com and realize the expected benefits of the merger, it will have
incurred significant costs which may harm its business.

   iVillage expects to incur costs and commit significant management time
integrating Women.com's operations, technology, Web sites, products, customers
and personnel. These costs may be substantial and may include costs for:

   o integration of operations, including combining teams and processes in
     various functional areas;

   o reorganization or closure of operations and/or facilities, including the
     cost of office space that iVillage is unable to sublease;

   o integration of technology, Web sites and products;

   o fees and expenses of professionals and consultants involved in completing
     the integration process; and

   o potential existing liabilities of Women.com.

   Successful integration of Women.com's operations, technology, Web sites,
products, customers and personnel will place a significant burden on the
management and internal resources of the combined company. The diversion of
the attention of management and any difficulties encountered in the transition
and integration process could have a material adverse effect on the future
business, financial condition and operating results of the combined company.

   If iVillage does not realize the expected benefits of the merger, iVillage's
financial results and its ability to achieve profitability will be adversely
affected.

   Achieving the benefits of the merger will depend in part on the successful
integration of Women.com's operations, technology, Web sites, products,
customers and personnel in a timely and efficient manner and maintaining the
companies' relationships with key customers and joint venturers. Integration
efforts may be difficult and unpredictable because of possible cultural
conflicts and different opinions on strategic plans, personnel and other
decisions. Integration may be made more difficult because iVillage's
operations are centered in New York while Women.com's operations are centered
in California. iVillage does not know whether it will be successful in these
integration efforts and it cannot assure you that it will realize the expected
benefits of the merger. If iVillage cannot successfully integrate Women.com's
operations, technology, Web sites, products, customers and personnel and
maintain its and Women.com's relationships with key customers and joint
venturers, the combined company may not realize the expected benefits of the
merger and its business, financial condition and results of operations may be
seriously harmed.

   The market price of iVillage common stock may decline after completion of
the merger.

   The market price of iVillage common stock may decline after completion of
the merger if:

   o the integration of the business and operations of Women.com is
     unsuccessful or takes longer than anticipated;

   o the effect of the merger on the combined company's financial results is
     not consistent with the expectations of securities analysts or investors;

   o iVillage does not achieve the perceived benefits of the merger as rapidly
     as, or to the extent, anticipated by securities analysts or investors; or

   o significant stockholders of iVillage following the merger decide to
     dispose of their shares because the results of the merger are not
     consistent with their expectations.

   Women.com's officers and directors have interests that may influence them to
support and approve the merger.

   The directors and officers of Women.com have interests in the merger that
may be different from, or in addition to, those of the Women.com stockholders,
including the following:

   o as of January 31, 2001, the officers and directors of Women.com own stock
     options to purchase an aggregate of 3,028,293 shares of Women.com common
     stock that will be converted into options to purchase shares of iVillage
     common stock at the time of the merger;

   o a severance and retention plan of up to $5 million for Women.com employees
     is currently being finalized, therefore, several officers of Women.com may
     receive severance or retention payments in connection with the merger;

   o iVillage has agreed to maintain directors and officers' insurance for the
     current directors and officers of Women.com for six years and to preserve
     for the same period the rights to indemnification of the current and
     former directors, officers and employees of Women.com; and

   o four of the members of the Women.com board of directors are serving in
     such capacity as representatives of Hearst Communications and, in
     connection with the merger, Hearst Communications has entered into a
     securities purchase agreement with iVillage and, as a condition to the
     closing of the merger, will enter into a stockholder agreement and a
     magazine content license and hosting agreement with iVillage. See
     "Agreements between Hearst Communications and iVillage" for more
     information regarding these agreements.

   For the above reasons, the directors and officers of Women.com could be more
likely to vote to approve the merger agreement than if they did not have these
interests. Women.com stockholders should consider whether these interests may
have influenced these directors and officers to support or recommend the
merger.

   Following the merger, Hearst Communications is expected to own approximately
__% of the outstanding shares of iVillage common stock, Hearst Communications
will have three representatives on the iVillage board of directors and Hearst
Communications will have the greatest influence of any iVillage stockholder.

   Following the merger, Hearst Communications is expected to own approximately
__% of the outstanding shares of iVillage common stock, which amount would be
increased if Hearst Communications is required or elects to purchase
additional shares of iVillage common stock as a result of a shortfall in cash
and/or working capital at March 31, 2001 or any later closing date or pursuant
to the rights offering or the securities purchase agreement, or in the event
that Women.com stockholders holding in excess of two percent of the shares of
Women.com outstanding as of the record date exercise dissenters' rights under
Delaware law. In addition, Hearst Communications will hold a warrant entitling
it to purchase up to 2,100,000 shares of iVillage common stock, less the number
of shares of iVillage common stock represented by warrants subscribed for by the
other stockholders of Women.com in the rights offering.

   Pursuant to a stockholder agreement to be entered into between iVillage and
Hearst Communications, iVillage must appoint three representatives of Hearst
Communications to iVillage's board of directors, with one Hearst
Communications designee appointed to each class of director. The stockholder
agreement provides that the number of Hearst Communications' representatives
is subject to reduction if Hearst Communications' ownership of iVillage common
stock falls below certain threshold levels. There will also be a Hearst
Communications representative on each of the iVillage nominating and
compensation committees. Hearst Communications' board representation and stock
ownership will allow Hearst Communications to significantly influence
iVillage's corporate direction and policies, including any mergers,
acquisitions, consolidations, strategic relationships or sales of assets. It
may also discourage or prevent transactions involving an actual or potential
change of control, including transactions in which stockholders would
otherwise receive a premium for their shares. In addition, the interests of
Hearst Communications, which owns or has significant investments in other
businesses, including cable television networks, newspapers, magazines and
electronic media, may from time to time be competitive with, or otherwise
diverge from, iVillage's interests, particularly with respect to new business
opportunities and future acquisitions.

   Although Hearst Communications is required to vote all shares that it holds
in excess of 25% (subject to adjustment) of iVillage's voting securities in
accordance with the recommendation of the iVillage board of directors, Hearst
Communications may effectively control stockholder actions, including
approving changes to iVillage's certificate of incorporation or bylaws and
adopting or changing equity incentive plans. Hearst Communications' effective
control over stockholder actions may also determine the outcome of any merger,
consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of iVillage's assets or other
form of change of control that iVillage might consider. See "Agreements between
Hearst Communications and iVillage" beginning on page 71.

   Exercise of the warrants will cause dilution to the iVillage stockholders
and could negatively impact the price of iVillage common stock.

   Exercise of warrants, whether by Hearst Communications or by Women.com
stockholders acquiring them in the rights offering, would cause dilution to
the voting power and interests of the then-current iVillage stockholders and
to the net income or loss per share of iVillage common stock. In addition, the
sale of a significant number of the shares of iVillage common stock acquired
on exercise of the warrants in the open market could cause a decline in the
market value of iVillage common stock. Stockholders of iVillage will

experience additonal ownership dilution if Hearst Communications is required, or
elects, to purchase additional shares of iVillage common stock in the event of a
Women.com cash or working capital shortfall as of March 31, 2001 or any later
closing date, or in the event that Women.com stockholders holding in excess of
two percent of the shares of Women.com outstanding as of the record date
exercise dissenters' rights under Delaware law. See "The Merger Agreement -
Merger Consideration" for information regarding the circumstances under which
Hearst Communications would be required, or could elect; to purchase additional
shares of iVillage common stock.

   Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact the businesses of
iVillage and Women.com and the market prices of iVillage and Women.com common
stock.

   If the merger is not completed for any reason, iVillage and Women.com will
be subject to a number of risks that may affect their respective businesses
and stock prices, including:

   o Women.com could be required to pay iVillage a $1.0 million termination
     fee, or iVillage could be required to pay Women.com a $1.0 million
     termination fee;

   o the market prices of shares of iVillage common stock and Women.com common
     stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of those
     shares reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed;

   o costs related to the merger, such as legal and accounting fees and a
     portion of the investment banking fees must be paid even if the merger is
     not completed;

   o the benefits that iVillage expects to realize from the merger would not
     be realized; and

   o the diversion of management attention from the day-to-day business of
     iVillage and Women.com and the unavoidable disruption to their employees
     and their relationships with customers and joint venturers during the
     period before consummation of the merger, may make it difficult for the
     companies to regain their market positions if the merger does not occur.

   If the merger agreement is terminated and Women.com's board of directors
seeks another merger or business combination, Women.com's stockholders cannot
be certain that Women.com will be able to find another company willing to pay
an equivalent or more attractive price than the price to be paid by iVillage
in the merger.

Risks Relating to the Combined Companies Following the Merger

   Both iVillage and Women.com have limited operating histories and the
combined companies may face difficulties encountered in the new and rapidly
evolving markets in which they operate.

   Both iVillage and Women.com have limited operating histories and face many
of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered in new and rapidly
evolving markets, including the Internet advertising market. The risks and
difficulties that will be faced by the combined companies following the merger
include their ability to:

   o attract a larger audience to iVillage.com;

   o increase awareness of the iVillage brand;

   o strengthen user loyalty;

   o offer compelling content;

   o maintain current, and develop new, strategic relationships;

   o attract a large number of advertisers from a variety of industries;

   o respond effectively to competitive pressures;

   o continue to develop and upgrade iVillage's technology; and

   o attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.

   Neither iVillage nor Women.com has achieved profitability and both have
recent and anticipated continuing losses.

   Neither iVillage nor Women.com has achieved profitability and iVillage
expects the combined company to continue to incur operating losses for the
foreseeable future. iVillage incurred net losses attributable to common
stockholders of $191.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, $116.6
million for the year ended December 31, 1999 and $43.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 1998. Women.com incurred net losses attributable to common
stockholders of $121.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, $57.1
million for the year ended December 31, 1999 and $13.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 1998. As of December 31, 2000, iVillage's accumulated
deficit was $384.3 million and Women.com's accumulated deficit was $204.2
million. iVillage expects to continue to incur significant operating and
capital expenditures and, as a result, it will need to generate significant
revenues to achieve and maintain profitability. Women.com also expects to
incur significant operating losses and negative cash flows for at least the
next several years.

   The combined company may need to raise additional capital and its prospects
for obtaining additional financing are uncertain.

   iVillage currently anticipates that its existing cash and cash equivalents
will be sufficient to meet its anticipated capital expenditures and working
capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. Women.com believes
that its existing cash and cash equivalents may not be sufficient to meet its
anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements beyond June
30, 2001. The amount of cash and cash equivalents that will be available to
the combined company upon completion of the merger cannot be accurately
predicted and depends on many factors, including the amount of revenues
received and expenses incurred by each company during the period prior to the
merger and the date on which the merger is completed. Accordingly, the
combined company may need to raise additional funds in the near future to fund
its operations. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be
available to the combined company on acceptable terms, or at all. In
particular, unless the market price of iVillage's common stock increases
dramatically, it is unlikely that the company will be able to raise funds
through a public offering of its common stock. If adequate funds are not
available or are not available on acceptable terms, the combined company would
have to scale back its business and its business and financial condition would
be harmed.

   Although iVillage's revenues have generally grown in recent quarters, it
cannot guarantee that it will achieve sufficient revenues for profitability.
Even if iVillage does achieve profitability, it cannot guarantee that it can
sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the
future. If revenues grow slower than iVillage anticipates, or if operating
expenses exceed iVillage's expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly, its
business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially and
adversely affected. Because iVillage's strategy includes acquisitions of and
joint ventures with other businesses, acquisition and joint venture expenses
and any cash used to make these acquisitions and joint ventures will reduce
its available cash.

   iVillage may not be able to integrate the operations from recent and future
acquisitions other than Women.com and/or from recent and future joint
ventures.

   As part of iVillage's business strategy, it has completed and may enter into
additional business combinations, acquisitions and joint ventures. The
particular risks associated with the Women.com merger are described above
under "Risks Relating to the Merger." The risks accompanying acquisition and
joint venture transactions include, among other things:

   o the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the
     acquired companies and joint venture entities;

   o the difficulty of establishing a new joint venture including, without
     limitation, attracting qualified personnel, potential adverse financial
     and accounting consequences, high initial expenses, attracting customers
     and advertisers, and integrating resources from previously unaffiliated
     entities;

   o the potential disruption of iVillage's ongoing business;

   o the inability of management to maximize iVillage's financial and
     strategic position through the successful incorporation of acquired or
     shared technology or content and rights into its products and media
     properties;

   o expenses associated with the transactions;

   o additional expenses associated with amortization of acquired intangible
     assets;

   o the difficulty of maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and
     policies;

   o the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result
     of any integration of new management personnel or reduction of personnel;
     and

   o the potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses and
     joint venture entities.

   iVillage's failure to adequately address these issues could have a material
adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.

   iVillage's and Women.com's quarterly revenues and operating results are not
indicative of future performance, are difficult to forecast and have been and
are likely to continue to fluctuate.

   As a result of iVillage's and Women.com's limited operating history, neither
company has historical financial data for a significant number of periods upon
which to forecast quarterly revenues and results of operations. In addition,
the operating results of the combined company are likely to fluctuate
significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of several factors, many of
which are outside iVillage's control, and any of which could materially harm
the business of the combined company. These factors include:

   o fluctuations in the demand for Internet advertising or electronic
     commerce;

   o bankruptcies of Internet companies which are a source of advertising
     revenues;

   o changes in the level of traffic on its network; and

   o fluctuations in marketing expenses and technology infrastructure costs.

   If the revenues of the combined company in a particular quarter are lower
than anticipated, iVillage may be unable to reduce spending in that quarter.
If iVillage has a shortfall in revenues in relation to its expenses, then
iVillage's business, results of operations and financial condition would be
materially and adversely affected.

   iVillage does not believe that period-to-period comparisons of its operating
results are necessarily meaningful nor should they be relied upon as reliable
indicators of future performance. In one or more future quarters, iVillage's
results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts
and investors. If iVillage's results of operations fall below expectations,
the trading price of its common stock would likely be materially adversely
affected.

   iVillage's revenues for the foreseeable future will remain dependent on user
traffic levels and advertising activity on its Web sites. Future revenues are
difficult to forecast. In addition, iVillage plans to expand and develop
content, and to upgrade and enhance its technology and infrastructure
development in order to support its growth. iVillage may be unable to adjust
spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall.

   The market for Internet advertising is still developing. If the Internet
fails to gain further acceptance as a medium for advertising, the combined
company would have slower revenue growth than expected and would incur greater
than expected losses.

   iVillage expects to continue to derive a substantial portion of its revenues
from sponsorships and advertising for the foreseeable future, as demand and
market acceptance for Internet advertising continues to develop. Accordingly,
iVillage's business depends on market acceptance of the Internet as a medium
for advertising.

   Although there are currently several standards for the measurement of the
effectiveness of Internet advertising, the industry has had difficulty
convincing potential advertisers that Internet advertising is a significant
advertising medium. Advertisers and advertising agencies that have
historically relied on traditional forms of advertising may be reluctant or
slow to adopt online advertising. In addition, advertisers and advertising
agencies that use the Internet as an advertising medium may find online
advertising to be less effective for promoting their products and services
than traditional advertising media, including television, radio and print.
Advertisers and advertising agencies that have invested substantial resources
in traditional methods of advertising may also be reluctant to reallocate
their resources to online advertising. The market for online advertising also
depends on the overall growth and acceptance of electronic commerce. If the
markets for online advertising and electronic commerce fail to develop or
develop more slowly than iVillage expects, iVillage would have slower

than expected revenue growth and would incur greater than expected losses, and
iVillage's business and financial condition would be harmed.

   Different pricing models are used to sell advertising on the Internet and it
is difficult to predict which, if any, of the models will emerge as the
industry standard. This makes it difficult to project iVillage's future
advertising rates and revenues. iVillage's advertising revenues could be
adversely affected if it is unable to adapt to new forms of Internet
advertising. Moreover, software programs that limit or prevent advertising
from being delivered to an Internet user's computer are available. Widespread
adoption of this software could adversely affect the commercial viability of
Internet advertising.

   iVillage relies on third parties to adequately measure the demographics of
its user base and delivery of advertisements on its Web sites. iVillage's
business would be harmed if these third parties fail to provide this service
to iVillage.

   It is important to iVillage advertisers that iVillage accurately measures
the demographics of its user base and the delivery of advertisements on its
Web site. iVillage depends on third parties to provide many of these
measurement services. If these third parties are unable or unwilling to
provide these services to iVillage in the future, iVillage would need to
perform them itself or obtain them from another provider. This could cause
iVillage to incur additional costs or cause interruptions in its business
until it replaces these services. Companies may choose to not advertise on
iVillage Web sites or may pay less for advertising if they perceive iVillage's
demographic measurements are not reliable. Either of these events would
adversely affect iVillage's business.

   If iVillage fails to manage its growth effectively, its business and
financial condition could be harmed.

   If iVillage is unable to manage its growth effectively, its business could
be adversely affected. iVillage has experienced and continues to experience
significant growth, both internally and through acquisitions and joint
ventures. This growth has placed, and the proposed merger with Women.com and
iVillage's anticipated future growth in its operations will continue to place,
a significant strain on iVillage's resources. As part of this growth, iVillage
will have to implement new operational and financial systems, procedures and
controls. iVillage's business would be harmed if it is unable to implement
these new systems in a timely and effective manner.

   Both iVillage and Women.com rely on third parties to drive traffic to their
sites and generate page views and the business and financial condition of
iVillage and Women.com would be harmed if these third parties were to no
longer provide this service.

   America Online has accounted for a significant portion of iVillage's online
traffic based on the delivery to iVillage of a guaranteed number of
impressions. A significant amount of its visitors and members reach iVillage
Web sites through America Online. iVillage's agreement with America Online
does not prohibit America Online from carrying online sites or developing and
providing content that compete with iVillage's sites, and America Online
currently carries additional competing Web sites. Although iVillage's
agreement with America Online expired on December 31, 2000, it is subject to
extension by either party for one year and iVillage is currently negotiating a
new agreement with America Online and, in the interim, iVillage and America
Online have extended the agreement on a monthly basis. If America Online
discontinues carrying iVillage channels, iVillage's business, results of
operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.

   Women.com relies on its Astronet site to generate a significant portion of
its page views and Astronet depends on America Online for traffic. During the
year ended December 31, 2000, approximately 21% of Women.com's page views were
generated by Astronet and, during that same period, approximately 45% of
Astronet's traffic was generated by America Online. Women.com's business would
be materially harmed if America Online stops carrying Women.com's Astronet
site.

   Pursuant to an internet advertising and ad serving agreement, Genealogy.com
generated approximately 27% of Women.com's page views in December 2000.
Women.com terminated this agreement in January 2001. If Women.com is unable to
generate additional page views in the future, it could materially adversely
affect Women.com's ranking among Web properties.

   iVillage has a small number of customers and the loss of a number of these
customers could adversely affect its financial condition and results of
operations.

   iVillage depends on a limited number of customers for a significant portion
of its revenues. Consequently, the loss of even a small number of these
customers at any one time may adversely affect iVillage's business, financial
condition and results of operations. In 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively,
revenues from iVillage's five largest advertisers accounted for approximately
23%, 20%, and 20% of total revenues, however, no one advertiser accounted for
greater than 10% of total revenues. At December 31, 2000, one customer
accounted for approximately 11% of the net accounts receivable. At December
31, 1999, no customer accounted for greater than 10% of the net accounts
receivable.

   iVillage anticipates that after the completion of the merger its results of
operations in any given period will continue to depend to a significant extent
upon revenues from a small number of customers. In addition, iVillage
anticipates that these customers will continue to vary over time, so that the
achievement of its long-term goals will require iVillage to obtain additional
significant customers on an ongoing basis. iVillage's failure to enter into a
sufficient number of large contracts during a particular period could have a
material adverse effect on iVillage's business, financial condition and
results of operations.

   Seasonal and cyclical patterns may adversely affect iVillage's business.

   iVillage believes that advertising sales in traditional media, such as
television and radio, generally are lower in the first and third calendar
quarters of each year. If iVillage's market makes the transition from an
emerging to a more developed market, seasonal and cyclical patterns may
develop in the future. As a result, if iVillage's industry follows the same
seasonal patterns as those in traditional media, it may experience lower
advertising revenues in the first and third calendar quarters of each year.
Seasonal and cyclical patterns in Internet advertising may also affect
iVillage's revenues. In addition, traffic levels on iVillage's Web sites
typically fluctuate during the summer and year-end vacation and holiday
periods and iVillage anticipates that sales from Astrology.com and e-commerce
partners from which it receives a revenue share payment, and any other future
consumer goods it may sell, will typically increase during the fourth quarter
as a result of the holiday season and may decline during other periods.

   Women.com's business relies on Hearst Communications for content and cross-
promotion and loss of that relationship would harm the combined companies'
business.

   Information supplied by or developed from the Hearst magazines to which
Women.com has online rights accounts for a significant portion of its current
network's content. If the relationship with Hearst Communications were to end,
this portion of the combined companies' business may not be able to enter into
alternative arrangements with third parties or to internally develop content
and services to replace the benefits received from the relationship with
Hearst Communications.

   The relationship between iVillage and Hearst Communications following the
merger will be governed by a magazine content license and hosting agreement.
While this agreement will continue to provide iVillage with benefits during
its three-year term, iVillage may not enjoy benefits from the relationship
with Hearst Communications beyond the term of this agreement, including the
benefits Women.com has derived and the combined companies expect to derive
from Hearst Communications' reputation, online content and cross-promotional
activities.

   Women.com has depended, and the combined companies will depend, on Hearst
Communications to assist with the effective marketing and promotion of various
Hearst magazine sites that have been part of the Women.com network. If Hearst
Communications fails to do so, iVillage brand identity could be negatively
affected and its business, financial condition and operating results could be
materially harmed. Women.com has also relied and iVillage expects to rely on
Hearst Communications to maintain the quality of its magazine content and to
maintain and expand its magazines' readership base. If the quality or
circulation of Hearst's magazines decline, the content of the iVillage network
would suffer and its business, financial condition and results of operations
could be materially harmed.

   Also, iVillage's ability to enter into sponsorship, advertising or other
business relationships with competitors of Hearst magazines may be adversely
impacted, due to such competitors' reluctance to have their brands and
products promoted on the iVillage network, which will, pursuant to the
magazine content license and hosting agreement, prominently feature Hearst
magazine content and Hearst branding.

   Hearst's right to license its content to other parties and our restrictions
on licensing other third-party content may restrict our ability to compete or
expand our network.

   Pursuant to the merger, iVillage will assume an amended and restated
magazine content license and hosting agreement, which was originally entered
into between Women.com and Hearst Communications. Hearst Communications is
permitted to license the content or trademarks of its magazines to any
Internet site or portal that is not deemed to be an iVillage competitor and is
permitted to use the Hearst content in international editions of its
magazines. A competitor is defined under the magazine content license and
hosting agreement to include any Internet site, channel, area or online
content aggregation service that provides content primarily for women, is
targeted primarily at women, is used primarily by women and is primarily
targeted to any country or region where iVillage is targeted. Any content or
trademark license by Hearst Communications to any third party, or other on-
line business relationship between Hearst Communications and a third party,
could dilute the value of the Hearst magazine content to iVillage. Hearst is
not permitted to grant any entity the right to display on the Internet content
that has appeared on the magazine websites in substantially the same format as
it appeared on the magazine websites (other than materials posted on the
website verbatim to the way it was initially published by Hearst
Communications). In the magazine content license and hosting agreement,
iVillage has agreed that it will not, without the prior written consent of
Hearst:

   o enter into any agreements to include as part of the iVillage network any
     competitive magazine site;

   o display on the Hearst magazine sites that are to be part of the iVillage
     network advertising or other promotional materials from competitive
     magazines of third parties; or

   o display on the same web page of the iVillage network the brands, marks or
     proprietary content of any of the Hearst magazines in question with the
     brands, marks or proprietary content of a competitive magazine in such a
     way that it appears that the Hearst brands, marks or proprietary content
     are co-branded or otherwise affiliated with the brands, marks or
     proprietary content of such competitive magazine.

   iVillage's inability to create new relationships in this sector could impair
iVillage's ability to enhance the visibility of its brand.

   iVillage may not find sufficient acquisition candidates and/or joint venture
partners to implement its business strategy.

   As part of iVillage's business strategy, it has completed and expects to
enter into additional business combinations, acquisitions and joint ventures
after its acquisition of Women.com. iVillage competes for acquisition
candidates and joint venture partners with other entities, some of which have
greater financial resources than it has. Increased competition for acquisition
candidates and joint venture partners may make fewer acquisition and/or joint
venture opportunities available to iVillage and may cause iVillage to make
acquisitions and joint ventures on less attractive terms, such as higher
purchase prices. Acquisition and joint venture costs may increase to levels
that are beyond iVillage's financial capability or that would adversely affect
its results of operations and financial condition. iVillage's ability to make
acquisitions will depend, in part, on the relative attractiveness of shares of
iVillage common stock as consideration for potential acquisition candidates.
This attractiveness may depend largely on the relative market price,
iVillage's ability to register common stock and capital appreciation prospects
of iVillage common stock compared to that of other bidders or potential
partners. Since the market price of iVillage common stock has declined
materially over a prolonged period of time, its acquisition program could be
materially adversely affected.

   International operations are subject to additional risks.

   iVillage's business strategy involves expanding its operations to numerous
foreign jurisdictions and as a result of recent joint ventures a portion of
its operations are conducted and located abroad. iVillage has had limited
experience with operations abroad and it has limited information available to
evaluate its prospects abroad. International operations and business expansion
plans are subject to numerous additional risks, including the impact of
foreign government regulations, currency fluctuations, political
uncertainties, social instability, differences in business practices or other
developments not typical of investments in the United States. There can be no
assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other
actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on iVillage's
business or market opportunities within such countries. Furthermore,

there can be no assurance that the political, cultural and economic climate
outside the United States will be favorable to iVillage's operations and
business strategy.

   In addition, as a United States corporation, iVillage is subject to the
regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act - the FCPA - which
generally prohibits United States companies and their intermediaries from
making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or
keeping business. Any determination that iVillage has violated the FCPA could
have a material adverse effect on it.

   As a result of iVillage's recent joint ventures, its operations have been
exposed to foreign competition. Many of these competitors have substantially
greater financial resources than iVillage does. In addition, many of these
competitors have a significant operating history in the jurisdictions in which
iVillage is seeking to establish itself. There can be no assurance that
iVillage will be able to successfully compete in any foreign jurisdiction or
against such competitors.

   iVillage may be sued for information published on its Web sites.

   iVillage has been and may be subject to claims for defamation, negligence,
copyright or trademark infringement, personal injury or other legal theories
relating to the information it publishes on its Web sites. These types of
claims have been brought, sometimes successfully, against online services as
well as other print publications in the past. iVillage could also be subjected
to claims based upon the content that is accessible from its Web sites through
links to other Web sites or through content and materials that may be posted
by members in chat rooms or bulletin boards. iVillage also offers e-mail
services through a third party vendor, which may subject it to potential
risks, such as liabilities or claims resulting from unsolicited e-mail, lost
or misdirected messages, illegal or fraudulent use of e-mail or interruptions
or delays in e-mail service. iVillage's insurance, which covers commercial
general liability, may not adequately protect it against these types of
claims.

   iVillage may incur potential product liability for the products it sells.

   Consumers may sue iVillage if any of the products that it sold before its
recent sale of assets related to its iBaby site, or before its divestiture of
its iMaternity and PlusBoutique sites, were defective, fail to perform
properly or injure the user. iVillage may also face potential liability in
connection with the sale of products and services by its e-commerce partners.
To date, iVillage has had very limited experience in the sale of products and
the development of relationships with manufacturers or suppliers. iVillage
plans to develop a range of products targeted specifically at women through
Astrology.com and Lamaze Publishing and other e-commerce sites that it may
acquire in the future. iVillage also may foster relationships with
manufacturers or companies to offer these products directly on iVillage.com.
Such a strategy involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Although iVillage's
agreements with manufacturers typically contain provisions intended to limit
its exposure to liability claims, these limitations may not prevent all
potential claims. In addition, through iVillage.com, Lamaze Publishing and
iVillage Integrated Properties, Inc., iVillage distributes publications and
broadcast over its Web sites and the Newborn Channel, information and
instructions regarding healthcare, childbirth, infant care and financial and
tax issues. iVillage may be exposed to liability claims in connection with the
information it provides. Liability claims could require iVillage to spend
significant time and money in litigation and to pay significant damages. As a
result, liability claims, whether or not successful, could seriously damage
iVillage's reputation and business.

   There is intense competition among Internet-based businesses and publishing
companies focused on women and this competition could result in price
reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share.

   The number of Web sites competing for the attention and spending of members,
users and advertisers has increased and iVillage expects it to continue to
increase. iVillage's Web sites compete for members, users and advertisers with
the following types of companies:

   o online services or Web sites targeted at women, such as Oxygen.com and
     condenet.com;

   o cable networks targeting women, such as Oxygen Media, Inc. and Lifetime
     Television;

   o Web search and retrieval and other online service companies, commonly
     referred to as portals, such as America Online, Inc., Terra Networks,
     S.A. and Yahoo! Inc.;

   o e-commerce companies such as Amazon.com; and

   o publishers and distributors of traditional media, such as television,
     radio and print.

   Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins or
loss of market share, any of which could adversely affect iVillage's business,
results of operations and financial condition.

   Lamaze Publishing's magazines directly compete with publishers of pre-and
post-natal publications such as Gruner and Jahr, Primedia and Time Warner.
These publishers have substantially greater marketing, research and financial
resources than Lamaze Publishing. Increased competition may result in less
advertising in Lamaze Publishing's magazines and a decline in Lamaze
Publishing's advertising rates, which could adversely affect its business,
results of operations and financial condition.

   iVillage's uncertain sales cycles could adversely affect its business.

   The time between the date of initial contact with a potential advertiser or
sponsor and the execution of a contract with the advertiser or sponsor is
often lengthy, typically six weeks for smaller agreements and longer for
larger agreements, and is subject to delays over which iVillage has little or
no control, including:

   o advertisers' and sponsors' budgetary constraints;

   o advertisers' and sponsors' internal acceptance reviews;

   o the success and continued internal support of advertisers' and sponsors'
     own development efforts; and

   o the possibility of cancellation or delay of projects by advertisers or
     sponsors.

   During the sales cycle, iVillage may expend substantial funds and management
resources and yet not obtain sponsorship or advertising revenues. Accordingly,
iVillage's results of operations for a particular period may be adversely
affected if sales to advertisers or sponsors forecasted in a particular period
are delayed or do not otherwise occur.

   America Online investments may result in conflicts of interest for America
Online that could be adverse to iVillage.

   America Online has invested in Oxygen Media, an Internet and television
company that is developing cable and interactive content for women and
children. In addition, Oxygen Media has acquired from America Online the
assets of electra.com, an online women's network, and Thrive Partners LLC, the
operator of thriveonline.com, a health site. The relationship between America
Online and Oxygen Media and America Online and other Internet companies may
result in a conflict of interest for America Online, which may not be resolved
in iVillage's favor. In addition, other principal investors in iVillage may
have similar conflicts of interests by virtue of their other investments.

   If iVillage fails to attract and retain key personnel, its business would be
materially and adversely affected.

   iVillage's future success depends to a significant extent on the continued
services of its senior management and other key personnel, particularly,
Douglas McCormick, its chief executive officer. iVillage currently does not
maintain "key person" life insurance for any of its personnel. The loss of the
services of Mr. McCormick or other key employees would likely harm iVillage's
business.

   iVillage may be unable to retain its key employees or attract, assimilate or
retain other highly qualified employees in the future. iVillage has from time
to time experienced, and expects to continue to experience difficulty in
hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications
as a result of its rapid growth and expansion and its relatively low stock
price. As a result, iVillage incurred increased salaries, benefits and
recruiting expenses for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999. If
iVillage does not succeed in attracting new personnel or retaining and
motivating its current personnel, its business will be adversely affected.

   iVillage's business will be harmed if Internet usage does not continue to
grow.

   iVillage's market is new and rapidly evolving. iVillage's business would be
adversely affected if Internet usage does not continue to grow, particularly
usage by women. A number of factors may inhibit Internet usage, including:

   o inadequate network infrastructure;

   o security concerns;

   o inconsistent quality of service;

   o lack of availability of cost-effective, high-speed service;

   o consumers returning to traditional or alternative sources for
     information, shopping and services; and

   o privacy concerns, including those related to the ability of Web sites to
     gather information about users without their knowledge or consent.

   If Internet usage continues to grow significantly, the Internet
infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by this
growth and its performance and reliability may decline. In addition, Web sites
have experienced interruptions in their services as a result of outages and
other delays occurring throughout the Internet network infrastructure. If
these outages and delays frequently occur in the future, Internet usage, as
well as the usage of iVillage Web sites, could grow more slowly or decline.

   iVillage may be unable to respond to the rapid technological change in its
industry.

   iVillage's market is characterized by rapidly changing technologies,
frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry
standards. The recent growth of the Internet and intense competition in
iVillage's industry exacerbate these market characteristics. To achieve its
goals, iVillage needs to effectively integrate the various software programs
and tools required to enhance and improve its product offerings and manage its
business. iVillage's future success will depend on its ability to adapt to
rapidly changing technologies by continually improving the performance
features and reliability of its services. iVillage may experience difficulties
that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction or
marketing of new products and services. In addition, iVillage's new
enhancements must meet the requirements of its current and prospective users
and must achieve significant market acceptance. iVillage also could incur
substantial costs if it needs to modify its services or infrastructures to
adapt to these changes.

   Government regulation and legal uncertainties could add additional costs to
doing business on the Internet.

   There are currently few laws or regulations that specifically regulate
communications or commerce on the Internet. However, laws and regulations may
be adopted in the future that address issues such as user privacy, pricing and
taxation, content, copyrights, distribution, antitrust matters and the
characteristics and quality of products and services. For example, the
Telecommunications Act sought to prohibit transmitting various types of
information and content over the Internet. Several telecommunications
companies have petitioned the Federal Communications Commission to regulate
Internet service providers and online service providers in a manner similar to
long distance telephone carriers and to impose access fees on those companies.
This could increase the cost of transmitting data over the Internet. Moreover,
it may take years to determine the extent to which existing laws relating to
issues such as property ownership, obscenity, libel and personal privacy are
applicable to the Internet or the application of laws and regulations from
jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to iVillage's business. Any
new laws or regulations relating to the Internet could adversely affect
iVillage's business.

   In addition, it has been reported that the Labor Department is investigating
the use of volunteers on Web sites. iVillage uses volunteers as Web site
community leaders and there can be no assurance that new government
regulations will not require iVillage to stop using volunteers or,
alternatively, treat them as employees.

   Due to the global nature of the Internet, it is possible that, although
iVillage's transmissions over the Internet originate primarily in New York,
the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to
regulate iVillage's business activities. In addition, because iVillage's
service is available over the Internet in multiple states and foreign
countries, these jurisdictions may require iVillage to qualify to do business
as a foreign corporation in each of these states or foreign countries, which
could subject iVillage to taxes and other regulations.

   iVillage may face potential liability for its privacy practices.

   Growing public concern about privacy and the collection, distribution and
use of information about individuals may subject iVillage to increased
regulatory scrutiny and/or litigation. If iVillage is accused of violating the
stated terms of its privacy policy it may be forced to expend significant
amounts of monetary and human resources to defend against any such
accusations. iVillage also may be required to make changes to its present and
planned products or services. These consequences, together with any resulting
liability for iVillage's privacy practices, could have a material adverse
effect on iVillage's business, financial condition and results of operations.

   The business of the combined company would be harmed if its systems fail or
experience a slowdown.

   Substantially all of iVillage's communications hardware and some of its
other computer hardware operations are located at Exodus Communications,
Inc.'s facilities in New Jersey and Verio, Inc.'s facilities in California.
Fire, floods, earthquakes, power loss (including as a result of rolling
blackouts), telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events could
damage these systems and the systems used by Women.com. For example, in May
and June 1999, user access to Women.com's pregnancy channel was disrupted as a
result of a system failure. System failures may adversely affect the combined
company's user traffic results, which could adversely affect its revenues and
operating results and harm its reputation with users, advertisers and commerce
partners. Computer viruses, electronic break-ins or other similar disruptive
problems, such as those historically experienced by several leading Web sites,
could also adversely affect iVillage's Web sites. California is in the midst
of an energy crisis that could disrupt the operation of iVillage's Web sites
and increase its expenses. iVillage's insurance policies may not adequately
compensate it for any losses that may occur due to any failures or
interruptions in its systems. iVillage does not presently have any secondary
"off-site" systems or a formal disaster recovery plan.

   iVillage's Web sites must accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver
frequently updated information. iVillage's Web sites have in the past
experienced slower response times or decreased traffic for a variety of
reasons. These occurrences have not had a material impact on iVillage's
business. These types of occurrences in the future could cause users to
perceive iVillage's Web sites as not functioning properly and therefore cause
them to use another Web site or other methods to obtain information.

   In addition, iVillage's users depend on Internet service providers, online
service providers and other Web site operators for access to iVillage's Web
sites. Many of them have experienced significant outages in the past, and
could experience outages, delays and other difficulties due to system failures
unrelated to iVillage's systems.

   iVillage may not be able to deliver various services if third parties fail
to provide reliable software, systems and related services to it.

   iVillage is dependent on various third parties for software, systems and
related services. For example, iVillage relies on Doubleclick Inc.'s software
for the placement of advertisements, Trellix Corporation for personal space
home pages and Critical Path Inc. for e-mail. Several of the third parties
which provide software and services to iVillage have a limited operating
history, have relatively immature technology and are themselves dependent on
reliable delivery of services from others. As a result, iVillage's ability to
deliver various services to its users may be adversely affected by the failure
of these third parties to provide reliable software, systems and related
services to it.

   iVillage may be liable if third parties misappropriate its users' personal
information.

   If third parties were able to penetrate iVillage's network security or
otherwise misappropriate its users' personal information or credit card
information, iVillage could be subject to liability arising from claims
related to, among other things, unauthorized purchases with credit card
information, impersonation or other similar fraud claims or other misuse of
personal information, such as for unauthorized marketing purposes. In
addition, the Federal Trade Commission and state agencies have been
investigating various Internet companies regarding their use of personal
information. iVillage could incur additional expenses if new regulations
regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if its privacy
practices are investigated.

   Internet security concerns could hinder e-commerce.

   The need to securely transmit confidential information over the Internet has
been a significant barrier to electronic commerce and communications over the
Internet. Any well-publicized compromise of security could deter people from
using the Internet or using it to conduct transactions that involve
transmitting confidential information. iVillage may incur significant costs to
protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems
caused by such breaches.

   iVillage's operation of Lamaze Publishing and the Newborn Channel poses a
number of risks that could materially adversely affect its business strategy.

   There are a number of risks in operating Lamaze Publishing and the Newborn
Channel, which are non-Internet businesses, including:

   o the competitiveness of the media and publishing industry;

   o iVillage's limited experience in operating a multi-media publishing
     company;

   o iVillage's ability to identify and predict trends in a timely manner that
     may impact consumer tastes in baby-related information in Lamaze
     Publishing's publications and iVillage's Newborn Channel;

   o iVillage's ability to continue to sell advertising and sponsorships on
     iVillage's Web sites and in Lamaze Publishing's magazines, videos and Web
     site, and iVillage's Newborn Channel;

   o iVillage's ability to continue to commercialize and protect the Lamaze
     mark;

   o iVillage's ability to maintain and market the Lamaze.com Web site; and

   iVillage's inability to perform the functions required for the operation of
Lamaze Publishing and the Newborn Channel in an efficient and timely manner
could result in a disruption of operations of Lamaze Publishing and the
Newborn Channel that could have a material adverse effect on iVillage's
business strategy.

   Satellite transmissions over the Newborn Channel may be interrupted.

   Through iVillage Integrated Properties, iVillage operates the Newborn
Channel, a satellite television network broadcast in over 1,000 hospitals in
the United States. There is a risk that the satellite from which the
transmission is sent may malfunction, interrupting the Newborn Channel's
broadcasts. In the event this occurs, there may be a period of time before the
Newborn Channel can transmit to and from another satellite. Any interruption
in iVillage's ability to transmit the Newborn Channel could have an adverse
impact on its business. In addition, extreme adverse weather could damage
receivers and transmitters on the ground, thereby hindering transmissions.

   Consumer protection privacy regulations could impair iVillage's ability to
obtain information about its users.

   iVillage's network captures information regarding its members in order to
tailor content to them and assist advertisers in targeting their advertising
campaigns to particular demographic groups. However, privacy concerns may
cause users to resist providing the personal data necessary to support this
tailoring capability. Even the perception of security and privacy concerns,
whether or not valid, may indirectly inhibit market acceptance of iVillage's
network. In addition, legislative or regulatory requirements may heighten
these concerns if businesses must notify Internet users that the data may be
used by marketing entities to direct product promotion and advertising to the
user. Other countries and political entities, such as the European Economic
Community, have adopted such legislation or regulatory requirements. If
consumer privacy concerns are not adequately addressed, iVillage's business,
financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.

   iVillage's network uses cookies to track user behavior and preferences. A
cookie is information keyed to a specific server, file pathway or directory
location that is stored on a user's hard drive, possibly without the user's
knowledge, but is generally removable by the user. Germany has imposed laws
limiting the use of cookies, and a number of Internet commentators, advocates
and governmental bodies in the United States and other countries have urged
the passage of laws limiting or abolishing the use of cookies. If these laws
are passed, iVillage's business, financial condition and results of operations
could be materially harmed.

   Possible infringement of intellectual property rights could harm iVillage's
business.

   iVillage cannot be certain that the steps it has taken to protect its
intellectual property rights will be adequate or that third parties will not
infringe or misappropriate its proprietary rights. Any infringement or
misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on iVillage's future
financial results. In addition, iVillage has from time to time become involved
in intellectual property disputes with third parties that may not result in a
favorable outcome for iVillage.

   iVillage could be subject to possible infringement actions based upon its
use of domain names, its content and content licensed from others.

   iVillage has invested resources in acquiring domain names for existing and
potential future use. iVillage cannot guarantee that it will be entitled to
use such names under applicable trademark and similar laws or that other
desired domain names will be available. Furthermore, enforcing iVillage's
intellectual property rights could entail significant expense and could prove
difficult or impossible. In addition, third parties could assert claims of
patent, trademark or copyright infringement or misappropriation of creative
ideas or formats against iVillage with respect to its use of domain names, its
content, Web page formats, Web business methods or any third-party content it
carries. iVillage expects that participants in its markets increasingly will
be subject to infringement claims as the number of services and competitors in
its industry segment grows. Any claims, with or without merit, could be time
consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management attention,
require iVillage to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements or
prevent it from using important technologies, ideas or formats, any of which
could materially harm iVillage's business, financial condition or results of
operations.

   Several members of senior management have only recently joined iVillage.

   Several members of iVillage's senior management joined the company in 2000
and have not previously worked together. As a result, iVillage's senior
managers are continuing to become integrated as a management team and may not
work together effectively as a team to successfully manage iVillage's growth.

Background of the Merger

   During the course of the prior three years, various senior management

   Beginning the week of January 29, 2001, there were a series of daily

   From February 1, 2001 through February 5, 2001, representatives of iVillage,

acquisition of Women.com and the investment of an aggregate of $20.0 million
by Hearst Communications and other Women.com stockholders in iVillage through

Women.com's Reasons for the Merger

   Women.com's board of directors has determined that the terms of the merger
and the merger agreement are fair to and in the best interests of Women.com
and its stockholders, has declared the advisability of the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated by it and has determined to recommend that
the stockholders of Women.com adopt the merger agreement. In its evaluation of
the merger and the merger agreement, Women.com's board of directors consulted
with Women.com's senior management, as well as its legal and financial
advisors. The decision of the Women.com board of directors to approve the
merger and the merger agreement was based upon several potential benefits of
the merger that Women.com's board believes will contribute to the success of
iVillage following the merger compared to Women.com continuing to operate as
an independent business. Women.com's management has also considered a number
of alternatives for enhancing its business, including acquiring other
companies.

   In addition to the potential benefits described under "iVillage's Reasons
for the Merger" that would be applicable to Women.com stockholders, the
Women.com board believes that additional reasons the merger will be beneficial
to Women.com and its stockholders include the following:

   o the merger would provide Women.com stockholders with shares of iVillage
     common stock in a taxable event, which will allow stockholders to realize
     losses, which are currently unrealized, upon the date of the completion
     of the merger;

   o the availability to iVillage following the merger of greater resources to
     continue to establish, expand and support advertisement sales,
     distribution, and editorial on and through the Women.com web site;

   o the potential synergies created from combining the audience reach,
     distribution and other strengths developed by iVillage with the brand and
     consumer relationships built by Women.com;

   o the ability to merge the complementary content of iVillage and Women.com
     and create a targeted, highly-relevant destination for women on the Web;

   o upon completion of the merger, the increased market share of iVillage
     would enable it to compete more effectively against content aggregators,
     including AOL, Yahoo! and MSN; and

   o the increased ability to more easily raise funds to continue operations
     and company growth.

   Women.com's board reviewed a number of factors in evaluating the merger,
including, but not limited to, the following:

   o information concerning the financial performance and condition, results
     of operations, competitive position, management and business of iVillage
     and Women.com before and after giving effect to the merger;

   o the disadvantages to Women.com of being a small public company, in that
     its capital structure as a small public company makes it difficult to
     support its capital requirements;

   o current financial market conditions and historical market prices,
     volatility and trading information with respect to iVillage common stock
     and Women.com common stock;

   o the consideration iVillage will issue in the merger in light of
     comparable merger transactions;

   o the belief that the consideration offered by iVillage was the most that
     iVillage was willing to offer;

   o the belief that no third party would be willing to offer more than
     iVillage for the shares of Women.com, based on the fact that iVillage
     fully understands Women.com's business plan, is fully aware of its future
     prospects and is in a better position to appreciate its long-term
     potential than any other potential buyer;

   o the belief that the terms of the merger agreement and related agreements
     are reasonable;

   o the impact of the merger on the customers and employees of Women.com and
     iVillage;

   o the market conditions affecting Internet media companies;

   o the business condition and prospects of Women.com if the proposed
     transaction with iVillage is not completed, which would involve a need
     for significant capital, and an uncertainty of being able to raise
     capital;

   o results of the due diligence investigation conducted by Women.com's
     management, accountants and legal and financial advisors;

   o the financial presentation and detailed analyses of Salomon Smith Barney,
     including its opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view
     and as of the date of the opinion, of the merger consideration, including
     the benefits to be derived from the Hearst Communications investment
     following the completion of the merger,  provided for in the merger
     agreement, as more fully described below under the caption "Opinion of
     Women.com's Financial Advisor;" and

   o the availability to dissenting stockholders of appraisal rights under the
     Delaware General Corporation Law.

   Women.com's board also considered the terms of the merger agreement
regarding Women.com's rights and limits on its ability to consider and
negotiate other acquisition proposals, as well as the possible effects of the

provisions regarding termination and termination fees. In addition, it was
noted to Women.com's board that the merger is expected to be a taxable
transaction and accounted for as a purchase.

   The Women.com board also identified and considered a number of potentially
negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger and the merger
agreement, including the following:

   o the risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized;

   o the fact that the proposed exchange ratio is not fixed and could change
     depending on certain metrics that Women.com must meet and the fact that
     the market prices of either company's stock before completion of the
     merger may change in a way that reduces the absolute value delivered to
     Women.com because the ratio does not change if the market values change;

   o the risk that the merger may not be consummated, notwithstanding the
     voting agreement obtained from certain stockholders of both iVillage and
     Women.com, and the effect of the public announcement of the merger on
     Women.com's sales, customer relations and operating results;

   o the risk of management and employee disruption associated with the
     merger, including resignations or layoffs of employees and the fact that
     key technical, sales and management personnel would likely not be
     employed by iVillage following the merger;

   o the fact that the merger agreement requires Women.com to obtain
     iVillage's consent to take a variety of actions prior to the closing of
     the merger;

   o Women.com's limited ability to terminate the merger agreement, including
     the fact that, under certain circumstances, the receipt of a superior
     proposal may allow the Women.com board of directors to change or withdraw
     its recommendation as to the adoption of the merger agreement, but would
     still require Women.com to submit the adoption of the merger agreement to
     a vote of Women.com stockholders;

   o the challenges of integrating Women.com's operations with those of
     iVillage; and

   o other applicable risks described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus
     under "Risk Factors."

   Women.com's board concluded, however, that these risks could be managed or
mitigated and that on balance, the merger's potential benefits to Women.com
and its stockholders outweighed the associated risks. This discussion of the
information and factors considered by Women.com's board is not exhaustive. In
view of the variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of
the merger, Women.com's board did not find it practicable to, and did not
quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to, the specific factors
considered in reaching the determination.

Recommendation of Women.com's board of directors

   For the reasons discussed above, the Women.com board of directors believes
that the terms of the merger are fair to and in the best interests of
Women.com's stockholders and recommends that the stockholders vote to approve
the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, including the merger.

   In considering the recommendation of Women.com's board with respect to the
merger agreement, Women.com stockholders should be aware that certain
directors and officers of Women.com have interests in the merger that are
different from, or are in addition to, the interests of other Women.com
stockholders and that iVillage has agreed to continue certain existing
indemnification arrangements in favor of directors and officers of Women.com.
Please see "The Merger - Interests of  Directors and Officers in the Merger
that are Different from Your Interests."

iVillage's Reasons for the Merger

   The board of directors of iVillage believes that the combination of iVillage
and Women.com will create the largest and most comprehensive online
destination for women. The board of directors of iVillage has determined that
the terms of the merger and the merger agreement are fair to and in the best
interests of iVillage and its stockholders, and has determined to recommend
that the stockholders of iVillage approve the merger and adopt the merger
agreement. In reaching the conclusion that the merger is in the best interest
of iVillage and its

stockholders, iVillage's board of directors consulted with iVillage's senior
management regarding the strategic and operational aspects of the merger and
the results of due diligence efforts undertaken by senior management. In
addition, iVillage's board of directors consulted with representatives of
Allen & Company Incorporated, financial advisor to iVillage, regarding
selected financial aspects of iVillage's and Women.com's business and future
prospects facing Internet media companies, in general, and iVillage and
Women.com, in particular, as well as the fairness from a financial point of
view to iVillage. iVillage's board also consulted with iVillage's internal
counsel and representatives of its outside legal counsel, regarding the duties
of the members of the board of directors, legal due diligence matters and the
terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the related agreements.

   The following factors among others were also evaluated in connection with
the merger:

   o information concerning the financial condition, business, operations,
     strategic objectives and prospects and competitive position of iVillage
     and Women.com before and after giving effect to the merger;

   o the market conditions and industry trends affecting iVillage, Women.com
     and Internet media companies in general;

   o current financial market conditions and historical market prices,
     volatility and trading information with respect to iVillage common stock
     and Women.com common stock;

   o the need for and the ability of iVillage to obtain additional financing;

   o the agreements with Hearst Communications regarding licensing of content
     by Hearst Communications to iVillage and the payment by Hearst
     Communications for production services and advertising;

   o the consideration iVillage will issue in the merger in light of merger
     transactions deemed comparable;

   o the impact of the merger on the advertisers, sponsors, customers and
     employees of iVillage and Women.com;

   o the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and related agreements;
     and

   o the financial presentation of Allen & Company Incorporated, including its
     opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view as of the date
     of the opinion, of the exchange ratio provided for in the merger
     agreement, as more fully described below under the caption "Opinion of
     iVillage's Financial Advisor."

   The iVillage board believes that the merger and the related agreements will
be beneficial to iVillage and its stockholders for the following reasons:

   o the terms and conditions of the merger and the related agreements are
     reasonable;

   o the merger will result in creation of the most comprehensive online
     destination for content and services targeted to women;

   o the merger will enable existing and new potential sponsors to have
     increased access to one of the most highly targeted and desirable
     demographics on the Internet;

   o the merger will result in iVillage being ranked in the largest 20 digital
     media/Web properties worldwide;

   o the merger will increase market share to enable the combined company to
     compete more effectively for advertising revenues;

   o strategic relationship with Hearst Communications relating to advertising
     and to access to extensive content of Hearst Communications, a leading
     publisher of publications targeted to women;

   o access to a significant equity investment from Hearst Communications and
     other Women.com stockholders to enable iVillage to continue to establish,
     expand and support sales and distribution; and

   o the merger and the related agreements will better position iVillage in
     the capital markets.

   iVillage's board also identified and considered a number of potentially
negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger and the agreement,
including the following:

   o the risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized;

   o the challenges of integrating Women.com's operations with those of
     iVillage; and

   o other applicable risks described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus
     under "Risk Factors."

   This discussion of the information and factors considered by iVillage's
board is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material factors
considered. iVillage's board did not find it practicable to, and did not
quantify or otherwise assign particular weight to or rank the specific factors
it considered in approving the merger and the merger agreement. In considering
the factors described above, the individual members of the iVillage board may
have given different weight to various factors. The iVillage board considered
all these factors as a whole, and overall considered them to be favorable to,
and to support, its determination.

Recommendation of iVillage's board of directors

   For the reasons discussed above, iVillage's board of directors has approved
the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and has
determined that the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of iVillage and
its stockholders, and recommends that iVillage stockholders vote for approval
of the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
including the merger and the issuance of iVillage common stock and warrants to
purchase iVillage common stock pursuant to the securities purchase agreement
between iVillage and Hearst Communications and the rights offering to
Women.com stockholders.

Opinion of Women.com's Financial Advisor

   Salomon Smith Barney has acted as the financial advisor to the Women.com
board of directors in connection with the merger. Pursuant to Salomon Smith
Barney's engagement letter dated January 30, 2001, Salomon Smith Barney rendered
an oral opinion to the Women.com board of directors and subsequently confirmed
in writing, that, as of February 5, 2001 and based upon and subject to the
assumptions, limitations and qualifications set forth in the opinion, its work
described below and other factors it deemed relevant, the merger consideration,
including the benefits to be derived from the Hearst Communications investment
following consummation of the merger, was fair to the holders of Women.com
common stock, other than Hearst Communications, from a financial point of view.

   The full text of the written opinion which sets forth the assumptions made,
procedures followed and matters considered by Salomon Smith Barney is set
forth as Annex B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and Women.com
stockholders are urged to read Salomon Smith Barney's opinion in its entirety.
The summary of the opinion as set forth in this joint proxy statement/
prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
opinion.

   In arriving at its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney reviewed:

   o a draft of the merger agreement dated as of February 5, 2001;

   o a securities purchase agreement by and between iVillage and Hearst
     Communications dated as of February 5, 2001;

   o a stockholder agreement to be entered into between iVillage and Hearst
     Communications on the closing date of the merger; and

   o an amendment to the Women.com and Hearst Communications content and
     licensing agreement dated February 5, 2001.

   Salomon Smith Barney also held discussions with certain Women.com senior
officers, directors and other representatives and advisors and certain senior
officers and other representatives and advisors of iVillage concerning
Women.com's and iVillage's businesses, operations and prospects. Salomon Smith
Barney examined publicly available business and financial information relating
to Women.com and iVillage, as well as financial forecasts and other
information and data for each that were provided to or otherwise discussed
with Salomon Smith Barney by the managements of Women.com and iVillage
including information regarding strategic implications and operational
benefits anticipated to result from each. Salomon Smith Barney reviewed the
financial terms of the merger as set forth in the draft merger agreement in
relation to, among other things:

   o current and historical market prices and trading volumes of Women.com and
     iVillage common stock;

   o current and historical exchange ratio comparisons;

   o current and prospective capitalization and financial conditions of
     Women.com and iVillage; and

   o implied exchange ratios based upon Women.com's percentage contribution of
     revenues and other metrics to the combined entity.

   Salomon Smith Barney also considered, to the extent publicly available, the
financial terms of other similar transactions recently effected that Salomon
Smith Barney considered relevant in evaluating the merger, and analyzed
certain financial and stock market data relating to the businesses of
Women.com and iVillage. Salomon Smith Barney also evaluated the relative pro
forma financial impact with respect to the synergies of the merger on the
combined company. In addition, Salomon Smith Barney conducted such other
analyses and examinations and considered such other information and financial,
economic and market criteria as it deemed appropriate in arriving at its
opinion.

   In its review and analysis and in arriving at its opinion, Salomon Smith
Barney assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the
information reviewed by Salomon Smith Barney for the purpose of its opinion
and did not assume any responsibility for independent verification of such
information. With respect to the financial forecasts of Women.com and
iVillage, Salomon Smith Barney assumed that they have been reasonably prepared
on bases reflecting best currently available estimates and judgments of the
managements of Women.com and iVillage, respectively, and Salomon Smith Barney
expressed no opinion with respect to such forecasts or the assumptions on
which they are based. Salomon Smith Barney also has assumed that the merger
and the Hearst Communications investment will be consummated in accordance
with the terms of the merger agreement and the securities purchase agreement,
respectively. Salomon Smith Barney did not make or obtain or assume any
responsibility for making or obtaining any independent evaluation or appraisal
of any of the assets (including properties and facilities) or liabilities of
Women.com or iVillage.

   Salomon Smith Barney's opinion should be read carefully and in its entirety.
It does not imply any conclusion as to the likely trading range for iVillage
common stock following the consummation of the merger or the Hearst
Communications investment, which may vary depending upon, among other factors,
changes in interest rates, dividend rates, market conditions, general economic
conditions and other factors that generally influence the price of securities.
It does not address Women.com's underlying business decision to effect the
merger or the Hearst Communications investment, and Salomon Smith Barney
expresses no view on the effect on Women.com or iVillage of the merger or the
Hearst Communications investment. Salomon Smith Barney's opinion is directed
only to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger
consideration, including the benefits to be derived from the Hearst
Communications investment following the consummation of the merger, to the
holders of Women.com common stock, other than Hearst Communications and does
not constitute a recommendation concerning how holders of Women.com common
stock should vote regarding the proposed merger.

   In connection with rendering its opinion to the Women.com board of
directors, Salomon Smith Barney performed several financial analyses, the
material portions of which are summarized below. Salomon Smith Barney believes
that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of
such analyses and the factors it considered, without considering all such
analyses and factors, could create an incomplete view of the analyses and the
process underlying its opinion. While the conclusions reached in connection
with each analysis were considered carefully by Salomon Smith Barney in
arriving at its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney made various subjective
judgments in arriving at its opinion and did not consider it practicable to,
nor did it attempt to, assign relative weights to the individual analyses and
specific factors considered in reaching its opinion. The following is a
summary of the material financial analyses used by Salomon Smith Barney in
connection with providing its opinion to the Women.com board of directors.
Several of the summaries below include information presented in tabular
format. To fully understand such financial analyses used by Salomon Smith
Barney, the tables must be read with the text of each summary. The tables
alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses.

   Historical Stock Price Performance.  Salomon Smith Barney reviewed the
movements of Women.com common stock and iVillage common stock relative to
their trading volume and price history for the period from

January 1, 2000 through February 2, 2001. Salomon Smith Barney noted that
during the period analyzed, Women.com common stock had declined 96% from its
52-week high on March 7, 2000 of $15.00 per share compared to iVillage's
declined depreciation of 94% from its 52-week high on March 15, 2000 of $27.31
per share. Salomon Smith Barney also found that the declines in both
companies' market capitalization over the past year were in line with smaller,
niche-oriented online media companies.

   Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis.  Salomon Smith Barney reviewed the
implied historical exchange ratio between Women.com common stock and iVillage
common stock determined by dividing the closing price per share of Women.com
common stock by the closing price per share of iVillage common stock for the
six, three and one month intervals ending February 2, 2001 as well as for the
period from January 1, 2000, through February 2, 2001. The review indicated
that during the periods measured, the closing prices of iVillage common stock
and Women.com common stock implied the following high, low and average
historical exchange ratios:

                             Implied Exchange Ratio

                                                   High    Low    Average
                                                   ----    ----   -------

1 month ........................................   0.41    0.23     0.31
3 months .......................................   0.58    0.18     0.36
6 months .......................................   1.27    0.18     0.41
Since 1/1/2000 .................................   1.27    0.18     0.41

   Salomon Smith Barney noted that the implied exchange ratio of 0.407 based on
the closing stock prices for iVillage and Women.com on February 2, 2001 was
greater than the exchange ratio of 0.322 agreed to in the merger. Salomon
Smith Barney also noted that the exchange ratio of 0.322 is greater than the
low of the exchange ratios calculated over the measured period and greater
than the average exchange ratio during the thirty days ending February 2,
2001. Due to volatility in stock prices, it is customary to view exchange
ratios over a period of time rather than on a single trading day.

   Relative Valuation Analysis. Salomon Smith Barney conducted various
analyses of Women.com and iVillage comparing several indicators of financial
performance on a prospective basis:

   Profit and Loss Performance. The profit and loss performance analysis
analyzed the relative operating performance of iVillage and Women.com on an
annual and quarterly basis for 2000 and as projected for 2001. Salomon Smith
Barney examined the profitability of each company by comparing the cost of
goods sold, sales and marketing and research and development expenses as a
percentage of revenue on a historical basis for each quarter of 2000 and
projected basis for each quarter of 2001. This analysis indicated that, as a
percentage of revenue, Women.com's expenses were consistently higher in the
historical periods and were projected to remain higher during 2001. The
analysis also highlighted iVillage's ability to maintain their revenues during
a difficult market environment while Women.com experienced quarterly declines.

   Cash Burn Analysis. The cash burn analysis compared the cash burn rate of
iVillage and Women.com for the operation of the respective businesses over
each of the four quarters of 2000 and as projected for 2001 to forecast their
respective capital requirements. The cash burn analysis indicated that
iVillage is expected to have more cash than Women.com at the end of 2001
implying a better competitive position for iVillage and its stockholders. This
analysis revealed that iVillage is projected to have positive cash balances
throughout 2001, while Women.com's cash balance is projected to be depleted by
the third quarter of 2001.

   Relative Contribution Analysis. Based upon financial estimates and
projections for Women.com and iVillage, Salomon Smith Barney analyzed the
respective contributions of Women.com and iVillage to the estimated revenues
of the combined company for the fourth quarter of 2000 annualized, calendar
year 2000 and calendar year 2001. In addition, Salomon Smith Barney analyzed
the respective contributions of Women.com and iVillage to the estimated web
site unique visitors, page views and usage hours to the combined company for
the month of December 2000 without any adjustment for potential positive or
negative synergies. Salomon Smith Barney noted that these metrics are less
relevant because they do not equate to direct measures of actual revenues or
profitability.

   The following table illustrates the implied exchange ratios, stock prices
and premiums for Women.com based upon Women.com's relative contribution to the
combined company's estimated revenues for the fourth quarter of 2000
annualized, calendar year 2000 and calendar year 2001 as well as for various
web site metrics for the month of December 2000. The currently offered
exchange ratio represents a premium when compared to all revenue metrics
analyzed for the Women.com stockholders to the exchange ratios implied by
revenue contributions.

   Precedent Transaction Analysis. Salomon Smith Barney reviewed publicly
available information for various proposed and completed stock-for-stock
acquisition transactions, all announced since September 20, 1999, that
involved publicly traded companies and that it deemed appropriate in analyzing
the merger. The precedent transactions considered by Salomon Smith Barney were
the following (in each case, the acquiror's name is listed first and the
acquired company's name is listed second):

   o Doubleclick Inc. / @plan.Inc

   o CNET Networks, Inc. / Ziff Davis, Inc. (ZD Net)

   o Media Metrix, Inc. / Jupiter Communications, Inc.

   o Earthlink, Inc. / OneMain.com, Inc.

   o Terra Networks, S.A. / Lycos, Inc.

   o MyPoints.com, Inc. / Cybergold, Inc.

   o America Online, Inc. / MapQuest.com, Inc.

   o CMGI, Inc. / Flycast Communications Corporation

   o MindSpring Enterprises Inc. / Earthlink, Inc.

   o CMGI, Inc. / AdForce, Inc.

   Salomon Smith Barney did not view any of these transactions as directly
comparable to the merger. For each precedent transaction, Salomon Smith Barney
derived the ratio of the target's pro forma ownership percentage in the
combined company to its percentage of revenue contributed to the combined
company without any adjustment for potential positive or negative synergies.

   With respect to the financial information for the companies involved in the
precedent transactions, Salomon Smith Barney relied on information in publicly
available documents, where available. The following table sets forth the
results of these analyses:

                                                                          Target Revenue                           Ownership/

                                                                      Last Quarter              Pro Forma    Last Quarter
                                                                       Annualized    Forward    Ownership     Annualized    Forward
                                                                       ---------      ------     --------     ---------      ------

Mean..............................................................       33.1%        34.8%       26.3%         85.5%        75.8%
Median............................................................        19.2         23.5        30.5          69.3         69.1

   Salomon Smith Barney noted that, prior to the Hearst Communications
transactions, Women.com stockholders, including Hearst Communications, would
receive shares based on the 0.322 exchange ratio that provided for an
approximate 33.8% ownership in the combined entity. Women.com is estimated to
have contributed 31% of revenue based on annualized fourth quarter 2000
estimates, which equates to an ownership / revenue contribution percentage of
109.0%. The same analysis for calendar year 2000 and 2001 indicates
percentages of 91.4% and 80.5%, respectively. Salomon Smith Barney noted that
all of these percentages are above the respective reference ranges with
respect to precedent transactions.

   Synergies Analysis. Salomon Smith Barney considered the impact of potential
synergies and cost savings expected to be achieved by the management of
Women.com and iVillage in connection with the merger. Based on the financial
information and forecasts discussed with the management of Women.com and
iVillage, Salomon Smith Barney calculated that the merger would have the
following pro forma effects on the revenues and expenses of the combined
company as compared to each company viewed independently:

Source: Salomon Smith Barney estimates for illustrative purposes only.

Assumptions:

(1) 15% increase to revenue.

(2) Proportional increase to cost of goods sold.

(3) 75% reduction to general & administrative expenses and 50% reduction to
    sales & marketing expenses and research & development expenses of smaller
    amount.

(4) iVillage cost of goods sold determined by applying Women.com cost of goods
    sold margin. Balance of cost of goods sold allocated to research &
    development.

   Salomon Smith Barney analyzed synergy projections estimated for the year
2000 and 2001 as to the future operating and financial performance of the
combined company. Salomon Smith Barney's pro forma analysis of revenues and
expenses illustrated that relative expenses for sales and marketing, research
and development and general administration as a percentage of revenue are
substantially higher for Women.com on its own than it will be for the combined
company. In addition, Salomon Smith Barney's pro forma estimates showed the
combined company with an estimated operating profit of 18.9% in 2001, as
compared to a projected 46.3% and 0.6% operating loss for Women.com and
iVillage, respectively.

   The preceding discussion is a summary of the material financial analyses
furnished by Salomon Smith Barney to the Women.com board of directors, but it
does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by
Salomon Smith Barney or of its presentations to the board of directors. The
preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily
susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In addition, the
process of preparing a fairness opinion necessarily requires a broad range of
subjective judgments with respect to appropriate comparable companies,
appropriate multiples of various selected financial data, appropriate discount
rates and other financial and other factors. Analyses and estimates of the
values of companies do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the
prices at which companies or their securities actually may be sold. No
precedent transaction analyzed for comparison is identical to this merger.
Accordingly, any analysis of a precedent transaction is not mathematical;
rather, it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning
differences in financial and operating characteristics of the companies
involved and other factors that could affect the public trading value of the
target companies or company to which they are being sold. The range of
valuation for any particular analysis should not be taken to be the view of
Salomon Smith Barney of the actual value of Women.com or iVillage.

   The opinion and presentation of Salomon Smith Barney to the Women.com board
of directors, in connection with which Salomon Smith Barney was requested to
evaluate the fairness from a financial point of view of the merger
consideration, including the benefits to be derived from the Hearst
Communications investment following the consummation of the merger, to the
holders of Women.com common stock, other than Hearst Communications, was only
one of many factors taken into consideration by the Women.com board of
directors in making its determination to approve the merger. No limitations
were imposed by the Women.com board of directors upon Salomon Smith Barney
with respect to the investigation made or the procedures followed by Salomon
Smith Barney in rendering its opinion.

   Salomon Smith Barney is an internationally recognized investment banking
firm that regularly engages in the valuation of companies and their securities
in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings,
competitive bids, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities,
and corporate, estate and other purposes. Women.com retained Salomon Smith
Barney as a financial advisor because of its reputation, expertise in the
valuation of companies and substantial experience in transactions such as the
merger.

   In the past, Salomon Smith Barney has rendered investment banking and
financial advisory services to Women.com for which it has been paid fees.
Pursuant to an engagement letter dated January 30, 2001, Women.com agreed to
pay Salomon Smith Barney a fee upon consummation of the merger. Additionally,
Women.com has agreed to reimburse Salomon Smith Barney for reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses
of Salomon Smith Barney's legal counsel. Women.com has also agreed to
indemnify Salomon Smith Barney and related persons against liabilities,
including liabilities under the federal securities laws, related to or arising
out of its engagement. In the ordinary course of its business, Salomon Smith
Barney and its affiliates may actively trade the securities of Women.com and
iVillage for its own account and the accounts of its customers and,
accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in these
securities.

Opinion of iVillage's Financial Advisor

   At the meeting of the iVillage board on February 2, 2001, Allen & Company
Incorporated delivered its opinion, later confirmed in writing on February 5,
2001, to the effect that, as of that date, the terms of the merger were fair
to iVillage from a financial point of view.

   The full text of the written opinion of Allen & Company, dated February 5,
2001, is set forth as Annex C to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and
describes the assumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review
undertaken. iVillage stockholders are urged to read the opinion carefully and
in its entirety. Allen & Company's opinion is directed only to the fairness to
iVillage, from a financial point of view, of the terms of the merger and does
not constitute a recommendation of the merger over other courses of action
that may be available to iVillage or constitute a recommendation to any
iVillage stockholder on how to vote with respect to the merger. The summary of
the opinion of Allen & Company set forth in this joint proxy statement/
prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such
opinion.

   In arriving at its opinion, Allen & Company:

   o reviewed the terms and conditions of the merger, including the draft
     merger agreement and the draft agreements related thereto;

   o reviewed and analyzed publicly available historical business and
     financial information relating to iVillage and Women.com, as presented in
     documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission;

   o reviewed certain financial, operating and budgetary data provided to
     Allen & Company by iVillage and Women.com relating to their businesses;

   o conducted discussions with certain members of the senior management of
     iVillage and Women.com with respect to the financial condition, business,
     operations, strategic objectives and prospects of iVillage and Women.com,
     as well as prevailing industry trends;

   o reviewed and analyzed public information, including certain stock market
     data and financial information relating to selected public companies in
     lines of business which Allen & Company deemed to be generally comparable
     to iVillage's and Women.com's, as well as analysts' reports and estimates
     for iVillage and Women.com;

   o reviewed the recent trading history of iVillage common stock and
     Women.com common stock, including each company's performance in
     comparison to market indices and to selected companies in comparable
     businesses;

   o reviewed public financial and transaction information relating to
     business combinations which Allen & Company deemed to be comparable to
     the merger;

   o considered premiums and multiples paid in recent transactions which Allen
     & Company deemed comparable to the merger; and

   o conducted such other financial analyses and investigations as Allen &
     Company deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of the opinion
     expressed therein.

   In giving its opinion, Allen & Company assumed and relied on the accuracy
and completeness of the information it reviewed for the purpose of its
opinion. Allen & Company did not assume any responsibility for independent
verification of such information or for any independent evaluation or
appraisal of the assets of iVillage or Women.com. Allen & Company assumed that
financial, operating and budgetary data referred to above for iVillage and
Women.com had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of the management of iVillage and Women.com.
Allen & Company expressed no opinion with respect to such financial, operating
and budgetary data or the assumptions on which they were based.

   Allen & Company's opinion was necessarily based upon business, market,
economic and other conditions as they existed on, and could be evaluated as
of, the date of its opinion. Allen & Company's opinion does not imply any
conclusion as to the likely trading range of the iVillage common stock
following the consummation of the merger. This may vary depending on, among
other factors, changes in interest rates, dividend rates, market conditions,
general economic conditions and other factors that generally influence the
price of securities.

   Allen & Company also assumed in its analysis that, in all material respects:

   o the representations and warranties of iVillage and Women.com contained in
     the merger agreement were true and correct, iVillage and Women.com will
     perform all of the covenants to be performed by them under the merger
     agreement and all conditions to the consummation of the merger by
     iVillage and Women.com will be satisfied;

   o all material governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents
     required in connection with the consummation of the merger will be
     obtained; and

   o obtaining the required approvals or opinions or consents or amendments,
     modifications or waivers to any agreements to which either iVillage or
     Women.com is a party would not impose any limitation,

     restrictions or conditions or amendments, modification or waivers that
     would have a material adverse effect on iVillage or Women.com or
     materially reduce the contemplated benefits of the merger to iVillage.

   The following is a summary of the presentations made by Allen & Company to
the iVillage board while giving its fairness opinion:

   Status of the Industry. Allen & Company presented an overview of the
current state of the specialized online portal industry. Allen & Company noted
that the industry has recently witnessed severe reductions in market values
and an increase in bankruptcies. The difficult financing environment faced by
Internet companies has led to a decrease in online advertising revenue and a
reduction in the quality of the receivables of advertising-driven online
companies. Allen & Company observed that third parties are projecting
advertising growth in the United States to be slower than previously expected,
due primarily to the loss of dot com advertising revenue. Further, traditional
advertisers have been cautious about spending in online entities without
significant scale or financial resources. This uncertainty has led to a lack
of revenue visibility for most companies supported by online advertising.
Finally, Allen & Company noted that larger companies with funding and scale
will continue to grow market share as undercapitalized companies are forced to
slow expansion or shut down entirely.

   Benefits of the Merger. Allen & Company identified the benefits of the
proposed merger, including:

   o consolidation of the online women's space;

   o increased advertising concentration;

   o increased scale;

   o increased traffic and revenue opportunities;

   o cost savings due to a reduction in overhead;

   o the cash investment by Hearst Communications; and

   o the continued relationship with Hearst Communications.

   Overview of Women.com. Allen & Company presented an overview of Women.com,
including a description of the content, community, shopping and personalized
services offered by Women.com. Allen & Company reviewed Women.com's historical
operating results for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1997 through 1999,
its estimated operating results for fiscal year 2000 and its budgeted
operating results for fiscal year 2001.

   Allen & Company also reviewed stock price and trading volume data for
Women.com. Allen & Company noted that the general trading patterns of
Women.com common stock have underperformed the NASDAQ Composite Index, Dow
Jones Industrial Average and an index of comparable Internet companies over
the past year.

   Allen & Company also compared selected multiples derived from the February
2, 2001 closing price of Women.com common stock to multiples of a selected
group of publicly traded companies comprised of CNet, Dr. Koop, iVillage,
Market Watch, NBC Internet, Sportsline.com, Star Media and TheStreet.com.
Allen & Company selected these companies because Allen & Company considered
them to have operations similar to the operations of Women.com. Allen &
Company commented that Women.com's stock trades at multiples of revenue, users
and page views below its comparable peers. To illustrate, Allen & Company
highlighted the following multiples:

                                                                                    Revenue           (Millions)

   Comparable Transaction Analysis. Allen & Company compared Women.com's
implied transaction enterprise and equity value multiples to publicly
available financial information for twelve selected mergers and acquisitions
in the specialized online portal industry. The transactions analyzed by Allen
& Company were:

   o America Online/Netscape Communications

   o At Home/Excite

   o Yahoo/GeoCities

   o Yahoo/Broadcast.com

   o NBC/Xoom.com

   o Walt Disney/Infoseek

   Based on the foregoing, Allen & Company concluded that the indicative
multiples of revenue, unique page views and unique users for the proposed
merger are at the low end or below the range of multiples paid in comparable
precedent transactions.

   Indicative Premiums Paid. Allen & Company noted that the per share value of
Women.com common stock implied by the merger of $0.55 was 20.2% less than the
closing price of the Women.com common stock on February 2, 2001, 12.2% less
than the price of the Women.com common stock one week prior to February 2,
2001 ($0.63) and 59.7% greater than the Women.com common stock price one month
prior to February 2, 2001 ($0.34). Allen & Company analyzed the premiums paid
over pre-announcement prices in public market merger and acquisition
transactions between $10 million and $50 million in equity value since January
1, 2000. Allen & Company compiled the premiums represented by acquisition
prices for 20 target companies for which data was available relative to those
target companies' share prices one day, one week and one month prior to the
announcement that the target company was to be acquired. The following table
summarizes Allen & Company's results:

                                                                                                Premium Prior to

Minimum ................................................................................   (12.2%)   (10.2%)   (10.2%)

   Based on the foregoing analysis, Allen & Company concluded that the
indicative premiums paid in the proposed merger are at the low end or below
the range of premiums paid in similar stock-for-stock acquisitions.

   Overview of Combined Company. Allen & Company reviewed the projected pro
forma operating results of the combined company for the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2001 and the pro forma balance sheet as of December 31, 2000.
Allen & Company described an analysis of the pro forma ownership of the
combined company resulting from the merger before and after the additional
investment by Hearst Communications, noting that such analysis indicated that
iVillage and Women.com would own the following percentages of the combined
company on a fully-diluted basis:

                                                                    Additional
                                                                      Hearst
                                                                  Communications
                                                                    Investment
                                                                  --------------
                                                                  Before   After

iVillage .....................................................    66.7%    53.4%
Women.com ....................................................    33.3%    46.6%

   The preparation of a fairness opinion is not susceptible to partial analysis
or summary description. Allen & Company believes that its analyses and the
summary set forth above must be considered as a whole and that selecting
portions of its analyses and the factors considered by it, without considering
all analyses and factors,

could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying the analysis set
forth in its opinion. Allen & Company has not indicated that any of the
analyses which it performed had a greater significance than any other.

   In determining the appropriate analyses to conduct and when performing those
analyses, Allen & Company made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business, financial, market and economic conditions, and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of iVillage and Women.com.
The analyses which Allen & Company performed are not necessarily indicative of
actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or
less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Such analyses were prepared
solely as part of Allen & Company's analysis of the fairness, from a financial
point of view, of the terms of the merger to iVillage. The analyses do not
purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might
actually be sold or the prices at which any securities may trade at the
present time or at any time in the future.

   Allen & Company is a nationally recognized investment banking firm that is
continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwriting, competitive
bids, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private
placements and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. iVillage
retained Allen & Company based on such qualifications as well as its
familiarity with iVillage. In the ordinary course of its business as a broker-
dealer, Allen & Company may hold positions in and trade in the securities of
iVillage from time to time.

   iVillage entered into an engagement letter agreement with Allen & Company
dated September 28, 1999 and amended on February 22, 2000, in which Allen &
Company agreed to act as iVillage's financial advisor in connection with the
merger and to render an opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of
view, of the terms of the merger to iVillage. Under the engagement letter,
iVillage agreed to pay a fee to Allen & Company, upon consummation of the
merger. Whether or not the merger is consummated, iVillage has agreed,
according to the engagement letter, to reimburse Allen & Company for all its
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including the fees and disbursements of its
counsel, incurred in connection with its engagement by iVillage, and to
indemnify Allen & Company against certain liabilities and expenses in
connection with its engagement.

Interests of Directors and Officers in the Merger that are Different from Your
Interests

   Women.com Directors and Executive Officers

   Upon consummation of the merger, it is anticipated that the directors and
executive officers of Women.com and their affiliates will beneficially own
approximately __% of the then outstanding shares of iVillage common stock,
calculated on the basis set forth under the heading "Information Concerning
Women.com - Principal Stockholders of Women.com."

   As of January 31, 2001, the directors and executive officers of Women.com
held outstanding stock options to purchase an aggregate of 3,028,293 shares of
Women.com common stock. In addition, William Miller, a non-employee member of
Women.com's board of directors, has received stock options to purchase an
aggregate of 17,500 shares of Women.com common stock. See "The Merger
Agreement - Treatment of Women.com Stock Options" for a description of the
treatment of outstanding Women.com stock options upon consummation of the
merger.

   Marleen McDaniel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Women.com, has an
employment agreement with Women.com under which she will receive severance
benefits in the event that, prior to January 27, 2002, her employment with
Women.com is terminated involuntarily without cause or voluntarily within
sixty days of a material reduction in her responsibilities or compensation or
a relocation of her place of employment by more than fifty miles. These
severance benefits include continuation of base salary and benefits until the
longer of six months from termination or January 27, 2002, and acceleration of
vesting on all options that would have vested as of January 27, 2002.

   A severance and retention plan of up to $5 million is currently being
finalized for Women.com employees. As a result, certain officers of Women.com
may receive severance or retention payments in connection with the merger.

   iVillage has agreed in the merger agreement that all rights to
indemnification existing in favor of those persons who are directors and
officers of Women.com as of the date of merger for their acts and omissions
occurring prior to the effective time of the merger, as provided in
Women.com's bylaws, as in effect as of the date of the merger agreement, and
as provided in the indemnification agreements between Women.com and such
persons, as in effect as of the date of the merger agreement, shall survive
the merger and shall be observed by Women.com to the fullest extent available
under Delaware law for a period of six years from the date of the merger.
iVillage also has agreed to maintain directors' and officers' liability
insurance for Women.com's directors and officers equivalent to Women.com's
current insurance for not less than six years after the effective time of the
merger, subject to certain limitations on the maximum premium payable for such
insurance.

   In connection with the merger, Hearst Communications, the holder of
approximately 46% of the outstanding Women.com common stock, has entered into
a securities purchase agreement with iVillage pursuant to which Hearst
Communications has agreed to purchase, for up to $20.0 million, up to
9,324,000 shares of iVillage common stock and warrants to purchase up to
2,100,000 shares of iVillage common stock, subject to adjustment as provided
in the securities purchase agreement.  In addition, it is a condition to the
closing of the transactions contemplated by the securities purchase agreement
and the merger that iVillage and Hearst Communications enter into a
stockholder agreement and a magazine content license and hosting agreement.
Among other things:

   o the stockholder agreement requires iVillage to appoint three Hearst
     Communications representatives to the iVillage board of directors, one of
     which shall serve on the nominating committee and one of which shall
     serve on the compensation committee, and

   o the magazine content license and hosting agreement requires iVillage to
     pay Hearst Communications a royalty payment based on net advertising
     revenues of at least $3.9 million during the three year term of the
     agreement.

For additional information regarding the securities purchase agreement, the
stockholder agreement and the magazine content license and hosting agreement,
see "Agreements between Hearst Communications and iVillage."

   Four of the members of the Women.com board of directors, James Asher,
Cathleen Black, Mark Miller and Alfred Sikes, are serving in such capacity as
representatives of Hearst Communications.

   As a result of the foregoing, the directors and executive officers of
Women.com may be more likely to vote to approve the adoption of the merger
agreement than Women.com stockholders generally.

   iVillage Directors and Executive Officers

   iVillage does not believe that any of the iVillage directors or executive
officers have interests in the merger that are different from the interests of
iVillage stockholders generally.

   iVillage directors and executive officers beneficially owned, as of the
record date, approximately ____% of the outstanding shares of iVillage common
stock, excluding those shares of iVillage common stock subject to outstanding
stock options.

Exchange of Women.com Stock Certificates for iVillage Stock Certificates

   Each share of Women.com common stock outstanding immediately before the time
of the merger will be converted into the right to receive 0.322 (subject to
adjustment) of a share of iVillage common stock at the time of the merger. In
addition, stockholders of Women.com will receive a cash payment equal to one
percent of the product of the average high and low prices of a share of
iVillage common stock on the Nasdaq National Market on the closing date of the
merger multiplied by 0.322 (subject to adjustment). To allow holders of shares
of Women.com common stock to exchange their certificates for certificates of
shares of iVillage common stock, iVillage will deposit with an exchange agent
certificates representing shares of iVillage common stock (plus the cash
portion of the merger consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares and
unpaid distributions, if any) that will be issued in exchange for the
Women.com stock certificates. The exchange agent will then mail to each holder
of shares of Women.com common stock a transmittal form that will contain
instructions for the surrender of Women.com stock certificates to be exchanged
in the merger. Women.com stockholders who surrender to the

exchange agent their shares of Women.com common stock, along with the
transmittal form, will receive a certificate representing the number of whole
shares of iVillage common stock that they are entitled to receive. These
Women.com stockholders will also receive a check representing the cash portion
of the merger consideration and cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any
unpaid dividends and distributions that the stockholder may have a right to
receive.

   The surrendered Women.com certificates will be canceled. If any Women.com
certificates are presented to iVillage or the exchange agent after the merger,
then those certificates will be canceled and exchanged for certificates
representing the shares of iVillage common stock (plus the cash portion of the
merger consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any) that the
holder of the Women.com certificates is entitled to receive under the merger
agreement.

   None of iVillage, the exchange agent or any other person will be liable to
any former Women.com stockholder for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheatment or similar
laws.

Dividend Policy

   iVillage intends to retain all available earnings generated by its
operations for the development and growth of iVillage's business. Since
iVillage's initial public offering, iVillage has not paid cash dividends.
iVillage does not anticipate paying any cash dividends on shares of iVillage
common stock in the foreseeable future. Subject to Delaware law, iVillage's
board of directors will have broad discretion to make any future determination
as to dividend policy. Any determination will depend on a number of factors,
including:

   o future earnings;

   o capital requirements;

   o financial condition;

   o business factors;

   o restrictions contained in iVillage's debt agreements; and

   o any other factors iVillage's board of directors deems relevant.

Women.com's Stock Option and Stock Purchase Plans

   At the effective time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of
Women.com common stock under Women.com's stock option plans will be assumed by
iVillage. Each Women.com stock option that is assumed by iVillage will
continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions that were
applicable to the option immediately prior to the effective time, except that:

   o each Women.com stock option will be exercisable for shares of iVillage
     common stock, and the number of shares of iVillage common stock issuable
     upon exercise of any given option will be determined by multiplying 0.322
     (as may be decreased pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement as
     described below under "The Merger Agreement--Merger Consideration") by
     the number of shares of Women.com common stock underlying the applicable
     option, rounded down to the nearest whole number;

   o the per share exercise price of any given option will be determined by
     dividing the exercise price of the option immediately prior to the
     effective time by 0.322 (subject to adjustment) less the per share cash
     payment, rounded up to the nearest whole cent; and

   o all Women.com stock options subject to vesting shall become vested in
     full and immediately exercisable.

   iVillage has agreed to file a registration statement on Form S-8 for the
shares of iVillage common stock issuable with respect to the assumed Women.com
stock options within 30 days after the effective time. iVillage intends to
maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement for so long as any
iVillage stock options or other rights thereunder remain outstanding.

   Immediately prior to the effective time, any outstanding purchase rights
under Women.com's Employee Stock Purchase Plan will automatically be exercised
and paid for through accumulated payroll deductions. This will allow
participants to purchase shares of Women.com common stock under the plan prior
to the effective time. This shortened purchase period will expire immediately
following the new purchase date, and the plan will terminate immediately prior
to the effective time.

Accounting Treatment of the Merger

   iVillage intends to account for the merger as a purchase for financial
reporting and accounting purposes, under generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America. After the merger, the results of
operations of iVillage and Women.com will be included in the consolidated
financial statements of iVillage and Women.com. The purchase price will be
allocated based on the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities
assumed. Any excess of cost over fair value of the net tangible assets of
Women.com acquired will be recorded as goodwill and other intangible assets and
will be amortized by charges to operations over the expected period of benefit.
These allocations will be made based upon valuations and other studies that have
not yet been finalized.

   If the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value of the net
tangible assets of Women.com acquired, the deficiency will be allocated first to
reduce proportionately the values assigned to non-current assets. Should non-
current assets be reduced to zero, any remaining deficiency should be recorded
as a deferred credit and amortized to income over the expected period of
benefit.

   Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are expected to be present at
the iVillage and Women.com special meetings and to be available to respond to
appropriate questions, and will have an opportunity to make a statement if
they desire to do so.

Material Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

   The following are the material United States federal income tax consequences
of the merger, assuming that you are a United States person and hold your
shares of Women.com common stock as capital assets. The following discussion
is based on and subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, its
legislative history, applicable Treasury regulations, administrative rulings
and court decisions currently in effect, all of which are subject to change at
any time, possibly with retroactive effect. The following discussion further
assumes that the merger will be consummated in accordance with the provisions
of the merger agreement.

   This discussion does not address all aspects of United States federal income
taxation that may be important to you in light of your particular
circumstances, or if you are subject to special rules, such as rules relating
to:

   o Women.com stockholders who are not citizens or residents of the United
     States;

   o Financial institutions;

   o Tax-exempt organizations;

   o Insurance companies;

   o Mutual funds;

   o Dealers in securities;

   o Women.com stockholders who acquired their shares of Women.com common
     stock by exercising employee stock options or rights or otherwise as
     compensation; and

   o Women.com stockholders who hold their shares of Women.com common stock as
     "qualified small business stock" under Section 1202 of the Internal
     Revenue Code, or as part of a hedge, straddle or a constructive sale or
     conversion transaction.

   Women.com and iVillage have structured the merger so that, in general, the
merger should be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax
purposes. Provided that the merger is a taxable transaction, the following
federal income tax consequences will result. Based on the foregoing, as a
result of the merger:

   o No gain or loss will be recognized by Women.com as a result of the
     merger.

   o Each Women.com stockholder will recognize gain or loss equal to the
     difference between (i) the amount of cash received plus the fair market
     value of the iVillage stock received (based upon the value of the
     iVillage stock on the date of the merger), and (ii) the stockholder's tax
     basis in the Women.com stock exchanged therefor. Such gain or loss
     generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital

     gain or loss if the stockholder's shares of Women.com stock have been
     held for more than one year at the time of the merger.

   o The tax basis of the iVillage common stock received by Women.com
     stockholders in the merger will be equal to its fair market value on the
     date of the merger.

   o The tax holding period of the iVillage common stock that Women.com
     stockholders receive in the merger will begin on the day after the
     merger.

   A Women.com stockholder may be subject to backup withholding at a rate of
31% on the cash payments and fair market value of the iVillage common stock a
Women.com stockholder receives in the merger. Backup withholding will not
apply, however, if a Women.com stockholder is an exempt recipient (such as a
corporation or financial institution) or is otherwise exempt from backup
withholding, if a Women.com stockholder furnishes its taxpayer identification
number and certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding on the
appropriate form. It is possible that the IRS may assert that the merger
constitutes a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 which would result in you not recognizing gain or loss for
federal income tax purposes (except with respect to shares that qualify as
dissenting shares under the Delaware General Corporation Law) and not adjusting
your tax basis to equal the fair market value of the iVillage common stock.

   iVillage's obligation to complete the merger is conditioned on, subject to
waiver by iVillage, receipt of a closing tax opinion from Orrick, Herrington &
Sutcliffe LLP, counsel to iVillage, dated the date that the merger is
completed, to the effect that for United States federal income tax purposes no
gain or loss will be recognized by iVillage or its stockholders as a result of
the merger. iVillage does not currently intend to waive the condition relating
to the receipt of a closing tax opinion. Women.com's obligation to complete
the merger is conditioned on, subject to waiver by Women.com, receipt of a
closing tax opinion from Cooley Godward LLP, counsel to Women.com, dated the
date the merger is completed, to the effect that for United States federal
income tax purposes each Women.com stockholder will recognize a gain or loss as
a result of the merger. Women.com does not currently intend to waive the
condition relating to the receipt of a closing tax opinion. In addition,
neither iVillage nor Women.com intend to request a ruling from the IRS with
respect to the merger. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS
will not challenge the conclusions set forth above or that a court will not
sustain such a challenge.

   The foregoing discussion is not intended to be a complete analysis or
description of all potential United States federal income tax consequences or
any other consequences of the merger and, except as described herein, does not
address transactions effectuated prior or subsequent to or concurrently with
the merger whether or not such transactions are in connection with the merger.
In addition, this discussion does not address tax consequences which may vary
with, or are contingent on, your individual circumstances. Moreover, this
discussion does not address any non-income tax or any foreign, state or local
tax consequences of the merger. Accordingly, you are strongly urged to consult
with your tax advisor to determine the particular United States federal,
state, local or foreign income or other tax consequences to you of the merger.

Regulatory Filings and Approvals Required to Complete the Merger

   iVillage and Women.com do not believe that there are any material regulatory
or governmental approvals necessary to consummate the merger.

Restrictions on Sale of Shares by Affiliates

   All shares of iVillage common stock that Women.com stockholders will receive
in the merger will be freely transferable, except for shares of iVillage
common stock that are received by persons who are deemed to be "affiliates" of
Women.com under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, at the time of the
Women.com special meeting. These affiliates may resell the shares of iVillage
common stock they receive in the merger only in transactions permitted by Rule
145 under the Securities Act or as otherwise permitted under the Securities
Act. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates of Women.com for these
purposes generally include individuals or entities that control, are
controlled by or are under common control with Women.com, including directors
and executive officers of Women.com.

Rights of Dissenting Women.com Stockholders

   Pursuant to Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, a
dissenting Women.com stockholder who desires to object to the merger and to
receive the fair value of his or her shares of Women.com common stock in cash
by following the procedure described below may do so by complying with the
provisions of Delaware law pertaining to the exercise of dissenters' rights.
Only those Women.com stockholders entitled to vote on the merger are entitled
to dissent and receive the fair value of their shares. All of the holders of
Women.com's common stock as of the record date are entitled to vote on the
merger and all of the holders may dissent and receive the fair value of their
shares of Women.com common stock. The following is a summary of the applicable
provisions of Delaware law and it is qualified in its entirety by reference to
such Delaware law. A copy of the relevant provisions of Delaware law is
attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex D.

   A written demand for appraisal of shares of Women.com common stock must be
delivered to Women.com by a Women.com stockholder seeking appraisal before the
vote on the merger is taken. The written demand must be separate from any
proxy or vote abstaining from or voting against approval and adoption of the
merger. Voting against approval and adoption of the merger, abstaining from
voting or failing to vote with respect to approval and adoption of the merger
will not constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262.
By voting against approval and adoption of the merger or by abstaining from
voting in favor of the merger, a Women.com stockholder may preserve his or her
rights of appraisal as a dissenting stockholder.

   Women.com stockholders electing to exercise their appraisal rights under
Section 262 must not vote for approval and adoption of the merger. A vote by a
Women.com stockholder against approval and adoption of the merger is not
required in order for a Women.com stockholder to exercise appraisal rights.
However, if a Women.com stockholder returns a signed proxy but does not
specify a vote against approval and adoption of the merger or a direction to
abstain, the proxy, if not revoked, will be voted for approval and adoption of
the merger, which will have the effect of waiving such Women.com stockholder's
appraisal rights.

   A demand for appraisal will be sufficient if it reasonably informs Women.com
of the identity of the Women.com stockholder and that such Women.com
stockholder intends thereby to demand appraisal. If the Women.com common stock
is owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian, or
custodian, such demand must be executed by the fiduciary. If the Women.com
common stock is owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy
or tenancy in common, such demand must be executed by all joint owners. An
authorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute
the demand for appraisal for a Women.com stockholder of record; however, the
agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose the fact
that, in exercising the demand, he or she is acting as agent for the record
owner or owners.

   A Women.com stockholder who elects to exercise appraisal rights should mail
or deliver his or her written demand to Women.com at its executive offices set
forth under the caption "Summary of the Merger- The Companies" in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus or deliver such demand to Women.com at Women.com's
special meeting. The demand should specify such Women.com stockholder's name
and mailing address and the number of shares of Women.com common stock owned.
It is the responsibility of each Women.com stockholder electing to exercise
appraisal rights to ensure that the written demand is received by Women.com
before the vote is taken at Women.com's special meeting.

   Within ten days after the effective time of the merger, iVillage must
provide notice of the date the merger has become effective to all Women.com
stockholders who have complied with Section 262(d), summarized above, and have
not voted for approval of the merger.

   Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any Women.com
stockholder who has complied with the provisions of Sections 262(a) and (d),
summarized above, is entitled, upon written request, to receive from iVillage
a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of Women.com common
stock not voted in favor of approval and adoption of the merger and with
respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate
number of holders of such shares. Such statement must be mailed to such
Women.com stockholders within ten days after the written request for it has
been received by iVillage or within ten days after expiration of the time for
delivery of demands for appraisal under Section 262(d), whichever is later.

   Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, either iVillage or
any holder of Women.com common stock who has complied with the required
conditions of Sections 262(a) and (d) and who is otherwise entitled to
appraisal rights may file a petition in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares of any
dissenting Women.com stockholders. If a petition for an appraisal is timely
filed, at a hearing on such petition, the court will determine which Women.com
stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights and will appraise the shares of
Women.com common stock owned by such Women.com stockholders, determining the
fair value of such shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with a fair rate of
interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.
In determining fair value, the court is to take into account all relevant
factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., decided in 1983, the Delaware Supreme
Court, in the context of litigation involving holders of common stock of a
Delaware corporation, expanded the factors that could be considered in
determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that "proof of
value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable
in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court" should be
considered, and that a "[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all
relevant factors involving the value of a company . . . ." The Delaware
Supreme Court stated that in making this determination of fair value the court
must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the
nature of the enterprise and any other facts which could be ascertained as of
the date of the relevant merger which could affect future prospects of the
merged corporation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court held that
"elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are
known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product
of speculation, may be considered."

   Women.com stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that
the fair value of their shares determined under Section 262 could be more
than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration they are to
receive under the merger if they do not seek appraisal of their shares.

   Both fairness opinions and appraisal proceedings review many different
aspects of a company's financial and business circumstances under accepted
valuation techniques, but the perspectives differ. A determination that a
transaction is fair from a financial point of view may be based on a finding
that the price term of a transaction falls within a range of values that would
be fair for other companies involved in similar types of transactions and
circumstances. Such a finding does not determine what the best possible price
would be, but looks at the transaction as a whole and determines whether
entering the transaction is a reasonable business decision. In reaching the
determination that an offered price is fair from a financial point of view,
consideration is given to the fact that a purchaser of an entire company may
be willing to pay a "control premium" in excess of the fair market value of
the stock. A determination of fair value in an appraisal proceeding attempts
to reduce all of the elements of value of a company to a set amount rather
than focusing on the range of values in similar transactions. A judicial
finding of fair value attempts to ensure that each dissenting stockholder
receives the substantial equivalent of his or her proportionate interest in a
company before the merger occurred. An appraisal proceeding does not attempt
to consider the effects, if any, of the merger transaction itself on the value
of the stock of a company.

   The cost of the appraisal proceeding may be determined by the court and
taxed against the parties as the court deems equitable in the circumstances.
Upon application of a dissenting Women.com stockholder, the court may order
that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any dissenting stockholder
in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged
against the value of shares of Women.com common stock entitled to appraisal.
In the absence of such a determination or assessment, each party bears its own
expenses.

   A Women.com stockholder who has duly demanded appraisal in compliance with
Section 262 will not, after the effective time of the merger, have any rights
in respect of shares subject to such demand except for appraisal rights and
the right to receive payment of dividends or other distributions, if any, on
such shares payable to Women.com stockholders of record as of a date prior to
the effective time.

   At any time within 60 days after the effective time of the merger, a
dissenting Women.com stockholder will have the right to withdraw his or her
demand for appraisal and to accept the terms of the merger. After this period,
a dissenting Women.com stockholder may withdraw his or her demand for
appraisal only with the consent of iVillage. If no petition for appraisal is
filed with the court within 120 days after the effective time of the

merger, a dissenting Women.com stockholder's rights to appraisal will cease.
As iVillage has no obligation to file such a petition, a dissenting Women.com
stockholder who desires such a petition to be filed is advised to file it on a
timely basis. No petition timely filed in the court demanding appraisal may be
dismissed as to a dissenting Women.com stockholder without the approval of the
court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the court deems
just.

   The provisions of Section 262 are technical in nature and complex. Women.com
stockholders desiring to exercise appraisal rights and obtain appraisal of the
fair value of their Women.com common stock should consult counsel, because
failure to comply strictly with the provisions of Section 262 may defeat their
appraisal rights.

Listing on the Nasdaq National Market of Shares of iVillage Common Stock to Be
Issued in the Merger

   It is a condition to the merger that the shares of iVillage common stock
issuable pursuant to the merger be authorized for listing on the Nasdaq
National Market, subject to official notice of issuance. iVillage common stock
is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "IVIL."

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

   The following is a summary of the material terms of the merger agreement, as
amended as of February 22, 2001. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as
Annex A-1 to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and a copy of the amendment
to the merger agreement is attached as Annex A-2 to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, both of which are incorporated in this document by
reference. All references in this joint proxy statement/prospectus to the
merger agreement mean the merger agreement as amended. This summary is
qualified by reference to the merger agreement. You should read the merger
agreement because it, and not this document, is the legal document that
governs the merger.

Merger Structure and Timing

   At the effective time of the merger, Stanhope Acquisition Sub, LLC, a wholly
owned subsidiary of iVillage, referred to in this joint proxy statement/
prospectus as "merger sub," will merge with and into Women.com, which will be
the surviving corporation in the merger and become a wholly owned subsidiary
of iVillage.

   The effective time of the merger will be the time we file the certificate of
merger with the Delaware Secretary of State or at a later time as we may agree
and specify in the certificate of merger. We currently anticipate that we will
complete the merger by March 31, 2001, assuming our stockholders approve the
merger at the special meetings and all other conditions to the merger have
been satisfied or waived.

Merger Consideration

   Exchange Ratio and Cash Consideration.  At the effective time of the
merger, each share of Women.com common stock issued and outstanding
immediately before the effective time of the merger (other than shares of
Women.com common stock held by Women.com, iVillage or the merger sub, which
will be canceled and retired) will be converted into 0.322 of a share (subject
to adjustment as described below) of iVillage common stock. In addition,
stockholders of Women.com will receive a cash payment equal to one percent of
the product of the average high and low prices of a share of iVillage common
stock on the Nasdaq National Market on the closing date of the merger
multiplied by 0.322 (subject to adjustment as described below). The exchange
ratio will decrease if Women.com does not have at least $12.0 million of
working capital and $20.0 million in cash as of March 31, 2001, or an adjusted
amount immediately before the closing of the merger if after such date. If the
actual cash and working capital of Women.com as of March 31, 2001 is less than
the required cash and working capital, or if, as of the day prior to the
closing of the merger, cash is less than the amount on hand as of March 31, 2001
less $166,666 per day for every day elapsed since March 31, 2001, or working
capital is materially less than the difference between the amount of working
capital as of March 31, 2001 less the reduction in Women.com's cash since March
31, 2001, Hearst Communications would have the option to purchase additional
shares of iVillage common stock in an amount equal to the amount of the
shortfall up to $2.0 million divided by $1.875. If the shortfall is more than
$2.0 million, but less than $4.0 million, then Hearst Communications must
purchase additional shares of iVillage common stock pursuant to the merger
agreement for the amount of the shortfall which exceeds $2.0 million, and Hearst
Communications will have the option to purchase shares with respect to the
additional $2.0 million shortfall amount. Hearst Communications will pay a
purchase price of $1.875 for each share purchased because of a shortfall.

   Fractional Shares. Certificates for fractional shares of iVillage common
stock will not be issued in the merger. Women.com stockholders that would
otherwise receive fractional shares will, instead, be entitled to receive a
cash payment equal to the value of these fractional share interests. The cash
payment for fractional shares is determined by multiplying the per share
closing price of iVillage common stock on the closing date by the fraction of
the share to which the holder is entitled.

Exchange Procedures

   As soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time of the merger, an
exchange agent will mail a letter of transmittal to each holder of record of
Women.com stock certificates. This letter of transmittal must be used in
surrendering Women.com stock certificates to the exchange agent for
cancellation. Upon surrender of a Women.com stock certificate for
cancellation, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal, the holder
of the Women.com stock certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange:

   o an iVillage stock certificate representing the whole number of shares of
     iVillage common stock that the holder has the right to receive;

   o a check representing the cash portion of the merger consideration and the
     amount of cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of iVillage
     common stock, if any; and

   o unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, that the holder has the right
     to receive pursuant to the merger agreement, after giving effect to any
     required withholding tax.

   Women.com stockholders should not send in their Women.com stock certificates
until they receive the letter of transmittal.

   After the effective time of the merger, each Women.com stock certificate,
until surrendered and exchanged, will represent only the right to receive a
certificate representing shares of iVillage common stock and the cash portion
of the merger consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and
unpaid dividends and distributions, if any. Holders of Women.com stock
certificates will not be entitled to receive any dividends or other
distributions declared or made by iVillage having a record date on or after
the effective time of the merger until the Women.com stock certificates are
surrendered for exchange. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of
the Women.com stock certificates, dividends and distributions, if any, will be
paid without interest and less the amount of any required withholding taxes.

Treatment of Women.com Stock Options

   At the effective time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of
Women.com common stock under Women.com's stock option plans will be assumed by
iVillage. Each Women.com stock option that is assumed by iVillage will
continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions that were
applicable to the option immediately prior to the effective time, except that:

   o each Women.com stock option will be exercisable for shares of iVillage
     common stock, and the number of shares of iVillage common stock issuable
     upon exercise of any given option will be determined by multiplying 0.322
     (as may be decreased pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement as
     described above under "Merger Consideration") by the number of shares of
     Women.com common stock underlying the applicable option, rounded down to
     the nearest whole number;

   o the per share exercise price for iVillage common stock issuable upon
     exercise of a Women.com stock option will be determined by dividing the
     exercise price of the option immediately prior to the effective time by
     0.322 (subject to adjustment), rounded up to the nearest whole cent,
     minus the cash amount; and

   o all Women.com stock options subject to vesting shall become vested in
     full and immediately exercisable.

   iVillage has agreed to file a registration statement on Form S-8 for the
shares of iVillage common stock issuable with respect to the assumed Women.com
stock options within 30 days after the effective time. iVillage intends to
maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement for so long as any
iVillage stock options or other rights thereunder remain outstanding.

   Immediately prior to the effective time, any outstanding purchase rights
under Women.com's Employee Stock Purchase Plan will automatically be exercised
and paid for through accumulated payroll deductions. This will allow
participants to purchase shares of Women.com common stock under the plan prior
to the effective time. This shortened purchase period will expire immediately
following the new purchase date, and the plan will terminate immediately prior
to the effective time.

   The merger agreement contains various representations and warranties by each

Conduct of Business of Women.com and iVillage Before the Merger

   Women.com has agreed that, before the effective time of the merger, it will:

   o conduct its business in the ordinary course in a manner consistent with
     prior practice;

   o use its commercially reasonable efforts to preserve substantially intact
     its business organizations, keep available the services of its officers
     and employees and preserve current relationships;

   o comply in all material respects with applicable laws;

   o not declare or pay any dividends on or make other distributions in
     respect of any of its capital stock, except for dividends by wholly-owned

Competing Acquisition Proposals for Women.com

   Women.com has agreed not to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or
encourage, including by way of furnishing material non-public information, or
take any action designed to facilitate, directly or indirectly, any competing
acquisition proposal for Women.com or participate in any discussions or
negotiations concerning an acquisition proposal, or a proposal which may
reasonably lead to an acquisition proposal, for Women.com. Women.com must give
iVillage immediate notice of any proposal which may lead to an acquisition
proposal.

   However, at any time prior to the date that is the earlier of the 60th day
after February 5, 2001 and the stockholders' meeting of Women.com, Women.com's
board of directors may consider a superior proposal (as defined below), may
furnish information of Women.com to a person making a superior proposal and
participate in discussions of such proposal in the exercise of its fiduciary
duties if but only if Women.com's board of directors reasonably determines in
good faith, based on the written advice of independent outside legal counsel,
that it is required to do so to comply with its fiduciary duties to
Women.com's stockholders. Women.com is required to give iVillage immediate
notice in writing of the terms and conditions of the superior proposal, keep
iVillage apprised of the status of any discussions and give iVillage at least
72 hours advance written notice before it modifies, or proposes publicly to
modify, the recommendation of its board of directors for the approval of the
merger. Any information provided to a person or group in connection with a
superior proposal for Women.com is required to be provided pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement.

   Women.com has also agreed that it will, through its board of directors,
recommend approval of the merger and use its best efforts to solicit from its
stockholders proxies in favor of the merger. However, before the date
Women.com's stockholders approve the merger, the Women.com board of directors
may withdraw, modify or change its recommendation regarding the merger if, in
the good faith judgment of the Women.com board of directors based on written
advice of independent outside legal counsel that it must do so in order to
comply with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable law.

   For purposes of the description of the merger agreement in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, "acquisition proposal for Women.com" means, except for
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement:

   o any bona fide proposal or offer from any person relating to any direct or
     indirect acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of the assets of
     Women.com and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 20% or more of the
     combined voting power of the shares of Women.com's common stock;

   o any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in
     any other person beneficially owning 20% or more of the combined voting
     power of Women.com's common stock; or

   o any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
     liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving Women.com or
     its subsidiaries in which the acquiring person or the acquiring person's
     stockholder(s) will own 20% or more of the combined voting power of
     Women.com.

   For purposes of the description of the merger agreement in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, a "superior proposal" means any proposal made by a third
party:

   o relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of all or
     substantially all of the assets of Women.com and its subsidiaries, taken
     as a whole, or 80% of the combined voting power of the shares of
     Women.com voting stock;

   o relating to any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
     result in any other person beneficially owning 80% or more of the
     combined voting power of Women.com's common stock; or

   o otherwise on terms which the board of directors of Women.com determines
     in its good faith judgment (based upon the advice of a financial advisor
     of nationally recognized reputation), taking into account the person
     making such proposal and the legal, financial, regulatory and other
     aspects of the proposal deemed appropriate by the board of directors of
     Women.com (1) is more favorable from a financial point of view than the
     merger to its stockholders, taken as a whole, (2) is reasonably capable
     of being completed and (3) for which financing is then committed or is
     capable of being obtained.

   Before taking any action in connection with a superior proposal for
Women.com, Women.com is required to immediately notify iVillage orally and in
writing of any requests for information or the receipt of any acquisition
proposal for Women.com or, which could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
acquisition proposal for Women.com, including the identity of the person or
group engaging in the discussions or negotiations, requesting the information
or making the competing acquisition proposal for Women.com, and the material
terms and conditions of any acquisition proposal for Women.com. Women.com is
required to keep iVillage fully informed on a timely basis of the status and
details of a superior proposal as well as any related discussions or
negotiations.

     information, subject to the confidentiality agreement signed by both

     satisfied by it in the merger agreement;

warranties, covenants or agreements contained in the magazine content license

   Additional Purchase Obligations. The securities purchase agreement provides
that if Women.com stockholders holding in excess of two percent of the number
of shares of Women.com common stock outstanding as of the record date for the
Women.com special stockholders meeting exercise dissenters' rights in
connection with the merger, iVillage can require Hearst Communications to
purchase additional shares of iVillage common stock at a price of $1.875 per
share.  See "The Merger - Rights of Dissenting Women.com Stockholders" for
information regarding Women.com stockholders' dissenters' rights.  The number
of shares of iVillage common stock that Hearst Communications would be
required to purchase in such event would equal the number of Women.com
dissenting shares in excess of two percent of the outstanding Women.com shares
as of the record date for the Women.com special stockholders meeting multiplied
by the exchange ratio of 0.322 (subject to adjustment).

Stockholder Agreement

   As a condition to the closing of the merger, iVillage and Hearst
Communications will enter into a stockholder agreement. The stockholder
agreement sets forth certain obligations, restrictions and limitations
relating to the securities purchased by Hearst Communications pursuant to the
merger agreement and the securities purchase agreement. The stockholder
agreement applies to all voting securities of iVillage owned by Hearst
Communications on the date of the agreement and all voting securities of
iVillage subsequently acquired by Hearst Communications. The following is a
summary of the material terms of the stockholder agreement.

   Purchase Restrictions. The stockholder agreement places a cap on the number
of iVillage voting securities that Hearst Communications and its affiliates
may own. This cap may be exceeded only with (i) the unanimous

written consent of the iVillage board of directors or (ii) the approval of all
of the non-Hearst Communications board designees present at a meeting of the
iVillage board of directors at which a quorum is present. Under the
stockholder agreement, Hearst Communications and its affiliates will be
prohibited from owning voting securities of iVillage in excess of a specified
percentage of the total number of iVillage voting securities outstanding at
any time. This specified percentage, which will not be calculated until the
closing of the merger, will be determined by:

   o calculating the total number of outstanding iVillage voting securities
     owned by Hearst Communications or its affiliates on the closing date of
     the merger and the total number of outstanding convertible securities,
     options, warrants or other rights exercisable for or convertible into
     iVillage voting securities, with or without the passage of time or the
     satisfaction of specified conditions, owned by Hearst Communications or
     its affiliates on the closing date of the merger; and

   o dividing the number calculated in the manner described above by the sum
     of the total number of iVillage voting securities outstanding on the
     closing date of the merger and the number of shares of iVillage voting
     securities represented by warrants for iVillage common stock held by
     Hearst Communications or its affiliates on the closing date of the
     merger.

   Assuming that:

   o no Women.com stockholders participate in the rights offering;

   o Hearst Communications is not required to, and does not elect to, purchase
     additional iVillage common stock pursuant to the merger agreement;

   o there are 54,233,431 shares of iVillage common stock outstanding after
     the merger; and

   o Women.com stockholders holding in excess of two percent of the number of
     shares of Women.com common stock outstanding as of the record date for the
     Women.com special stockholders meeting do not exercise dissenters' rights
     in connection with the merger

the cap would equal 32.6% and Hearst Communications and its affiliates would
be prohibited from owning iVillage voting securities or securities convertible
into or exercisable for iVillage voting securities in excess of 32.6% of the
total number of outstanding iVillage voting securities.

   Restrictions on Stockholder Activities. The stockholder agreement provides
that unless Hearst Communications obtains (i) the unanimous written consent of
iVillage's board of directors or (ii) the approval of all of the non-Hearst
Communications board designees present at a meeting of the iVillage board of
directors at which a quorum is present, Hearst Communications may not, as it
relates to iVillage, initiate or engage in proxy solicitations, solicit
stockholders or induce others to do so, initiate stockholder proposals or
tender offers, call stockholders' meetings, act by written consent or place
any voting securities in a voting trust or other voting agreement.

   Quorum Obligations. The stockholder agreement requires Hearst
Communications and each of its affiliates to be present in person or
represented by proxy at all iVillage stockholder meetings so that their
iVillage shares may be counted for the purpose of determining a quorum.

   Voting Obligations. The stockholder agreement does not restrict Hearst
Communications' or its affiliates' ability to vote their iVillage shares to
the extent that the aggregate amount of such shares does not exceed 25% of the
outstanding iVillage voting securities as of the date of the calculation.
However, any voting securities held by Hearst Communications or its affiliates
in excess of 25% of the outstanding voting securities must be voted by Hearst
Communications and its affiliates in the manner recommended to iVillage
stockholders by (i) the unanimous written consent of iVillage's board of
directors or (ii) the non-Hearst Communications board designees present at a
meeting of the iVillage board of directors at which a quorum is present. This
25% threshold will be increased to the extent Hearst Communications is
required to purchase additional shares of iVillage common stock as discussed
above under "--The Securities Purchase Agreement--Additional Purchase
Obligations."

   Board Representation. Effective upon the closing, the stockholder agreement
requires iVillage to appoint three representatives of Hearst Communications to
separate classes of the iVillage board of directors. iVillage must appoint one
of these board members to the nominating committee and one to the compensation
committee. In addition, the stockholder agreement requires iVillage to appoint
five independent directors to the board. An

independent director is defined as any person who is not and has not been for
the past three years affiliated with Hearst Communications or its affiliates
or an employee of iVillage or any of its subsidiaries.

   So long as Hearst Communications or its affiliates holds at least 10% of the
outstanding voting securities of iVillage, Hearst Communications may recommend
and iVillage's nominating committee must recommend to the iVillage board that
number of nominees of Hearst Communications or its affiliates as follows:

   o so long as Hearst Communications holds at least 80% of its initial equity
     investment, Hearst Communications may designate three nominees;

   o so long as Hearst Communications holds at least 66%, but less than 80%,
     of its initial equity investment,  Hearst Communications may designate
     two nominees;

   o so long as Hearst Communications holds at least 10% of the voting
     securities of iVillage, but less than 66% of its initial equity
     investment, Hearst Communications may designate one nominee.

   Hearst Communications' initial equity investment is determined as follows:

   o first, determine the number of iVillage voting securities (including
     securities convertible into or exercisable for iVillage voting
     securities) held by Hearst Communications and its affiliates immediately
     following the closing of the merger,

   o second, divide the number calculated in the manner described above by the
     sum of the total number of outstanding iVillage voting securities as of
     the closing date of the merger and the number of voting securities
     issuable upon conversion or exercise of any other iVillage securities
     held by Hearst Communications or its affiliates as of the closing date of
     the merger, and

   o third, multiply the percentage resulting from steps one and two above by
     the sum of the total number of iVillage voting securities outstanding as
     of the date of the determination and the number of shares of iVillage
     common stock issuable upon exercisable of any warrants held by Hearst
     Communications or its affiliates.

   If, after the election of directors pursuant to the above requirements, the
number of voting securities held by Hearst Communications decreases below the
stated thresholds, any excess directors must immediately resign. If the number
of voting securities held by Hearst Communications falls below ten percent
(10%) of the initial equity investment, all Hearst Communications designated
board members must immediately resign and all quorum and voting obligations
cease. However, if the number of voting securities held by Hearst
Communications returns to 10% or more of the initial equity investment, all
rights and obligations under the agreement revive for the duration of the term
of the agreement.

   The stockholder agreement also provides that if iVillage issues voting
securities in a single transaction or a series of related transactions and the
number of iVillage voting securities outstanding immediately after such
transaction or series of related transactions:

   o is greater than 20% but less than 40%, then, at the request of iVillage,
     Hearst Communications and its affiliates must cooperate with iVillage and
     take all action reasonably necessary to increase the size of the iVillage
     board of directors to 11 and to fill the vacancy resulting therefrom with
     an independent director, or

   o is equal to or greater than 40%, then, at the request of iVillage, Hearst
     Communications and its affiliates must cooperate with iVillage and take
     all action reasonably necessary to increase the size of the iVillage
     board of directors to 12 and to fill the vacancies resulting therefrom
     with two independent directors.

In either case, the independent directors appointed as a result of the
increased board size must be approved by either (i) the unanimous written
consent of the iVillage board of directors or (ii) all members of the iVillage
board of directors at any properly noticed board meeting at which a quorum is
present, including all of the non-Hearst Communications board designees
present at the meeting.

   Transfer Restrictions. Except for certain permitted transfers, for so long
as Hearst Communications and its affiliates own voting securities representing
at least ten percent (10%) of iVillage's outstanding voting securities, Hearst
Communications may not transfer any voting securities of iVillage without (i)
the approval of all of the

non-Hearst Communications directors present at a meeting of the board of
directors of iVillage at which a quorum is present or (ii) the unanimous
written consent of the iVillage board of directors. The following transfers
will be permitted without the approval of the non-Hearst directors or the
unanimous written consent of the iVillage board of directors:

   o a pledge of voting securities pursuant to a bona fide loan transaction
     that creates a mere security interest;

   o a repurchase of voting securities by iVillage;

   o a bona fide gift of voting securities;

   o a sale or transfer of voting securities to a third party that does not
     result in the third party holding more than 10% of iVillage's voting
     securities;

   o a sale or transfer of voting securities pursuant to a tender offer or
     exchange approved by the board of directors;

   o a sale or transfer of voting securities in connection with a merger or
     consolidation approved by the iVillage board of directors; and

   o a sale or transfer in connection with the sale of all or substantially
     all of iVillage's assets approved by the iVillage board of directors.

   In the case of pledges and gifts, Hearst Communications must notify iVillage
in advance and the transferee must agree to be bound by the stockholder
agreement. In addition, without obtaining approval from the non-Hearst
Communications members of the board of directors, Hearst Communications may
transfer voting securities to its affiliates provided that the affiliates
agree to be bound by the terms of the stockholder agreement. In the event that
Hearst Communications ceases to own or control at least 80% of the affiliate
or ceases to control the management or policies of the affiliate, the
affiliate will lose all ownership and voting rights in the voting securities
and will be required to transfer them back to Hearst Communications.

   Term. The stockholder agreement expires in five years unless earlier
terminated by mutual written consent of iVillage and Hearst Communications.
Upon any early termination, any Hearst Communications designees serving on the
iVillage board of directors must resign immediately.

Magazine Content License and Hosting Agreement

   Pursuant to the merger, iVillage will assume an amended and restated
magazine content license and hosting agreement, which was originally entered
into between Women.com and Hearst Communications. Under this agreement, and an
amendment number two to the agreement which iVillage and Hearst Communications
intend to execute upon the closing of the merger, iVillage will provide
production and hosting services for certain web sites affiliated with selected
Hearst magazines, including Good Housekeeping, Redbook, Cosmopolitan and
Country Living. These sites will be part of the iVillage network. The magazine
sites will be on URL's owned by Hearst Communications.

   Under the agreement, as amended, iVillage agrees to provide to Hearst
Communications website production and hosting services, including the creation
of original site content which will be owned by Hearst Communications. In
consideration for these services, Hearst Communications agrees to:

   o pay iVillage at least $5.0 million per year for production services
     during the three-year term of the agreement, for a total of at least $15
     million;

   o place at least $2.0 million of Hearst Communications advertising per year
     (total of at least $6 million) on the network, which amount may be
     increased in the second and third years of the agreement if Hearst
     Communications fails to pay iVillage the required fees for production
     services as described above. If such a shortfall in production fees
     occurs in the second and third years of the agreement, Hearst
     Communications must place additional advertising in an amount equal to
     40% of the production fee shortfall; and

   o grant to iVillage a right of first offer on any new internet-based
     development projects initiated by Hearst Communications that are
     appropriate for inclusion on the network.

   The agreement also provides for revenue sharing between iVillage and Hearst
Communications with respect to advertising revenues obtained by iVillage from
the Hearst magazine websites and other iVillage websites containing
substantial Hearst content. This revenue sharing arrangement requires that
iVillage pay Hearst Communications a royalty payment based on net advertising
revenues of at least $3.9 million during the three year term of the agreement.
This amount is reducible pro rata if Hearst Communications fails to expend the
$5.0 million in production fees in the second and third years of the
agreement.

   Exclusivity. Pursuant to the agreement, iVillage agrees that it will not,
without the prior written consent of Hearst Communications:

   o enter into any agreement to include in iVillage's network of websites any
     sites for magazines that compete with the Hearst magazines listed in the
     agreement;

   o display on the magazine websites any advertising or other promotional
     materials from magazines that compete with the Hearst magazines listed in
     the agreement;

   o display on an iVillage webpage the brands, logos, trademarks or
     proprietary content of both Hearst Communications and a Hearst
     Communications competitor.

   Under the agreement, Hearst Communications agrees that it will not enter
into, with an iVillage competitor, any internet distribution agreements that
relate to Hearst content covered by the agreement nor will it grant any entity
the right to display on the internet content that has appeared on the magazine
websites in substantially the same form and format as it appeared on the
magazine website (other than materials posted on the website verbatim to the
way they were initially published by Hearst Communications). However, Hearst
Communications is permitted to license the content or trademarks of its
magazines to any internet site or portal that is not deemed to be an iVillage
competitor, subject only to the  restrictions in the foregoing sentence, and
to use the Hearst content in international editions of its magazine and on the
internet. The agreement defines an iVillage competitor to include any internet
site, channel, area or online content aggregation service that provides
content primarily for women, is targeted primarily at women, is used primarily
by women and is primarily targeted to any country or region in the world where
iVillage is targeted.

   Warranties. In the agreement, Hearst Communications warrants that it will
not provide any content to iVillage or publish any content that, and iVillage
warrants that it will not post to the magazine websites any content that:

   o infringes on any third party's proprietary rights or rights to publicity
     or privacy;

   o violates any law, statute, ordinance or regulation;

   o is defamatory, trade libelous, unlawfully threatening or harassing;

   o is obscene or pornographic;

   o violates any laws regarding unfair competition, antidiscrimination or
     false advertising; or

   o to the best of the party's knowledge, contains any viruses or other
     damaging computer problems.

   Term. The term of the magazine content license and hosting agreement will
be three years from the effective date of the amendment. However, the
agreement may be terminated by either party immediately upon written notice if
the other party:

   o becomes the subject of any proceeding relating to insolvency,
     receivership or liquidation;

   o files or has filed against it a petition in bankruptcy that is not
     discharged within 30 days;

   o makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors; or

   o admits in writing its inability to pay debts as they become due.

   In addition, either party has the right to terminate the magazine content
license and hosting agreement in the event of a "change of control" of the
other party. A "change of control" is defined in the magazine content license
and hosting agreement to mean: (i) a sale of all or substantially all of the
assets of iVillage; (ii) a merger or consolidation of iVillage with or into
another corporation or entity with the effect that, immediately after such

merger or consolidation, none of the existing holders of iVillage voting stock
immediately before such merger or consolidation holds, and the existing holders
of iVillage voting stock immediately before such merger or consolidation do not
hold, in the aggregate, at least 50% of the combined voting power of the then
voting stock of the surviving corporation of such merger or the corporation or
other entity resulting from such consolidation, (iii) the acquisition of 20% or
more of the voting stock of iVillage by an entity other than Hearst
Communications, (iv) the adoption by iVillage of a plan of complete or partial
liquidation or (v) certain bankruptcy events.

respectively, of iVillage's revenues.

   iVillage's strategy is focused in part on generating a majority of its
advertising revenues from sponsors and merchants who seek a cost-effective
means to reach women online. iVillage is aggressively working to build its
leadership position as the preeminent women's brand to the advertising
community. iVillage's sponsorship arrangements typically differ from
traditional banner advertising in that they are designed to achieve broad
marketing objectives such as brand promotion, awareness, product introductions
and online research. Sponsorships allow iVillage to cater to the specific
goals of advertisers in the areas of impressions, product research, market
research, new product launches, list development, product information,
repositioning, new account openings, lead generation and transactions.
Sponsors also have the opportunity to develop a dialogue with their key
consumer prospects through iVillage's message boards, chats, polls and special
events, which allows sponsors the opportunity to gain insights into their
customers. iVillage's sponsorship arrangements generally have longer terms
than typical banner advertising placements, provide for higher CPMs per
advertiser and independence from page-views as the sole measure of value. In
addition, iVillage occasionally develops extensive content to support the
marketing initiatives of advertisers. iVillage's sponsorship agreements can be
exclusive.

   iVillage also derives a smaller portion of its sponsorship and advertising
revenues from banner advertisements that are prominently displayed at the top
and bottom of pages throughout iVillage.com. From

each banner advertisement, viewers can hyperlink directly to the advertiser's
own Web site, thus providing the advertiser the opportunity to directly
interact with an interested customer.

   During the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, iVillage's five largest
advertisers accounted for approximately 23% and 20%, respectively, of its
total revenues. At December 31, 2000, one customer accounted for approximately
11% of the net accounts receivable, and at December 31, 1999, no advertiser
accounted for more than 10% of total revenues. The following is a select list of
iVillage's advertisers:

               Amazon.com                            Johnson & Johnson
               Fuji Photo Film USA                   Kimberly-Clark
               Glaxo Wellcome                        Dasani (Coco-Cola)
               Procter & Gamble                      Bristol Myers Squibb
               Unilever PLC

   Membership

   iVillage believes a large and active membership base is critical to its
success. Some features of iVillage's Web sites are restricted to members.
Membership is free and available to iVillage.com visitors who disclose their
names, e-mail addresses, zip codes, ages and gender and choose a member name
and password to be used throughout member-only areas. Members form
iVillage.com's core audience and are its most valuable users. E-mail, instant
messaging, community challenges, message boards and chats are examples of
members-only benefits.

   iVillage recognizes the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of
member information and has a privacy policy to protect such information. In
addition, iVillage Health is a founding member of the Health Internet Ethics,
or Hi-Ethics, organization. iVillage's current privacy policy is accessible
through a link from the iVillage.com home page as well as every Web page on
iVillage.com, including the page where a person initially registers for
membership. iVillage's current policy is to never sell or disclose to any
third party any member's personal identifying information such as his or her
name or address, unless the member has provided consent in the form of an
"opt-in" or in certain limited situations as described in iVillage's privacy
policy. For example, in some situations, iVillage does allow a third-party
partner access to database information it if is necessary for the delivery of
a member service, such as e-mail. In these instances, the partner has
generally agreed to be bound by iVillage's current policy. iVillage does share
aggregated member information with third parties, such as average age or
geographic dispersion. iVillage also reserves the right to offer members
products and services. iVillage may use information revealed by members and
information built from user behavior to target advertising, content and e-
mail. For instance, iVillage may, on behalf of an advertiser, send e-mail
offers to all members from a particular region or target advertisements to all
users who frequent a specific area of the site.

   Lamaze Publishing and the Newborn Channel

   Lamaze Publishing is used to solidify iVillage's leading position in the
parenting category. Lamaze Publishing produces advertising-supported
educational materials for expectant and new parents and is the exclusive
licensee of the LAMAZE mark for use in connection with consumer publications
and other communications, which include print, audio, visual and other
consumer oriented media, that are commercial in nature. Lamaze Publishing is
also the exclusive marketing agent for Lamaze International, Inc., the owner
of the LAMAZE family of marks. iVillage also operates the Lamaze.com Web site.

   Lamaze is a method of childbirth preparation based on the Lamaze philosophy
of birth. The Lamaze philosophy of birth states that birth is "normal, natural
and healthy," and "childbirth education empowers women to make informed
choices in healthcare, to assume responsibility for their health and trust
their inner wisdom".

   Lamaze International was founded by interested parents, childbirth educators
and healthcare providers in 1960 to promulgate these ideas. Lamaze Publishing
was established as a for-profit company in 1990 to provide childbirth and
infant care educational materials.

   During a pregnancy and immediately after the birth of a child, new parents
spend substantial amounts of time with childbirth educators and maternity
nurses seeking information on healthcare issues, the birth process and infant
care. These busy healthcare professionals typically have neither the time nor
the resources to create the

consumer publications or communications that would assist this process and
allow parents to absorb this material at home.

   The Lamaze Publishing business strategy is to provide these consumer
publications or communications to childbirth educators and maternity nurses
free of charge, and offset the expense incurred by selling print advertising
and commercial messages to advertisers who target the young family market.

   Lamaze Publishing publications, used and distributed to parents by
childbirth educators and maternity nurses nationwide, include:

   o Lamaze Parents, a prenatal publication used in childbirth education.
     Topics include prenatal nutrition, the role of the childbirth partner,
     and the physical and emotional challenges of pregnancy. Childbirth
     educators distribute Lamaze Parents to expectant parents on the first
     night of class. Lamaze Parents had an average annual circulation of
     approximately 2,400,000 for 2000.

   o Lamaze Baby, a parenting guide for mothers from the time a child is born
     through twelve months of life written entirely by healthcare
     professionals. Lamaze Baby is delivered by maternity nurses to new
     mothers at the hospital bedside shortly after childbirth. The magazine
     covers topics that hospital nurses review with new mothers prior to
     discharge serving as a helpful and time saving tool for nurses in
     educating mothers about infant care Lamaze Baby had an average annual
     circulation of approximately 3,000,000 for 2000.

   o Revista Lamaze para Padres, a Spanish language prenatal magazine which
     reaches more expectant Hispanic mothers than any other title. Childbirth
     educators distribute Revista Lamaze para Padres to expectant parents on
     the first night of class. Revista Lamaze para Padres had an average
     annual circulation of approximately 550,000 for 2000.

   o "Lamaze You and Your Baby," a 90 minute video textbook providing
     expectant parents with important instruction on infant care. Childbirth
     educators distribute to expectant parents the video, which is later
     returned. This video is distributed yearly to childbirth educators,
     typically during the first four months of the year. In 2000,
     approximately 13,000 childbirth educators ordered approximately 200,000
     copies of this video from Lamaze Publishing.

   o "Lo Mejor para Su Bebe," a 60 minute Spanish-language video textbook that
     provides expectant parents with important instruction on infant care.
     This video is modeled after "Lamaze You and Your Baby". The video is
     distributed yearly to childbirth educators, typically during the first
     four months of the year. In 2000, approximately 5,000 childbirth
     educators ordered approximately 50,000 copies of this video from Lamaze
     Publishing.

   o Lamaze Special Delivery, a program offering advertisers the ability to
     distribute coupons, samples and promotional literature to expectant and
     new parents. Information to be distributed is polybagged with Lamaze
     Parents, Lamaze Baby and Revista Lamaze para Padres.

   iVillage Integrated Properties also owns the Newborn Channel, a satellite
television network that instructs mothers in their hospital rooms following
birth in over 1,000 hospitals nationwide and, as of December 31, 2000, reached
approximately 2,400,000 new mothers.

   Astrology.com

   Astrology.com is a leading destination for women seeking daily horoscopes,
astrology content and personalized forecasts online. Through iVillage's
network of sites organized by topics of interest to women such as family,
love, money and career, Astrology.com provides a timely, personalized
experience for the user, stimulates commerce sales of monthly and annual
forecasts by subject and creates an advertising environment that is appealing
to advertisers due to targeting possibilities within the site and through e-
mail communication.

   Astrology.com brings iVillage a content and commerce site that is appealing
to iVillage's core demographic of women, represents one of the best customer
acquisition tools as demonstrated by strong performance in online media, and a
vehicle to drive repeat visits to iVillage.com through the use of daily
horoscopes. Astrology.com has also created an interactive commerce system that
provides instantaneous, digital astrology reports. The system

consists of software which operates the Web site and is capable of generating
customized astrology reports based on input from users.

   Alliances

   iVillage pursues strategic relationships to increase its access to online
customers, build brand recognition and expand its online presence.
Historically, iVillage has pursued strategic alliances to reach online
customers. iVillage has begun to shift its focus to building offline brand
recognition and to increasing its access to offline customers. iVillage's
principal strategic alliances and relationships include the following:

      Media Arrangement

   In November 1998, iVillage entered into an advertising and promotional
agreement with NBC pursuant to which NBC promotes iVillage.com on television,
primarily during prime-time programs, as well as through its Web sites. In
February 2001, iVillage further amended its November 1998 agreement with NBC to
provide for an extension of time during which iVillage must purchase its
advertising or promotional spots on the NBC network. The revised terms require
iVillage to purchase approximately $11.6 million of advertising promotional
spots between January 30, 2001 and December 31, 2002, with $3.0 million of such
spots being telecast during the year 2001 and approximately $8.6 million during
the year 2002.

      Sponsorship Arrangements

   iVillage has a number of sponsorship arrangements with leading advertisers
and sponsors, including:

   o Fuji Photo Film USA - exclusive sponsorship for the photographic film,
     disposable camera and digital camera categories throughout iVillage's
     network.

   o Glaxo Wellcome - exclusive sponsorship for resource centers for smoking
     cessation, migraine, and asthma that include interactive assessment
     tools, disease-specific newsletters, and enhanced community support.

   o Johnson & Johnson - exclusive sponsor of certain birth control, anti-

   o Kimberly-Clark - exclusive sponsor on certain parenting areas of diapers,
     wipes, training pants and similar products.

   o Unilever PLC - promotion of various Unilever brands in several consumer
     product categories.

      Distribution Arrangements

   iVillage considers branding an important aspect of its distribution
arrangements and seek distribution relationships where its brand is promoted.
iVillage periodically enters into distribution and content relationships with
major online service companies on the Internet, including:

   o AOL - some of iVillage's icons are placed within the AOL service and
     iVillage receives guaranteed impressions.

      Joint Venture and International License Arrangements

   iVillage  has entered into the following joint venture and international
license arrangements:

   o Cooperative Beauty Ventures LLC - iVillage and Unilever PLC have formed
     Cooperative Beauty Ventures LLC to provide women with a highly focused
     community, an array of interactive, customized online services, beauty and
     personal care products and personalized product recommendations.

   o iVillage UK Limited - iVillage, Tesco PLC and Tesco.com have formed
     iVillage UK Limited, an international joint venture to serve the women's
     online market in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland through a
     highly focused community and an array of interactive, customized online
     solutions and services.

   o Hindustan Lever Limited - iVillage entered into an exclusive licensing
     and technology agreement with Hindustan Lever Limited to create a Web
     site focussed on women in India. The license agreement is subject to
     necessary regulatory approvals in India.

   Sales, Marketing and Public Relations

      Sales

   As of December 31, 2000, iVillage had a direct sales organization,
consisting of 20 sales professionals and 25 sales operations staff. iVillage's
sales organization consults regularly with advertisers and agencies on design
and placement of its Web-based advertising and the production and management
of bridge sites, provides customers with advertising management analysis and
focuses on providing a high level of customer satisfaction. Nine professionals
concentrate primarily on advertising sales for the Newborn Channel, video
products, and print advertising sales. iVillage generally seeks to hire
individuals with significant experience in selling advertising and pre-
existing relationships with advertisers in a variety of media.

      Marketing and Public Relations

   iVillage employs a variety of methods to promote the iVillage.com brand and
to attract traffic and new members, including advertising on other Internet
sites, targeted publications, radio stations, national television, cross
promotional arrangements to secure advertising and other promotional
considerations. To extend the iVillage.com brand, iVillage has also entered
into several strategic alliances with offline partners. Please see
"Alliances". In addition, iVillage leverages other audience building
strategies, including working closely with search engine submissions, news
group postings and cross-promotion with affinity sites to properly index
materials. iVillage's marketing department consisted of 30 marketing
professionals as of December 31, 2000.

   iVillage's internal public relations staff oversees a comprehensive public
relations program which iVillage believes is a key component of its marketing
and brand recognition strategy. Organized into two primary components that
promote iVillage and the iVillage.com brand, the program targets a trade/
business and consumer audience, respectively. iVillage has also implemented
national long-lead consumer initiatives, such as radio media tours, regional
broadcast media tours, consumer publicity of its Parent Soup book series and
other related activities, and multiple daily media advisories sent to consumer
outlets throughout the United States.

   To maximize distribution of iVillage's publications and the Newborn Channel,
and gain the endorsement of the professional community for these products,
iVillage gives particular attention to marketing efforts targeted to
childbirth educators, maternity nurses and hospitals. A staff of four
marketing professionals contacts hospitals for distribution of the Newborn
Channel and works with the professional community to maintain distribution
levels of iVillage's publications and demonstrate how they can be used as
teaching tools for expectant parents and new mothers. iVillage's
representatives maintain contact with the professional community through trade
shows, professional conferences, consumer publication updates and personal
sales calls.

      Operating Infrastructure

   iVillage's Internet operating infrastructure has been designed and
implemented to support the delivery of millions of page views a day. Web pages
are generated and delivered, in response to end-users requests, by any one of
more than 100 servers. Key attributes of this infrastructure include the
ability to support growth, performance and service availability.

   iVillage's servers run on the Sun Solaris, Microsoft NT and Linux operating
systems and use Netscape Enterprise, Apache and Microsoft Corporation's IIS
Web server software.

   iVillage maintains all of its production servers at the New Jersey Data
Center of Exodus Communications, Inc. and Verio, Inc. in San Francisco,
California. iVillage's operations are dependent upon these companies' ability to
protect their respective systems against damage from fire, hurricanes, power
loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins and other events.

   Exodus provides comprehensive facilities management services, including
human and technical monitoring of all production servers 24 hours per day,
seven days per week. The servers located at Verio are monitored by

iVillage's California operations staff. Exodus and Verio provide the means of
connectivity for iVillage's servers to end-users via the Internet through
multiple connections. Each facility is powered by multiple uninterruptible
power supplies and backup generators.

   All of iVillage's production data, except Astrology.com, are copied to
backup tapes each night and stored at a third party, off-site storage
facility. Astrology.com's production data is backed up on a daily basis to
local storage. iVillage is in the process of developing a comprehensive
disaster recovery plan to respond to system failures. iVillage keeps all of
its production servers behind firewalls for security purposes and does not
allow outside access, at the operating systems level, except via special
secure channels. Strict password management and physical security measures are
followed. Computer emergency response team alerts are read, and, where
appropriate, recommended action is taken to address security risks and
vulnerabilities.

   iVillage's Web sites must accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver
frequently updated information. Components or features of iVillage's Web sites
have in the past suffered outages or experienced slower response times because
of hardware or software downtime. This has not had a material effect on
iVillage's business.

   Broadcasting of the Newborn Channel to hospitals originates from a laser
disc system operated by Group W Network Services, from Group W's facility in
Stamford, Connecticut. The system provides an uplink signal to a satellite
operated by PanAmSat. The signal is received through a satellite dish at each
hospital and distributed to patients' rooms. Group W handles installation and
service of all hospital receiving equipment. iVillage maintains business
interruption insurance in the event programming is interrupted over the
designated satellite.

   Competition

   The market for members, visitors and Internet advertising is new and rapidly
evolving, and competition for members, visitors and advertisers is intense and
is expected to increase significantly in the future. With no substantial
barriers to entry, iVillage expects that competition will continue to
intensify.

   iVillage believes that the primary competitive factors in creating community
on the Internet are:

   o functionality;

   o brand recognition;

   o member affinity and loyalty;

   o demographic focus;

   o variety of value-added services;

   o ease-of-use;

   o quality of service; and

   o reliability and critical mass.

   Other companies or sites which are primarily focused on targeting women
online include Oxygen.com and condenet.com, as well as Web sites targeted to
categories such as health. iVillage will likely also face competition in the
future from:

   o developers of Web directories;

   o search engine providers;

   o shareware archives;

   o content sites;

   o commercial online services;

   o sites maintained by Internet service providers; and

   o other entities that attempt to or establish communities on the Internet
     by developing their own or purchasing one of iVillage's competitors.

   In addition, iVillage could face competition in the future from traditional
media companies, a number of which, including CBS and NBC, have made
significant acquisitions of or investments in Internet companies. Further,
there can be no assurance that iVillage's competitors and potential
competitors will not develop communities that are equal or superior to ours or
that achieve greater market acceptance than iVillage's community.

   iVillage also competes with traditional forms of media, such as newspapers,
magazines, radio and television, for advertisers and advertising revenues.
iVillage believes that the principal competitive factors in attracting
advertisers are:

   o the amount of traffic on iVillage's Web sites;

   o brand recognition;

   o the demographics of iVillage's members and visitors;

   o iVillage's ability to offer targeted audiences; and

   o the overall cost-effectiveness of the advertising medium offered by us.

   iVillage believes that the number of Internet companies relying on Web-based
advertising revenues may increase in the future. Accordingly, iVillage may
face increased competition, which could in turn have a material adverse effect
on its business, results of operations and financial condition.

   Many of iVillage's current and potential competitors, including developers
of Web directories and search engines and traditional media companies, have:

   o longer operating histories;

   o significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources;

   o greater name recognition; and

   o larger existing customer bases.

   These competitors are able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns
for their brands and services, adopt more aggressive advertising pricing
policies and make more attractive offers to potential employees, distribution
partners, commerce companies, advertisers and third-party content providers.
There can be no assurance that Internet content providers and Internet service
providers, including developers of Web directories, search engines, sites that
offer professional editorial content and commercial online services, will not
be perceived by advertisers as having more desirable Web sites for placement
of advertisements. In addition, many of iVillage's current advertising
customers and strategic partners also have established collaborative
relationships with certain of iVillage's competitors or potential competitors,
and other high-traffic Web sites. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that:

   o iVillage will be able to grow its membership, traffic levels and
     advertiser customer-base at historical levels;

   o iVillage will be able to retain its current members, traffic levels or
     advertiser customers;

   o competitors will not experience greater growth in traffic as a result of
     these relationships which could have the effect of making their Web sites
     more attractive to advertisers; or

   o iVillage's strategic partners will not sever or will elect not to renew
     their agreements with us.

   Several major publishing companies produce products that are directly
competitive with iVillage's magazines. Time Warner, Gruner and Jahr and
Primedia all publish various pre- and post-natal publications. Disney
Publishing and Children's Television Workshop also publish general parenting
magazines. All of these publishers have substantially greater marketing,
research and financial resources than us. iVillage competes by emphasizing the
highly targeted nature of its audience, product quality and the fact that its
publications are used as teaching tools by professionals, and the credibility
and trust parents place in the Lamaze brand name.

   While iVillage's Lamaze Publishing instructional videos and the Newborn
Channel currently have no direct competitors, advertisers in this marketplace
are heavy users of daytime network television and cable television networks
targeted to young parents. The broadcasting companies that provide such
opportunities have invested substantial amounts in programming, sales and
marketing and are much better-known to advertisers than Lamaze Publishing and
the Newborn Channel. To compete, Lamaze Publishing and the Newborn Channel
must convince them that advertising recall and effectiveness obtained in an
educational or hospital setting is superior to that of traditional
broadcasting.

   There can be no assurance that iVillage will be able to compete successfully
against its current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced
by us will not have a material adverse effect on its business, results of
operations and financial condition.

   Intellectual Property, Proprietary Rights and Domain Names

   iVillage regards its copyrights, service marks, trademarks, trade names,
trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology and similar intellectual
property as critical to its success, and rely on trademark and copyright law,
trade secret protection and confidentiality and/or license agreements with its
employees, customers, independent contractors, partners and others to protect
iVillage's proprietary rights. iVillage pursues the registration of its
trademarks and service marks in the United States, and has applied for and
obtained registration in the United States for certain of iVillage's
trademarks and service marks, including "iVillage". Effective trademark,
service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in
every country in which iVillage's products and services are made available
online.

   iVillage has licensed in the past, and expects that it may license in the
future, certain of iVillage's proprietary rights, such as trademarks or
copyrighted material, to third parties. While iVillage attempts to ensure that
the quality of its brand is maintained by these licensees, there can be no
assurance that the licensees will not take actions that might materially
adversely affect the value of its proprietary rights or reputation, which
could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and
results of operations. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by
iVillage to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate or that third
parties will not infringe or misappropriate its copyrights, trademarks, trade
dress and similar proprietary rights. In addition, there can be no assurance
that other parties will not assert claims of infringement of intellectual
property or alter proprietary rights against iVillage.

   iVillage has been subject to claims and expects to be subject to legal
proceedings and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of its
business, including claims of alleged infringement of patents, trademarks and
other intellectual property rights of third parties by iVillage and its
licensees. These claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the
expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Further, if
these claims are successful, iVillage may be required to change its
trademarks, alter its content, alter its site format and pay financial
damages. There can be no assurance that these changes of trademarks,
alteration of content or format or payment of financial damages will not
adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.

   iVillage may be required to obtain licenses from others to refine, develop,
market and deliver new services. There can be no assurance that iVillage will
be able to obtain any license on commercially reasonable terms or at all or
that rights granted pursuant to any licenses will be valid and enforceable.

   Employees

   As of February 20, 2001, iVillage employed 309 full-time employees, of whom
96 were in sales and marketing, 85 were in editorial and community, 53 were in
administration and customer service, and 75 were in technology, operations and
support. As iVillage continues to grow and introduce more products, iVillage
may need to hire more personnel, particularly in the areas of product
development and sponsorship. None of iVillage's current employees are
represented by a labor union or is the subject of a collective bargaining
agreement. iVillage believes that relations with its employees are good.

   Properties

   iVillage is headquartered in New York, New York. In March 2000, iVillage
entered into a fifteen-year lease for approximately 105,000 square feet at
500-512 Seventh Avenue in which iVillage has consolidated its New York City
operations.

   iVillage also leases two floors at 149 Fifth Avenue, which are each for
approximately 10,000 square feet. The lease expires on June 30, 2001 and
iVillage is exploring the possibility of subleasing this space.

   iVillage also leases a sales office that is located at 645 North Michigan
Avenue, Chicago, Illinois. The lease is on a month-to-month basis.

   iVillage's subsidiary, IVN, Inc., formerly known as iBaby, Inc., is
currently leasing approximately 74,000 rentable square feet at a facility
located at 6910 Carroll Road in San Diego, California for use as general
office, administrative, storage, warehousing and distribution and expires in
November 2001. iVillage is exploring the possibility of subleasing this space.

   Lamaze Publishing subleases approximately 10,300 square feet of space at 9
Old Kings Highway, Darien, Connecticut. The sublease expires on June 30, 2005.

   Astrology.com leases approximately 7,400 square feet of space in San
Francisco, California. The lease expires in November 2002.

   Legal Matters

   On May 24, 2000, a complaint was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of
New York in New York County by Insignia/ESG, Inc. f/k/a Insignia/Edward S.
Gordon, Inc., a real estate broker, against iVillage. The complaint alleges a
breach of the provisions of a written agreement between Insignia and iVillage
related to iVillage's failure to pay Insignia a broker's commission in
connection with its lease of office space at 500-512 Seventh Avenue in New
York City. In addition to unspecified damages, the complaint seeks an award of
$2.0 million plus interest thereon. On July 10, 2000, iVillage filed an answer
and counterclaim to Insignia's complaint alleging intentional, malicious,
wrongful and tortious interference by Insignia with iVillage's prospective
contractual relationship with the owner of another New York office building.
In addition to unspecified damages, iVillage's counterclaim seeks an award of
$7.0 million in compensatory damages and $1.0 million in punitive damages as
well as interest thereon from Insignia.

   iVillage believes that the lawsuit and claims asserted against it by
Insignia are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against these
claims.

   On July 22, 1998, Jewish Family and Children's Services filed a Notice of
Opposition in the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board of the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office to iVillage's service mark application for the mark
"PARENTSPLACE.COM". On January 22, 1999, iVillage filed an Answer to the
Notice of Opposition, denying that there was any likelihood of confusion
between iVillage's mark and the mark used by Jewish Family and Children's
Services. In September 2000, iVillage and Jewish Family and Children's Services
entered into a settlement agreement permitting each party to use its
respective mark in a manner that does not infringe on the other party's
primary use of its mark. The parties also plan to move for dismissal of the
Trademark Trial and Appeal Board proceedings.

   iVillage is not currently subject to any other material legal proceedings.
iVillage may from time to time become a party to various legal proceedings
arising in the ordinary course of its business.

Selected Consolidated Financial Data of iVillage

   The iVillage selected consolidated financial data should be read in
conjunction with iVillage's "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations" and iVillage's consolidated financial

interest and remaining minority interest in iBaby, Inc. In June 2000, iVillage
decided to discontinue the operations of iBaby, Inc. and, as such, all
discussion and analysis below represents solely the continuing operations of

iVillage's Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

   The following discussion should be read in conjunction with iVillage's
consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements and the other
financial information appearing elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/
prospectus.

   Overview

   iVillage is a new media company, which operates iVillage.com, Lamaze
Publishing and the Newborn Channel. iVillage.com is a leading women's online
destination providing practical solutions and everyday support for women 18
and over. Lamaze Publishing produces advertising supported educational
materials for expectant and new parents. The Newborn Channel is a satellite
television network in over 1,000 hospitals nationwide.

   In June 2000, iVillage decided to discontinue the operations of its iBaby,
Inc. subsidiary. As such, all discussion and analysis below represents solely
the continuing operations of iVillage.

   To date iVillage's revenues have been derived primarily from the sale of
sponsorship and advertising contracts. Sponsorship revenues are derived
principally from contracts ranging from one to three years. Sponsorships are
designed to support broad marketing objectives, including brand promotion,
awareness, product introductions and online research. Sponsorship agreements
typically include the delivery of impressions on iVillage's Web sites and
occasionally the design and development of customized sites that enhance the
promotional objectives of the sponsor. An impression is the viewing of
promotional material on a Web page, which may include banner advertisements,
links, buttons, or other text or images. As part of certain sponsorship
agreements, sponsors who also sell products may provide iVillage with a
commission on sales of their products generated through iVillage's Web site.
To date, these amounts have not been significant.

   Advertising revenues are derived principally from short-term advertising
contracts in which iVillage typically guarantees a minimum number of
impressions or pages to be delivered to users over a specified period of time
for a fixed fee. Sponsorship and advertising revenues are recognized ratably
in the period in which the advertisement is displayed, provided that iVillage
has no continuing obligations and the collection of the receivable is
reasonably assured, at the lesser of the ratio of impressions delivered over
total guaranteed impressions or the straight-line basis over the term of the
contract. To the extent that minimum guaranteed impressions are not met,
iVillage defers recognition of the corresponding revenues until the guaranteed
impressions are achieved.

   Included in sponsorship and advertising revenues are revenues from
advertising placements in Lamaze Publishing's publications, videos and website
and satellite broadcasts on the Newborn Channel. In addition, revenues are
generated through a sampling and coupon program which offers advertisers the
ability to distribute samples, coupons and promotional literature to new and
expectant mothers.

   Sponsorship and advertising revenues also include barter revenues, which
represent exchanges by iVillage of advertising space on iVillage's Web sites
for reciprocal advertising space or traffic on other Web sites. Revenues and
expenses from these barter transactions are recorded based upon the fair value
of the advertisements delivered. Fair value of advertisements delivered is
based upon iVillage's recent historical practice of receiving cash from
similar advertisers.  Barter revenues are recognized when the advertisements
are displayed on iVillage.com and its affiliated properties. Barter expenses
are recognized at the value of

advertisements received when iVillage's advertisements are displayed on the
reciprocal Web sites or properties, which is typically in the same period as
when advertisements are displayed on iVillage.com and its affiliated
properties, and are included as part of sales and marketing expenses. Revenues
from barter transactions were approximately $3.6 million, $3.3 million and
$3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. iVillage anticipates that barter revenues will continue to
increase in the future and will remain constant or increase slightly as a
percentage of total revenues depending on iVillage's future revenue growth.

   Revenues from Astrology.com consist of the sale of astrological charts and
other related products to visitors to the Astrology.com Web site. iVillage
recognizes revenues from Astrology.com product sales, net of any discounts,
when products are shipped to customers and the collection of the receivable is
reasonably assured.

   iVillage received fees from the licensing of portions of its content in
connection with the PlanetRx.com relationship. Such fees are recognized on a
straight-line basis over the life of the contract.

   iVillage has and will continue to reduce its costs through several expense
reduction initiatives targeted at certain expenses, including, without
limitation, reduced advertising, targeted staff reductions primarily through
attrition, reduced company employee benefit plan costs, as well as other
initiatives.

   Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999

   Revenues

   Revenues were $76.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, which
represents an increase of 109% when compared with 1999. The increase in
revenues was primarily due to iVillage's ability to generate significantly
higher sponsorship and advertising revenues during 2000 and the benefit of
receiving revenues from Lamaze Publishing and the Newborn Channel for the
entire 2000 period. Sponsorship, advertising and other revenues were $69.9
million for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to $35.0 million for
1999. The increase in sponsorship, advertising and other revenues was
primarily due to an increase in the number of impressions sold, an increase in
the number of sponsors advertising on iVillage's Web sites during 2000, and
from operating Lamaze Publishing and the Newborn Channel for the entire 2000
period. Sponsorship, advertising and other revenues accounted for
approximately 92% and 95% of total revenues for the year ended December 31,
2000 and 1999, respectively.

   Although no one advertiser accounted for greater than 10% of iVillage's
total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000, iVillage's five largest
advertisers accounted for 23% of total revenues. The five largest advertisers
accounted for 20% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999.

   Included in sponsorship and advertising revenues are barter transactions,
which accounted for approximately 5% of sponsorship and advertising revenues for
the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to 10% for 1999.

   Included in total revenues are fees received from the licensing of portions
of iVillage's content and fees from chart sales through Astrology.com, which
accounted for approximately 8% of total revenues for the year ended December
31, 2000, compared to 5% for 1999.

   Cost of Revenues

   The principal elements of cost of revenues for iVillage's operations are
content costs, payroll and related expenses for the editorial staff, Web site
design and production staff, the cost of communications and related expenses
necessary to support iVillage's Web sites, and an allocation of facility
expenses, which is based on the number of personnel. Cost of revenues was
$27.6 million, or 36% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2000. Cost
of revenues was $15.4 million, or 42% of total revenues, for 1999. Cost of
revenues, as a percentage of total revenues, decreased during the year ended
December 31, 2000 due to significant growth in advertising, sponsorship and
other revenues over the respective prior period.

   Operating Expenses

   Product Development and Technology. Product development and technology
expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for the technology
staff, related expenditures for support, technology, software development and
operations personnel, and an allocation of facility expenses, which is based
on the number of personnel. Product development and technology expenses for
the year ended December 31, 2000 were approximately $7.7 million, or 10% of
total revenues. Product development and technology expenses were approximately
$5.2 million, or 14% of total revenues, for 1999. The increase was primarily
attributable to additional personnel costs related to creating and testing new
concepts and tools used throughout iVillage's network of Web sites. Product
development and technology expenses decreased as a percentage of total
revenues as a result of the growth in revenues for the year ended December 31,
2000 compared to 1999.

   Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of
costs related to distribution agreements, payroll and related expenses for
sales and marketing personnel, commissions, advertising and other marketing-
related expenses, and an allocation of facility expenses, which is based on
the number of personnel. Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended
December 31, 2000 were approximately $54.1 million, or 71% of total revenues.
Sales and marketing expenses were approximately $63.5 million, or 174% of
total revenues, for 1999. The dollar decrease in sales and marketing expenses
in 2000 was primarily attributable to the launch of a national advertising
campaign in the third quarter of 1999 which was substantially completed by
early 2000, coupled with cost reduction initiatives instituted in the second
quarter of 2000 and continued throughout the year. Sales and marketing
expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenues as a result of the growth
in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared to 1999.

   Included in sales and marketing expenses are barter transactions, which
amounted to approximately 7% of total sales and marketing costs during the
year ended December 31, 2000, compared to 5% of total sales and marketing
costs during 1999.

   General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of payroll and related expenses and related costs for general
corporate overhead, including executive management, finance, allocated
facilities, and legal and other professional fees. General and administrative
expenses for the year ended December 31, 2000 were $22.6 million, or 30% of
total revenues. For 1999, general and administrative expenses were $13.2
million, or 36% of total revenues. The increase in general and administrative
expenses was primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits, recruiting
costs, expenses incurred for international endeavors, allocation of costs
associated with iVillage's office space, and the acquisition of Lamaze
Publishing in August 1999. General and administrative expenses decreased as a
percentage of total revenues as a result of the growth in revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2000 compared to 1999.

   Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses for
the year ended December 31, 2000 were approximately $37.7 million, or 49% of
total revenues. For 1999, depreciation and amortization expenses were $25.7
million, or 70% of total revenues. The dollar increase between 1999 and 2000
was primarily

attributable to a full year of amortization expense resulting from iVillage's
acquisitions of Astrology.Net, OnLine Psychological Services, Inc., Lamaze
Publishing and Family Point Inc. in 1999, as well as depreciation on a greater
base of fixed assets owned by us during 2000 periods. In the third quarter of
2000, iVillage recorded a charge of $98.1 million, or $3.30 per share, for the
impairment of goodwill relating to the 1999 acquisitions of OnLine
Psychological Services, Inc., Code Stone Technologies, Inc., Lamaze Publishing
Company, Inc., and Family Point Inc. iVillage determined that its estimated
future discounted cash flows were below the carrying values of its long-lived
assets, primarily goodwill. iVillage used a discount rate commensurate with
the risk involved when estimating future discounted cash flows. Yearly
amortization of this goodwill was approximately $26.6 million.

   Interest Income, Net

   Interest income, net includes interest income from iVillage's cash balances.
Interest income, net for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $5.3 million, or
7% of total revenues. For 1999, interest income, net was $4.1 million, or 11%
of total revenues. The increase between 1999 and 2000 was due to higher
interest rates in 2000 despite slightly lower average net cash and cash
equivalents balances in 2000 resulting primarily from the cash received from
iVillage's initial public offering of common stock in March 1999, and
secondary offering of common stock in October 1999.

   Net Loss

   iVillage recorded a net loss of $191.4 million, or $6.45 per share, for the
year ended December 31, 2000. For 1999, iVillage recorded a net loss of $116.6
million, or $5.58 per share. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2000
includes one-time expenses totaling approximately $118.7 million.  These one-
time expenses consisted of a charge for the impairment of goodwill of
approximately $98.1 million in the third quarter of 2000, the write-down of
marketable and non-marketable investments of approximately $8.4 million ($0.3
million in the fourth quarter of 2000 and $8.1 million in the second quarter
of 2000), whose decline was considered other than temporary, the write-down of
a note receivable of approximately $5.1 million in the third quarter of 2000,
and an estimated loss on the sale of iBaby, Inc. assets of $7.1 million. The
net loss for the year ended December 31, 1999 includes a deemed dividend of
$23.6 million incurred as a result of the difference between the purchase
price of the series E convertible preferred stock sold to NBC during the first
quarter of 1999, and the fair market value on the date of issuance.

   Revenues were $36.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, which
represented an increase of 194%, when compared with 1998. The increase in
revenues was primarily due to iVillage's ability to generate significantly
higher sponsorship and advertising revenues during 1999 and from the
acquisition of Lamaze Publishing in the third quarter of 1999, and
Astrology.com in the first quarter of 1999. Sponsorship, advertising and other
revenues were $35.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, compared to
$12.5 million for 1998. The increase in sponsorship, advertising and other
revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of impressions sold
and an increase in the number of sponsors advertising on iVillage's Web sites
during 1999. Sponsorship, advertising and other revenues accounted for
approximately 95% and 100% of total revenues for the year ended December 31,
1999 and 1998, respectively.

   Although no one advertiser accounted for greater than 10% of total revenues
for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, iVillage's five largest
advertisers accounted for 20% of total revenues in each period.

   Included in sponsorship and advertising revenues are barter transactions,
which accounted for approximately 10% of sponsorship and advertising revenues
for the year ended December 31, 1999, compared to 24% for 1998.

   Cost of Revenues

   The principal elements of cost of revenues for iVillage's operations are
content costs, payroll and related expenses for the editorial staff, Web site
design and production staff, the cost of communications and related

expenses necessary to support iVillage's Web sites, and an allocation of
facility expenses, which is based on the number of personnel. Cost of revenues
was $15.4 million, or 42% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 1999.
Cost of revenues was $10.3 million, or 83% of revenues, for 1998. Cost of
revenues, as a percentage of these revenues, decreased during the year ended
December 31, 1999 due to the significant growth in advertising and sponsorship
revenues over the prior period.

   Operating Expenses

   Product Development and Technology. Product development and technology
expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses and related
expenditures for support, technology, software development and operations
personnel, and an allocation of facility expenses, which is based on the
number of personnel. Product development and technology expenses for the year
ended December 31, 1999 were approximately $5.2 million, or 14% of total
revenues. Product development and technology expenses were $1.4 million, or
11% of total revenues, for 1998. The increase was primarily attributable to
additional personnel costs related to creating and testing new concepts and
tools to be used throughout iVillage's network of Web sites.

   Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of
costs related to distribution agreements, payroll and related expenses for
sales and marketing personnel, commissions, advertising and other marketing-
related expenses, and an allocation of facility expenses, which is based on
the number of personnel. Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended
December 31, 1999 were approximately $63.5 million, or 174% of total revenues.
Sales and marketing expenses were $28.2 million, or 226% of total revenues,
for 1998. The dollar increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily
attributable to iVillage's national advertising campaign on the Internet and
television in accordance with iVillage's agreement with NBC. Sales and
marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased between 1998 and 1999
as a result of the growth in revenues.

   Included in sales and marketing are barter transactions which amounted to
approximately 5% of sales and marketing costs during the year ended December
31, 1999, compared to 10% of sales and marketing costs during 1998.

   General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of payroll and related expenses and related costs for general
corporate overhead, including executive management, finance, allocated
facilities, and legal and other professional fees. General and administrative
expenses for the year ended December 31, 1999 were $13.2 million, or 36% of
total revenues. For 1998, general and administrative expenses were $9.5
million, or 77% of total revenues. The increase in general and administrative
expenses between 1998 and 1999 was primarily due to an increase in salaries
and benefits, recruiting costs and facilities expenses resulting from an
increase in the number of personnel hired to support the growth of iVillage's
business. General and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of
total revenues as a result of the growth in revenues in the year ended
December 31, 1999 compared to 1998.

   Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses for
the year ended December 31, 1999 were $25.7 million, or 70% of total revenues.
For 1998, depreciation and amortization expenses were $5.5 million, or 44% of
total revenues. The dollar increase between 1998 and 1999 was primarily
attributable to increased amortization expense resulting from iVillage's
acquisitions of Astrology.Net, OnLine Psychological Services, Inc., Lamaze
Publishing and Family Point Inc. as well as depreciation on a greater base of
fixed assets owned by iVillage during 1999.

   Interest Income, Net

   Interest income, net includes interest income from iVillage's cash balances
and interest expenses related to iVillage's financing obligations. Interest
income, net for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $4.1 million, or 11% of
total revenues. For 1998, interest income, net was $0.6 million, or 5% of
total revenues. The increase between 1998 and 1999 was primarily due to higher
average net cash and cash equivalents balances resulting primarily from the
cash received from iVillage's initial public offering of common stock in March
1999, and secondary offering of common stock in October 1999.

   Net Loss

   iVillage recorded a net loss of $116.6 million, or $5.58 per share, for the
year ended December 31, 1999. The net loss per share for the year ended
December 31, 1999 includes a deemed dividend of $23.6 million incurred as a
result of the difference between the purchase price of the series E
convertible preferred stock sold to NBC during the first quarter of 1999, and
the fair market value on the date of issuance. For 1998, iVillage recorded a
net loss of $43.7 million.

   Income Taxes

   As of December 31, 2000, iVillage had approximately $196.0 million of net
operating loss carryforwards for federal tax reporting purposes available to
offset future taxable income. iVillage's federal net operating loss
carryforwards expire beginning in 2010. Certain future changes in the share
ownership of iVillage, as defined in the Tax Reform Act of 1986, may restrict
the utilization of carryforwards. A valuation allowance has been recorded for
the entire deferred tax asset as a result of uncertainties regarding the
realization of the asset due to the lack of iVillage's earnings history.

   Recent Events

   Women.com. On February 5, 2001, iVillage signed a definitive agreement to
acquire all outstanding shares of Women.com Networks, Inc. The overall
transaction has an approximate aggregate value of $28.2 million. Under terms
of the merger agreement, iVillage will issue 0.322 shares (subject to
adjustment) of iVillage common stock for each share of Women.com common stock
on the closing date of the acquisition, plus an aggregate amount of cash
currently anticipated to be approximately $250,000.

   The acquisition is subject to the approval of iVillage's stockholders and
Women.com's stockholders and other customary closing conditions.

   In addition, Hearst Communications and Women.com's other public stockholders
will have the opportunity to invest an aggregate of $20.0 million in iVillage
in exchange for approximately 9.3 million shares, and warrants to purchase an
additional 2.1 million shares, of iVillage common stock. The warrants are
exercisable until December 31, 2004 at an exercise price of $0.01, but only if
the average closing market price of iVillage common stock, on any 15
consecutive trading days, has been above $3.75 per share. To the extent any of
Women.com's other stockholders do not purchase their pro rata percentage of
iVillage shares and warrants in this rights offering, Hearst Communications
has agreed to purchase any such shortfall.

   Hearst Communications has also committed to purchase from iVillage between
$15.0 and $21.0 million, of production and advertising services, over a three-
year period.

   NBC. In February 2001, iVillage further amended its November 1998 agreement
with NBC to provide for an extension of time during which iVillage must
purchase its advertising or promotional spots on the NBC network. The revised
terms require iVillage to purchase approximately $11.6 million of advertising or
promotional spots between January 30, 2001 and December 31, 2002, with $3.0
million of such spots being telecast during the year 2001 and approximately $8.6
million during the year 2002.

   Liquidity and Capital Resources

   Until iVillage's initial public offering in March 1999, which raised net
proceeds of $91.4 million, iVillage financed its operations primarily through
the private placement of its convertible preferred stock. On November 3, 1999,
iVillage consummated a secondary offering of 2.7 million shares of common
stock and received net proceeds of $70.8 million. As of December 31, 2000,
iVillage had approximately $58.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and
restricted cash.

   iVillage has sustained net losses and negative cash flows from operations
since its inception. iVillage's ability to meet its obligations in the
ordinary course of business is dependent upon its ability to achieve
profitable operations and/or raise additional financing through public or
private equity financings, collaborative or other arrangements with corporate
sources, or other sources of financing to fund operations. However, there is
no

assurance that iVillage will achieve profitable operations or that it will be
able to raise adequate financing from other sources. Management believes without
giving consideration to the effects of the proposed merger with Women.com that
its current funds will be sufficient to enable iVillage to meet its planned
expenditures through at least December 31, 2001. If anticipated operating
results are not achieved, management has the intent and believes it has the
ability to delay or reduce expenditures so as not to require additional
financial resources, if such resources were not available on terms acceptable to
iVillage.

   If the proposed merger with Women.com is consummated management believes
that its current funds, along with the investment of $20 million in connection
with the rights offering and management's intent and ability to significantly
reduce expenditures of the combined company, will be sufficient to enable
iVillage to meet its planned expenditures through at least December 31, 2001.

   Net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations decreased
to $39.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, from $48.6 million for
the year ended December 31, 1999. The overall decrease in net cash used in
operating activities from continuing operations during the year resulted
primarily from a decrease in losses from continuing operations, excluding non-
cash charges, a decrease in deferred revenue, offset by an increase in
restricted cash and other assets and depreciation and amortization expenses.
Non-cash charges includes the write-down of a note receivable and investments,
and an impairment of goodwill. The decreased loss from continuing operations,
excluding non-cash charges, was primarily due to the increase in revenue
coupled with iVillage's expense reduction initiatives. Net cash used in
operating activities amounted to $31.0 million for the year ended December 31,
1998. The increase in net cash used from 1998 to 1999 resulted primarily from
increasing net losses and other assets and decreasing accounts payable and
accrued expenses, offset by an increase in deferred revenue and depreciation
and amortization expense.

   Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $17.7
million for the year ended December 31, 2000. This compares to cash used in
investing activities from continuing operations of $32.9 million and $5.4
million for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The
overall decrease in cash used in investing activities from continuing
operations for the year ended December 31, 1999 to 2000 resulted primarily
from the acquisition of iBaby and Astrology.Net in the first quarter of 1999,
the acquisitions of OnLine Psychological Services, Inc. and Code Stone
Technologies, Inc. during the second quarter of 1999, and Lamaze Publishing
and Family Point Inc. in the third quarter of 1999, offset by higher fixed
asset purchases in 2000 for the build-out of iVillage's New York City office.
Through December 31, 2000, approximately $9.9 million has been disbursed for
the build-out of iVillage's office space. Net cash used in investing
activities increased from 1998 to 1999, primarily from the acquisitions of
iBaby, Inc. and Astrology.Net in the first quarter of 1999, the acquisitions
of OnLine Psychological Services, Inc. and Code Stone Technologies, Inc.
during the second quarter of 1999, and the acquisition of Lamaze Publishing
and Family Point Inc. in August 1999.

   Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations
amounted to $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to
$166.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The overall decrease in
net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was
primarily due to the receipt of $91.4 million of net proceeds from iVillage's
initial public offering in March 1999 and $70.8 million of net proceeds from
its secondary public offering consummated in November 1999. Net cash provided
by financing activities from continuing operations was $63.1 for 1998. The
increase from 1998 to 1999 was primarily due to the receipt of $91.4 million
in net proceeds from iVillage's initial public offering in March 1999 and
$70.8 million of net proceeds from its secondary public offering consummated
in November 1999, offset by $63.6 million of net proceeds from the sale of
shares of its series D and E convertible preferred stock, and common stock in
1998.

   On September 3, 1999, iVillage paid approximately $7.5 million to
PlanetRx.com for 371,103 shares of series D preferred stock of PlanetRx.com,
which was converted into the same number of shares of PlanetRx.com, common
stock upon the closing of PlanetRx.com's initial public offering in October
1999. At June 30, 2000, the investment in PlanetRx.com was written down
approximately $7.1 million, and at December 31, 2000 the investment was
further written down approximately $0.3 million, to its estimated fair market
value due to a decline in value deemed to be other than temporary.

   In addition, in September 1999 iVillage entered into a content license
agreement with PlanetRx.com for $7.5 million and a multi-year sponsorship
agreement for $15.0 million. In June 2000, iVillage's sponsorship

agreement with PlanetRx.com was amended to reduce the aggregate value of the
agreement to approximately $9.3 million, as well as reduce iVillage's
obligations thereunder. In September 2000, iVillage's Sponsorship Agreement
with PlanetRx.com was further amended to reduce the aggregate value of the
agreement to approximately $4.0 million, further reduce iVillage's obligations
thereunder, and terminate the agreement as of December 31, 2000.

   As of September 28, 1999, iVillage entered into a financial advisory
agreement with Allen & Company Incorporated pursuant to which Allen & Company
will act as iVillage's financial advisor with respect to various matters from
time to time. iVillage paid Allen & Company $0.3 million upon execution of the
agreement. In February 2000, iVillage executed an amendment to the agreement
that extended its term to September 28, 2000 and set forth additional fees
payable to Allen & Company for up to 12 months after expiration of the
agreement upon the occurrence of certain events. Upon consummation of the
merger with Women.com, iVillage will be obligated to pay Allen & Company a fee
in connection with their services.

   In March 2000, iVillage entered into a fifteen-year lease for approximately
105,000 square feet at 500-512 Seventh Avenue in which iVillage has recently
consolidated its New York City operations. The financial commitment for rent
at this office space is approximately $4.7 million for the next 12 months.
Pursuant to the terms of the lease, iVillage received approximately $3.8
million in January 2001 and anticipates receiving another approximately $1.5
million for reimbursement of certain construction expenses. iVillage also
expects to spend an additional approximately $2.1 million to complete the
construction project.

   On February 15, 2000, iVillage and Unilever PLC announced the formation of an
independently managed company to provide women within a highly focused
community, an array of interactive, customized online services, beauty and
personal care products and personalized products recommendations.  Unilever
PLC and iVillage plan to provide cash, intellectual property, marketing and
other resources.  Unilever PLC will provide capital as well as sponsorship and
promotional initiatives. iVillage will provide its Beauty channel, capital,
intellectual property, services and promotion. iVillage's funding obligations
shall not exceed in the aggregate $1.5 million in calendar year 2000 and $2.0
million in calendar year 2001, however any unused funding for calendar year
2000 or 2001 may be carried over and used in calendar year 2001 or 2002,
respectively.  As of December 31, 2000, iVillage had not contributed any
capital to the joint venture. During the year ended 2000, iVillage recognized
losses from the joint venture of approximately $0.4 million.

   In June 2000, iVillage decided to discontinue the operations of iBaby, Inc.
iVillage recorded a loss on disposal of approximately $7.1 million, which
includes a loss on sale of assets of approximately $3.6 million and an
estimated loss from operations during the phase-out period of approximately
$3.4 million.  Results of these operations have been classified as
discontinued operations and all prior period results have been reclassified.

   In July 2000, iVillage sold certain assets of iBaby, Inc. to Babygear.com,
Inc. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement dated July 6, 2000, iVillage received
a convertible promissory note of approximately $9.7 million. Pursuant to the
terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, in October 2000 the note was converted
into 890,198 shares of Babygear.com Series C Convertible Preferred Stock.
Subsequent to the conversion of the note, Babygear.com filed for bankruptcy.

   In calculating the loss on sale of assets, iVillage valued the note at $5.1
million as of June 30, 2000, due to uncertainties surrounding the
recoverability of the convertible note. At September, 30, 2000, the
convertible note was fully reserved due to uncertainties surrounding
Babygear.com's ability to sustain their operations, and is included in the
caption write-down of note receivable and investments in the consolidated
statements of operations.

   In December 2000, iVillage entered into an exclusive licensing and
technology agreement with Hindustan Lever Limited to create a Web site
targeting women in India. As part of the licensing agreement, Hindustan Lever
Limited will pay an initial set-up fee for certain services and domain
knowledge and iVillage will receive an annual royalty on any revenue
generated. The license agreement is subject to necessary regulatory approvals
in India.

   iVillage's capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including:

   o market acceptance of its services;

   o the amount of resources iVillage devotes to investments in the
     iVillage.com network, including entering into joint ventures with and/or
     the acquisition of other entities;

   o the resources iVillage devotes to marketing; and

   o the resources iVillage devotes to selling its services and brand
     promotions.

   iVillage has experienced a substantial increase in its expenditures since
its inception. The increase in expenditures is consistent with the growth in
iVillage's operations and staffing. iVillage anticipates that it will continue
to evaluate possible investments in businesses and products and technologies,
either of which could reduce iVil
