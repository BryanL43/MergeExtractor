 *Estimated for purposes of calculating the amount of the filing fee only. The
  fee was calculated by multiplying $5.267, the per share tender offer price, by
  the 9,052,243 currently outstanding shares of Common Stock sought in the
  Offer, which gives an aggregate consideration of $47,678,163.88 (the "Common
  Stock Consideration"). The Common Stock Consideration was then added to
  $2,572,211.59, being the net consideration for the Subject Company's 1,907,831
  in-the-money employee stock options and the 96,924 rights to purchase shares
  of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to the Subject Company's employee
  stock purchase plan to arrive at a total transaction value of $50,250,375.47.

**Calculated as 1/50 of 1% of the transaction value.

a wholly owned subsidiary of Boston Scientific Corporation ("Parent"). We have
been organized in connection with this Offer and have not carried on any
activities other than in connection with this Offer. See Section 8.

     Parent is a Delaware corporation, with securities listed on the New York
Stock Exchange. Parent is a worldwide developer, manufacturer and marketer of
medical devices. The principal offices of Parent are located at One Boston
Scientific Place, Natick, Massachusetts 01760-1537. The telephone number of
Parent at such location is (508) 650-8000. See Section 8.

WHAT ARE THE CLASSES AND AMOUNTS OF SECURITIES SOUGHT IN THIS OFFER?

     We are seeking to purchase all the issued and outstanding shares of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, including the associated preferred stock
purchase rights, of Cardiac Pathways Corporation ("Cardiac Pathways" or the
"Company"). See the "Introduction" and Section 1.

     We are not offering to purchase in the Offer any shares of preferred stock,
series B, par value $0.001 per share, of Cardiac Pathways (the "Series B
Shares"), nor will tenders be accepted of any Series B Shares. Certain
stockholders of the Company have agreed to sell their Series B Shares to us
immediately following consummation of the Offer pursuant to the Stock Purchase
Agreement (as defined herein). The Series B Shares, to the extent not subject to
the Stock Purchase Agreement, will be acquired in the Merger (as defined
herein). However, after consummation of the Offer, we may enter into agreements
with certain holders of Series B Shares to acquire such Shares prior to the
closing of the Merger. In this Offer, references to "Shares" will be references
only to the shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Cardiac
Pathways, including associated preferred stock purchase rights. See Section 11.

HOW MUCH ARE YOU OFFERING TO PAY AND WHAT IS THE FORM OF PAYMENT?

     We are offering to pay $5.267 per Share (rounded to the nearest whole cent
after aggregating all Shares held by you), net in cash and without interest
thereon. See the "Introduction" and Section 1.

     If you tender your Shares in the Offer, you will not be obligated by Parent
to pay brokerage fees or commissions or, except as otherwise provided in
Instruction 6 of the Letter of Transmittal, stock transfer taxes with respect to
the sale of your Shares pursuant to the Offer. If you own Shares through a
broker or other nominee, and your broker or nominee tenders your Shares on your
behalf, your broker or nominee may charge a fee for doing so. You should consult
your broker or nominee to determine whether any charges or commissions will
apply. See the "Introduction."

HAVE ANY STOCKHOLDERS ALREADY AGREED TO TENDER THEIR SHARES?

     Yes. All of the directors and executive officers of Cardiac Pathways, as
well as a principal holder of Shares have entered into agreements with us (the
"Stockholder Support Agreements") whereby they have agreed to tender all of
their Shares (representing approximately 52% of the outstanding Shares or
approximately 32% of the outstanding voting securities of Cardiac Pathways).
These directors and executive officers, together with such principal holder,
have also agreed to vote in favor of the Merger and against any competing
acquisition proposal. See Section 10.

HAVE YOU ENTERED INTO ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER STOCKHOLDERS?

     Yes. We have entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement with certain other
principal stockholders of Cardiac Pathways (the "Stock Purchase Agreement")
pursuant to which such principal stockholders have agreed to sell to us the
Series B Shares and warrants to purchase Series B Shares owned by them
(representing approximately 74% of the outstanding Series B Shares and warrants
or approximately 28% of the outstanding voting securities of Cardiac Pathways)
and tender all of their Shares (representing approximately 13% of the
outstanding Shares or approximately 8% of the outstanding voting securities of
Cardiac Pathways). These principal stockholders have also agreed to vote in
favor of the Merger and against any competing acquisition proposal. See Section
10.

     Upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase
Agreement and the Stockholder Support Agreements, Parent and Purchaser will
acquire approximately 68% of outstanding voting securities of Cardiac Pathways.

WHAT ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER?

     We are not obligated to purchase any Shares unless the Shares validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn before the expiration of the Offer, together
with any Series B Shares owned by Parent (after giving effect to the assumed
purchase of the Series B Shares pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, as
though such purchase had already occurred), represent at least a majority of the
then outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis. See Section 1 and Section 14.

     We are not obligated to purchase any Shares unless prior to the expiration
of the Offer the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act has expired or been
terminated. See Sections 14 and 15.

     The Offer also is subject to a number of other conditions which are
described in greater detail in Sections 1 and 14.

DO YOU HAVE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO MAKE PAYMENT?

     Yes. The Offer is not subject to a financing condition. Parent will provide
the funds necessary to purchase the Shares in the Offer from existing resources
or borrowing availability. See Section 9.

IS YOUR FINANCIAL CONDITION RELEVANT TO MY DECISION TO TENDER IN THE OFFER?

     Because the form of payment consists solely of cash and the Offer is not
contingent upon our receipt of financing, we do not believe our financial
condition is relevant to your decision to tender in the Offer.

HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO TENDER IN THE OFFER?

     You will have at least until 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Monday,
August 6, 2001, to decide whether to tender your Shares in the Offer. If you
cannot deliver everything that is required in order to make a valid tender by
that time, you may be able to use a guaranteed delivery procedure which is
described in Section 3 of this Offer to Purchase. See Section 3.

CAN THE OFFER BE EXTENDED, AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES?

     Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement and applicable law, we can
extend the period of time during which the Offer remains open. We have agreed in
the Merger Agreement that we may extend the Offer if certain conditions to the
Offer have not been satisfied. We have also agreed in the Merger Agreement that,
at the request of Cardiac Pathways, we will extend the Offer if certain
conditions to the Offer have not been satisfied. See Section 1.

HOW WILL I BE NOTIFIED IF THE OFFER IS EXTENDED?

     If we decide to extend the Offer, we will inform Mellon Investor Services
LLC, which is the Depositary for the Offer, of that fact, and will issue a press
release giving the new expiration date no later than 9:00 a.m.,
                                        ii

New York City time, on the day after the day on which the Offer was previously
scheduled to expire. See Section 1.

WILL THERE BE A SUBSEQUENT OFFERING PERIOD?

     Following satisfaction or waiver of all the conditions to the Offer and the
acceptance of and payment for all the Shares tendered during the offering
period, we may elect to provide a subsequent offering period. This would allow
us to accept additional Shares that were not tendered prior to the expiration of
the Offer. During a subsequent offering period, you will not be able to withdraw
any of the Shares that you have already tendered (because such Shares will have
already been accepted for payment by us), nor any of the Shares that you tender
during such subsequent offering period. If we elect to provide a subsequent
offering period, we will announce it by issuing a press release no later than
9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day after the expiration of the Offer. See
Section 1.

HOW DO I TENDER MY SHARES?

     To tender your Shares in the Offer, you must:

     - complete and sign the accompanying Letter of Transmittal (or a manually
       signed facsimile of the Letter of Transmittal) in accordance with the
       instructions in the Letter of Transmittal and mail or deliver it together
       with your share certificates, and any other required documents, to the
       Depositary;

     - tender your Shares pursuant to the procedure for book-entry transfer set
       forth in Section 3; or

     - if your share certificates are not immediately available or if you cannot
       deliver your share certificates, and any other required documents, to the
       Depositary, prior to the expiration of the Offer, or you cannot complete
       the procedure for delivery by book-entry transfer on a timely basis, you
       may still tender your Shares if you comply with the guaranteed delivery
       procedures described in Section 3.

UNTIL WHAT TIME CAN I WITHDRAW PREVIOUSLY TENDERED SHARES?

     You may withdraw previously tendered Shares any time prior to the
expiration of the Offer, and, unless we have accepted and paid for the Shares
pursuant to the Offer, you may also withdraw any tendered Shares at any time
after September 8, 2001. See Section 4.

HOW DO I WITHDRAW PREVIOUSLY TENDERED SHARES?

     To withdraw previously tendered Shares, you must deliver a written or
facsimile notice of withdrawal with the required information to the Depositary
while you still have the right to withdraw. If you tendered Shares by giving
instructions to a broker or bank, you must instruct the broker or bank to
arrange for the withdrawal of your Shares. See Section 4.

WHAT DOES THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS THINK OF THE OFFER?

     We are making the Offer on the basis of the Merger Agreement. The Board of
the Company has unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including each of the Offer and the Merger,
and the transactions contemplated by the Stockholder Agreements are fair to, and
in the best interests of, you, as a holder of Shares, has approved, adopted and
declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, and has resolved to recommend that you accept the Offer and tender your
Shares.

WILL THE COMPANY CONTINUE AS A PUBLIC COMPANY?

     No. If the Merger occurs, the Company will no longer be publicly owned.
Even if the Merger does not occur, if we purchase all the tendered Shares, there
may be so few remaining holders of Shares and publicly held Shares that the
Shares will no longer be eligible to be traded through Nasdaq, or other
securities market and there may not be a public trading market for the Shares.
As a result, the Company may cease making

                                       iii

filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") or
otherwise cease being required to comply with Commission rules relating to
publicly held companies. See Section 13.

WILL THE OFFER BE FOLLOWED BY A MERGER IF ALL THE SHARES ARE NOT TENDERED?

     If we accept for payment and pay for Shares that represent a majority
(after giving effect to the assumed purchase of the Series B Shares pursuant to
the Stock Purchase Agreement as though such purchase had already occurred) of
the outstanding Shares on an "as-converted" basis, Purchaser will merge with and
into the Company.

     You should note that upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Stockholder Agreements, Parent and Purchaser will own a number of Shares and
Series B Shares sufficient, even if no other Shares are tendered in the Offer,
to cause the Merger to occur without the affirmative vote of any other
stockholder of Cardiac Pathways.

     If the Merger occurs, the Company will become a private, wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent, and each issued and then outstanding Share (other than any
Shares held in the treasury of the Company and any Shares held by holders
seeking appraisal under Delaware law for their Shares) will be canceled and
converted automatically into the right to receive $5.267 per Share, in cash (or
any greater amount per Share paid pursuant to the Offer).

IF I DECIDE NOT TO TENDER, HOW WILL THE OFFER AFFECT MY SHARES?

     If you decide not to tender your Shares in the Offer and the Merger occurs,
unless you have exercised your rights to seek appraisal of your Shares, you will
receive in the Merger the same amount of cash per Share as if you had tendered
your Shares in the Offer. Therefore, if the Merger occurs and you have not
sought an appraisal, the only difference to you between tendering and not
tendering your Shares is that you will be paid earlier if you tender your
Shares. The rights you have to seek appraisal of your Shares are described in
this Offer to Purchase. See Section 11.

     If you decide not to tender your Shares in the Offer and the Merger does
not occur, if we purchase all the tendered Shares, there may be so few remaining
holders of Shares and publicly held Shares that the Shares will no longer be
eligible to be traded through the Nasdaq National Market, or other securities
market, there may not be a public trading market for the Shares and the Company
may cease making filings with the Commission or otherwise cease being required
to comply with Commission rules relating to publicly held companies. See Section
13.

WHAT IS THE MARKET VALUE OF MY SHARES AS OF A RECENT DATE?

     On Monday, June 18, 2001, the closing price per Share, as reported on the
Nasdaq National Market, was $3.40 per share. On Thursday, June 28, 2001, the
last full trading day before we announced our Offer, the closing price per
share, as reported on the Nasdaq National Market, was $5.80. See Section 6.

WITH WHOM MAY I TALK IF I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE OFFER?

     You can call Innisfree M&A Incorporated, the Information Agent for the
Offer, at (888) 750-5834 (Bankers and Brokers may call collect at (212)
750-5833). See the back cover of this Offer to Purchase.

                                        iv

TO THE HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK OF
CARDIAC PATHWAYS CORPORATION:

                                  INTRODUCTION

     Adam Acquisition 2001 Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Purchaser") and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Boston Scientific Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), hereby offers to purchase all the shares of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, including the associated preferred stock purchase rights
(together, the "Shares"), of Cardiac Pathways Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("Cardiac Pathways" or the "Company"), that are issued and
outstanding for $5.267 per Share (rounded to the nearest whole cent after
aggregating all Shares held by the seller), net to the seller in cash, without
interest, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Offer
to Purchase and in the related Letter of Transmittal (which, together with this
Offer to Purchase and any amendments or supplements hereto or thereto,
collectively constitute the "Offer"). See Section 8 for additional information
concerning Parent and Purchaser.

     Tendering holders of Shares will not be obligated by Parent or Purchaser to
pay brokerage fees or commissions or, except as otherwise provided in
Instruction 6 of the Letter of Transmittal, stock transfer taxes with respect to
the purchase of Shares by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer. If you own Shares
through a broker or other nominee, and your broker or nominee tenders your
Shares on your behalf, your broker or nominee may charge a fee for doing so. You
should consult your broker or nominee to determine whether any charges or
commissions will apply. However, any tendering holder of Shares or other payee
who fails to complete and sign the Substitute Form W-9 that is included in the
Letter of Transmittal may be subject to a required back-up U.S. federal income
tax withholding of 31% (or such reduced rate as applicable) of the gross
proceeds payable to such holder or other payee pursuant to the Offer. See
Section 5. Purchaser or Parent will pay all charges and expenses of Mellon
Investor Services LLC (the "Depositary") and Innisfree M&A Incorporated (the
"Information Agent") incurred in connection with the Offer. See Section 16.

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY (THE "BOARD") HAS UNANIMOUSLY (i)
DETERMINED THAT THE MERGER AGREEMENT (AS DEFINED HEREIN) AND THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, INCLUDING EACH OF THE OFFER AND THE MERGER (AS DEFINED
HEREIN), AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENTS (AS
DEFINED HEREIN) ARE FAIR TO, AND IN THE BEST INTEREST OF, THE HOLDERS OF SHARES,
(ii) APPROVED, ADOPTED AND DECLARED ADVISABLE THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, INCLUDING EACH OF THE OFFER AND THE MERGER
AND (iii) RESOLVED TO RECOMMEND THAT THE HOLDERS OF SHARES ACCEPT THE OFFER AND
TENDER SHARES PURSUANT TO THE OFFER AND, IF APPLICABLE, VOTE THEIR SHARES IN
FAVOR OF THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

     Dain Rauscher Wessels, a division of Dain Rauscher Incorporated, financial
advisor to Cardiac Pathways in connection with the Offer ("Dain Rauscher"), has
delivered to the Board its written opinion dated June 28, 2001 to the effect
that, based upon and subject to various considerations and assumptions set forth
in such opinion, the consideration to be received by the holders of Shares
pursuant to each of the Offer and the Merger is fair to such holders from a
financial point of view. A copy of the written opinion of Dain Rauscher is
contained in the Company's Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 (the "Schedule 14D-9"), which has been filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "Commission") in connection with the Offer and which is
being mailed to holders of Shares concurrently herewith, and holders of Shares
are urged to read such opinion carefully in its entirety for a description of
the assumptions made, matters considered and limitations of the review
undertaken by Dain Rauscher.

     THE OFFER IS CONDITIONED UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, (i) THERE HAVING BEEN
VALIDLY TENDERED AND NOT WITHDRAWN PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE OFFER AT LEAST
THE NUMBER OF SHARES THAT, TOGETHER WITH THE SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES
B, PAR VALUE $0.001 PER SHARE OF THE COMPANY (THE "SERIES B SHARES") OWNED BY
PARENT (AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO THE ASSUMED PURCHASE OF SERIES B SHARES PURSUANT
TO THE STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (AS DEFINED HEREIN)) SHALL CONSTITUTE A MAJORITY
OF THE THEN OUTSTANDING SHARES ON A FULLY DILUTED BASIS (INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, ALL SHARES ISSUABLE UPON THE CONVERSION OF THE SERIES B SHARES OR
UPON THE EXERCISE OF ANY OPTIONS, WARRANTS, OR RIGHTS BUT EXCLUDING ANY
SECURITIES THAT HAVE AN EFFECTIVE CONVERSION, OR EXERCISE PRICE IMMEDIATELY
PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE OFFER THAT IS IN EXCESS OF THE PER SHARE AMOUNT

(AS DEFINED HEREIN)) (THE "MINIMUM CONDITION") AND (ii) THE APPLICABLE WAITING
PERIOD UNDER THE HART-SCOTT-RODINO ANTITRUST IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1976, AS AMENDED
(THE "HSR ACT"), HAVING EXPIRED OR BEEN TERMINATED PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF
THE OFFER (THE "HSR CONDITION"). THE OFFER IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OTHER
CONDITIONS DESCRIBED IN THIS OFFER TO PURCHASE. THE OFFER IS NOT SUBJECT TO A
FINANCING CONDITION. SEE SECTIONS 1 AND 14, WHICH SET FORTH IN FULL THE
CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER.

     The Offer is being made pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of June 28, 2001 (the "Merger Agreement"), among Parent, Purchaser and the
Company. The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that as promptly as
practicable after the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer and the
satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of the other conditions set forth in the
Merger Agreement and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ("Delaware Law"), Purchaser will be
merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, the
Company will continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation")
and will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. At the effective time of
the Merger (the "Effective Time"), each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares held in the treasury of the
Company and other than Shares held by holders of Shares who shall have demanded
and perfected appraisal rights under Delaware Law) shall be canceled and
converted automatically into the right to receive $5.267 in cash, or any higher
price that may be paid per Share in the Offer, without interest (the "Merger
Consideration"). Holders of Shares who demand and fully perfect appraisal rights
under Delaware Law will be entitled to receive, in connection with the Merger,
cash for the fair value of their Shares as determined pursuant to the procedures
prescribed by Delaware Law. See Section 11. The Merger Agreement is more fully
described in Section 10. Certain federal income tax consequences of the sale of
Shares pursuant to the Offer and the Merger, as the case may be, are described
in Section 5.

     Simultaneously with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Parent entered
into a stock purchase agreement, dated as of June 28, 2001 (the "Stock Purchase
Agreement"), with Morgan Stanley Venture Partners III, L.P., Morgan Stanley
Venture Investors III, L.P. and Morgan Stanley Venture Partner Entrepreneur
Fund, L.P. (together, the "Morgan Stanley Entities") and Bank of America
Ventures and BA Venture Partners V (together, the "Bank of America Entities",
and together with the Morgan Stanley Entities, the "Selling Stockholders"),
pursuant to which the Selling Stockholders have, among other things, (i) agreed
to sell to Parent all of the Series B Shares and warrants to purchase Series B
Shares ("Series B Warrants") owned by them (which equal approximately 73% of the
outstanding Series B Shares on a fully diluted basis), on the terms and subject
to the conditions of the Stock Purchase Agreement following the closing of the
Offer, (ii) agreed to tender all Shares owned by them (which equal approximately
13% of the outstanding Shares) and (iii) granted an irrevocable proxy to Parent
and each of its officers to vote and take any actions with respect to all of the
Shares and Series B Shares owned by the Selling Stockholders (representing
approximately 36% of the outstanding voting securities of the Company), at any
meeting of the stockholders of the Company, however called, (A) against any
action, proposal, agreement or transaction that would result in a breach of any
covenant, obligation, agreement, representation or warranty of the Company under
the Merger Agreement or of the Selling Stockholders under the Stock Purchase
Agreement, (B) against any action, agreement, transaction (other than the Merger
Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby) or proposal that could
reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to the Company's
obligations under the Merger Agreement not being fulfilled or that is intended,
or could reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere, delay, discourage or
adversely affect the Merger Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the Stock
Purchase Agreement and (C) in favor of the transactions contemplated by the
Stockholder Agreements as may be required pursuant to the protective provisions
of the Certificate of Designation for the Series B Shares (the "Certificate of
Designation"). The Stock Purchase Agreement is more fully described in Section
10.

     Simultaneously with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Parent and
Purchaser have also entered into stockholder agreements, dated as of June 28,
2001 (the "Stockholder Support Agreements"), with each of Van Wagoner Funds,
Inc. ("Van Wagoner") and the directors and executive officers of the Company
(together with Van Wagoner, the "Supporting Stockholders"), pursuant to which
the Supporting Stockholders have, among other things, (i) agreed to tender into
the Offer all Shares owned by them (which

equal approximately 52% of the outstanding Shares or approximately 32% of the
outstanding voting securities of the Company), (ii) agreed to vote and take any
actions with respect to all such Shares owned by the Supporting Stockholders, at
any meeting of the stockholders of the Company in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement and against any action, proposal, agreement or transaction that
would result in a breach of any covenant, obligation, agreement, representation
or warranty of the Company under the Merger Agreement or of the Supporting
Stockholders under the Stockholder Support Agreements, or that could reasonably
be expected to result in any of the conditions to the Company's obligations
under the Merger Agreement not being fulfilled, or that is intended, or could
reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere, delay, discourage or adversely
affect the Merger Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the Stockholder Support
Agreements, and (iii) granted Purchaser an option, exercisable under certain
limited circumstances, to purchase all such Shares owned by them at the price
per Share to be paid in the Offer. The Stockholder Support Agreements are more
fully described in Section 10.

     The Stockholder Support Agreements and the Stock Purchase Agreement are
together referred to in this Offer to Purchase as the "Stockholder Agreements."
The Selling Stockholders and the Supporting Stockholders are together referred
to in this Offer to Purchase as the "Stockholders".

     The Merger Agreement provides that, promptly upon the purchase by Purchaser
of Shares pursuant to the Offer and the transactions contemplated by the
Stockholder Agreements and from time to time thereafter, Purchaser shall be
entitled to designate up to such number of directors, rounded up to the next
whole number, on the Board equal to the product of the total number of directors
on the Board (giving effect to the directors elected pursuant to this sentence)
multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of Shares and Series B
Shares beneficially owned by Purchaser and its affiliates following such
purchase bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding on an
"as-converted" basis. In the Merger Agreement, the Company has agreed, at such
time, to promptly take all actions necessary to cause Purchaser's designees to
be elected as directors of the Company, including increasing the size of the
Board or securing the resignations of incumbent directors, or both.

     The consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
certain conditions, including the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition, as a
result of Purchaser's acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Stockholder Agreements, or
a combination of the foregoing and, if necessary, the adoption of the Merger
Agreement by the requisite vote of the stockholders of the Company. For a more
detailed description of the conditions to the Merger, see Section 10. Under the
Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Certificate of Designation
and Delaware Law, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding Shares and Series B Shares voting together as a single class is
required to adopt the Merger Agreement. Consequently, if Purchaser acquires
(pursuant to the Offer or the Stockholder Agreements) at least a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Company, then Purchaser will have
sufficient voting power to adopt the Merger Agreement without the vote of any
other holder of Shares. See Sections 10 and 11.

     Under Delaware Law, if Purchaser acquires, pursuant to the Offer or
otherwise, including pursuant to the Stockholder Agreements, at least 90% of the
then outstanding Shares and 90% of the then outstanding Series B Shares,
Purchaser will be able to adopt the Merger Agreement without a vote of the
Company's holders of Shares and Series B Shares voting together as a single
class. In such event, Parent and Purchaser shall take all necessary action to
cause the Merger to become effective in accordance with Delaware Law as promptly
as reasonably practicable after such acquisition, without a meeting of the
Company's stockholders. If, however, Purchaser does not acquire at least 90% of
the then outstanding Shares pursuant to the Offer and 90% of the then
outstanding Series B Shares and a vote of the Company's stockholders is required
under Delaware Law, a significantly longer period of time will be required to
effect the Merger. See Section 11.

     The Company has advised Purchaser that as of June 28, 2001, 16,810,746
Shares were issued and outstanding on a fully diluted basis, comprising
9,052,243 Shares, 1,907,831 Shares reserved for issuance pursuant to employee
stock options, 22,582 Shares reserved in connection with rights issued pursuant
to the Company's employee stock purchase plan and 27,250 Series B Shares and
warrants to purchase 300 Series B Shares, together representing on an
"as-converted" basis approximately 5,828,090 Shares. As a result, as of

such date, the Minimum Condition would be satisfied if Purchaser acquired
8,405,373 Shares on a fully diluted basis. Pursuant to, and subject to the terms
and conditions of, the Stockholder Agreements, Parent and Purchaser expect to
acquire approximately 5,338,283 outstanding Shares and 19,900 outstanding Series
B Shares (or approximately 11,229,949 Shares on a fully diluted basis), being a
number of Shares and Series B Shares sufficient, even if no other Shares are
tendered in the Offer, to cause the Merger to occur without the affirmative vote
of any other stockholder of the Company. Purchaser could also cause the Merger
to become effective in accordance with Delaware Law without a meeting of the
Company's stockholders if Purchaser acquired 8,147,019 outstanding Shares and
24,525 outstanding Series B Shares.

     The Company has issued one preferred share purchase right (a "Right") for
each outstanding Share pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated as of April 22,
1997 and as amended between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, N.A., as
successor in interest to Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A. (the "Rights Agreement").
The Company has represented in the Merger Agreement that it has amended its
Rights Agreement (the "Rights Amendment") to ensure that (a) none of the
execution or delivery of the Merger Agreement or the Stockholder Agreements or
the consummation of the transactions to be effected pursuant to the Merger
Agreement or the Stockholder Agreements will result in (i) the occurrence of the
"flip-in event" described in the Rights Agreement, (ii) the occurrence of the
"flip-over event" described in the Rights Agreement, or (iii) the Rights
becoming evidenced by, and transferable pursuant to, certificates separate from
the certificates representing Shares and (b) the Rights will expire pursuant to
the terms of the Rights Agreement at the effective time of the Merger.

     Parent intends to file shortly with the Federal Trade Commission (the
"FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "Antitrust
Division") a Premerger Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with
respect to the purchase of Shares and Series B Shares pursuant to the Offer and
the Stockholder Agreements, and accordingly, the statutory waiting period under
the HSR Act applicable to the purchase of Shares and Series B Shares pursuant to
the Offer and the Stockholder Agreements will expire in due course, unless
extended by the FTC or the Antitrust Division requesting additional information
from Parent with respect to the Offer. If such a request is made, the waiting
period will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the tenth calendar day
after substantial compliance with such request. Thereafter, the waiting period
may only be extended by court order or with the consent of Parent. The waiting
period under the HSR Act may be terminated prior to expiration by the FTC and
the Antitrust Division. Parent has requested early termination of the waiting
period, although there can be no assurance that this request will be granted.
According to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
June 2000, the Company conducts operations in a number of foreign countries. As
a result of such operations, Parent has determined that it is required to file
certain information in Germany. In addition, in the event that one or more other
foreign laws are deemed to be applicable to the Offer, Purchaser and/or the
Company may be required to file certain information or to receive the approval
of the relevant non-United States authority. Such governmental authority may
also attempt to impose additional conditions on the Company's operations
conducted in such countries. Purchaser presently intends to take such action as
such laws may require. See Section 15 for additional information regarding such
filings and approvals under the HSR Act and in other jurisdictions.

     No appraisal rights are available in connection with the Offer. However,
holders of Shares may have appraisal rights in connection with the Merger
regardless of whether the Merger is consummated with or without a vote of the
Company's stockholders. See Section 11.

     THIS OFFER TO PURCHASE AND THE RELATED LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL CONTAIN
IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY DECISION
WITH RESPECT TO THE OFFER.

1. TERMS OF THE OFFER; EXPIRATION DATE.

     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer (including, if
the Offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of such extension or
amendment), Purchaser will accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly
tendered (and not withdrawn in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 4) on or prior to the Expiration Date. "Expiration Date" means 12:00
midnight, New York City time, on Monday,

August 6, 2001, unless and until Purchaser (subject to the terms and conditions
of the Merger Agreement) shall have extended the period during which the Offer
is open, in which case Expiration Date shall mean the latest time and date at
which the Offer, as may be extended by Purchaser, shall expire.

     The Offer is subject to the conditions set forth under Section 14,
including the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the HSR Condition.
Subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission and subject to
the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Purchaser expressly reserves
the right to waive any such condition in whole or in part, in its sole
discretion. Subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission
and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Purchaser also
expressly reserves the right to increase the price per Share payable in the
Offer and to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer;
provided, however, that the Purchaser may not decrease the price per Share
payable in the Offer, reduce the number of Shares to be purchased in the Offer,
change the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer, extend the Offer
except as provided in the Merger Agreement, amend any other term of the Offer in
a manner adverse to the holders of Shares or impose conditions to the Offer in
addition to those set forth in Section 14.

     The Merger Agreement provides that Purchaser may, without the consent of
the Company, (i) extend the Offer for a period of not more than 30 business days
beyond the scheduled expiration date, which shall be 20 business days following
the commencement of the Offer, if, at the scheduled expiration of the Offer, any
of the conditions to Purchaser's obligation to accept for payment Shares, shall
not be satisfied or waived or (ii) extend the Offer for any period required by
any rule, regulation or interpretation of the Commission, or the staff thereof,
applicable to the Offer. The Merger Agreement also provides that, if, on the
initial scheduled expiration date of the Offer, the sole condition remaining
unsatisfied is the failure of the waiting period under the HSR Act to have
expired or been terminated, then Purchaser shall extend the Offer from time to
time until the earlier to occur of (i) December 31, 2001 and (ii) the fifth
business day after the public announcement of the expiration or termination of
the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act.

     If certain of the conditions to the Offer shall not have been satisfied,
and in Parent and Purchaser's sole judgment are reasonably capable of being
satisfied within 30 days, Parent will, at the request of the Company, extend the
Offer from time to time unless any such condition is no longer reasonably
capable of being satisfied within such 30 day period in Parent and Purchaser's
sole judgment. In no event will Purchaser be required to extend the Offer beyond
December 31, 2001.

     During any such extension, all Shares previously tendered and not withdrawn
will remain subject to the Offer and subject to the right of a tendering holder
of Shares to withdraw such holder's Shares. See Section 4. Under no
circumstances will interest be paid on the purchase price for tendered Shares,
whether or not the Offer is extended. Any extension of the Offer may be effected
by Purchaser giving oral or written notice of such extension to the Depositary.

     Purchaser shall pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
promptly following the acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer.
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence and subject to the applicable
rules of the Commission and the terms and conditions of the Offer and the Merger
Agreement, Purchaser also expressly reserves the right (i) to extend or
terminate the Offer and not to accept for payment or pay for any Shares not
theretofore accepted for payment or paid for, upon the occurrence of any of the
conditions to the Offer specified in Section 14 and (ii) to amend the Offer or
to waive any conditions to the Offer in any respect consistent with the
provisions of the Merger Agreement described above, in each case by giving oral
or written notice of such delay, termination, waiver or amendment to the
Depositary and by making public announcement thereof.

     Any such extension, delay, termination, waiver or amendment will be
followed as promptly as practicable by public announcement thereof, such
announcement in the case of an extension to be made no later than 9:00 a.m., New
York City time, on the next business day after the previously scheduled
Expiration Date. Subject to applicable law (including Rules 14d-4(c), 14d-6(d)
and 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the "Exchange
Act"), which require that material changes be promptly disseminated to holders
of Shares in a manner reasonably designed to inform them of such changes) and
without limiting the manner in which Purchaser may choose to make any public
announcement, Purchaser will have no obligation

to publish, advertise or otherwise communicate any such public announcement
other than by issuing a press release to the Dow Jones News Service or the
Public Relations Newswire.

     If Purchaser makes a material change in the terms of the Offer or the
information concerning the Offer, or if it waives a material condition of the
Offer, Purchaser will extend the Offer to the extent required by Rules l4d-4(c),
l4d-6(d) and 14e-1 under the Exchange Act.

     Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, if, prior to the Expiration
Date, Purchaser should decide to decrease the number of Shares being sought or
to increase or decrease the consideration being offered in the Offer, such
decrease in the number of Shares being sought or such increase or in the
consideration being offered will be applicable to all holders of Shares whose
Shares are accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer and, if at the time notice
of any such decrease in the number of Shares being sought or such increase or
decrease in the consideration being offered is first published, sent or given to
holders of such Shares, the Offer is scheduled to expire at any time earlier
than the period ending on the tenth business day from and including the date
that such notice is first so published, sent or given, the Offer will be
extended at least until the expiration of such ten business day period.

     Subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission,
Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, elect to extend the Offer beyond the
Expiration Date for a subsequent offering period of between three business days
and 20 business days (the "Subsequent Offering Period"), if, among other things,
upon the Expiration Date (i) all of the conditions to Purchaser's obligations to
accept for payment, and to pay for, the Shares are satisfied or waived and (ii)
Purchaser immediately accepts for payment, and promptly pays for, all Shares
validly tendered (and not withdrawn in accordance with the procedures set forth
in Section 4) prior to the Expiration Date. SHARES TENDERED DURING THE
SUBSEQUENT OFFERING PERIOD MAY NOT BE WITHDRAWN. See Section 4. Purchaser will
immediately accept for payment, and promptly pay for, all validly tendered
Shares as they are received during the Subsequent Offering Period. Any election
by Purchaser to include a Subsequent Offering Period may be effected by
Purchaser giving oral or written notice of the Subsequent Offering Period to the
Depositary. If Purchaser decides to include a Subsequent Offering Period, it
will make an announcement to that effect by issuing a press release to the Dow
Jones News Service or the Public Relations Newswire no later than 9:00 a.m., New
York City time, on the next business day after the Expiration Date.

     For purposes of the Offer, a "business day" means any day on which the
principal offices of the Commission in Washington, D.C. are open to accept
filings, or, in the case of determining a date when any payment is due, any day
on which banks are not required or authorized to close in The City of New York,
and consists of the time period from 12:01 a.m. through 12:00 midnight, New York
City time.

     The Company has provided Purchaser with the Company's stockholder list and
security position listings, including the most recent list of names, addresses
and security positions of non-objecting beneficial owners in the possession of
the Company, for the purpose of disseminating the Offer to holders of Shares.
This Offer to Purchase and the related Letter of Transmittal will be mailed by
Purchaser to record holders of Shares whose names appear on the Company's
stockholder list and will be furnished, for subsequent transmittal to beneficial
owners of Shares, to brokers, dealers, commercial banks, trust companies and
similar persons whose names, or the names of whose nominees, appear on the
stockholder list or, if applicable, who are listed as participants in a clearing
agency's security position listing.

2. ACCEPTANCE FOR PAYMENT AND PAYMENT FOR SHARES.

     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer (including, if
the Offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of any such extension
or amendment), Purchaser will accept promptly for payment all Shares validly
tendered (and not properly withdrawn in accordance with Section 4) prior to the
Expiration Date. Purchaser shall pay for all Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn promptly following the acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to
the Offer. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence and subject to
applicable rules and regulations of the Commission and the terms of the Merger
Agreement, Purchaser expressly reserves the right to delay payment for Shares in
order to comply in whole or in part with applicable laws. See Sections 1 and 15.
If Purchaser decides to include a Subsequent Offering Period, Purchaser will

accept for payment, and promptly pay for, all validly tendered Shares as they
are received during the Subsequent Offering Period. See Section 1.

     In all cases (including during any Subsequent Offering Period), payment for
Shares tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer will be made only
after timely receipt by the Depositary of (i) the certificates evidencing such
Shares (the "Share Certificates") or timely confirmation (a "Book-Entry
Confirmation") of a book-entry transfer of such Shares into the Depositary's
account at The Depository Trust Company (the "Book-Entry Transfer Facility")
pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 3, (ii) the Letter of
Transmittal (or a manually signed facsimile thereof), properly completed and
duly executed, with any required signature guarantees or an Agent's Message (as
defined below), in connection with the book-entry transfer and (iii) any other
documents required under the Letter of Transmittal. The term "Agent's Message"
means a message, transmitted by the Book-Entry Transfer Facility to, and
received by, the Depositary and forming a part of the Book-Entry Confirmation
which states that the Book-Entry Transfer Facility has received an express
acknowledgment from the participant in the Book-Entry Transfer Facility
tendering the Shares that are the subject of such Book-Entry Confirmation, that
such participant has received and agrees to be bound by the Letter of
Transmittal and that Purchaser may enforce such agreement against such
participant.

     For purposes of the Offer (including during any Subsequent Offering
Period), Purchaser will be deemed to have accepted for payment (and thereby
purchased) Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn as, if and when
Purchaser gives oral or written notice to the Depositary of Purchaser's
acceptance for payment of such Shares pursuant to the Offer. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Offer, payment for Shares accepted for payment
pursuant to the Offer will be made by deposit of the purchase price therefor
with the Depositary, which will act as agent for tendering holders of Shares for
the purpose of receiving payments from Purchaser and transmitting such payments
to tendering holders of Shares whose Shares have been accepted for payment.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL INTEREST ON THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR SHARES BE PAID,
REGARDLESS OF ANY DELAY IN MAKING SUCH PAYMENT.

     If any tendered Shares are not accepted for payment for any reason pursuant
to the terms and conditions of the Offer, or if Share Certificates are submitted
evidencing more Shares than are tendered, Share Certificates evidencing
unpurchased Shares will be returned without expense to the tendering stockholder
(or, in the case of Shares tendered by book-entry transfer into the Depositary's
account at a Book-Entry Transfer Facility pursuant to the procedure set forth in
Section 3, such Shares will be credited to an account maintained at such
Book-Entry Transfer Facility), as promptly as practicable following the
expiration or termination of the Offer.

     Purchaser reserves the right to transfer or assign, in whole or from time
to time in part, to one or more of its affiliates, the right to purchase all or
any portion of the Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, but any such transfer
or assignment will not relieve Purchaser of its obligations under the Offer and
will in no way prejudice the rights of tendering holders of Shares to receive
payment for Shares validly tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the
Offer.

3. PROCEDURES FOR ACCEPTING THE OFFER AND TENDERING SHARES.

     Valid Tender of Securities.  In order for a holder of Shares to tender
Shares validly pursuant to the Offer, the Letter of Transmittal (or a manually
signed facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed, together with
any required signature guarantees or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an
Agent's Message, and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal,
must be received by the Depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the back
cover of this Offer to Purchase and either (i) the Share Certificates evidencing
tendered Shares must be received by the Depositary at such address or such
Shares must be tendered pursuant to the procedure for book-entry transfer
described below and a Book-Entry Confirmation must be received by the Depositary
(including an Agent's Message if the tendering stockholder has not delivered a
Letter of Transmittal), in each case prior to the Expiration Date, or (ii) the
tendering stockholder must comply with the guaranteed delivery procedures
described below.

     THE METHOD OF DELIVERY OF SHARE CERTIFICATES AND ALL OTHER REQUIRED
DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING DELIVERY THROUGH THE BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER FACILITY, IS AT
THE OPTION AND RISK OF THE TENDERING STOCKHOLDER, AND THE DELIVERY WILL BE
DEEMED MADE ONLY WHEN ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY. IF DELIVERY IS BY
MAIL, REGISTERED MAIL WITH RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, PROPERLY INSURED, IS
RECOMMENDED. IN ALL CASES, SUFFICIENT TIME SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO ENSURE TIMELY
DELIVERY.

     Book-Entry Transfer.  The Depositary will establish accounts with respect
to the Shares at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility for purposes of the Offer
within two business days after the date of this Offer to Purchase. Any financial
institution that is a participant in the system of the Book-Entry Transfer
Facility may make a book-entry delivery of Shares by causing the Book-Entry
Transfer Facility to transfer such Shares into the Depositary's account at the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility in accordance with the Book-Entry Transfer
Facility's procedures for such transfer. However, although delivery of Shares
may be effected through book-entry transfer at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility,
the Letter of Transmittal (or a manually signed facsimile thereof), properly
completed and duly executed, together with any required signature guarantees, or
an Agent's Message, and any other required documents, must, in any case, be
received by the Depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the back cover
of this Offer to Purchase prior to the Expiration Date, or the tendering
stockholder must comply with the guaranteed delivery procedure described below.
DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS TO THE BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER FACILITY DOES NOT CONSTITUTE
DELIVERY TO THE DEPOSITARY.

     Signature Guarantees.  Signatures on all Letters of Transmittal must be
guaranteed by a firm which is a member of the Security Transfer Agent Medallion
Signature Program, or by any other "eligible guarantor institution," as such
term is defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act (each of the foregoing
being referred to as an "Eligible Institution"), except in cases where Shares
are tendered (i) by a registered holder of Shares who has not completed either
the box entitled "Special Payment Instructions" or the box entitled "Special
Delivery Instructions" on the Letter of Transmittal or (ii) for the account of
an Eligible Institution. If a Share Certificate is registered in the name of a
person other than the signer of the Letter of Transmittal, or if payment is to
be made, or a Share Certificate not accepted for payment or not tendered is to
be returned, to a person other than the registered holder(s), then the Share
Certificate must be endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in
either case signed exactly as the name(s) of the registered holder(s) appear on
the Share Certificate, with the signature(s) on such Share Certificate or stock
powers guaranteed by an Eligible Institution. See Instructions 1 and 5 of the
Letter of Transmittal.

     Guaranteed Delivery.  If a stockholder desires to tender Shares pursuant to
the Offer and such stockholder's Share Certificates evidencing such Shares are
not immediately available or such stockholder cannot deliver the Share
Certificates and all other required documents to the Depositary prior to the
Expiration Date, or such holder of Shares cannot complete the procedure for
delivery by book-entry transfer on a timely basis, such Shares may nevertheless
be tendered, provided that all the following conditions are satisfied:

     - such tender is made by or through an Eligible Institution;

     - a properly completed and duly executed Notice of Guaranteed Delivery,
       substantially in the form made available by Purchaser, is received prior
       to the Expiration Date by the Depositary as provided below; and

     - the Share Certificates (or a Book-Entry Confirmation) evidencing all
       tendered Shares, in proper form for transfer, in each case together with
       the Letter of Transmittal (or a manually signed facsimile thereof),
       properly completed and duly executed, with any required signature
       guarantees or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an Agent's Message,
       and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal are
       received by the Depositary within three Nasdaq National Market ("Nasdaq")
       trading days after the date of execution of such Notice of Guaranteed
       Delivery.

     The Notice of Guaranteed Delivery may be delivered by hand or mail or by
facsimile transmission to the Depositary and must include a guarantee by an
Eligible Institution in the form set forth in the form of Notice of Guaranteed
Delivery made available by Purchaser. The procedures for guaranteed delivery
specified above may not be used during any Subsequent Offering Period.

     In all cases (including during any Subsequent Offering Period), payment for
Shares tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer will be made only
after timely receipt by the Depositary of (i) the Share Certificates evidencing
such Shares, or a Book-Entry Confirmation of the delivery of such Shares, and
(ii) the Letter of Transmittal (or a manually signed facsimile thereof),
properly completed and duly executed, with any required signature guarantees or,
in the case of a book-entry transfer, an Agent's Message, and any other
documents required by the Letter of Transmittal.

     Determination of Validity.  ALL QUESTIONS AS TO THE FORM OF DOCUMENTS AND
THE VALIDITY, FORM, ELIGIBILITY (INCLUDING TIME OF RECEIPT) AND ACCEPTANCE FOR
PAYMENT OF ANY TENDER OF SHARES WILL BE DETERMINED BY PURCHASER, IN ITS SOLE
DISCRETION, WHICH DETERMINATION SHALL BE FINAL AND BINDING ON ALL PARTIES.
Purchaser reserves the absolute right to reject any and all tenders determined
by it not to be in proper form or the acceptance for payment of which may, in
the opinion of its counsel, be unlawful. Purchaser also reserves the absolute
right to waive any condition of the Offer to the extent permitted by applicable
law and the Merger Agreement or any defect or irregularity in the tender of any
Shares of any particular stockholder, whether or not similar defects or
irregularities are waived in the case of other holders of Shares. NO TENDER OF
SHARES WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN VALIDLY MADE UNTIL ALL DEFECTS AND
IRREGULARITIES HAVE BEEN CURED OR WAIVED. NONE OF PURCHASER, PARENT OR ANY OF
THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES OR ASSIGNS, THE DEPOSITARY, THE INFORMATION AGENT OR
ANY OTHER PERSON WILL BE UNDER ANY DUTY TO GIVE NOTIFICATION OF ANY DEFECTS OR
IRREGULARITIES IN TENDERS OR INCUR ANY LIABILITY FOR FAILURE TO GIVE ANY SUCH
NOTIFICATION. Purchaser's interpretation of the terms and conditions of the
Offer (including the Letter of Transmittal and the instructions thereto) will be
final and binding.

     A tender of Shares pursuant to any of the procedures described above will
constitute the tendering stockholder's acceptance of the terms and conditions of
the Offer, as well as the tendering stockholder's representation and warranty to
Purchaser that (i) such stockholder has the full power and authority to tender,
sell, assign and transfer the tendered Shares (and any and all other Shares or
other securities issued or issuable in respect of such Shares), and (ii) when
the same are accepted for payment by Purchaser, Purchaser will acquire good and
unencumbered title thereto, free and clear of all liens, restrictions, charges
and encumbrances and not subject to any adverse claims.

     The acceptance for payment by Purchaser of Shares pursuant to any of the
procedures described above will constitute a binding agreement between the
tendering stockholder and Purchaser upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of the Offer.

     Appointment as Proxy.  By executing the Letter of Transmittal as set forth
above, a tendering stockholder irrevocably appoints designees of Purchaser as
such stockholder's agents, attorneys-in-fact and proxies, each with full power
of substitution, in the manner set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, to the
full extent of such stockholder's rights with respect to the Shares tendered by
such stockholder and accepted for payment by Purchaser (and with respect to any
and all other Shares or other securities issued or issuable in respect of such
Shares on or after June 28, 2001). All such powers of attorney and proxies shall
be considered irrevocable and coupled with an interest in the tendered Shares.
Such appointment will be effective when, and only to the extent that, Purchaser
accepts such Shares for payment. Upon such acceptance for payment, all prior
powers of attorney and proxies given by such stockholder with respect to such
Shares (and such other Shares and securities) will be revoked, without further
action, and no subsequent powers of attorney or proxies may be given nor any
subsequent written consent executed by such stockholder (and, if given or
executed, will not be deemed to be effective) with respect thereto. The
designees of Purchaser will, with respect to the Shares for which the
appointment is effective, be empowered to exercise all voting and other rights
of such stockholder as they in their sole discretion may deem proper at any
annual or special meeting of the Company's stockholders or any adjournment or
postponement thereof, by written consent in lieu of any such meeting or
otherwise. Purchaser reserves the right to require that, in order for Shares to
be deemed validly tendered, immediately upon Purchaser's payment for such
Shares, Purchaser must be able to exercise full voting rights with respect to
such Shares (and such other Shares and securities).

     UNDER THE "BACKUP WITHHOLDING" PROVISIONS OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAW,
THE DEPOSITARY MAY BE REQUIRED TO WITHHOLD 31% (OR SUCH REDUCED RATE AS
APPLICABLE) OF ANY PAYMENTS OF CASH PURSUANT TO THE OFFER. TO PREVENT BACKUP
FEDERAL INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING WITH RESPECT TO PAYMENT TO HOLDERS OF SHARES OF
THE

PURCHASE PRICE OF SHARES PURCHASED PURSUANT TO THE OFFER, EACH SUCH STOCKHOLDER
MUST PROVIDE THE DEPOSITARY WITH SUCH STOCKHOLDER'S CORRECT TAXPAYER
IDENTIFICATION NUMBER AND CERTIFY THAT SUCH HOLDER OF SHARES IS NOT SUBJECT TO
BACKUP FEDERAL INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING BY COMPLETING THE SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9 IN
THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL. SEE INSTRUCTION 9 OF THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL.

4. WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS.

     Tenders of Shares made pursuant to the Offer are irrevocable except that
such Shares may be withdrawn at any time prior to the Expiration Date and,
unless theretofore accepted for payment and paid for by Purchaser pursuant to
the Offer, may also be withdrawn at any time after September 8, 2001. If
Purchaser extends the Offer, is delayed in its acceptance for payment of Shares
or is unable to accept Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer for any reason,
then, without prejudice to Purchaser's rights under the Offer, the Depositary
may, nevertheless, on behalf of Purchaser, retain tendered Shares, and such
Shares may not be withdrawn except to the extent that tendering holders of
Shares are entitled to withdrawal rights as described in this Section 4, subject
to Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act. Any such delay will be by an extension
of the Offer to the extent required by law. If Purchaser decides to include a
Subsequent Offering Period, Shares tendered during the Subsequent Offering
Period may not be withdrawn. See Section 1.

     For a withdrawal to be effective, a written or facsimile transmission
notice of withdrawal must be timely received by the Depositary at one of its
addresses set forth on the back cover page of this Offer to Purchase. Any such
notice of withdrawal must specify the name of the person who tendered the Shares
to be withdrawn, the number of Shares to be withdrawn and the name of the
registered holder of such Shares, if different from that of the person who
tendered such Shares. If Share Certificates evidencing Shares to be withdrawn
have been delivered or otherwise identified to the Depositary, then, prior to
the physical release of such Share Certificates, the serial numbers shown on
such Share Certificates must be submitted to the Depositary and the signature(s)
on the notice of withdrawal must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution,
unless such Shares have been tendered for the account of an Eligible
Institution. If Shares have been tendered pursuant to the procedure for
book-entry transfer as set forth in Section 3, any notice of withdrawal must
specify the name and number of the account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility
to be credited with the withdrawn Shares.

     ALL QUESTIONS AS TO THE FORM AND VALIDITY (INCLUDING TIME OF RECEIPT) OF
ANY NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL WILL BE DETERMINED BY PURCHASER, IN ITS SOLE
DISCRETION, WHOSE DETERMINATION WILL BE FINAL AND BINDING. NONE OF PURCHASER,
PARENT OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES OR ASSIGNS, THE DEPOSITARY, THE
INFORMATION AGENT OR ANY OTHER PERSON WILL BE UNDER ANY DUTY TO GIVE ANY
NOTIFICATION OF ANY DEFECTS OR IRREGULARITIES IN ANY NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL OR
INCUR ANY LIABILITY FOR FAILURE TO GIVE ANY SUCH NOTIFICATION.

     Withdrawals of Shares may not be rescinded. Any Shares properly withdrawn
will thereafter be deemed not to have been validly tendered for purposes of the
Offer. However, withdrawn Shares may be re-tendered at any time prior to the
Expiration Date (or during the Subsequent Offering Period, if any) by following
one of the procedures described in Section 3 (except Shares may not be
re-tendered using the procedures for guaranteed delivery during any Subsequent
Offering Period).

5. CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES.

     The following is a summary of the principal federal income tax consequences
of the Offer and the Merger to holders whose Shares are purchased pursuant to
the Offer or whose Shares are converted into the right to receive cash in the
Merger (whether upon receipt of the Merger Consideration or pursuant to the
proper exercise of dissenter's rights). The discussion applies only to holders
of Shares who hold their Shares as capital assets, and may not apply to Shares
received pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as
compensation, or to holders of Shares who are not citizens or residents of the
United States of America.

     THE TAX DISCUSSION SET FORTH BELOW IS INCLUDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION
PURPOSES ONLY AND IS BASED UPON CURRENT LAW. BECAUSE INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES
MAY DIFFER, EACH HOLDER OF SHARES SHOULD CONSULT SUCH HOLDER'S OWN TAX ADVISOR
TO DETERMINE THE APPLICABILITY TO SUCH STOCKHOLDER OF THE RULES DISCUSSED AND
THE PARTICULAR TAX EFFECTS OF THE OFFER AND THE MERGER ON SUCH STOCKHOLDER,
INCLUDING THE APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF STATE, LOCAL AND OTHER TAX LAWS.

     The receipt of cash pursuant to the Offer and the receipt of cash pursuant
to the Merger (whether as Merger Consideration or pursuant to the proper
exercise of dissenter's rights) will be a taxable transaction for federal income
tax purposes (and also may be a taxable transaction under applicable state,
local and other income tax laws). In general, for federal income tax purposes, a
holder of Shares will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between
such holder's adjusted tax basis in the Shares sold pursuant to the Offer or
converted to cash in the Merger and the amount of cash received therefor. Gain
or loss must be determined separately for each block of Shares (i.e., Shares
acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) sold pursuant to the Offer or
converted to cash in the Merger. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss.
Non-corporate holders (including individuals) will be subject to tax on the net
amount of such gain at a maximum rate of 20% if the Shares were held for more
than one year. Special rules (and generally lower maximum rates) apply to
non-corporate taxpayers in lower tax brackets. The deductibility of capital
losses is subject to certain limitations. Holders of Shares should consult their
own tax advisors in this regard.

     Payments in connection with the Offer or the Merger may be subject to
backup withholding at a 31% rate (or such reduced rate as applicable). Backup
withholding generally applies if a stockholder (i) fails to furnish such
stockholder's social security number or taxpayer identification number ("TIN"),
(ii) furnishes an incorrect TIN, (iii) fails properly to report interest or
dividends or (iv) under certain circumstances, fails to provide a certified
statement, signed under penalties of perjury, that the TIN provided is such
stockholder's correct number and that such stockholder is not subject to backup
withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax but merely an advance
payment, which may be refunded to the extent it results in an overpayment of
tax. Certain persons, including corporations and financial institutions
generally, are exempt from backup withholding. Certain penalties apply for
failure to furnish correct information and for failure to include the reportable
payments in income. Each stockholder should consult with such stockholder's own
tax advisor as to such stockholder's qualifications for exemption from
withholding and the procedure for obtaining such exemption.

10. BACKGROUND OF THE OFFER; CONTACTS WITH THE COMPANY; THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND
RELATED AGREEMENTS.

     On an ongoing basis, management of Parent identifies candidates for
acquisitions, business combinations or strategic alliances in order to further
its strategic plan and strengthen its existing core businesses.

     As part of the foregoing, from April 1999 to June 1999, Parent and Cardiac
Pathways conducted preliminary discussions and negotiations regarding a
potential business combination transaction. In June 1999 these discussions
terminated as a result of the parties' inability to agree on the terms of a
transaction.

     In early October 2000, a representative of Parent contacted a
representative of Cardiac Pathways to express Parent's interest in a potential
business combination transaction with Cardiac Pathways. During the period from
October 2000 until November 2000, the respective representatives of Parent and
Cardiac Pathways engaged in discussions with respect to a potential business
combination transaction between Parent and Cardiac Pathways. In connection with
these discussions, on October 10, 2000, Parent and Cardiac Pathways entered into
a confidentiality agreement, and Parent and its legal advisors conducted a
preliminary due diligence investigation of Cardiac Pathways. In November 2000
these discussions terminated as a result of the parties' inability to agree on
the terms of a transaction.

     On April 19, 2001, a representative of Dain Rauscher contacted David Milne,
Director -- New Business Development of Parent, to discuss a potential business
combination transaction between Parent and Cardiac Pathways.

     On May 1, 2001, Lawrence Best, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer of Parent, and Thomas Coen, President of EP Technologies (a division of
Parent) and Mr. Milne met in Natick, Massachusetts with Thomas Prescott,
President and Chief Executive Officer of Cardiac Pathways, Eldon Bullington,
Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer of Cardiac Pathways and
other representatives of Cardiac Pathways and a representative of Dain Rauscher.
At that meeting, representatives of Cardiac Pathways presented the business plan
and existing technology platforms of Cardiac Pathways and gave a financial
overview of Cardiac Pathways.

     During the period from May 15 through June 6, 2001, representatives of
Parent engaged in further discussions by telephone conference call with
representatives of Cardiac Pathways regarding a proposed business combination
transaction between Parent and Cardiac Pathways.

     On May 18, 2001, Parent delivered an initial draft letter setting forth
Parent's preliminary non-binding expression of interest in purchasing all the
fully diluted equity interests of Cardiac Pathways.

     Between May 23 and June 6, 2001, the parties and their advisors continued
to negotiate the terms on which Cardiac Pathways would be prepared to proceed
with a business combination transaction with Parent.

     On June 6, 2001, Mr. Best, on behalf of Parent, and Mr. Prescott, on behalf
of Cardiac Pathways, executed a letter setting forth Parent's preliminary
non-binding expression of interest in purchasing all the fully diluted equity
interests of Cardiac Pathways for $115 million in cash, and containing the
agreement of Cardiac Pathways to negotiate exclusively with Parent regarding the
proposed acquisition until June 30, 2001.

     Between June 6 and June 15, 2001, representatives of Parent and Cardiac
Pathways, together with their outside respective legal counsel, Shearman &
Sterling and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation
("WSGR"), participated in several telephone calls regarding the structure of the
proposed transaction.

     On June 12 and June 13, 2001, representatives of Parent and representatives
of Shearman & Sterling conducted legal due diligence at a data room at the
offices of WSGR in Palo Alto, CA. On the same dates, James Taylor, Senior Vice
President -- Corporate Operations of Parent, Robert MacLain, Senior Vice
President -- Human Resources of Parent, Vance Brown, Corporate Counsel of Parent
and Messrs. Coen and Milne met at WSGR's offices in Palo Alto, CA with Messrs.
Prescott and Bullington as well as additional members of Cardiac Pathways'
management team to conduct business and operational due diligence, which
included an on-site technology demonstration at Cardiac Pathways' Sunnyvale, CA
facility. Representatives of Parent and Shearman & Sterling continued their due
diligence investigation over the next few weeks.

     On June 15, 2001, Shearman & Sterling delivered drafts of the Merger
Agreement and the Stockholder Agreements to Cardiac Pathways, WSGR and Dain
Rauscher.

     On June 20, 2001, Messrs. Best, Milne, Knopf and Brown and representatives
of Shearman & Sterling met in the New York offices of Shearman & Sterling with
Messrs. Prescott and Bullington and representatives of WSGR and Dain Rauscher to
negotiate the terms of the proposed transaction, including the terms of the
Merger Agreement and Parent's requirement that stockholders of Cardiac Pathways
holding more than a majority of the outstanding voting securities of Cardiac
Pathways enter into Stockholder Agreements with Parent.

     On June 22, 2001, copies of the Merger Agreement and the Stock Purchase
Agreement were forwarded on a confidential basis to Davis Polk & Wardwell,
outside legal counsel to Cardiac Pathways' stockholders affiliated with Morgan
Stanley and Bank of America Ventures.

     On June 25, 2001, Mr. Bullington and representatives of WSGR contacted
representatives of Van Wagoner Capital Management, Cardiac Pathways' largest
single stockholder, on a confidential basis to seek its support of the
transaction. Copies of the Stockholder Agreement and the Merger Agreement were
forwarded to its outside legal counsel, Shartsis, Friese & Ginsburg LLP.

     From June 22 through June 28, 2001, representatives of Cardiac Pathways and
WSGR continued to negotiate the terms of the Merger Agreement and the
Stockholder Agreements with representatives of Parent and Shearman & Sterling by
telephone conference call. A representative of Davis Polk & Wardwell
participated in the negotiations regarding the Stock Purchase Agreement on
behalf of Cardiac Pathways' stockholders affiliated with Morgan Stanley and Bank
of America Ventures and a representative of Shartsis, Friese & Ginsburg LLP
participated in the negotiations regarding the Stockholder Agreement on behalf
of Van Wagoner.

     On June 27, 2001, the Parent board of directors met telephonically. After
discussion, which included updates on the financial and legal aspects of the
proposed transaction from members of the senior management of Parent, the Parent
board of directors unanimously approved the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, the Stock Purchase Agreement and the Stockholder Support
Agreements, and approved the forms of such agreements.

     On the evening of June 27, 2001, Cardiac Pathways' Board met at WSGR's Palo
Alto, CA office (with a certain director participating by telephone) regarding
the status of the discussions with Parent. Representatives of WSGR and Dain
Rauscher participated in the meeting. Dain Rauscher reviewed with the Board its
financial analysis of the proposed transaction and advised the Board that it
would be in a position to deliver its opinion as to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the Per Share Price to the holders of Shares if
asked to do so. Mr. Prescott and representatives of WSGR provided the Board with
an update on the progress of the discussions with Parent. Representatives of
WSGR updated the Board on the open issues to be negotiated and advised the Board
of its fiduciary obligations in considering the transaction. After extensive
discussion, the Board advised management and WSGR as to its positions on the
various open issues, instructed them to continue negotiating such points and to
report back to the Board at a special meeting to be held on June 28, 2001.

     On the morning of June 28, 2001, Messrs. Knopf, Brown, Prescott and
Bullington, as well as representatives of Shearman & Sterling and WSGR,
negotiated the remaining open issues. Counsel for Cardiac Pathways stockholders
affiliated with Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Ventures and for Van Wagoner
participated in the negotiation of the remaining open issues with respect to the
Stockholder Agreements.

     Later on the morning of June 28, 2001, Cardiac Pathways' Board convened a
special telephonic meeting with its legal and financial advisors. During this
meeting, management and WSGR provided the Board with an update on the status of
the discussions with Parent. After discussion, Cardiac Pathways' Board
unanimously (a) determined that the Merger Agreement and the Transactions are
fair to, and in the best interests of, the holders of Shares, (b) approved,
adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, and
(c) resolved to recommend that the holders of Shares accept the Offer, tender
their Shares pursuant thereto and, if applicable, vote to adopt the Merger
Agreement. Dain Rauscher delivered to the Board its oral

opinion (which was confirmed in writing later that evening) that, as of that
date, the Per Share Price is fair, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of Shares.

     Several conference calls were conducted throughout the day and evening of
June 28, 2001 among Messrs. Best, Knopf, Brown, Prescott and Bullington, as well
as representatives of Shearman & Sterling and WSGR, during which the final
issues regarding drafting of the Merger Agreement and Stockholder Agreements
were resolved.

     On the evening of June 28, 2001, Parent and Cardiac Pathways executed the
Merger Agreement. Contemporaneously with the execution of the Merger Agreement,
Parent and the respective other parties thereto executed the Stock Purchase
Agreement and the Stockholder Support Agreements.

     On the morning of June 29, 2001, Parent and Cardiac Pathways issued a joint
press release announcing the execution of the Merger Agreement on June 28, 2001.
A joint conference call was also held on the afternoon of June 29, 2001 to

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.
THIS SUMMARY IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT,
WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE, AND A COPY OF WHICH HAS BEEN FILED AS
AN EXHIBIT TO THE TENDER OFFER STATEMENT ON SCHEDULE TO (THE "SCHEDULE TO")
FILED BY PURCHASER AND PARENT WITH THE COMMISSION IN CONNECTION WITH THE OFFER.
THE MERGER AGREEMENT MAY BE EXAMINED AND COPIES MAY BE OBTAINED AT THE PLACES
SET FORTH IN SECTION 7. DEFINED TERMS USED HEREIN AND NOT DEFINED HEREIN SHALL
HAVE THE RESPECTIVE MEANINGS ASSIGNED TO THOSE TERMS IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

     The Offer.  The Merger Agreement provides for the commencement of the Offer
as promptly as reasonably practicable, but, subject to certain exceptions, in no
event later than seven business days after the initial public announcement of
Purchaser's intention to commence the Offer. The obligation of Purchaser to
accept for payment Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer is subject to the
satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the HSR Condition and certain other
conditions that are described in Section 14 hereof. Purchaser and Parent have
agreed that no change in the Offer may be made which decreases the price per
Share payable in the Offer, which reduces the maximum number of Shares to be
purchased in the Offer, changes the form of consideration to be paid in the
Offer, amends any other terms of the Offer in a manner adverse to the holders of
Shares, or which imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth
in Section 14 hereof.

     The Merger.  The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions thereof, and in accordance with Delaware Law, Purchaser shall
be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Purchaser will cease and the Company will continue as the
Surviving Corporation and will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Upon
consummation of the Merger, each issued and then outstanding Share (other than
any Shares held in the treasury of the Company, or owned by Purchaser, Parent or
any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or of the Company and
any Shares which are held by holders of Shares who have not voted in favor of
the Merger and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such
Shares in accordance with Delaware Law) shall be canceled and converted
automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable,
without interest, to the holder of such Share.

     Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each Series B Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
converted automatically into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the
liquidation preference set forth in section 6(a) of the Certificate of
Designation plus the Merger Consideration (calculated as though each Series B
Shares had been converted into Shares in accordance with the Certificate of
Designation), in each case without interest, to the holder of such Series B
Share.

     The Merger Agreement provides that the directors of Purchaser immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation and that the officers of Purchaser immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation.
Subject to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Certificate of
Incorporation of Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the

Effective Time, will be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation. Subject to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, the By-laws
of Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be the
By-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

     Stockholder's Meeting.  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company
shall, if required by applicable law in order to consummate the Merger, (i) duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold an annual or special meeting of its
stockholders as promptly as practicable following the purchase by Purchaser of
Shares pursuant to the Offer, or, if the Offer shall have been terminated,
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Stockholder Agreements that
would result in Parent or Purchaser acquiring a majority of the voting
securities of the Company on a fully diluted basis, for the purpose of
considering and taking action on the Merger Agreement (the "Stockholder's
Meeting"), and (ii) (A) subject to the exceptions provided in the Merger
Agreement, include in the Proxy Statement, and not subsequently withdraw, amend,
change or modify in any manner adverse to Purchaser or Parent, the
recommendation of the Board that the stockholders of the Company adopt the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and (B) use its best
efforts to obtain such adoption. If Purchaser acquires at least a majority
(after giving effect to the assumed purchase of the Series B Shares pursuant to
the Stock Purchase Agreement as though such purchase had already occurred) of
the outstanding Shares on an "as-converted" basis, Purchaser will have
sufficient voting power to approve the Merger, even if no other stockholder
votes in favor of the Merger. UPON CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THE STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENTS, PARENT AND PURCHASER, BY VIRTUE OF THE
ACQUISITION OF APPROXIMATELY 68% OF THE OUTSTANDING VOTING SECURITIES OF THE
COMPANY, WILL OWN A NUMBER OF SHARES AND SERIES B SHARES SUFFICIENT, EVEN IF NO
OTHER SHARES ARE TENDERED IN THE OFFER, TO CAUSE THE MERGER TO OCCUR WITHOUT THE
AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF ANY OTHER STOCKHOLDER OF THE COMPANY. SEE SECTION 11.

     Proxy Statement.  The Merger Agreement provides that the Company shall, if
approval of the Company's stockholders is required by applicable law to
consummate the Merger, promptly following the purchase by Purchaser of Shares
pursuant to the Offer, or, if the Offer shall have been terminated, consummation
of the transactions contemplated by the Stockholder Agreements that would result
in Parent or Purchaser acquiring a majority of the voting securities of the
Company on a fully diluted basis, file with the Commission under the Exchange
Act, and use its best efforts to have cleared by the Commission promptly, a
proxy statement and related proxy materials (the "Proxy Statement") with respect
to the Stockholders' Meeting and shall cause the Proxy Statement and all
required amendments and supplements thereto to be mailed to stockholders of the
Company at the earliest practicable time. The Company has agreed, subject to the
exceptions provided in the Merger Agreement, to include in the Proxy Statement,
and not subsequently withdraw, amend, change or modify in any manner adverse to
Purchaser or Parent, the recommendation of the Board that the stockholders of
the Company adopt the Merger Agreement. Parent and Purchaser have agreed to
cause all Shares then owned by them and their subsidiaries to be voted in favor
of adoption of the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides that, in the
event that Purchaser shall acquire at least 90% of each of the then outstanding
Shares and Series B Shares, Purchaser and Parent will take all necessary actions
to cause the Merger to become effective, in accordance with Delaware Law, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Offer, without a meeting of the
Company's stockholders.

     Conduct of Business by the Company Pending the Merger.  Pursuant to the
Merger Agreement, the Company has agreed that, between the date of the Merger
Agreement and the Effective Time, unless Parent shall otherwise agree in writing
(or except as expressly contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the schedules
thereto), the businesses of the Company and its subsidiaries (the "Subsidiaries"
and, individually, a "Subsidiary") shall be conducted only in, and the Company
and the Subsidiaries shall not take any action except in, the ordinary course of
business and in a manner consistent with past practice; and the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to preserve substantially intact the business
organization of the Company and the Subsidiaries, to keep available the services
of the current officers, employees and consultants of the Company and the
Subsidiaries and to preserve the current relationships of the Company and the
Subsidiaries with customers, suppliers and other persons with which the Company
or any Subsidiary has significant business relations. The Merger Agreement
provides that, by way of amplification and not limitation, except as
contemplated therein, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall, between the
date of the Merger

Agreement and the Effective Time, directly or indirectly, do, or propose to do,
any of the following, without the prior written consent of Parent:

          (a) amend or otherwise change its Restated Certificate of
     Incorporation or By-laws or equivalent organizational documents;

          (b) issue, sell, pledge, dispose of, grant, encumber, or authorize the

     options, warrants, convertible securities or other rights of any kind to
     acquire any shares of such capital stock, or any other ownership interest
     (including, without limitation, any phantom interest), of the Company or
     any Subsidiary (except for the securities issuable pursuant to outstanding
     Company options and warrants or pursuant to the Company's employee stock
     purchase plan) or (ii) any assets of the Company or any Subsidiary, except
     in the ordinary course of business and in a manner consistent with past
     practice;

          (c) declare, set aside, make or pay any dividend or other

     combination) any corporation, partnership, other business organization or
     any division thereof or any significant amount of assets; (ii) incur any
     indebtedness for borrowed money or issue any debt securities or assume,
     guarantee or endorse, or otherwise become responsible for, the obligations
     of any person, or make any loans or advances, or grant any security
     interest in any of its assets, except, in each case, in the ordinary course
     of business and consistent with past practice; (iii) enter into any
     contract or agreement that would be a Material Contract (as defined in the
     Merger Agreement), (iv) enter into any distribution or manufacturing
     contract or agreement, other than contracts or agreements (including
     intellectual property contracts) entered into in the ordinary course of
     business and consistent with past practice; (v) authorize, or make any
     commitment with respect to, any capital expenditure in any manner not
     reflected in the capital budget of the Company; or (vi) enter into or amend

     any matter set forth in the relevant section of the Merger Agreement;

          (f) take any action that would have the effect, directly or
     indirectly, of causing the amount of cash and cash equivalents (as such
     term is defined under GAAP) held by the Company and the Subsidiaries (i) to
     be less than $15.0 million on a consolidated basis at any time up to and

     entitled to pay documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of the Company
     incurred in connection with the Transactions up to the aggregate amount of
     $2.5 million; and provided further, however, that the Company shall be
     entitled to pay additional reasonable documented out-of-pocket fees and
     expenses of the Company incurred in connection with causing the waiting
     period under the HSR Act to expire or be terminated (including any required
     filings and complying with any extension of any such waiting period) or any
     litigation resulting from or relating to the approval of, or the entering
     into, or compliance with the terms of, or the taking of any action required
     by, the Merger Agreement, and such payments shall in either case be deemed
     included in the amount of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company and

     obligation (absolute, accrued, asserted or unasserted, contingent or
     otherwise), other than the payment, discharge or satisfaction of any such
     liabilities in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
     practice;

          (k) amend, modify or consent to the termination of any Material
     Contract (as defined in the Merger Agreement), or amend, waive, modify or
     consent to the termination of the Company's or any Subsidiary's material
     rights thereunder, other than in the ordinary course of business and
     consistent with past practice;

          (l) commence or settle any litigation, suit, claim, action, proceeding
     or investigation; or

          (m) announce an intention, enter into any formal or informal agreement
     or otherwise make a commitment, to do anything set forth in paragraphs (a)
     through (l) above.

     Company Board Representation.  The Merger Agreement provides that, promptly
upon the purchase by Purchaser of Shares pursuant to the Offer, and from time to
time thereafter, Purchaser shall be entitled to designate up to such number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Board as shall give
Purchaser representation on the Board equal to the product of the total number
of directors on the Board (giving effect to the directors elected pursuant to
this sentence), multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of Shares
and Series B Shares beneficially owned by Purchaser or any affiliate of
Purchaser following such purchase bears to the total number of Shares then
outstanding on an "as-converted" basis, and the Company shall, at such time,
promptly take all actions necessary to cause Purchaser's designees to be elected
as directors of the Company, including increasing the size of the Board or
securing the resignations of incumbent directors (the moment of such election
being the "Appointment Time"). Prior to the date of the Merger Agreement, the
Company obtained the conditional resignations of all but two of the incumbent
directors of the Company, which conditional resignations shall automatically
become effective at the Appointment Time. The Merger Agreement also provides
that, the Company shall use its best efforts to cause persons designated by
Purchaser to constitute the same percentage as persons designated by Purchaser
shall constitute of the Board of (a) each committee of the Board, (b) each board
of directors of each Subsidiary, and (c) each committee of each such board, in
each case only to the extent permitted by applicable law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, until the Effective Time, such Board shall have at least two
directors who are directors of the Company on the date of the Merger Agreement
or such nominees of such directors and who are not officers of employees of the
Company (the "Continuing Directors").

     The Merger Agreement provides that, following the election or appointment
of Purchaser's designees in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph
and prior to the Effective Time, the affirmative vote of at least one Continuing
Director shall be required for the Company to (a) amend or terminate the Merger
Agreement or agree or consent to any amendment or termination of the Merger
Agreement, (b) amend the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the
Company in a manner that is reasonably likely to adversely affect the interests
of the holders of the Shares or Series B Shares (other than Parent or its
affiliates), (c) waive any of the Company's rights, benefits or remedies under
the Merger Agreement, (d) extend the time for performance of Parent's and
Purchasers, respective obligations under the Merger Agreement, or (e) approve
any other action by the Company which is reasonably likely to adversely affect
the interests of the holders of the Shares or the Series B Shares (other than
Parent or its affiliates).

     No Solicitation of Transactions.  Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
shall, directly or indirectly, through any officer, director, employee,
representative, agent or otherwise (collectively, the "Representatives"), (a)
solicit, initiate or take any action intended to encourage the submission of any
Acquisition Proposal (as defined below), or (b) except as required by the
fiduciary duties of the Board under applicable law after consultation with
outside legal counsel in response to unsolicited proposals, participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person, any information
(provided that prior to furnishing such information, the Company enters into a
customary, confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable to the Company
than those contained in the confidentiality agreement entered into between the
Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement") with respect to, or
otherwise cooperate in any way with respect to, or assist or participate in, or
take any action intended to facilitate or encourage, any proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal.
The Company shall, and shall direct or cause its Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any
parties that may be ongoing with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

     The Company has also agreed that neither the Board nor any committee
thereof shall (a) withhold, withdraw, amend, change or modify, or propose to
withhold, withdraw, amend, change or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or
Purchaser, the approval or recommendation by the Board or any such committee of
the Merger Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the Stockholder Agreements (the
"Transactions"), (b) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend,
any Acquisition Proposal or (c) enter into any agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, prior to
the time of acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Board
determines in good faith that it is required to do so by its fiduciary duties
under applicable law after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Board
may withhold, withdraw, amend, change or modify its approval or recommendation
of the Offer and the Merger.

     The Company has agreed to promptly advise Parent orally (within one
business day) and in writing (within two business days) of (a) any Acquisition
Proposal or any request for information with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or
request and the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal or
request and (b) any changes in any such Acquisition Proposal or request.

     Except as required by the Board's fiduciary duties under applicable law
after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Company has further agreed
not to release any third party from, or waive any provision of, any standstill
agreement or any material provision of any confidentiality agreement to which
the Company is a party.

     Notwithstanding the Company's agreements in the four preceding paragraphs
in respect of Acquisition Proposals (but subject to the other terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement), at any time on or after November 15, 2001
and prior to the Appointment Time, the Company may, upon delivery of written
notice to Purchaser, solicit, initiate, or participate in discussions or
negotiations regarding (or provide information in connection with) the
acquisition by any person or persons that is not a competitor of Parent or the
Company (as determined by Parent in its reasonable judgment) of equity
securities of the Company representing not more than 40% of the equity
securities of the Company (calculated on a fully diluted basis as though such
proposed issuance had already occurred); provided, however, that (i) the Company
shall not enter into any contract, agreement or arrangement in respect of any
such proposed equity issuance, (ii) prior to engaging in any such discussions or
negotiations, or providing any such information, the Company shall have entered
into a confidentiality agreement with such person or persons on terms no less
favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement,
and (iii) no single person or group of persons would, if the transactions
contemplated by such discussions or negotiations were consummated, acquire more
than 5% of the equity securities of the Company (calculated on a fully diluted
basis as though such proposed issuance had already occurred).

     "Acquisition Proposal" means (a) any proposal or offer from any person
other than Parent or Purchaser relating to any direct or indirect acquisition of
(i) all or a substantial part of the assets of the Company or (ii) over 15% of
any class of equity securities of the Company; (b) any tender offer or exchange
offer, as

defined pursuant to the Exchange Act, that, if consummated, would result in any
person beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company, other than the Offer; or (c) any merger, consolidation, business
combination, sale of all or a substantial part of the assets, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any
Subsidiary, other than the Transactions; or (iv) any other similar transaction
that would impede, interfere with, prevent or materially delay one or more of
the Transactions.

     Employee Stock Options and Other Employee Benefits.  The Merger Agreement
also provides that, effective as of the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all necessary action to (a) terminate the Company's 1991 Stock Option Plan, the
1996 Director Option Plan, the 1998 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan and 2000
Stock Option Plan, each as amended through the date of the Merger Agreement (the
"Company Stock Option Plans"), and (b) cancel, at the Effective Time, each
outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under the
Company Stock Option Plans (each, a "Company Stock Option") that is outstanding
and unexercised as of such date. Each holder of a Company Stock Option that is
outstanding and unexercised at the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive
from the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time, in exchange
for the cancellation of such Company Stock Option, an amount in cash equal to
the excess, if any, of (i) the Per Share Amount over (ii) the per share exercise
price of such Company Stock Option, multiplied by the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option as of the Effective
Time. Any such payment shall be subject to all applicable federal, state and
local tax withholding requirements.

     As of the last day of the payroll period immediately preceding the earlier
of the Appointment Time and November 1, 2001 (the "ESPP Date"), all offering and
purchase periods under way under the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
"ESPP"), shall be terminated and, as of the date of the Merger Agreement, no new
offering or purchase periods shall be commenced. The Company shall take all
necessary action, including providing all required notices to participants, to
ensure that the rights of participants in the ESPP with respect to any such
offering or purchase periods shall be determined by treating the ESPP Date as
the last day of such offering and purchase periods. The Company shall take all
actions as may be necessary in order to freeze the rights of the participants in
the ESPP, effective as of the date of the Merger Agreement, to existing
participants and, to the extent permissible under the ESPP, existing
participation levels. At the Appointment Time, the Company shall terminate the
ESPP.

     Subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, the Merger Agreement
provides that (a) from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor and satisfy all obligations and liabilities with
respect to all employee related contracts, agreements, arrangement, policies,
plans and commitments of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (b) Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to continue to provide employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries with benefits (including welfare benefit and excluding
equity compensation) that are substantially similar to the benefits currently
provided by the Company, provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall
not be required to provide any specific benefits that Parent does not otherwise
provide to its similarly situated employees; and (c) to the extent that service
is relevant for eligibility, vesting or allowances (including flexible time
off), but not for benefit accruals, under any plan, program or arrangement of
Purchaser and/or the Surviving Corporation, then Parent shall ensure that such
plan, program or arrangement shall credit employees for service prior to the
Effective Time with the Company and its Subsidiaries. However, Parent, Purchaser
or the Surviving Corporation retain the right under the Merger Agreement (a) to
terminate employment or change the place of work, responsibilities, status or
description of any employee or group of employees, or (b) to terminate any
employee benefit plan without establishing a replacement plan (to the extent the
Company would have had such right prior to the Effective Time), in each case in
their discretion.

     Directors' and Officers' Indemnification Insurance.  The Merger Agreement
further provides that the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the
Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification and limitation of liability for directors, officers, employees,
fiduciaries and agents than are set forth in the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws of the Company, which provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time
in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals
who, at

or prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries
or agents of the Company, unless such modification shall be required by law.

     Parent is also obligated to, and to cause the surviving corporation in the
Merger to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company
under indemnification agreements with the Company's officers and directors and
under the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Merger
Agreement also provides that Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain in effect for six years from the Effective Time, if available, the
current directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by the
Company (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are
not materially less favorable) with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time subject to certain price limitations.

     Parent, Purchaser and the Company have also agreed that in the event the
Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or
assigns (a) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (b) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, or at Parent's option, Parent, shall assume the foregoing indemnity
obligations.

     Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts.  The Merger Agreement provides
that, subject to its terms and conditions, each of the parties thereto shall (a)
make promptly its respective filings, and thereafter make any other required
submissions, under the HSR Act and applicable German antitrust laws, if any,
with respect to the Transactions and (b) use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations to consummate and make effective the Transactions, including,
without limitation, using its reasonable best efforts to obtain all Permits,
consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of Governmental
Authorities and parties to contracts with the Company and the Subsidiaries as
are necessary for the consummation of the Transactions and to fulfill the
conditions to the Offer and the Merger; provided that neither Purchaser nor
Parent will be required to take any action, including entering into any consent
decree, hold separate orders or other arrangements, that (i) requires the
divestiture of any assets of any of Purchaser, Parent, the Company or any of
their respective subsidiaries or (ii) limits Parent's freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain, the Company and the Subsidiaries or any
portion thereof or any of Parent's or its affiliates' other assets or
businesses.

     The Merger Agreement also provides that except where prohibited by
applicable law, and subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, Company and Parent
each shall promptly (a) supply the other with any information which may
reasonably be required in order to effectuate such filings and (b) supply any
additional information which reasonably may be required by antitrust,
competition or merger control authorities in any competent jurisdiction and
which the parties may reasonably deem appropriate.

     The Merger Agreement also provides that each of the parties agrees to
cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to vigorously contest and resist
any Action, including administrative or judicial Action, and to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and that
restricts, prevents or prohibits consummation of the Transactions, including,
without limitation, by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of
administrative and judicial appeal.

     Representations and Warranties.  The Merger Agreement contains various
customary representations and warranties of the parties thereto including
representations by the Company and Seller as to the absence of certain changes
or events concerning the Company's business, compliance with law, litigation,
employee benefit plans, labor matters, property and leases, intellectual
property, environmental matters, taxes, amendments to the Rights Agreement,
material contracts, insurance and brokers.

     Conditions to the Merger.  Under the Merger Agreement, the respective
obligations of each party to effect the Merger are subject to the satisfaction,
at or prior to the Effective Time, of the following conditions:

          (a) if necessary under Delaware Law, the Merger Agreement shall have
     been adopted by the affirmative vote of the stockholders of the Company;

          (b) any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the
     consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act shall have expired or been
     terminated;

          (c) no governmental authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,
     enforced or entered any law (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent)
     which is then in effect and has the effect of making the acquisition of
     Shares by Parent or Purchaser or any affiliate of either of them illegal or
     otherwise restricting, preventing or prohibiting consummation of the
     Transactions; and

          (d) Parent, Purchaser, or any affiliate or permitted assignee thereof
     shall have (i) purchased all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
     pursuant to the Offer that, together with any Shares, Series B Shares or
     warrants purchased pursuant to the Stockholder Agreements, would satisfy
     the Minimum Condition, or (ii) purchased a number of Series B Shares,
     Shares and Warrants pursuant to the Stockholder Agreements constituting a
     majority of the outstanding Shares of the Company on a fully diluted basis
     (including, without limitation, all Shares issuable upon the conversion of
     the Series B Shares or upon the exercise or conversion of any options,
     warrants, rights or other convertible securities, but excluding any
     securities that have an effective conversion or exercise price immediately
     prior to the expiration of the Offer that is in excess of the Per Share
     Amount); provided, however, that this condition shall not be applicable to
     the obligations of Parent or Purchaser if (x) in breach of the Merger
     Agreement or the terms of the Offer, Purchaser fails to purchase any Shares
     validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, or (y) in breach
     of the Stockholder Agreements, Parent or Purchaser fails to purchase any
     Series B Shares, Shares or Warrants, as applicable, thereunder.

     Termination.  The Merger Agreement provides that it may be terminated and
the Merger and the other Transactions may be abandoned, notwithstanding any
requisite adoption of the Merger Agreement by the stockholders of the Company:

          (a) at any time prior to the Effective Time, by mutual written consent
     of each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company duly authorized by the Boards
     of Directors of Parent, Purchaser and the Company; or

          (b) at any time prior to the Effective Time, by either Parent,
     Purchaser or the Company if (i) the Effective Time shall not have occurred
     on or before December 31, 2001; provided, however, that the right to
     terminate the Merger Agreement shall not be available to any party whose
     failure to fulfill any obligation under the Merger Agreement has been the
     cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or
     before such date or (ii) any Governmental Authority shall have enacted,
     issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any injunction, order, decree or
     ruling (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) which has become final
     and nonappealable and has the effect of making consummation of the Offer or
     the Merger illegal or otherwise preventing or prohibiting consummation of
     the Offer or the Merger; or

          (c) at any time prior to the Appointment Time, by Parent if due to an
     occurrence or circumstance that would result in a failure to satisfy any
     condition set forth in Conditions to the Offer annexed to the Merger
     Agreement (and as summarized in Section 14 of this Offer to Purchase),
     Purchaser shall have (i) failed to commence the Offer within 30 days
     following the date of the Merger Agreement, (ii) terminated the Offer
     without having accepted any Shares for payment thereunder or (iii) failed
     to accept Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer within 90 days following
     the commencement of the Offer (provided, however, that the applicable time
     period specified in clause (iii) shall be extended until the earlier to
     occur of (A) the fifth business day following the public announcement of
     the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the
     HSR Act and (B) December 31, 2001), unless such action or inaction under
     clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph (c) shall have been caused by
     or resulted from the failure of Parent or Purchaser to perform, in any
     material respect, any of their material covenants or agreements contained
     in the Merger Agreement, or the material breach by Parent or

     Purchaser of any of their material representations or warranties contained
     in the Merger Agreement in which case Parent may not terminate the Merger
     Agreement; or

          (d) at any time prior to the Appointment Time, by the Company, upon
     approval of the Board, if Purchaser shall have in breach of the terms of
     the Merger Agreement (i) failed to commence the Offer within 30 days
     following the date of the Merger Agreement, (ii) terminated the Offer
     without having accepted any Shares for payment thereunder or (iii) failed
     to accept Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer within 90 days following
     the commencement of the Offer (provided, however, that the applicable time
     period specified in clause (iii) shall be extended until the earlier to
     occur of (A) the fifth business day following the public announcement of
     the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the
     HSR Act and (B) December 31, 2001), unless such action or inaction under
     clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph (d) shall have been caused by
     or resulted from the failure of the Company or any of the Stockholders to
     perform, in any material respect, any of their respective material
     covenants or agreements contained in the Merger Agreement or any of the
     Stockholder Agreements or any material breach by the Company or the
     Stockholder of any of their material representations or warranties
     contained in the Merger Agreement or the Stockholder Agreements, in which
     case the Company may not terminate the Merger Agreement.

     Effect of Termination.  In the event of the termination of the Merger
Agreement, the Merger Agreement shall forthwith become void, and there shall be
no liability on the part of any party thereto, except (i) as set forth below
under the section entitled "Fees and Expenses" and (ii) nothing in the Merger
Agreement shall relieve any party from liability for any breach of a covenant
thereof prior to the date of such termination, provided, however, that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of the Merger Agreement.

     Fees and Expenses.  The Merger Agreement provides that all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement, the Stockholder
Agreements and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses, whether or not any Transaction is consummated.

THE STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENTS

     THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE STOCK PURCHASE
AGREEMENT AND THE STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO WITH THE STOCKHOLDERS.
THIS SUMMARY IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE STOCKHOLDER
AGREEMENTS, WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE, AND COPIES OR FORMS OF
WHICH HAVE BEEN FILED WITH THE COMMISSION AS AN EXHIBIT TO THE SCHEDULE TO. THE
STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENTS MAY BE EXAMINED AND COPIES MAY BE OBTAINED AT THE PLACES
SET FORTH IN SECTION 7.

  Stock Purchase Agreement

     Purchase of Shares and Warrants.  Upon the closing of the Stock Purchase
Agreement and upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained therein,
Parent agrees to purchase from the Selling Stockholders the number of Series B
Shares and warrants to purchase Series B Shares (the "Series B Warrants") held
by such Seller at the purchase price set forth next to such Selling
Stockholder's name on a schedule attached to the Stock Purchase Agreement,
subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.

     Tender of Shares.  Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement and the
Offer, each Selling Stockholder agrees to tender, pursuant to and in accordance
with the terms of the Offer, and not withdraw (except following termination of
the Offer in accordance with its terms), all of the Shares held by such Selling
Stockholder, together with any Shares subsequently acquired by such Selling
Stockholder after the date of the Stock Purchase Agreement and prior to the
consummation of the Offer.

     Irrevocable Proxy.  Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, each
Selling Stockholder irrevocably constitutes and appoints Parent and each of its
officers, from and after June 28, 2001 and until the earlier to occur of the
Closing and the termination of the Stock Purchase Agreement (at which point such
constitution and appointment will automatically be revoked), as such Selling
Stockholder's attorney, agent and proxy (such constitution and appointment, the
"Irrevocable Proxy"), with full power of substitution, to

vote such Selling Stockholder's Series B Shares and Shares, together with any
Series B Shares issued upon exercise of the Series B Warrants and any securities
acquired after the date of the Stock Purchase Agreement, at any meeting of the
stockholders of the Company, however called, and in any action by consent of the
stockholders of the Company (a) against any action, proposal, agreement or
transaction that would result in a breach of any covenant, obligation,
agreement, representation or warranty of the Company under the Merger Agreement
or of the Selling Stockholders contained in the Stock Purchase Agreement, (b)
against any action, agreement, transaction (other than the Merger Agreement or
the transactions contemplated thereby) or proposal (including any Acquisition
Proposal) that could reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions
to the Company's obligations under the Merger Agreement not being fulfilled or
that is intended, or could reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere, delay,
discourage or adversely affect the Merger Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or
the Stock Purchase Agreement, and (c) in favor of the Transactions as may be
required pursuant to the protective provisions of the Company's Certificate of
Designation.

     No Disposition or Encumbrance of Series B Shares and Series B
Warrants.  Under the Stock Purchase Agreement each Selling Stockholder has
agreed not to (a) sell, transfer, tender (including, without limitation, into
the Offer), pledge, assign, contribute to the capital of any entity,
hypothecate, give or otherwise dispose of, grant a proxy or power of attorney
with respect to, deposit into any voting trust, enter into any voting agreement,
or create or permit to exist any Liens (as defined in the Stock Purchase
Agreement) of any nature whatsoever with respect to (other than the Irrevocable
Proxy), any of such Selling Stockholder's Series B Shares or Series B Warrants
(or agree or consent to, or offer to do, any of the foregoing) or (b) take any
action that would make any representation or warranty of the Selling
Stockholders therein untrue or incorrect in any material respect or have the
effect of preventing or disabling such Selling Stockholder from performing such
Selling Stockholder's obligations thereunder.

     No Solicitation of Transactions.  Each Selling Stockholder has agreed that
between June 28, 2001 and the date of termination of the Merger Agreement, such
Selling Stockholder will not, directly or indirectly, through any director,
officer, employee, representative, agent or otherwise, (a) solicit, initiate,
endorse, accept or encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, or (b)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
person any information with respect to, or otherwise participate in, assist,
facilitate, endorse or encourage any proposal that constitutes, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal.

     The Stock Purchase Agreement further provides that such Selling Stockholder
will, and will direct or cause its directors, officers, employees,
representatives and agents to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions or negotiations with any parties that may be ongoing with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal. Such Selling Stockholder will promptly advise Parent
orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for information
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal or request and the identity of the person making such
Acquisition Proposal or request, in each case received by such Selling
Stockholder and not the Company; provided, however, that such duties to advise
Parent will not apply to employees or agents of such Selling Stockholder who are
directors of the Company, whose obligations to advise with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal will be to the Company.

     Company Board Representation.  The Stock Purchase Agreement provides that
promptly upon the Closing, the Selling Stockholders will cause the directors
nominated by the Selling Stockholders or who are otherwise affiliated with the
Selling Stockholders after the Closing to resign from the Company's Board and
any boards of directors of the Company's subsidiaries if so requested by Parent
or Purchaser, and will cause their employees or agents who are directors of the
Company to cause the individuals nominated by Parent to be elected to the Board
in accordance with the Merger Agreement.

     Grant of Option.  The Selling Stockholders, pursuant to the Stock Purchase
Agreement, granted Parent an irrevocable option to purchase any or all of such
Selling Stockholder's Shares at the Merger Consideration, net to such Selling
Stockholder in cash, which may be exercised in whole but not in part, at any
time following termination of the Offer until the termination of the Merger
Agreement. The options will expire if not exercised prior to the termination of
the Merger Agreement.

     General Conditions to the Closing.  The obligations of each party to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement are
subject to the satisfaction, at or prior to the closing thereunder, of the
following conditions:

          (a) no governmental authority in the United States has enacted,
     issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any law (whether temporary,
     preliminary or permanent) which is then in effect and has the effect of
     making the acquisition of the Series B Shares or the Series B Warrants by
     Parent or any affiliate of Parent illegal or otherwise restricting or
     prohibiting consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Stock
     Purchase Agreement or the Merger Agreement and (ii) consummation of the
     transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement will not conflict
     with or violate any provision of United States law; and

          (b) Parent or its affiliate will have purchased, or will purchase
     concurrently with the consummation of the Stock Purchase Agreement, a
     number of Shares under the other Stockholder Agreements such that, together
     with the Shares, warrants and Series B Shares to be purchased under the
     Stock Purchase Agreement, the Parent or an affiliate thereof would own a
     majority of the outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis.

     Conditions to the Obligations of Parent.  The Stock Purchase Agreement
further provides that the obligations of Parent with respect to each Selling
Stockholder are subject to the fulfillment, at or prior to the closing
thereunder, of each of the following conditions:

          (a) the representations and warranties of such Selling Stockholder
     contained in the Stock Purchase Agreement are true and correct in all
     material respects on and as of the closing date with the same force and
     effect as if made on and as of the closing date except for those
     representations and warranties which address matters only as of a
     particular date (which representations shall have been true and correct in
     all material respects as of such particular date, and Parent has received a
     certificate to such effect signed by a duly authorized officer of such
     Selling Stockholder; and

          (b) the covenants and agreements contained in the Stock Purchase
     Agreement to be complied with by such Selling Stockholder on or before the
     closing thereunder are complied with in all material respects, and Parent
     has received a certificate to such effect signed by a duly authorized
     officer of such Selling Stockholder; and

          (c) Parent or its affiliate will have purchased all Shares validly
     tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, or the conditions to the
     Offer will have been satisfied or waived.

     Conditions to the Obligations of the Selling Stockholders.  The Stock
Purchase Agreement further provides that the obligations of each Selling
Stockholder with respect to Parent are subject to the fulfillment, at or prior
to the closing, of each of the following conditions:

          (a) the representations and warranties of Parent contained in the
     Stock Purchase Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on
     and as of the closing date with the same force and effect as if made on and
     as of the closing date except for those representations and warranties
     which address matters only as of a particular date (which representations
     will have been true and correct in all material respects as of such
     particular date, and the Selling Stockholders will have received a
     certificate to such effect signed by a duly authorized officer of Parent;
     and

          (b) the covenants and agreements contained in the Stock Purchase
     Agreement to be complied with Parent on or before the closing are complied
     with in all material respects, and the Selling Stockholders will have
     received a certificate to such effect signed by a duly authorized officer
     of Parent.

     Termination.  The Stock Purchase Agreement provides that it may be
terminated at any time prior to the closing:

          (a) by Selling Stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding
     Series B Shares, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, if any
     governmental authority has enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or
     entered any injunction, order, decree or ruling which has become final and
     nonappealable and has the

     effect of making the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase
     Agreement illegal or otherwise preventing or prohibiting consummation of
     the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement; or

          (b) automatically, without any action on behalf of any party, if the
     Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms; or

          (c) by Parent if a material breach of any of the covenants or
     agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth in the
     Stock Purchase Agreement occurs on the part of any of the Selling
     Stockholders, which breach is not cured within 15 days following written
     notice to the breaching party, or which breach, by its nature or timing,
     cannot be cured prior to the closing.

  Stockholder Support Agreements

     Tender of Shares.  Pursuant to Stockholder Support Agreements, each
Supporting Stockholder agrees to tender, pursuant to and in accordance with the
terms of the Offer, and not withdraw (except following the termination of the
Offer in accordance with its terms), all of such Supporting Stockholder's
Shares, together with any Shares subsequently acquired by such Supporting
Stockholder after the date of the Stockholder Support Agreements and prior to
the consummation of the Offer.

     Voting Agreement.  Each Supporting Stockholder agrees that, from and after
the date thereof and until the earlier to occur of the consummation of the Offer
in which such Supporting Stockholder's Shares are purchased and the termination
of the Stockholder Support Agreements, at any meeting of the stockholders of the
Company, however called, such Supporting Stockholder will vote (or cause to be
voted) such Supporting Stockholder's Shares (a) in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement and otherwise in such manner as may be necessary to consummate
the Merger; (b) against any action, proposal, agreement or transaction that
would result in a breach of any covenant, obligation, agreement, representation
or warranty of the Company under the Merger Agreement or of such Supporting
Stockholder contained in the Stockholder Support Agreements; and (c) against any
action, agreement, transaction (other than the Merger Agreement or the
transactions contemplated thereby) or proposal (including any Acquisition
Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement)) that could be reasonably be
expected to result in any of the conditions to the Company's obligations under
the Merger Agreement not being fulfilled or that is intended, or could
reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere, delay, discourage or adversely
affect the Merger Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the Stockholder
Agreements. Any vote by such Supporting Stockholder that is not in accordance
with this paragraph will be null and void.

     Irrevocable Proxy.  According to the Stockholder Support Agreements, if
such Supporting Stockholder fails to comply with the voting agreement provisions
detailed above, such failure will result in the constitution and appointment of
Parent and each of its officers from and after the date of such determination
until the earlier to occur of the closing under the Stockholder Support
Agreement and the termination of the Stockholder Support Agreements (at which
point such constitution and appointment will automatically be revoked) as such
Supporting Stockholder's attorney, agent and proxy, (such constitution and
appointment, the "Irrevocable Proxy") with full power of substitution, to vote
and otherwise act with respect to the Supporting Stockholder's Shares at any
meeting of stockholder of the Company.

     Grant of Option.  The Supporting Stockholders grant Parent an irrevocable
option to purchase any or all of such Supporting Stockholder's Shares at the
Merger Consideration, net to such Supporting Stockholder in cash. Such options
will expire if not exercised prior to the termination of the Merger Agreement.

     Parent's Obligation.  The Supporting Stockholder Agreements provide that
Parent and its affiliates will acquire all the Shares, Series B Shares and
Series B Warrants subject to any of the Stockholder Agreements, unless the
failure to acquire such Shares, Series B Shares or Series B Warrants is due to
the breach or default of any other party to the Stockholder Agreements.

     No Disposition or Encumbrance of Shares.  Each Supporting Stockholder has
agreed not to (a) sell, transfer, tender (except into the Offer), pledge,
assign, contribute to the capital of any entity, hypothecate, give or otherwise
dispose of, grant a proxy or power of attorney with respect to (other than the
Irrevocable

Proxy), deposit into any voting trust, enter into any voting agreement, or
create or permit to exist any Liens of any nature whatsoever (other than
pursuant to the Stockholder Support Agreements) with respect to, any of such
Supporting Stockholder's Shares (or agree or consent to, or offer to do, any of
the foregoing), or (b) take any action that would make any representation or
warranty of such Supporting Stockholder in the Stockholder Support Agreements
untrue or incorrect in any material respect or have the effect of preventing or
disabling such Supporting Stockholder from performing such Supporting
Stockholder's obligations thereunder.

     No Solicitation of Transactions.  Each Supporting Stockholder has agreed
that between the date of the Stockholder Support Agreements and the date of
termination of the Merger Agreement, such Supporting Stockholder will not,
directly or indirectly, through any director, officer, affiliate, employee,
representative, agent or otherwise, (a) solicit, initiate, endorse, accept or
encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, or (b) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information
with respect to, or otherwise participate in, assist, facilitate, endorse or
encourage any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead
to, an Acquisition Proposal. Such Supporting Stockholder will, and will direct
or cause its directors, officers, affiliates, employees, representatives and
agents to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or
negotiations with any parties that may be ongoing with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. Such Supporting Stockholder will promptly advise Parent
orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for information
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal or request and the identity of the person making such
Acquisition Proposal or request.

     Termination.  The Stockholder Support Agreements provide that each
Supporting Stockholder's obligation to tender, and not withdraw, its Shares
pursuant to the Offer will terminate on the expiration date of the Offer. The
Options will terminate upon termination of the Merger Agreement. The remaining
provisions of the Stockholder Support Agreements, and all other rights and
obligations of the parties thereunder, will terminate, and no party will have
any rights or obligations thereunder and the Stockholder Support Agreements will
become null and void and have no further effect upon the earliest of (a) the
Effective Time, (b) 10 business days following the later to occur of (i) the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and
(ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement and (c) the date upon which Parent
will have purchased and paid for all of the Shares in accordance with the terms
of the Offer or pursuant to the exercise of the Option granted by the Supporting
Stockholder thereunder.

SEVERANCE AND RETENTION AGREEMENTS

     In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Parent and the
Company agreed to put in place a severance and retention plan for certain
executive officers of the Company. Under the proposed plan, Mssrs. Eldon
Bullington, Robert Weigle, Michael Forrest and Thomas Prescott, current
executive officers of the Company, will be entitled to receive aggregate fees of
up to $221,250, in exchange for (i) providing consulting services to the Company
through November 30, 2001 (December 31, 2001 in the case of Mr. Prescott), and
(ii) entering into non-competition and non-solicitation covenants with one-year
terms. The terms of the proposed plan with such executive officers will be
finalized by the Company prior to the Effective Time after consultation with,
and subject to the approval of, Parent.

11. PURPOSE OF THE OFFER; PLANS FOR THE COMPANY AFTER THE OFFER AND THE MERGER.

     Purpose of the Offer.  The Offer is being made pursuant to the Merger
Agreement. The purpose of the Offer and the Merger is for Parent to acquire the
entire equity interest in the Company. The purpose of the Merger is for Parent
to acquire all Shares and Series B Shares not purchased pursuant to the Offer
and the Stockholder Agreements. Upon consummation of the Merger, the Company
will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

     Under Delaware Law, the approval of the Board and the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares is required to adopt the
Merger Agreement. The Board of the Company has unanimously determined that the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including each of
the Offer and the Merger, and the transactions contemplated by the Stockholder
Agreements are fair

to, and in the best interests of, the stockholders of the Company, has approved,
adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including each of the Offer and the Merger, and the
transactions contemplated by the Stockholder Agreements (such approval and
adoption having been made in accordance with Delaware Law, including, without
limitation, Section 203 thereof) and has resolved to recommend that holders of
Shares accept the Offer and tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer. Unless
the Merger is consummated pursuant to the short-form merger provisions under
Delaware Law described below, the only remaining required corporate action of
the Company is the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Company.
Accordingly, if the Minimum Condition is satisfied, Purchaser will have
sufficient voting power to cause the adoption of the Merger Agreement without
the affirmative vote of any other stockholder.

     UPON CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE STOCKHOLDER
AGREEMENTS, PARENT AND PURCHASER, BY VIRTUE OF THE ACQUISITION OF APPROXIMATELY
68% OF THE OUTSTANDING VOTING SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY, WILL OWN A NUMBER OF
SHARES AND SERIES B SHARES SUFFICIENT, EVEN IF NO OTHER SHARES ARE TENDERED IN
THE OFFER, TO CAUSE THE MERGER TO OCCUR WITHOUT THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF ANY
OTHER STOCKHOLDER OF THE COMPANY.

     In the Merger Agreement, the Company has agreed to duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold an annual or special meeting of its stockholders for the
purpose of considering and taking action on the Merger Agreement, if such action
is required by Delaware Law, as promptly as practicable following the purchase
by Purchaser of Shares pursuant to the Offer, or, if the Offer shall have been
terminated, consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Stockholder
Agreements that would result in Parent or Purchaser acquiring a majority of the
voting securities of the Company on a fully diluted basis. Parent and Purchaser
have agreed that all Shares owned by them and their subsidiaries will be voted
in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

     The Merger Agreement provides that, promptly upon the purchase by Purchaser
of Shares pursuant to the Offer, or, if the Offer shall have been terminated,
upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Stockholder Agreements
that would result in Parent or Purchaser acquiring a majority of the voting
securities of the Company, Purchaser will be entitled to designate
representatives to serve on the Board in proportion to Purchaser's ownership of
Shares (on an "as-converted" basis) following such purchase. See Section 10.
Purchaser expects that such representation would permit Purchaser to obtain
majority representation on the Board and control over the Company's conduct of
its business and operations.

     Short-Form Merger.  Under Delaware Law, if Purchaser acquires, pursuant to
the Offer, the Stockholder Agreements or otherwise, at least 90% of each of the
then outstanding Shares and Series B Shares, Purchaser will be able to approve
the Merger without a vote of the Company's stockholders. In such event, Parent,
Purchaser and the Company have agreed in the Merger Agreement to take, at the
request of Purchaser, all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger
to become effective as promptly as practicable after such acquisition, without a
meeting of the Company's stockholders. If, however, Purchaser does not acquire
at least 90% of the outstanding Shares and Series B Shares pursuant to the
Offer, the Stockholder Agreements or otherwise and a vote of the Company's
stockholders is required under Delaware Law, a significantly longer period of
time would be required to effect the Merger.

     Appraisal Rights.  No appraisal rights are available in connection with the
Offer. However, if the Merger is consummated, holders of Shares who have not
tendered their Shares or, if applicable, voted in favor of the Merger will have
certain rights under Delaware Law to dissent from the Merger and demand
appraisal of, and to receive payment in cash of the fair value of, their Shares.
Holders of Shares who perfect such rights by complying with the procedures set
forth in Section 262 of the Delaware Law ("Section 262") will have the "fair
value" of their Shares (exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger) determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery and will be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to such fair value
for the Surviving Corporation. In addition, such dissenting holders of Shares
would be entitled to receive payment of a fair rate of interest from the date of
consummation of the Merger on the amount determined to be the fair value of
their Shares.

     Parent does not intend to object, assuming the proper procedures are
followed, to the exercise of appraisal rights by any stockholder and the demand
for appraisal of, and payment in cash for the fair value of, the Shares. Parent
intends, however, to cause the Surviving Corporation to argue in an appraisal
proceeding that, for purposes of such proceeding, the fair value of each Share
is less than or equal to the Merger Consideration.

     The foregoing summary of the rights of dissenting holders of Shares under
Delaware Law does not purport to be a complete statement of the procedures to be
followed by holders of Shares desiring to exercise any dissenters' rights under
Delaware Law. The preservation and exercise of dissenters' rights require strict
adherence to the applicable provisions of Delaware Law.

     Going Private Transactions.  The Commission has adopted Rule 13e-3 under
the Exchange Act which is applicable to certain "going private" transactions and
which may under certain circumstances be applicable to the Merger or another
business combination following the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer or
the Stockholder Agreements in which Purchaser seeks to acquire the remaining
Shares not held by it. Purchaser believes that Rule 13e-3 will not be applicable
to the Merger. Rule 13e-3 requires, among other things, that certain financial
information concerning the Company and certain information relating to the
fairness of the proposed transaction and the consideration offered to minority
stockholders in such transaction be filed with the Commission and disclosed to
stockholders prior to consummation of the transaction.

     Plans for the Company.  It is expected that, initially following the
Merger, the business and operations of the Company will be integrated with the
EPT division of Parent and, except as set forth in this Offer to Purchase,
otherwise be continued by the Company substantially as they are currently being
conducted. Parent will continue to evaluate the business and operations of the
Company during the pendency of the Offer and after the consummation of the Offer
and the Merger, and will take such actions as it deems appropriate under the
circumstances then existing. Parent intends to seek additional information about
the Company during this period. Thereafter, Parent intends to review such
information as part of a comprehensive review of the Company's business,
operations, capitalization and management in order to determine what, if any,
changes would be desirable in light of the circumstances which then exist. Such
changes could include, among other things, changes in the Company's business,
corporate structure, restated certificate of incorporation, by-laws,
capitalization or management, including any changes necessary to integrate the
Company into the EPT division of Parent.

     Assuming the Minimum Condition is satisfied and Purchaser purchases Shares
pursuant to the Offer or the Stockholder Agreements, Parent intends to promptly
exercise its rights under the Merger Agreement to obtain majority representation
on, and control of, the Company Board. See "Section 10 -- Merger
Agreement -- Company Board Representation" above. Parent will exercise such
rights by causing the Company to elect to the Board the following individuals:
Lawrence C. Best, Lawrence J. Knopf, Paul W. Sandman and Paul A. LaViolette.
Information with respect to such persons is contained in Schedule I to the
Schedule 14D-9. The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the purchase by
Purchaser of Shares pursuant to the Offer, or, if the Offer shall have been
terminated, upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Stockholder Agreements that would result in Parent or Purchaser acquiring a
majority of the voting securities of the Company, Purchaser shall be entitled to
designate up to such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number,
on the Board as shall give Purchaser representation on the Board equal to the
product of the total number of directors on the Board (giving effect to the
directors elected pursuant to this sentence), multiplied by the percentage that
the aggregate number of Shares and Series B Shares beneficially owned by
Purchaser or any affiliate of Purchaser following such purchase bears to the
total number of Shares then outstanding on as "as-converted" basis. See Section
11. The Merger Agreement provides that the directors and officers of Purchaser
at the Effective Time of the Merger Agreement will, from and after the Effective
Time, be the initial directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving
Corporation.

     In the event the Merger is terminated, Purchaser or an affiliate of
Purchaser may, following the consummation or termination of the Offer, seek to
acquire additional Shares or Series B Shares through open market purchases,
privately negotiated transactions, a tender offer or exchange offer or
otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as it shall determine, which may
be more or less than the price to be paid pursuant to

the Offer. Purchaser and its affiliates also reserve the right to dispose of any
or all Shares in Series B Shares acquired by them, subject to the terms of the
Merger Agreement.

     Except as indicated in this Offer to Purchase, Parent does not have any
current plans or proposals which relate to or would result in any extraordinary
corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation,
relocation of any operations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, any
purchase, sale or transfer of a material amount of assets, involving the Company
or any of its subsidiaries, any material change in the Company's current
indebtedness, capitalization or dividend policy, any change in the present Board
or management of the Company or any other material change in the Company's
corporate structure or business.

12. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.

     The Merger Agreement provides that the Company shall not, between the date
of the Merger Agreement and the Effective Time, without the prior written
consent of Parent:

          (a) issue, sell, pledge, dispose of, grant or encumber, or authorize
     the issuance, sale, pledge, disposition, grant or encumbrance of, (i) any
     shares of any class of capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary, or
     any options, warrants, convertible securities or other rights of any kind
     to acquire any shares of such capital stock, or any other ownership
     interest (including, without limitation, any phantom interest), of the
     Company or any Subsidiary (except for the securities issuable pursuant to
     the outstanding warrants and options to purchase Shares or Series B Shares,
     or the Company's employee stock purchase plan) or (ii) any assets of the
     Company or any Subsidiary, except in the ordinary course of business and in
     a manner consistent with past practice;

          (b) declare, set aside, make or pay any dividend or other
     distribution, payable in cash, stock, property or otherwise, with respect
     to any of its capital stock, except for dividends by any direct or indirect
     wholly owned Subsidiary to the Company or any other Subsidiary or the
     accrual of cumulative dividends on the Series B Shares pursuant to the
     Certificate of Designation; or

          (c) reclassify, combine, split, subdivide or redeem, or purchase or
     otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any of its capital stock.

13. POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF THE OFFER ON THE MARKET FOR SHARES, NASDAQ LISTING,
    MARGIN REGULATIONS AND EXCHANGE ACT REGISTRATION.

     Possible Effects of the Offer on the Market for the Shares.  The purchase
of Shares by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer will reduce the number of Shares
that might otherwise trade publicly and will reduce the number of holders of
Shares, which could adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the
remaining Shares held by the public.

     Parent intends to cause the delisting of the Shares by Nasdaq following
consummation of the Offer.

     Nasdaq Listing.  Depending upon the number of Shares purchased pursuant to
the Offer, the Shares may no longer meet the standards for continued listing on
Nasdaq. According to Nasdaq's published guidelines, the Shares would not be
eligible to be included for listing if, among other things, the number of Shares
publicly held falls below 750,000, the number of round lot holders of Shares
falls below 400 or the market value of such publicly held Shares is not at least
$5 million. If, as a result of the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the
Merger, the Stock Purchase Agreement or otherwise, the Shares no longer meet the
requirements of Nasdaq for continued listing, the listing of the Shares will be
discontinued. In such event, the market for the Shares would be adversely
affected. In the event the Shares were no longer eligible for listing on Nasdaq,
quotations might still be available from other sources. The extent of the public
market for the Shares and the availability of such quotations would, however,
depend upon the number of holders of such Shares remaining at such time, the
interest in maintaining a market in such Shares on the part of securities firms,
the possible termination of registration of such Shares under the Exchange Act
as described below and other factors.

     Exchange Act Registration.  The Shares are currently registered under the
Exchange Act. Such registration may be terminated upon application by the
Company to the Commission if the Shares are not listed on a "national securities
exchange" and there are fewer than 300 record holders. The termination of the
registration of the Shares under the Exchange Act would substantially reduce the
information required to be furnished by the Company to holders of Shares and to
the Commission and would make certain provisions of the Exchange Act, such as
the short-swing profit recovery provisions of Section 16(b), the requirement of
furnishing a proxy statement in connection with stockholders' meetings pursuant
to Section 14(a) or 14(c) of the Exchange Act and the related requirements of an
annual report, and the requirements of Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act with
respect to "going private" transactions, no longer applicable to the Shares. In
addition, "affiliates" of the Company and persons holding "restricted
securities" of the Company may be deprived of the ability to dispose of such
securities pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended. If registration of the Shares under the Exchange Act were terminated,
the Shares would no longer be eligible for Nasdaq reporting. Purchaser currently
intends to seek to cause the Company to terminate the registration of the Shares
under the Exchange Act as soon after consummation of the Offer as the
requirements for termination of registration are met.

     Margin Regulations.  The Shares are currently "margin securities", as such
term is defined under the rules of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System (the "Federal Reserve Board"), which has the effect, among other things,
of allowing brokers to extend credit on the collateral of such securities.
Depending upon factors similar to those described above regarding listing and
market quotations, following the Offer it is possible that the Shares might no
longer constitute "margin securities" for purposes of the margin regulations of
the Federal Reserve Board, in which event such Shares could no longer be used as
collateral for loans made by brokers. In addition, if registration of the Shares
under the Exchange Act were terminated, the Shares would no longer constitute
"margin securities."

14. CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer and subject to the terms
of the Merger Agreement, Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment
any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, and may extend, terminate or amend
the Offer, if (i) immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer the Minimum
Condition shall not have been satisfied, (ii) the HSR Act shall not have been
satisfied, or (iii) at any time on or after the date of the Merger Agreement and
prior to the expiration of the Offer any of the following conditions shall
exist:

          (a) there shall have been instituted or be pending any Action before
     any governmental authority (i) challenging or seeking to make illegal,
     materially delay, or otherwise, directly or indirectly, restrain or
     prohibit or make materially more costly, the making of the Offer, the
     acceptance for payment of any Shares by Parent, Purchaser or any other
     affiliate of Parent, or the purchase of Series B Shares pursuant to the
     Stock Purchase Agreement, or the consummation of any other Transaction, or
     seeking to obtain material damages in connection with any Transaction; (ii)
     seeking to prohibit or materially limit the ownership or operation by the
     Company, Parent or any of their subsidiaries of all or any of the business
     or assets of the Company, Parent or any of their subsidiaries that is
     material to either Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the
     EPT division of Parent, or the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a
     whole, or to compel the Company, Parent or any of their subsidiaries, as a
     result of the Transactions, to dispose of or to hold separate all or any
     portion of the business or assets of the Company, Parent or any of their
     subsidiaries that is material to Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a
     whole, or the EPT division of Parent, or the Company and the Subsidiaries,
     taken as a whole; (iii) seeking to impose or confirm any limitation on the
     ability of Parent, Purchaser or any other affiliate of Parent to exercise
     effectively full rights of ownership of any Shares, including, without
     limitation, the right to vote any Shares acquired by Purchaser pursuant to
     the Offer or any Series B Shares acquired by Purchaser pursuant to the
     Stock Purchase Agreement or otherwise on all matters properly presented to
     the Company's stockholders, including, without limitation, the adoption of
     the Merger Agreement; or (iv) seeking to require divestiture by Parent,
     Purchaser or any other affiliate of Parent of any Shares or Series B
     Shares;

          (b) there shall have been any statute, rule, regulation, legislation
     or interpretation enacted, promulgated, amended, issued or deemed
     applicable to (i) Parent, the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate of
     Parent or the Company or (ii) any Transaction, by any United States or
     non-United States legislative body or Governmental Authority with
     appropriate jurisdiction, other than the routine application of the waiting
     period provisions of the HSR Act to the Offer, the Stockholder Agreements
     or the Merger, that is reasonably likely to result, directly or indirectly,
     in any of the consequences referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) of
     paragraph (a) above;

          (c) any material adverse effect on the Company or its ability to
     consummate the Merger Agreement or the Transactions shall have occurred;

          (d) there shall have occurred (i) a declaration of a banking
     moratorium or any suspension of payments in respect of banks in the United
     States that materially and adversely affects the ability of Parent to
     consummate the Transactions for more than five business days after the
     expiration of the Offer or (ii) a commencement of a war or armed
     hostilities or other national or international calamity directly or
     indirectly involving the United States that materially and adversely
     affects the ability of Purchaser and Parent to consummate the Transactions
     or, in the case of such calamity existing on the date hereof, a material
     acceleration or worsening thereof;

          (e) except as set forth in the two provisos set forth in this
     paragraph (e), any representation or warranty of the Company in the Merger
     Agreement shall not be true and correct as if such representation or
     warranty was made as of any expiration date of the Offer (as may be
     extended from time to time in accordance with the terms of the Merger
     Agreement) without for this purpose giving effect to qualifications or
     limitations as to materiality or the absence of a material adverse effect
     contained in such representations and warranties, except for such failures
     to be true and correct as would not have a material adverse effect;
     provided, that certain representations and warranties (set forth in the
     Merger Agreement) of the Company shall not, to the extent qualified by
     materiality or material adverse effect, be true and correct, or to the
     extent that any such representation or warranty is not so qualified, shall
     not be true and correct in any material respect as if such representations
     or warranties were made as of the date of the expiration of the Offer (as
     may be extended from time to time in accordance with the terms of the
     Merger Agreement); and provided, further, that those representations or
     warranties that address matters only as of a specific date shall not be
     true and correct (subject to the applicable materiality standard as set
     forth above) as of such date;

          (f) (i) the Company shall have (A) failed to perform, in any material
     respect, any obligation or to comply, in any material respect, with any
     agreement or covenant of the Company to be performed or complied with by it
     under the Merger Agreement, or (B) shall have failed to perform or comply
     in any respect with its agreement and covenant in Section 6.01(f) of the
     Merger Agreement, or (ii) the Stockholders shall have failed to perform, in
     any material respect, any obligation or to comply, in any material respect,
     with any agreement or covenant of the Stockholders to be performed or
     complied with by them under the Stockholder Agreements as a result of which
     Purchaser's ability to consummate the Transactions is materially impaired;

          (g) the Merger Agreement or the Stock Purchase Agreement shall have
     been terminated in accordance with its terms;

          (h) the conditions to Parent's obligations under the Stock Purchase
     Agreement (other than the condition relating to the closing of the Offer)
     to acquire a number of Series B Shares which, when added to the number of
     Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, would satisfy the Minimum Condition,
     shall not have been satisfied or waived; or

          (i) Purchaser and the Company shall have agreed that Purchaser shall
     terminate the Offer or postpone the acceptance for payment of Shares
     thereunder;

which, in the reasonable judgment of Purchaser in any such case, and regardless
of the circumstances (including any action or inaction by Parent or any of its
affiliates) giving rise to any such condition, makes it inadvisable to proceed
with such acceptance for payment.

     Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the foregoing conditions are
for the sole benefit of Purchaser and Parent and may be asserted by Purchaser or
Parent regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such condition or may
be waived by Purchaser or Parent in whole or in part at any time and from time
to time in their sole discretion. The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time
to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right; the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and other
circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and
circumstances; and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.

15. CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS AND REGULATORY APPROVALS.

     General.  Based upon its examination of publicly available information with
respect to the Company and the review of certain information furnished by the
Company to Parent and discussions between representatives of Parent with
representatives of the Company during Parent's investigation of the Company (see
Section 10), neither Purchaser nor Parent is aware of (a) any license or other
regulatory permit that appears to be material to the business of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which might be adversely affected by
the acquisition of Shares by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer or the Stockholder
Agreements or (b) except as set forth below, of any approval or other action by
any domestic (federal or state) or foreign governmental authority which would be
required prior to the acquisition of Shares by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer
or the Stockholder Agreements. Should any such approval or other action be
required, it is Purchaser's current intention to seek such approval or action.
Purchaser does not currently intend, however, to delay the purchase of Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer pending the outcome of any such action or the
receipt of any such approval (subject to Purchaser's right to decline to
purchase Shares if any of the conditions in Section 14 shall have occurred).

     State Takeover Laws.  The Company is incorporated under the laws of the
State of Delaware. In general, Section 203 of Delaware Law prevents an
"interested stockholder" (generally a person who owns or has the right to
acquire 15% or more of a corporation's outstanding voting stock, or an affiliate
or associate thereof) from engaging in a "business combination" (defined to
include mergers and certain other transactions) with a Delaware corporation for
a period of three years following the date such person became an interested
stockholder unless, among other things, prior to such date the board of
directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the
transaction in which the interested stockholder became an interested
stockholder. On June 28 2001, prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement and
the Stockholder Agreements, the Board by unanimous vote of all directors present
at a meeting held on such date, approved the Merger Agreement and the
Stockholder Agreements, determined that each of the Offer and the Merger is fair
to, and in the best interest of, the stockholders of the Company. Accordingly,
Section 203 is inapplicable to the Offer and the Merger.

     A number of other states have adopted laws and regulations applicable to
attempts to acquire securities of corporations which are incorporated, or have
substantial assets, stockholders, principal executive offices or principal
places of business, or whose business operations otherwise have substantial
economic effects, in such states. In Edgar v. MITE Corp., the Supreme Court of
the United States invalidated on constitutional grounds the Illinois Business
Takeover Statute, which, as a matter of state securities law, made takeovers of
corporations meeting certain requirements more difficult. However, in 1987 in
CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of America, the Supreme Court held that the State of
Indiana may, as a matter of corporate law and, in particular, with respect to
those aspects of corporate law concerning corporate governance, constitutionally
disqualify a potential acquiror from voting on the affairs of a target
corporation without the prior approval of the remaining stockholders. The state
law before the Supreme Court was by its terms applicable only to corporations
that had a substantial number of stockholders in the state and were incorporated
there.

     The Company, directly or through its subsidiaries, conducts business in a
number of states throughout the United States, some of which have enacted
takeover laws. Purchaser does not know whether any of these laws will, by their
terms, apply to the Offer or the Merger and has not complied with any such laws.
Should any person seek to apply any state takeover law, Purchaser will take such
action as then appears desirable, which may include challenging the validity or
applicability of any such statute in appropriate court proceedings. In the event
it is asserted that one or more state takeover laws is applicable to the Offer
or the Merger, and an

appropriate court does not determine that it is inapplicable or invalid as
applied to the Offer, Purchaser might be required to file certain information
with, or receive approvals from, the relevant state authorities. In addition, if
enjoined, Purchaser might be unable to accept for payment any Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer, or be delayed in continuing or consummating the Offer,
and the Merger. In such case, Purchaser may not be obligated to accept for
payment any Shares tendered. See Section 14.

     Antitrust.  Under the HSR Act and the rules that have been promulgated
thereunder by the FTC, certain acquisition transactions may not be consummated
unless certain information has been furnished to the Antitrust Division and the
FTC and certain waiting period requirements have been satisfied. The acquisition
of Shares and Series B Shares by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer and the
Stockholder Agreements are subject to such requirements. See Section 2.

     Pursuant to the HSR Act, Parent intends to file shortly a Premerger
Notification and Report Form in connection with the purchase of Shares pursuant
to the Offer and the Stockholder Agreements with the Antitrust Division and the
FTC. Under the provisions of the HSR Act applicable to the Offer and the
Stockholder Agreements, the purchase of Shares and Series B Shares pursuant to
the Offer and the Stockholder Agreements may not be consummated until the
expiration of the relevant waiting period following the filing by Parent.
Accordingly, the waiting period under the HSR Act applicable to the purchase of
Shares and Series B Shares pursuant to the Offer and the Stockholder Agreements
will expire in due course, unless such waiting period is earlier terminated by
the FTC and the Antitrust Division or extended by a request from the FTC or the
Antitrust Division for additional information or documentary material prior to
the expiration of the waiting period. Pursuant to the HSR Act, Parent has
requested early termination of the waiting period applicable to the Offer and
the Stockholder Agreements. There can be no assurance, however, that the
relevant HSR Act waiting period will be terminated early. If either the FTC or
the Antitrust Division were to request additional information or documentary
material from Parent with respect to the Offer, the waiting period would expire
at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the tenth calendar day after the date of
substantial compliance with such request. Thereafter, the waiting period could
be extended only by court order. If the acquisition of Shares is delayed
pursuant to a request by the FTC or the Antitrust Division for additional
information or documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act, the Offer may, but
need not, be extended and, in any event, the purchase of and payment for Shares
will be deferred until 10 days after the request is substantially complied with,
unless the waiting period is sooner terminated by the FTC and the Antitrust
Division. Only one extension of such waiting period pursuant to a request for
additional information is authorized by the HSR Act and the rules promulgated
thereunder, except by court order. Any such extension of the waiting period will
not give rise to any withdrawal rights not otherwise provided for by applicable
law. See Section 4. It is a condition to the Offer that the waiting period
applicable under the HSR Act to the Offer expire or be terminated. See Section 1
and Section 14.

     The FTC and the Antitrust Division frequently scrutinize the legality under
the antitrust laws of transactions such as the proposed acquisition of Shares
and Series B Shares by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer or the Stockholder
Agreements. At any time before or after the purchase of Shares or Series B
Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Stockholder Agreements by Purchaser, the FTC
or the Antitrust Division could take such action under the antitrust laws as it
deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin
the purchase of Shares or Series B Shares pursuant to the Offer or the
Stockholder Agreements or seeking the divestiture of Shares or Series B Shares
purchased by Purchaser or the divestiture of substantial assets of Parent, the
Company or their respective subsidiaries. Private parties and state attorneys
general may also bring legal action under federal or state antitrust laws under
certain circumstances. Based upon an examination of information available to
Parent relating to the businesses in which Parent, the Company and their
respective subsidiaries are engaged, Parent and Purchaser believe that neither
the Offer nor the Stockholders Agreements will violate the antitrust laws.
Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that a challenge to the Offer or the
Stockholder Agreements on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a
challenge is made, what the result would be. See Section 14 for certain
conditions to the Offer, including conditions with respect to litigation.

     Other Laws and Legal Matters.  According to the Company's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000, the Company conducts
operations in a number of foreign countries. As a

result of such operations, Parent has determined that it is required to file
certain information in Germany. In addition, in the event that one or more other
foreign laws is deemed to be applicable to the Offer, Purchaser and/or the
Company may be required to file certain information or to receive the approval
of the relevant non-United States authority (other than Germany). Such
governments may also attempt to impose additional conditions on the Company's
operations conducted in such countries. Purchaser presently intends to take such
action as such laws may require.

16. FEES AND EXPENSES.

     Except as set forth below, Purchaser will not pay any fees or commissions
to any broker, dealer or other person for soliciting tenders of Shares pursuant
to the Offer.

     Purchaser and Parent have retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated to serve as
the Information Agent, and Mellon Investor Service LLC, to serve as the
Depositary, in connection with the Offer. The Information Agent may contact
holders of Shares by personal interview, mail, telephone, telex, telegraph and
other methods of electronic communication and may request brokers, dealers,
commercial banks, trust companies and other nominees to forward the Offer
materials to beneficial holders. The Information Agent and Depositary will each
receive reasonable and customary compensation for their services, be reimbursed
for certain reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and be indemnified against certain
liabilities in connection with their services, including certain liabilities and
expenses under the federal securities laws.

     Except as set forth above, neither Parent nor Purchaser will pay any fees
or commissions to any broker or dealer or other person or entity in connection
with the solicitation of tenders of Shares pursuant to the Offer. Brokers,
dealers, banks and trust companies will be reimbursed by Purchaser for customary
mailing and handling expenses incurred by them in forwarding the Offer materials
to their customers.

17. MISCELLANEOUS.

     The Offer is being made solely by this Offer to Purchase and the related
Letter of Transmittal and is being made to holders of Shares. Purchaser is not
aware of any jurisdiction where the making of the Offer is prohibited by any
administrative or judicial action pursuant to any valid state statute. If
Purchaser becomes aware of any valid state statute prohibiting the making of the
Offer or the acceptance of Shares pursuant thereto, Purchaser will make a good
faith effort to comply with any such state statute. If, after such good faith
effort, Purchaser cannot comply with any such state statute, the Offer will not
be made to (nor will tenders be accepted from or on behalf of) the holders of
Shares in such state. In any jurisdiction where the securities, blue sky or
other laws require the Offer to be made by a licensed broker or dealer, the
Offer shall be deemed to be made on behalf of Purchaser by one or more
registered brokers or dealers licensed under the laws of such jurisdiction.

     NO PERSON HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED TO GIVE ANY INFORMATION OR MAKE ANY
REPRESENTATION ON BEHALF OF PURCHASER OR THE COMPANY NOT CONTAINED IN THIS OFFER
TO PURCHASE OR IN THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL, AND IF GIVEN OR MADE, SUCH
INFORMATION OR REPRESENTATION MUST NOT BE RELIED UPON AS HAVING BEEN AUTHORIZED.

     Pursuant to Rule 14d-3 of the General Rules and Regulations under the
Exchange Act, Parent and Purchaser have filed with the Commission the Schedule
TO, together with exhibits, furnishing certain additional information with
respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO and any amendments thereto, including
exhibits, may be inspected at, and copies may be obtained from, the same places
and in the same manner as set forth in Section 7 (except that they will not be
available at the regional offices of the Commission).

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     The undersigned hereby tenders to ADAM ACQUISITION 2001 INC., a Delaware
corporation ("Purchaser") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Boston Scientific
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), the above-described shares of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, including the associated preferred
stock purchase rights ("Shares"), of Cardiac Pathways Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), pursuant to Purchaser's offer to purchase all
Shares at $5.267 per Share, net to the seller in cash, without interest, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase,
dated July 10, 2001 (the "Offer to Purchase"), receipt of which is hereby
acknowledged, and in this Letter of Transmittal (which, together with the Offer
to Purchase and any amendments or supplements hereto or thereto, collectively
constitute the "Offer"). The undersigned understands that Purchaser reserves the
right to transfer or assign, in whole or from time to time in part, to one or
more of its affiliates the right to purchase all or any portion of Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer.

     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer (and if the Offer
is extended or amended, the terms of any such extension or amendment), and
subject to, and effective upon, acceptance for payment of Shares tendered
herewith, in accordance with the terms of the Offer, the undersigned hereby
sells, assigns and transfers to or upon the order of Purchaser all right, title
and interest in and to all Shares that are being tendered hereby and all
dividends, distributions (including, without limitation, distributions of
additional Shares) and rights declared, paid or distributed in respect of such
Shares on or after July 10, 2001 (collectively, "Distributions") and irrevocably
appoints the Depositary as the true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact of the
undersigned with respect to such Shares (and all Distributions), with full power
of substitution (such power of attorney being deemed to be an irrevocable power
coupled with an interest), to (i) deliver Share Certificates evidencing such
Shares (and all Distributions), or transfer ownership of such Shares (and all
Distributions) on the account books maintained by the Book-Entry Transfer
Facility, together, in either case, with all accompanying evidences of transfer
and authenticity, to or upon the order of Purchaser, (ii) present such Shares
(and all Distributions) for transfer on the books of the Company and (iii)
receive all benefits and otherwise exercise all rights of beneficial ownership
of such Shares (and all Distributions), all in accordance with the terms of the
Offer.

     By executing this Letter of Transmittal, the undersigned hereby irrevocably
appoints the designees of the Company and Purchaser and each of them, as the
attorneys and proxies of the undersigned, each with full power of substitution,
to vote in such manner as each such attorney and proxy or his substitute shall,
in his sole discretion, deem proper and otherwise act (by written consent or
otherwise) with respect to all Shares tendered hereby which have been accepted
for payment by Purchaser prior to the time of such vote or other action and all
Shares and other securities issued in Distributions in respect of such Shares,
which the undersigned is entitled to vote at any meeting of holders of Shares of
the Company (whether annual or special and whether or not an adjourned or
postponed meeting) or consent in lieu of any such meeting or otherwise. This
proxy and power of attorney is coupled with an interest in Shares tendered
hereby, is irrevocable and is granted in consideration of, and is effective
upon, the acceptance for payment of such Shares by Purchaser in accordance with
other terms of the Offer. Such acceptance for payment shall revoke all other
proxies and powers of attorney granted by the undersigned at any time with
respect to such Shares (and all Shares and other securities issued in
Distributions in respect of such Shares), and no subsequent proxies, powers of
attorney, consents or revocations may be given by the undersigned with respect
thereto (and if given will not be deemed effective). The undersigned understands
that, in order for Shares or Distributions to be deemed validly tendered,
immediately upon Purchaser's acceptance of such Shares for payment, Purchaser
must be able to exercise full voting and other rights with respect to such
Shares (and any and all Distributions), including, without limitation, voting at
any meeting of the Company's holders of Shares then scheduled.

     The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the undersigned has
full power and authority to tender, sell, assign and transfer Shares tendered
hereby and all Distributions, that when such Shares are accepted for payment by
Purchaser, Purchaser will acquire good, marketable and unencumbered title
thereto and to all Distributions, free and clear of all liens, restriction,
charges and encumbrances, and that none of such Shares and Distributions will be
subject to any adverse claim. The undersigned, upon request, shall execute and
deliver all additional documents deemed by the Depositary or Purchaser to be
necessary or desirable to complete the sale, assignment and transfer of Shares
tendered hereby and all Distributions. In addition, the undersigned shall remit
and transfer promptly to the Depositary for the

account of Purchaser all Distributions in respect of Shares tendered hereby,
accompanied by appropriate documentation of transfer, and pending such
remittance and transfer or appropriate assurance thereof, Purchaser shall be
entitled to all rights and privileges as owner of each such Distribution and may
withhold the entire purchase price of Shares tendered hereby, or deduct from
such purchase price, the amount or value of such Distribution as determined by
Purchaser in its sole discretion.

     No authority herein conferred or agreed to be conferred shall be affected
by, and all such authority shall survive, the death or incapacity of the
undersigned. All obligations of the undersigned hereunder shall be binding upon
the heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns of the undersigned.
Except as stated in the Offer to Purchase, this tender is irrevocable.

     The undersigned understands that the valid tender of Shares pursuant to any
one of the procedures described in Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase and in the
Instructions hereto will constitute the undersigned's acceptance of the terms
and conditions of the Offer. Purchaser's acceptance of such Shares for payment
will constitute a binding agreement between the undersigned and Purchaser upon
the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer (and if the Offer is
extended or amended, the terms or conditions of any such extension or
amendment).

     Unless otherwise indicated below in the box entitled "Special Payment
Instructions", please issue the check for the purchase price of all Shares
purchased and return all Share Certificates evidencing Shares not tendered or
not accepted for payment in the name(s) of the registered holder(s) appearing

Instructions", please credit any Shares tendered hereby and delivered by
book-entry transfer that are not accepted for payment by crediting the account
at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility designated above. The undersigned recognizes
that Purchaser has no obligation, pursuant to the Special Payment Instructions,
to transfer any Shares from the name of the registered holder(s) thereof if
Purchaser does not accept for payment any Shares tendered hereby.

     1. Guarantee of Signatures.  All signatures on this Letter of Transmittal
must be guaranteed by a firm which is a member of the Security Transfer Agent
Medallion Signature Program, or by any other "eligible guarantor institution,"
as such term is defined in Rule 17Ad-15 promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (each of the foregoing being an "Eligible
Institution") unless (i) this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered
holder(s) of Shares (which term, for purposes of this document, shall include
any participant in the Book-Entry Transfer Facility whose name appears on a
security position listing as the owner of Shares) tendered hereby and such
holder(s) has (have) not completed the box entitled "Special Payment
Instructions" or "Special Delivery Instructions" on the reverse hereof or (ii)
such Shares are tendered for the account of an Eligible Institution. See
Instruction 5.

     2. Delivery of Letter of Transmittal and Share Certificates.  This Letter
of Transmittal is to be used either if Share Certificates are to be forwarded
herewith or if tenders are to be made pursuant to the procedures for tenders by
book-entry transfer pursuant to the procedure set forth in Section 3 of the
Offer to Purchase. Share Certificates evidencing all physically tendered Shares,
or a confirmation of a book-entry transfer into the Depositary's account at the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility of all Shares delivered by book-entry transfer, as
well as a properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal (or a
manually signed facsimile thereof) and any other documents required by this
Letter of Transmittal, must be received by the Depositary at one of its
addresses set forth below prior to the Expiration Date (as defined in Section 1
of the Offer to Purchase). If Share Certificates are forwarded to the Depositary
in multiple deliveries, a properly completed and duly executed Letter of
Transmittal must accompany each such delivery. Holders of Shares whose Share
Certificates are not immediately available, who cannot deliver their Share
Certificates and all other required documents to the Depositary prior to the
Expiration Date or who cannot complete the procedure for delivery by book-entry
transfer on a timely basis may tender their Shares pursuant to the guaranteed
delivery procedure described in Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase. Pursuant to
such procedure: (i) such tender must be made by or through an Eligible
Institution; (ii) a properly completed and duly executed Notice of Guaranteed
Delivery, substantially in the form made available by Purchaser, must be
received by the Depositary prior to the Expiration Date; and (iii) the Share
Certificates evidencing all physically delivered Shares in proper form for
transfer by delivery, or a confirmation of a book-entry transfer into the
Depositary's account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility of all Shares delivered
by book-entry transfer, in each case together with a Letter of Transmittal (or a
manually signed facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed, with
any required signature guarantees (or in the case of a book-entry transfer, an
Agent's Message (as defined in Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase)) and any
other documents required by this Letter of Transmittal, must be received by the
Depositary within three Nasdaq trading days after the date of execution of such
Notice of Guaranteed Delivery, all as described in Section 3 of the Offer to
Purchase.

     THE METHOD OF DELIVERY OF THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL, SHARE CERTIFICATES
AND ALL OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING DELIVERY THROUGH THE BOOK-ENTRY
TRANSFER FACILITY, IS AT THE OPTION AND RISK OF THE TENDERING STOCKHOLDER, AND
THE DELIVERY WILL BE DEEMED MADE ONLY WHEN ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY.
IF DELIVERY IS BY MAIL, REGISTERED MAIL WITH RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, PROPERLY
INSURED, IS RECOMMENDED. IN ALL CASES, SUFFICIENT TIME SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO
ENSURE TIMELY DELIVERY.

     No alternative, conditional or contingent tenders will be accepted. By
execution of this Letter of Transmittal (or a manually signed facsimile hereof),
all tendering holders of Shares waive any right to receive any notice of the
acceptance of their Shares for payment.

     3. Inadequate Space.  If the space provided on the reverse hereof under
"Description of Shares Tendered" is inadequate, the Share Certificate numbers,
the number of Shares evidenced by such Share Certificates and the number of
Shares tendered should be listed on a separate signed schedule and attached
hereto.

     4. Partial Tenders (not applicable to holders of Shares who tender by
book-entry transfer).  If fewer than all Shares evidenced by any Share
Certificate delivered to the Depositary herewith are to be tendered hereby, fill
in the number of Shares that are to be tendered in the box entitled "Number of
Shares Tendered". In such cases, new Share Certificate(s) evidencing the
remainder of Shares that were evidenced by the Share Certificates delivered to
the Depositary herewith will be sent to the person(s) signing this Letter of
Transmittal, unless otherwise provided in the box entitled "Special Delivery
Instructions" on the reverse hereof, as soon as practicable after the Expiration
Date or the termination of the

Offer. All Shares evidenced by Share Certificates delivered to the Depositary
will be deemed to have been tendered unless otherwise indicated.

     5. Signatures on Letter of Transmittal; Stock Powers and Endorsements.  If
this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of Shares
tendered hereby, the signature(s) must correspond with the name(s) as written on
the face of the Share Certificates evidencing such Shares without alteration,
enlargement or any other change whatsoever.

     If any Shares tendered hereby are held of record by two or more persons,
all such persons must sign this Letter of Transmittal.

     If any Shares tendered hereby are registered in different names, it will be
necessary to complete, sign and submit as many separate Letters of Transmittal
as there are different registrations of such Shares.

     If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of
Shares tendered hereby, no endorsements of Share Certificates or separate stock
powers are required, unless payment is to be made to, or Share Certificates
evidencing Shares not tendered or not accepted for payment are to be issued in
the name of, a person other than the registered holder(s). If the Letter of
Transmittal is signed by a person other than the registered holder(s) of the
Share Certificate(s) evidencing Shares tendered, the Share Certificate(s)
tendered hereby must be endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in
either case signed exactly as the name(s) of the registered holder(s) appear(s)
on such Share Certificate(s). Signatures on such Share Certificate(s) and stock
powers must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution.

     If this Letter of Transmittal or any Share Certificate or stock power is
signed by a trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, attorney-in-fact,
officer of a corporation or other person acting in a fiduciary or representative
capacity, such person should so indicate when signing, and proper evidence
satisfactory to Purchaser of such person's authority to so act must be
submitted.

     6. Stock Transfer Taxes.  Except as otherwise provided in this Instruction
6, Purchaser will pay all stock transfer taxes with respect to the sale and
transfer of any Shares to it or its order pursuant to the Offer. If, however,
payment of the purchase price of any Shares purchased is to be made to, or Share
Certificate(s) evidencing Shares not tendered or not accepted for payment are to
be issued in the name of, any person other than the registered holder(s) or if
tendered certificates are registered in the name of any person other than the
person(s) signing the Letter of Transmittal, the amount of any stock transfer
taxes (whether imposed on the registered holder(s), or such other person, or
otherwise) payable on account of the transfer to such other person will be
deducted from the purchase price of such Shares if satisfactory evidence of the
payment of such taxes, or exemption therefrom, is not submitted.

     Except as provided in this Instruction 6, it will not be necessary for
transfer tax stamps to be affixed to the Share Certificates evidencing Shares
tendered hereby.

     7. Special Payment and Delivery Instructions.  If a check for the purchase
price of any Shares tendered hereby is to be issued in the name of, and/or Share
Certificate(s) evidencing Shares not tendered or not accepted for payment are to
be issued in the name of and/or returned to, a person other than the person(s)
signing this Letter of Transmittal or if such check or any such Share
Certificate is to be sent to a person other than the signor of this Letter of
Transmittal or to the person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal but at an
address other than that shown in the box entitled "Description of Shares
Tendered" on the reverse hereof, the appropriate boxes herein must be completed.

     8. Questions and Requests for Assistance or Additional Copies.  Questions
and requests for assistance may be directed to the Information Agent at the
address or telephone number set forth below. Additional copies of the Offer to
Purchase, this Letter of Transmittal, the Notice of Guaranteed Delivery and the
Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute
Form W-9 may be obtained from the Information Agent.

     9. Substitute Form W-9.  Each tendering stockholder is required to provide
the Depositary with a correct Taxpayer Identification Number ("TIN") on the
Substitute Form W-9 which is provided under "Important Tax Information" below,
and to certify, under penalty of perjury, that such number is correct and that
such stockholder is not subject to backup withholding of federal income tax. If
a tendering stockholder has been notified by the Internal Revenue Service that
such stockholder is subject to backup withholding, such stockholder must cross
out item (2) of the Certification box of the Substitute Form W-9, unless such
stockholder has since been notified by the Internal Revenue Service that such
stockholder is no longer subject to backup withholding. Failure to provide the
information on the Substitute Form W-9

may subject the tendering stockholder to 31% federal income tax withholding
(subject to a reduction of such rate as a consequence of recent legislative
initiatives) on the payment of the purchase price of all Shares purchased from
such stockholder. If the tendering stockholder has not been issued a TIN and has
applied for one or intends to apply for one in the near future, such stockholder
should write "Applied For" in the space provided for the TIN in Part I of the
Substitute Form W-9, and sign and date the Substitute Form W-9. If "Applied For"
is written in Part I and the Depositary is not provided with a TIN within 60
days, the Depositary will withhold 31% (or such reduced rate as applicable) on
all payments of the purchase price to such stockholder until a TIN is provided
to the Depositary and, if the Depositary is not provided a TIN within 60 days,
such amounts will be paid over to the Internal Revenue Service.

     10. Lost, Destroyed or Stolen Certificates.  If any certificate(s)
representing Shares has been lost, destroyed or stolen, the shareholder should
promptly notify the Depositary. The shareholder will then be instructed as to
the steps that must be taken in order to replace the certificate(s). This Letter
of Transmittal and related documents cannot be processed until the procedures
for replacing lost, destroyed or stolen certificates have been followed.

     IMPORTANT: THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL, PROPERLY COMPLETED AND DULY EXECUTED
(TOGETHER WITH ANY REQUIRED SIGNATURE GUARANTEES (OR, IN THE CASE OF A
BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER, AN AGENT'S MESSAGE) AND SHARE CERTIFICATES OR CONFIRMATION
OF BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER AND ALL OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS) OR A PROPERLY COMPLETED
AND DULY EXECUTED NOTICE OF GUARANTEED DELIVERY MUST BE RECEIVED BY THE
DEPOSITARY PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATE (AS DEFINED IN THE OFFER TO PURCHASE).

                           IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION

     Under U.S. federal income tax law, a stockholder whose tendered Shares are
accepted for payment is generally required to provide the Depositary (as payer)
with such stockholder's correct TIN on Substitute Form W-9 provided herewith. If
such stockholder is an individual, the TIN generally is such stockholder's
social security number. If the Depositary is not provided with the correct TIN,
the stockholder may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue
Service and payments that are made to such stockholder with respect to Shares
purchased pursuant to the Offer may be subject to backup withholding of 31% (or
such reduced rate as applicable). More serious penalties may be imposed for
providing false information which, if willfully done, may result in fines and/or
imprisonment.

     Certain holders of Shares (including, among others, corporations and
certain foreign individuals) are not subject to these backup withholding and
reporting requirements. In order for a foreign individual to qualify as an
exempt recipient, such individual must submit a statement (IRS Form W-8 BEN, or
other applicable IRS Form W-8), signed under penalties of perjury, attesting to
such individual's exempt status. Forms of such statements can be obtained from
the Depositary. See the enclosed "Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer
Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9" for additional instructions. A
stockholder should consult his or her tax advisor as to such stockholder's
qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for
obtaining such exemption.

     If backup withholding applies, the Depositary is required to withhold 31%
(or such reduced rate as applicable) of any payments made to the stockholder.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the federal income tax
liability of persons subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the amount
of tax withheld. If withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may
be obtained provided that the required information is furnished to the Internal
Revenue Service.

  Purpose of Substitute Form W-9

     To prevent backup withholding on payments that are made to a stockholder
with respect to Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer, the stockholder is
required to notify the Depositary of such stockholder's correct TIN by
completing the form below certifying that (a) the TIN provided on Substitute
Form W-9 is correct (or that such stockholder is awaiting a TIN), and (b)(i)
such stockholder has not been notified by the Internal Revenue Service that such
stockholder is subject to backup withholding as a result of a failure to report
all interest or dividends or (ii) the Internal Revenue Service has notified such
stockholder that such stockholder is no longer subject to backup withholding.

  What Number to Give the Depositary

     The stockholder is required to give the Depositary the TIN (e.g., social
security number or employer identification number) of the record holder of
Shares tendered hereby. If Shares are in more than one name or are not in the
name of the actual owner, consult the enclosed "Guidelines for Certification of
Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9" for additional guidance
on which number to report. If the tendering stockholder has not been issued a
TIN and has applied for a number or intends to apply for a number in the near
future, the stockholder should write "Applied For" in the space provided for the
TIN in Part I, and sign and date the Substitute Form W-9. If "Applied For" is
written in Part I and the Depositary is not provided with a TIN within 60 days,
the Depositary will withhold 31% (or such reduced rate as applicable) of all
payments of the purchase price to such stockholder until a TIN is provided to
the Depositary and, if the Depositary is not provided a TIN within 60 days, such
amounts will be paid over to the Internal Revenue Service.

in cash, without interest, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the Offer to Purchase, and in the related Letter of Transmittal (which,
together with the Offer to Purchase and any amendments or supplements thereto,
collectively constitute the "Offer"). The Offer is being made in connection with
the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 28, 2001 (the "Merger
Agreement"), among Parent, Purchaser and the Company. The Merger Agreement
provides, among other things, that as promptly as practicable after the purchase
of Shares pursuant to the Offer, Purchaser will be merged with and into the
Company (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, the Company will continue as
the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") and will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent.

     We (or our nominee) are the holder of record of Shares held by us for your
account. A tender of such Shares can be made only by us as the holder of record
and pursuant to your instructions. The Letter of Transmittal is furnished to you
for your information only and cannot be used by you to tender Shares held by us
for your account.

     We request instructions as to whether you wish to have us tender on your
behalf any or all of the Shares held by us for your account, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer.

     Your attention is invited to the following:

          1. The tender price is $5.267 per Share, net to the seller in cash.

          2. The Offer is being made for any and all outstanding Shares.

          3. The Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously (i)
     determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
     thereby, including each of the Offer, the Merger and the transactions
     contemplated by the Stockholder Agreements (as defined in the Offer to
     Purchase), are fair to, and in the best interests of, the holders of
     Shares, (ii) approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement
     and the transactions contemplated

     thereby, including each of the Offer and the Merger, and (iii) resolved to
     recommend that the holders of Shares accept the Offer and tender Shares
     pursuant to the Offer and, if applicable, vote their Shares in favor of the
     adoption of the Merger Agreement.

          4. The Offer and withdrawal rights will expire at 12:00 Midnight, New
     York City time, on Monday, August 6, 2001, unless the Offer is extended.

          5. The Offer is also conditioned upon, among other things, the
     expiration, termination or satisfaction of the applicable waiting period
     under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended.

          6. Tendering stockholders will not be obligated by Parent or Purchaser
     to pay brokerage fees or commissions or, except as otherwise provided in
     Instruction 6 of the Letter of Transmittal, stock transfer taxes with
     respect to the sale and transfer of any Shares to Purchaser pursuant to the
     Offer. If you own Shares through a broker or other nominee, and your broker
     or nominee tenders your Shares on your behalf, your broker or nominee may
     charge a fee for doing so. You should consult your broker or nominee to
     determine whether any charges or commissions will apply.

          7. Tendering stockholders who fail to complete and sign the Substitute
     Form W-9 may be subject to a required federal backup withholding tax of 31%
     (or such reduced rate as applicable) of the gross proceeds payable to such
     stockholder or other payee pursuant to the Offer.

     If you wish to have us tender any or all of your Shares, please so instruct
us by completing, executing and returning to us the instruction form contained
in this letter. An envelope in which to return your instructions to us is
enclosed. If you authorize the tender of your Shares, all such Shares will be
tendered unless otherwise specified in your instructions. Your instructions
should be forwarded to us in ample time to permit us to submit a tender on your
behalf prior to the expiration of the Offer.

     The Offer is made solely by the Offer to Purchase and the related Letter of
Transmittal and is being made to all holders of Shares. Purchaser is not aware
of any state where the making of the Offer is prohibited by any administrative
or judicial action pursuant to any valid state statute. If Purchaser becomes
aware of any valid state statute prohibiting the making of the Offer or the
acceptance of Shares pursuant thereto, Purchaser will make a good faith effort
to comply with such state statute. If, after such good faith effort, Purchaser
cannot comply with such state statute, the Offer will not be made to (nor will
tenders be accepted from or on behalf of) the holders of Shares in such state.
In any jurisdiction where the securities, blue sky or other laws require the
Offer to be made by a licensed broker or dealer, the Offer shall be deemed to be
made on behalf of Purchaser by one or more registered brokers or dealers
licensed under the laws of such jurisdiction.

fines and/or imprisonment.
(4) MISUSE OF TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS -- If the payer discloses or uses

B, par value $0.001 per share of the Company (the "Series B Shares") owned by
Parent (after giving effect to the assumed purchase of Series B Shares pursuant
to the Stock Purchase Agreement (as defined in the Offer to Purchase)) shall
constitute a majority of the then outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis,
including, without limitation, all Shares issuable upon the conversion of the
Series B Shares or upon the exercise of any options, warrants, or rights, but
excluding any securities that have an effective conversion or exercise price
immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer that is in excess of $5.267 per
Share and (ii) any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), having expired or
been terminated prior to the expiration of the Offer.

     The Offer is being made pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of June 28, 2001 (the "Merger Agreement"), among Parent, Purchaser and the
Company. The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that as

promptly as practicable after the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer and
the satisfaction or waiver, if permissible, of the other conditions set forth in
the Merger Agreement and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ("Delaware Law"), Purchaser
will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"). As a result of the
Merger, the Company will continue as the surviving corporation and will become a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. At the effective time of the Merger (the
"Effective Time"), each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Shares held in the treasury of the Company and other
than Shares held by holders who shall have demanded and perfected appraisal
rights under Delaware Law) shall be canceled and converted automatically into
the right to receive $5.267 in cash, or any higher price that may be paid per
Share in the Offer, without interest (the "Merger Consideration").

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY HAS UNANIMOUSLY (i) DETERMINED THAT
THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, INCLUDING EACH
OF THE OFFER, THE MERGER AND THE STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENTS (AS DEFINED IN THE OFFER
TO PURCHASE) ARE FAIR TO, AND IN THE BEST INTEREST OF, THE HOLDERS OF SHARES,
(ii) APPROVED, ADOPTED AND DECLARED ADVISABLE THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, INCLUDING EACH OF THE OFFER AND THE MERGER,
AND (iii) RESOLVED TO RECOMMEND THAT THE HOLDERS OF SHARES ACCEPT THE OFFER AND
TENDER SHARES PURSUANT TO THE OFFER AND, IF APPLICABLE, VOTE THEIR SHARES IN
FAVOR OF THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

     For purposes of the Offer, Purchaser will be deemed to have accepted for
payment (and thereby purchased) Shares validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn as, if and when Purchaser gives oral or written notice to Mellon
Investor Services LLC (the "Depositary"), of Purchaser's acceptance for payment
of such Shares pursuant to the Offer. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Offer, payment for Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the
Offer will be made by deposit of the purchase price therefor with the
Depositary, which will act as agent for tendering holders of Shares for the
purpose of receiving payments from Purchaser and transmitting such payments to
tendering holders of Shares whose Shares have been accepted for payment. UNDER
NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL INTEREST ON THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR SHARES BE PAID,
REGARDLESS OF ANY DELAY IN MAKING SUCH PAYMENT. In all cases, payment for Shares
tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer will be made only after
timely receipt by the Depositary of (i) the certificates evidencing such Shares
(the "Share Certificates") or timely confirmation of a book-entry transfer of
such Shares into the Depositary's account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility
(as defined in Section 2 of the Offer to Purchase) pursuant to the procedures
set forth in Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase, (ii) the Letter of Transmittal
(or a manually signed facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed,
with any required signature guarantees or an Agent's Message (as defined in
Section 2 of the Offer to Purchase), in connection with the book-entry transfer,
and (iii) any other documents required under the Letter of Transmittal.

     Purchaser expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion (but subject
to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement), at any time and from time
to time, to extend for any reason the period of time during which the Offer is
open, including the occurrence of any condition specified in Section 14 of the
Offer to Purchase, by giving oral or written notice of such extension to the
Depositary. Any such extension will be followed as promptly as practicable by
public announcement thereof, such announcement to be made no later than 9:00
a.m., New York City time, on the next business day after the previously
scheduled expiration date of the Offer. During any such extension, all Shares
previously tendered and not withdrawn will remain subject to the Offer and
subject to the right of a tendering stockholder to withdraw such stockholder's
Shares. If certain of the conditions to the Offer shall not have been satisfied,
and in Parent's sole judgment are reasonably capable of being satisfied within
30 days, Parent will, at the request of the Company, extend the Offer from time
to time unless any such condition is no longer reasonably capable of being
satisfied within such 30 day period in Parent and Purchaser's sole judgment. In
no event will Purchaser be required to extend the Offer beyond December 31,
2001. Following satisfaction or waiver of all the conditions to the Offer and
the acceptance of and payment for all the Shares tendered during the offering
period, Purchaser may elect to provide a subsequent offering period. This would
allow Purchaser to accept additional Shares that were not tendered prior to the
expiration of the Offer. During a subsequent offering period, Shares already
tendered may not be withdrawn.

     Tenders of Shares made pursuant to the Offer are irrevocable except that
such Shares may be withdrawn at any time prior to the Expiration Date and,
unless theretofore accepted for payment and paid for by Purchaser pursuant to
the Offer, may also be withdrawn at any time after September 8, 2001. For the
withdrawal to be effective, a written notice of withdrawal must be timely
received by the Depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the back cover
page of the Offer to Purchase. Any such notice of withdrawal must specify the
name of the person who tendered the Shares to be withdrawn, the number of Shares
to be withdrawn and the name of the registered holder of such Shares, if
different from that of the person who tendered such Shares. If Share
Certificates evidencing Shares to be withdrawn have been delivered or otherwise
identified to the Depositary, then, prior to the physical release of such Share
Certificates, the serial numbers

shown on such Share Certificates must be submitted to the Depositary and the
signature(s) on the notice of withdrawal must be guaranteed by an Eligible
Institution (as defined in Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase), unless such
Shares have been tendered for the account of an Eligible Institution. If Shares
have been tendered pursuant to the procedure for book-entry transfer as set
forth in Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase, any notice of withdrawal must
specify the name and number of the account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility
to be credited with the withdrawn Shares. All questions as to the form and
validity (including the time of receipt) of any notice of withdrawal will be
determined by Purchaser, in its sole discretion, which determination will be
final and binding.

     The information required to be disclosed by Rule 14d-6(d)(1) of the General
Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is
contained in the Offer to Purchase and is incorporated herein by reference.
