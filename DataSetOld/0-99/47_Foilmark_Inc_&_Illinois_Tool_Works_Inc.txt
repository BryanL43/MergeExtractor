    The following is a summary of some of the key terms of this offer to
purchase all of the outstanding common stock of Foilmark, Inc., a Delaware
corporation, for $6.36 per share in cash. We urge you to read carefully the
remainder of this offer to purchase and the accompanying letter of transmittal
because the information in this Summary is not complete. Additional important
information is contained in the remainder of this offer to purchase and the
letter of transmittal.

- -  THE SUB.

    The Sub referred to in this offer to purchase is Dudley Acquisition Inc., a
Delaware corporation formed for the purpose of making this tender offer and the
merger described herein. Dudley Acquisition is a wholly owned subsidiary of
Illinois Tool Works Inc., a Delaware corporation. See Section 8 of this offer to
purchase--"Certain Information Concerning Parent and Sub."

- -  CLASS AND AMOUNT OF SHARES SOUGHT.

    We are seeking to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Foilmark common
stock. See "Introduction" and Section 1 of this offer to purchase--"Terms of the
Offer."

- -  OFFER PRICES; FEES AND COMMISSIONS.

    We are offering to pay $6.36 per share, net to you in cash, less any
required withholding of taxes and without the payment of interest. If you are
the record owner of your shares and you tender your shares to us in the offer,
you will not have to pay brokerage fees or similar expenses. If you own your
shares through a broker or other nominee, and your broker tenders your shares on
your behalf, your broker or nominee may charge you a fee for doing so. You
should consult your broker or nominee to determine whether any charges will
apply. We will not be obligated to pay for or reimburse you for such broker or
nominee charges. See the "Introduction" to this offer to purchase. In addition,
if you do not complete and sign the Substitute Form W-9 included in the letter
of transmittal, you may be subject to required backup federal income tax
withholding. See Instruction 9 to the letter of transmittal.

- -  SOURCE OF FUNDS.

    Dudley Acquisition will be provided funds of up to approximately
$55 million by its parent company, Illinois Tool Works, for the purchase of
shares in the offer. This offer is not conditioned on any financing
arrangements. See Section 9 of this offer to purchase--"Source and Amount of
Funds." Illinois Tool Works expects to obtain such funds from cash on hand and
its other working capital sources. See Section 8 of this offer to
purchase--"Certain Information Concerning Parent and Sub."

- -  TIME FOR ACCEPTANCE.

    You will have until 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Thursday,
May 17, 2001, to tender your shares in the offer. If you cannot deliver
everything that is required in order to make a valid tender by that time, you
may be able to use a guaranteed delivery procedure, which is described later in
this offer to purchase. See Sections 1 and 3 of this offer to purchase--"Terms
of the Offer" and "Procedures for Accepting the Offer and Tendering Shares."

- -  EXTENSION OF THE OFFER.

    Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, we can extend the offer. We
have agreed in the merger agreement that we can extend the offer without
Foilmark's consent for up to 45 days if on the initial expiration date any of
the conditions to our offer are not satisfied or waived. We may also

                                       i

extend the offer for any period required by the United States securities laws or
the SEC or if the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act has not
terminated or expired.

    We may, if all conditions to the offer have been satisfied or waived but the
number of shares tendered in the offer is less than 90% of the fully diluted
shares outstanding, provide a "subsequent offering period" for the offer. A
subsequent offering period will be an additional period of time not to exceed
twenty business days, beginning after we have purchased shares tendered during
the offer, during which shareholders may tender, but not withdraw, their shares
and receive the offer consideration. See Section 1 of this offer to
purchase--"Terms of the Offer."

- -  NOTIFICATION OF EXTENSIONS.

    We will make a public announcement if we extend the offer, and we will
inform American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the depositary for the offer, of
the extension by not later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the next
business day after the day on which the offer was scheduled to expire. See
Section 1 of this offer to purchase--"Terms of the Offer."

- -  SIGNIFICANT CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER.

    We are not obligated to purchase any tendered shares if the total number of
shares validly tendered and not withdrawn is less than a majority of the total
outstanding number of shares of Foilmark voting stock on a fully-diluted basis.
We are not obligated to purchase shares that are validly tendered if there is a
material adverse change in Foilmark's business. The offer is also subject to a
number of other conditions including the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
of 1976, as amended, or a similar provision of any foreign antitrust law. See
Sections 1 and 15 of this offer to purchase--"Terms of the Offer," and "Certain
Conditions of the Offer."

- -  METHOD OF TENDER.

    To tender shares, you must deliver the certificates representing your
shares, together with a completed letter of transmittal, to American Stock
Transfer & Trust Company, the depositary for the offer, not later than the time
the tender offer expires. If your shares are held in street name, the shares can
be tendered by your nominee through the depositary. If you cannot deliver
everything that is required by the depositary by the expiration of the offer,
you may get a little extra time to do so by having a broker, a bank or other
fiduciary which is a member of the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program
or other eligible institution, guarantee that the missing items will be received
by the depositary within three National Association of Securities Dealers
Automated Quotation System trading days. However, the depositary must receive
the missing items within that three trading day period. See Section 3 of this
offer to purchase--"Procedures for Accepting the Offer and Tendering Shares."

- -  TIME OF PAYMENT.

    If all of the conditions of the offer are satisfied or waived and your
shares are accepted for payment, we will pay you promptly after the expiration
of the offer. See Section 2 of this offer to purchase--"Acceptance of Payment
and Payment for Shares."

- -  WITHDRAWAL OF TENDERED SHARES.

    You can withdraw previously tendered shares at any time until the offer has
expired and, if we have not agreed to accept your shares for payment by
June 19, 2001, you can withdraw them at any time after such time until we accept
the shares for payment. This right to withdraw does not apply to any subsequent
offering period. See Section 4 of this offer to purchase--"Withdrawal Rights."

                                       ii

    To withdraw previously tendered shares, you must deliver a written notice of
withdrawal, or a facsimile of one, with the required information to the
depositary while you still have the right to withdraw the shares. If you
tendered by giving instructions to a broker or nominee, you must instruct the
broker or nominee to arrange for the withdrawal of your shares. See Sections 1
and 4 of this offer to purchase--"Terms of the Offer" and "Withdrawal Rights."

- -  BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDATION.

    The offer is being made pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated as
of April 10, 2001 among Foilmark, Illinois Tool Works and Dudley Acquisition.
The Board of Directors of Foilmark has approved and declared advisable the
merger agreement, the offer, the merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement. The Board of Directors of Foilmark recommends that its
stockholders accept the offer and tender their shares. See Section 10 of this
offer to purchase--"Background of the Offer; Past Contacts or Negotiations with
the Company."

- -  MERGER AFTER TENDER OFFER.

    If we purchase at least a majority of the total outstanding number of shares
of Foilmark common stock on a fully-diluted basis in the offer, and all other
applicable conditions are met, Dudley Acquisition will be merged with Foilmark
and all remaining stockholders (other than stockholders who have properly
perfected appraisal rights under Delaware state law) will receive the same price
per share paid in the offer. See "Introduction" and Section 12 of this offer to
purchase--"Purpose of the Offer; Plans for the Company."

- -  APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

    No appraisal rights are available in connection with the offer. After the
offer, appraisal rights will be available to holders of shares who do not vote
in favor of the merger if a stockholder vote is required, subject to and in
accordance with Delaware state law. A holder of shares must properly perfect its
right to seek an appraisal under Delaware state law in connection with the
merger in order to exercise the appraisal rights provided under Delaware state
law. See Section 17 of this offer to purchase--"Appraisal Rights."

- -  MARKET FOR SHARES AFTER THE OFFER.

    If we purchase all of the tendered shares and the merger takes place, there
will no longer be a trading market for the shares. Even if the merger does not
take place, if we purchase all of the tendered shares:

    - there may be so few remaining stockholders and publicly held shares that
      the shares will no longer be eligible to be traded through the National
      Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System;

    - there may not be any public trading market for the shares or, even if
      there is a public market for the shares, the shares may be very thinly
      traded and your ability to buy or sell shares may be very limited; and

    - Foilmark may cease to make quarterly reports, annual reports and other
      disclosures with SEC or otherwise cease being required to comply with the
      SEC's rules relating to publicly held companies. See Section 13 of this
      offer to purchase--"Certain Effects of the Offer."

- -  TAXES

    In general, the receipt of cash by you pursuant to the offer or the merger
will constitute a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax
purposes. For United States federal income tax

                                      iii

purposes, by tendering shares you generally would recognize gain or loss in an
amount equal to the difference between the cash received by you pursuant to the
offer or merger and your tax basis in the shares. In addition, under the United
States federal income tax laws, the payments made by the depositary to you
pursuant to the offer or merger may, under certain circumstances, be subject to
backup withholding at a rate of 31%. To avoid backup withholding with respect to
payments made pursuant to the offer or merger, you must provide the depositary
with proof of an applicable exemption from backup withholding or a correct
taxpayer identification number, and you must otherwise comply with the
applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. See Section 5 of this
offer to purchase "Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations."

- -  RETURN OF TENDERED SHARES.

    If any of the shares you tender are not accepted for purchase for any
reason, certificates representing such shares will be returned to you or to the
person you specify in your tendering documents. See Section 2 of this offer to
purchase--"Acceptance of Payment and Payment for Shares."

- -  RECENT MARKET PRICES.

    On April 10, 2001, the last trading day before Illinois Tool Works and
Foilmark announced that they had signed the merger agreement, the last sale
price of the shares reported on the National Association of Securities Dealers
Automated Quotation System was $3.50 per share. On April 19, 2001, the last
trading day before Dudley Acquisition commenced the offer, the last sale price
of the shares reported on the National Association of Securities Dealers
Automated Quotation System was $6.27 per share. We advise you to obtain a recent
quotation for shares of Foilmark in deciding whether to tender your shares. See
Section 6 of this offer to purchase--"Price Range of Shares."

                                       iv

To: THE HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK
    OF FOILMARK, INC.:

                                  INTRODUCTION

    Dudley Acquisition Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Sub") and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Illinois Tool Works Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"),
hereby offers to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par
value $.01 per Share (the "Shares") of Foilmark, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the "Company"), at a purchase price of $6.36 per Share (the "Offer Price"), net
to the seller in cash, without interest thereon, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Offer to Purchase (as amended or supplemented
from time to time, the "Offer to Purchase") and the related Letter of
Transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal," which, together with the Offer to
Purchase, as each may be amended or supplemented from time to time, collectively
constitute the "Offer").

    Tendering stockholders who are record owners of the Shares and tender their
Shares directly to the Depositary (as defined below) will not be obligated to
pay brokerage fees or commissions or, except as otherwise provided in
Instruction 6 of the Letter of Transmittal, stock transfer taxes with respect to
the purchase of Shares by Sub pursuant to the Offer. Stockholders who hold their
Shares through a broker or nominee should consult such institution as to whether
it charges any service fees. Parent or Sub will pay all charges and expenses of
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as depositary (the "Depositary"), and
MacKenzie Partners, Inc., as information agent (the "Information Agent"),
incurred in connection with the Offer. See Section 18 of this Offer to
Purchase--"Fees and Expenses."

    The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, (1) there being validly
tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer, Shares
representing at least a majority of the total outstanding voting securities of
the Company on a fully-diluted basis after giving effect to the exercise,
conversion or termination of all options, warrants, rights and securities
exercisable or convertible into such voting securities (the "Minimum Tender
Condition") and (2) the applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof)
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the
"HSR Act") shall have terminated or expired and any consents, approvals and
filings under any foreign antitrust law, the absence of which would prohibit the
purchase of all Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, shall have been obtained
or made prior to the acceptance of Shares pursuant to the Offer. The Offer also
is subject to certain other terms and conditions. See Sections 1, 15 and 16 of
this Offer to Purchase.

    The Offer will expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on May 17, 2001
(the "Expiration Date") unless the Offer is extended, in which case the
Expiration Date will be the latest time and date the Offer, as extended,
expires.

    The Offer is being made pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as
of April 10, 2001, among the Company, Parent and Sub (the "Merger Agreement")
pursuant to which, after completion of the Offer and satisfaction or waiver of
certain conditions, Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger")
and the Company will be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").
On the effective date of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), each outstanding
Share (other than Shares owned by Parent, Sub or any subsidiary or affiliate of
Parent, Sub or the Company or held in the treasury of the Company or by
stockholders who have properly perfected appraisal rights under Delaware state
law) will by virtue of the Merger, and without any action by the holder thereof,
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $6.36 per Share in cash, or
any higher price per Share paid pursuant to the Offer, without interest thereon
(the "Merger Consideration"). The Merger Agreement is more fully described in
Section 11 of this Offer to Purchase entitled "The Merger Agreement; Other
Arrangements." Certain United States federal income tax consequences of the
exchange of the Shares pursuant to the Offer and the Merger, as the case may be,
are discussed in Section 5 of this Offer to Purchase entitled "Material United
States Federal Income Tax Considerations."

    The Company Board has by a unanimous vote of those directors present at the
meeting (i) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
(ii) determined that the Offer, the Merger and the other

transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are fair to, and in the best
interests of, the stockholders, (iii) recommended that stockholders accept the
Offer and tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer, and (iv) recommended that
the Company's stockholders approve and adopt the Merger Agreement.

    JPMorgan, a division of Chase Securities Inc., the Company's financial
advisor ("JPMorgan"), has delivered to the Company Board a written opinion dated
April 10, 2001 to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to
the matters described in the opinion, the $6.36 per Share cash consideration to
be received by the Company Stockholders in the Offer and the Merger, taken
together, was fair to such holders from a financial point of view. A copy of
JPMorgan's written opinion, which describes the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is
contained in the Company's Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 (the "Schedule 14D-9") concurrently filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on the date of the Offer to Purchase in
connection with the Offer, a copy of which (without certain exhibits) is being
furnished to stockholders of the Company concurrently herewith. Stockholders are
urged to carefully read the full text of such opinion in its entirety.

    The Company has informed Sub that, as of April 10, 2001, there were
8,092,572 Shares issued and outstanding (excluding 39,200 Shares held in the
Company's treasury), and there were 1,189,414 Shares reserved for issuance
pursuant to outstanding options under the Company's employee stock option plans.

    As of the date of this Offer to Purchase, Parent may be deemed to
beneficially own 2,893,040 Shares (approximately 36% of the Shares issued and
outstanding) by virtue of its rights under the Stock Option and Tender
Agreements entered into with the following Company stockholders: the Estate of
Frank J. Olsen, Sr., Carol J. Robie, Martin A. Olsen, Gloria Olsen, Frank J.
Olsen, Jr., Edward D. Sullivan, Bradford Venture Partners, L.P., and Overseas
Private Investor Partners (the "Stockholders"). The Stock Option and Tender
Agreements require each of the Stockholders to tender their respective Shares
and to vote all of their respective Shares in favor of the Merger and against
any alternative acquisition proposal. In addition, each Stockholder has granted
Parent a proxy to vote their respective Shares and an option to purchase such
Shares that is exercisable under certain conditions. See Section 11 of this
Offer to Purchase--"The Merger Agreement; Other Arrangements."

    The Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions,
including, among other things, the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement
by the requisite vote of the stockholders of the Company, if required. If the
Minimum Tender Condition is satisfied, Sub would have sufficient voting power to
approve the Merger without the affirmative vote of any other stockholder of the
Company. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") if, after
consummation of the Offer, Sub owns at least 90% of the Shares then outstanding,
Sub will be able to cause the Merger to occur without a vote of the Company's
stockholders. However, if Sub owns less than 90% of the Shares then outstanding
after consummation of the Offer, a vote of the Company's stockholders will be
required under the DGCL to approve the Merger. The Company has agreed, if
required, to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders, to be held as promptly as practicable after the expiration of the
Offer for the purpose of obtaining stockholder approval of the Merger Agreement.
See Section 11 of this Offer to Purchase--"The Merger Agreement; Other
Arrangements."

    No appraisal rights are available in connection with the Offer. Stockholders
may have appraisal rights in connection with the Merger if they comply with
applicable Delaware state law and do not vote such Shares in favor of the Merger
or, if no such vote is required, if they comply with the requirements of
Delaware state law regarding the perfection of available appraisal rights. See
Section 17 of this Offer to Purchase--"Appraisal Rights."

    THIS OFFER TO PURCHASE AND THE RELATED LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL CONTAIN
IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE READ CAREFULLY AND IN THEIR ENTIRETY BEFORE
ANY DECISION IS MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE OFFER.

                                THE TENDER OFFER

1.  TERMS OF THE OFFER.

    Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer (including the
terms and conditions of any extension or amendment, if the Offer is extended or
amended), Sub will accept for payment and pay the Offer Price for all Shares
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date as
permitted under Section 4 of this Offer to Purchase entitled "Withdrawal
Rights."

    The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, (1) there being validly
tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer, Shares
representing at least the Minimum Tender Condition and (2) the applicable
waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the HSR Act shall have
terminated or expired and any consents, approvals and filings under any foreign
antitrust law, the absence of which would prohibit the purchase of all Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer shall have been obtained or made prior to the
acceptance of Shares pursuant to the Offer. The Offer is also subject to certain
other terms and conditions. See Sections 1, 15 and 16 of this Offer to Purchase.

    Subject to the limitations set forth in this Offer, the Merger Agreement and
the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC described below, Sub reserves
the right, at any time and from time to time in its sole discretion, to extend
the period during which the Offer is open by giving oral or written notice of
such extension to the Depositary. During any such extension, all Shares
previously tendered and not properly withdrawn will remain subject to the Offer,
subject to the right, if any, of a tendering stockholder to withdraw such
stockholder's Shares. See Section 4 of this Offer to Purchase--"Withdrawal
Rights." There can be no assurance that Sub will exercise its right to extend
the Offer.

    Sub has agreed that it will not, without the prior consent of the Company
(a) reduce the number of Shares subject to the Offer or reduce or waive the
Minimum Tender Condition, (b) reduce the per share consideration to be paid
pursuant to the Offer below the Offer Price, (c) modify or add to the conditions
set forth in Section 15 of this Offer to Purchase, (d) except as provided in the
next paragraph, extend the Offer, or (e) change the form of consideration
payable in the Offer.

    Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Sub may, without the consent of the
Company, (a) extend the Offer for up to forty-five (45) days, if at the initial
scheduled expiration date of the Offer any of the conditions to Sub's obligation
to purchase Shares are not satisfied or waived, until such time as such
conditions are satisfied or waived, (b) extend the Offer, if all of the
conditions to the Offer are satisfied or waived but the number of Shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn is less than ninety percent (90%) of the then
outstanding number of shares on a fully-diluted basis, for an aggregate period
not to exceed twenty (20) business days (for all such extensions); provided that
Sub shall immediately accept and promptly pay for all Shares tendered prior to
the date of such an extension and shall otherwise meet the requirements of
Rule 14d-11 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") in
connection with each such extension, (c) extend the Offer for any period
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the
staff thereof applicable to the Offer, and (d) extend the Offer in increments of
not more than twenty (20) business days, if at the initial scheduled expiration
of the Offer (or any extension thereof) the waiting period (and any extension
thereof) applicable to any of the transactions under the HSR Act shall not have
been terminated or shall not have expired or any consents, approvals and filings
under any foreign antitrust law, the absence of which would prohibit the
consummation of the Merger, shall not have been obtained or made.

    The rights reserved in the foregoing paragraphs are in addition to any
additional rights described in Section 15 of this Offer to Purchase entitled
"Certain Conditions of the Offer."

    Any extension, delay, termination, waiver or amendment will be followed as
promptly as practicable by public announcement. An announcement, in the case of
an extension, will be made no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the
next business day after the previously scheduled expiration of the Offer, in
accordance with the public announcement requirements of Rule 14e-1(d).

Subject to applicable law (including Rules 14d- 4(d), and 14d-6(c) under the
Exchange Act, which require that material changes be promptly disseminated to
stockholders in a manner reasonably designed to inform them of such changes) and
without limiting the manner in which Sub may choose to make any public
announcement, Sub shall have no obligation to publish, advertise or otherwise
communicate any such public announcement other than by issuing a press release
to the Dow Jones News Service.

    Subject to the Merger Agreement, if Sub makes a material change in the terms
of the Offer or the information concerning the Offer or waives any material
condition of the Offer, Sub will disseminate additional tender offer materials
(including by public announcement as set forth below) and extend the Offer to
the extent required by Rules 14d-4(d) and 14e-1 under the Exchange Act. These
rules generally provide that the minimum period during which the Offer must
remain open following material changes in the terms of the Offer or information
concerning the Offer, other than a change in price or a change in the percentage
of securities sought, will depend upon the facts and circumstances then
existing, including the relative materiality of the changed terms or
information. In the SEC's view, an offer should remain open for a minimum of
five (5) business days from the date the material change is first published,
sent or given to stockholders, and, if material changes are made with respect to
information that approaches the significance of price and the percentage of
securities sought, a minimum of ten (10) business days may be required to allow
for adequate dissemination and investor response. With respect to a change in
price, a minimum ten (10) business day period from the date of the change is
generally required to allow for adequate dissemination to stockholders.
Accordingly, if, prior to the Expiration Date, Sub increases or decreases the
consideration offered pursuant to the Offer, and if the Offer is scheduled to
expire at any time earlier than the tenth business day from the date that notice
of the increase or decrease is first published, sent or given to holders of
Shares, Sub will extend the Offer at least until the expiration of such tenth
business day. For purposes of the Offer, a "business day" means any day other
than a Saturday, Sunday or a federal holiday and consists of the time period
from 12:01 a.m. through 12:00 midnight, New York City time.

    Pursuant to, but subject to certain conditions in, the Merger Agreement, Sub
has agreed to (i) accept for payment all Shares validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as permitted under applicable
law, and (ii) pay for such Shares promptly thereafter.

    The Company has provided Sub with the Company's stockholder list and
security position listings for the purpose of disseminating the Offer to holders
of Shares. This Offer to Purchase and the related Letter of Transmittal will be
mailed to record holders of Shares whose names appear on the Company's
stockholder list and will be furnished, for subsequent transmittal to beneficial
owners of Shares, to brokers, dealers, commercial banks, trust companies and
similar persons whose names, or the names of whose nominees, appear on the
stockholder list or, if applicable, who are listed as participants in a clearing
agency's security position listing.

2.  ACCEPTANCE OF PAYMENT AND PAYMENT FOR SHARES.

    Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer (including, if the
Offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of any such extension or
amendment), Sub will accept for payment, purchase and pay for all Shares which
have been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer at
the earliest time following expiration of the Offer when all conditions to the
Offer described in Section 15 of this Offer to Purchase entitled "Certain
Conditions of the Offer" have been satisfied or waived by Sub. Subject to the
Merger Agreement and any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including
Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Sub's obligation to pay for or
return tendered Shares promptly after termination or withdrawal of the Offer),
Sub expressly reserves the right to delay the acceptance for payment of or the
payment for any tendered Shares in order to comply in whole or in part with any
applicable laws, including, without limitation, the HSR Act and similar foreign
statutes and regulations. See Section 16 of this Offer to Purchase--"Certain
Legal Matters; Regulatory Approvals."

    For purposes of the Offer, Sub will be deemed to have accepted for payment
(and thereby purchased) Shares tendered and not properly withdrawn, if and when
Sub gives oral or written notice to the Depositary of Sub's acceptance for
payment of such Shares pursuant to the Offer. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Offer, payment for Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the
Offer will be made by deposit of the purchase price for the Shares with the
Depositary, which will act as agent for tendering stockholders for the purposes
of receiving payments from Sub and transmitting payments to tendering
stockholders. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL SUB PAY INTEREST ON THE PURCHASE PRICE
FOR ANY SHARES ACCEPTED FOR PAYMENT, REGARDLESS OF ANY EXTENSION OF THE OFFER OR
ANY DELAY IN MAKING PAYMENT.

    The reservation by Sub of the right to delay the acceptance, purchase of or
payment for Shares is subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement and the
provisions of Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act, which requires Sub to pay
the consideration offered or return the Shares deposited by or on behalf of
tendering stockholders promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the
Offer.

    In all cases, Sub will pay for Shares purchased in the Offer only after
timely receipt by the Depositary of (i) the certificates representing the Shares
(the "Share Certificates") or confirmation (a "Book-Entry Confirmation") of a
book-entry transfer of such Shares into the Depositary's account at The
Depositary Trust Company (the "Book-Entry Transfer Facility") pursuant to the
procedures set forth in Section 3 of this Offer to Purchase entitled "Procedures
for Accepting the Offer and Tendering Shares;" (ii) the appropriate Letter of
Transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, with any required signature
guarantees or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an Agent's Message (as
defined below) in lieu of the Letter of Transmittal; and (iii) any other
documents required under the Letter of Transmittal.

    "Agent's Message" means a message transmitted by the Book-Entry Transfer
Facility to, and received by, the Depositary and forming a part of a Book-Entry
Confirmation, which message states that the Book-Entry Transfer Facility has
received an express acknowledgment from the participant in the Book-Entry
Transfer Facility tendering the Shares which are the subject of the Book-Entry
Confirmation that the participant has received and agrees to be bound by the
terms of the Letter of Transmittal and that Sub may enforce the Letter of
Transmittal against the participant.

    If Sub does not purchase any tendered Shares pursuant to the Offer for any
reason, or if a holder of Shares submits Share Certificates representing more
Shares than are tendered, Share Certificates representing unpurchased or
untendered Shares will be returned, without expense to the tendering stockholder
(or, in the case of Shares tendered by book-entry transfer into the Depositary's
account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility pursuant to the procedure set forth
in Section 3 of this Offer to Purchase entitled "Procedures for Accepting the
Offer and Tendering Shares," such Shares will be credited to an account
maintained at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility), as promptly as practicable
following the expiration or termination of the Offer.

    If, prior to the Expiration Date, Sub increases the Offer Price, Sub will
pay the increased Offer Price to all holders of Shares that are purchased in the
Offer, whether or not the Shares were tendered before the increase in the Offer
Price.

    Sub reserves the right to transfer or assign, in whole or in part, from time
to time, to one or more direct or indirect subsidiaries of Parent, the right to
purchase all or any portion of the Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, but
any such transfer or assignment will not relieve Sub of its obligations under
the Offer and will in no way prejudice the rights of tendering stockholders to
receive payment for Shares validly tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to
the Offer.

3.  PROCEDURES FOR ACCEPTING THE OFFER AND TENDERING SHARES.

VALID TENDERS

    To tender Shares pursuant to the Offer, a stockholder must comply with one
of the following: (a) a properly completed and duly executed Letter of
Transmittal in accordance with the instructions of the Letter of Transmittal,
with any required signature guarantees, Share Certificates to be tendered and
any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal must be received by
the Depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the back cover of this Offer
to Purchase prior to the Expiration Date, (b) such Shares must be properly
delivered pursuant to the procedures for book-entry transfer, as described
below, and a confirmation of such delivery received by the Depositary, which
confirmation must include an Agent's Message if the tendering stockholder has
not delivered a Letter of Transmittal, prior to the Expiration Date, or (c) the
tendering stockholder must comply with the guaranteed delivery procedures set
forth below.

BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER

    The Depositary will establish accounts with respect to the Shares at the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility for purposes of the Offer within two business days
after the date of this Offer to Purchase. Any financial institution that is a
participant in the system of the Book-Entry Transfer Facility may make a
book-entry delivery of Shares by causing the Book-Entry Transfer Facility to
transfer such Shares into the Depositary's account at the Book-Entry Transfer
Facility in accordance with the Book-Entry Transfer Facility's procedures for
such transfer. However, although delivery of Shares may be effected through
book-entry transfer at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility, either the Letter of
Transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, together with any required
signature guarantees, or an Agent's Message in lieu of the Letter of
Transmittal, and any other required documents, must, in any case, be received by
the Depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the back cover of this Offer
to Purchase on or prior to the Expiration Date, or the tendering stockholder
must comply with the guaranteed delivery procedure set forth below.

SIGNATURE GUARANTEES

    No signature guarantee is required on the Letter of Transmittal where Shares
are tendered (i) by a registered holder of Shares who has not completed either
the box labeled "Special Delivery Instructions" or the box labeled "Special
Payment Instructions" on the Letter of Transmittal or (ii) for the account of a
bank, broker, dealer, credit union, savings association or other entity which is
a member in good standing of a recognized Medallion Program approved by the
Securities Transfer Association Inc., including the Securities Transfer Agents
Medallion Program, the Stock Exchange Medallion Program and the New York Stock
Exchange Medallion Signature Program, or any other "eligible guarantor
institution" as defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act (each of the
foregoing, an "Eligible Institution"). In all other cases, all signatures on a
Letter of Transmittal must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution. See
Instruction 1 of the Letter of Transmittal.

    If a Share Certificate is registered in the name of a person or persons
other than the signer of the Letter of Transmittal, or if payment is to be made
or delivered to a person other than the registered holder, or if a Share
Certificate for unpurchased Shares is to be issued or returned to a person other
than the registered holder, then the Share Certificate must be endorsed or
accompanied by a duly executed stock power, in either case signed exactly as the
name of the registered holder appears on the Share Certificate, with the
signature on such Share Certificate or stock power guaranteed by an Eligible
Institution as provided in the Letter of Transmittal. See Instructions 1 and 5
of the Letter of Transmittal.

GUARANTEED DELIVERY

    If a stockholder desires to tender Shares pursuant to the Offer and the
Share Certificates evidencing such stockholder's Shares are not immediately
available or such stockholder cannot deliver the Share Certificates and all
other required documents to the Depositary prior to the Expiration Date, or such
stockholder cannot complete the procedure for delivery by book-entry transfer on
a timely basis, the stockholder's Shares may nevertheless be tendered, provided
that all of the following conditions are satisfied:

    (i) the tender is made by or through an Eligible Institution;

    (ii) the Depositary receives, as described below, a properly completed and
         duly executed notice of guaranteed delivery (the "Notice of Guaranteed
         Delivery"), substantially in the form made available by Sub, on or
         prior to the Expiration Date; and

   (iii) the Depositary receives the Share Certificates (or a Book-Entry
         Confirmation) evidencing all tendered Shares, in proper form for
         transfer, in each case together with the Letter of Transmittal,
         properly completed and duly executed, with any required signature
         guarantees (or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an Agent's
         Message), and any other documents required by the Letter of
         Transmittal, within three National Association of Securities Dealers
         Automated Quotation System trading days after the date of execution of
         such Notice of Guaranteed Delivery.

NOTICE OF GUARANTEED DELIVERY

    The Notice of Guaranteed Delivery may be delivered by hand or mail or
transmitted by telegram or facsimile transmission to the Depositary and must
include a guarantee by an Eligible Institution in the form set forth in the form
of Notice of Guaranteed Delivery made available by Sub.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, Sub will pay for Shares
only after timely receipt by the Depositary of: (i) Share Certificates
representing, or Book-Entry Confirmation with respect to, the Shares, (ii) a
properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal, together with any
required signature guarantees (or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an
Agent's Message), and (iii) any other documents required by the Letter of
Transmittal.

DETERMINATION OF VALIDITY

    All questions as to the validity, form, eligibility (including time of
receipt) and acceptance for payment of any tender of Shares will be determined
by Sub in its sole discretion, which determination will be final and binding on
all parties. Sub reserves the absolute right to reject any and all tenders
determined by it not to be in proper form or the acceptance for payment of which
may, in the opinion of its counsel, be unlawful. Subject to the terms of the
Merger Agreement, Sub also reserves the absolute right to waive any condition of
the Offer or any defect or irregularity in the tender of any Shares of any
particular stockholder of the Company, whether or not similar defects or
irregularities are waived in the case of other stockholders of the Company.

    Subject to the Merger Agreement, Sub's interpretation of the terms and
conditions of the Offer (including the Letter of Transmittal and the
instructions thereto) will be final and binding. No tender of Shares will be
deemed to have been validly made until all defects and irregularities have been
cured or waived. None of Parent, Sub, or any of their respective affiliates or
assigns, the Depositary, the Information Agent or any other person will be under
any duty to give notification of any defects or irregularities in tenders or
incur any liability for failure to give any such notification.

APPOINTMENT AS PROXY

    By executing the Letter of Transmittal, a tendering stockholder irrevocably
appoints designees of Sub as such stockholder's agents, attorneys-in-fact and
proxies, with full power of substitution, in the

manner set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, to the full extent of such
stockholder's rights with respect to the Shares tendered by such stockholder and
accepted for payment by Sub and with respect to any and all other Shares or
other securities or rights issued or issuable in respect of those Shares or
after the date of this Offer to Purchase. All such powers of attorney and
proxies will be considered irrevocable and coupled with an interest in the
tendered Shares, as the case may be. This appointment will be effective when,
and only to the extent that, Sub accepts such Shares for payment. Upon such
acceptance for payment, all other powers of attorney and proxies given by such
stockholder with respect to such Shares and such other securities or rights
prior to such payment will be revoked without further action, and no subsequent
powers of attorney or proxies may be given, nor may any subsequent written
consent be executed by such stockholder (and, if given or executed, will not be
deemed to be effective) with respect thereto. With respect to the Shares for
which the appointment is effective, the designees of Sub will be empowered to
exercise all voting and other rights of such stockholder as the designees, in
their sole discretion, may deem proper at any annual or special meeting of the
Company's stockholders or any adjournment or postponement thereof, or by written
consent in lieu of any such meeting or otherwise. In order for Shares to be
deemed validly tendered, immediately upon the acceptance for payment of such
Shares, Sub or its designee must be able to exercise full voting rights to the
extent permitted under applicable law with respect to such Shares.

TENDER CONSTITUTES BINDING AGREEMENT

    Sub's acceptance for payment of Shares tendered pursuant to any of the
procedures described above will constitute a binding agreement between Sub and
the tendering stockholder upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the
Offer.

RISK OF LOSS

    Delivery of documents to the Book-Entry Transfer Facility in accordance with
the Book-Entry Transfer Facility's procedures does not constitute delivery to
the Depositary. The method of delivery of Share Certificates, the Letter of
Transmittal and all other required documents, including delivery through the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility, is at the option and risk of the tendering
stockholder, and the delivery will be deemed made only when actually received by
the Depositary (including, in the case of a book-entry transfer, a Book-Entry
Confirmation). If delivery is by mail, registered mail with return receipt
requested and properly insured is recommended. In all cases, sufficient time
should be allowed to ensure timely delivery.

4.  WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS.

    Tenders of Shares made pursuant to the Offer are irrevocable, except that
such Shares may be withdrawn (i) at any time prior to the Expiration Date and
(ii) at any time after Tuesday, June 19, 2001 (or such later date as may apply
if the Offer is extended), unless accepted for payment by Sub pursuant to the
Offer prior to that date. However, pursuant to Rule 14d-7 under the Exchange
Act, no withdrawal rights apply to Shares tendered during any subsequent
offering period and no withdrawal rights apply during a subsequent offering
period with respect to Shares tendered in the Offer and accepted for payment.
See Section 1 of this Offer to Purchase--"Terms of the Offer."

    If Sub extends the Offer, is delayed in its acceptance for payment of
Shares, or is unable to accept Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer for any
reason, then, without prejudice to Sub's rights under the Offer, the Depositary
may nevertheless retain tendered Shares on behalf of Sub, and such Shares may
not be withdrawn, except to the extent that tendering stockholders are entitled
to and duly exercise their withdrawal rights as described in this Section 4. Any
such delay will be by an extension of the Offer to the extent required by law.

    For a withdrawal to be effective, a written or facsimile transmission notice
of withdrawal must be timely received by the Depositary at one of its addresses
set forth on the back cover page of this Offer to Purchase. Any such notice of
withdrawal must specify the name of the person who tendered the

Shares to be withdrawn, the number of Shares to be withdrawn and (if Share
Certificates have been tendered) the name of the registered holder of such
Shares, if different from that of the person who tendered such Shares. If Share
Certificates representing Shares to be withdrawn have been delivered or
otherwise identified to the Depositary, then, prior to the physical release of
such Share Certificates, the serial numbers shown on such Share Certificates
must be submitted to the Depositary and the signature on the notice of
withdrawal must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution, except in the case of
Shares tendered for the account of an Eligible Institution. If Shares have been
tendered pursuant to the procedure for book-entry transfer as set forth in
Section 3 of this Offer to Purchase entitled "Procedures for Accepting the Offer
and Tendering Shares," the notice of withdrawal must specify the name and number
of the account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility to be credited with the
withdrawn Shares, in which case a notice of withdrawal will be effective if
delivered to the Depositary by any method of delivery described in the first
sentence of this paragraph.

    Withdrawals of Shares may not be rescinded. Any Shares properly withdrawn
will be considered not validly tendered for purposes of the Offer. However,
withdrawn Shares may be tendered again at any time prior to the Expiration Date
by following one of the procedures described in Section 3 of this Offer to
Purchase entitled "Procedures for Accepting the Offer and Tendering Shares."

    All questions as to the form and validity (including time of receipt) of any
notice of withdrawal will be determined by Sub in its sole discretion, whose
determination will be final and binding. None of Parent, Sub, or their
respective affiliates or assigns, the Depositary, the Information Agent or any
other person will be under any duty to give notification of any defects or
irregularities in any notice of withdrawal or incur any liability for failure to
give any such notification.

5.  MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS.

    The following is a summary of the material United States federal income tax
consequences that are generally applicable to holders of Shares who exchange
such Shares for cash pursuant to the Offer and to holders of Shares who exchange
such shares for cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is based on the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), Treasury regulations,
and judicial and administrative decisions, all of which are subject to change,
possibly with retroactive effect. Holders of Shares should be aware that this
discussion does not deal with all federal income tax considerations that may be
relevant to particular holders in light of their individual circumstances. For
example, this discussion does not address the tax consequences of the Offer and
the Merger to holders of Shares who are dealers in securities, foreign persons,
or do not hold their Shares as capital assets. Nor does it address the tax
consequences of the Offer or the Merger to holders of Shares who acquired such
Shares through the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as
compensation or holders who are otherwise subject to special tax treatment under
the Code (such as insurance companies, tax-exempt entities and regulated
investment companies). In addition, the following discussion does not address
the tax consequences of the Offer or the Merger to the holders of Shares under
foreign, state, or local tax laws. Accordingly, all holders of Shares are urged
to consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax consequences
to them of the Offer and the Merger, including the applicable federal, state,
local and foreign tax consequences.

    In general, the receipt of cash by the holders of Shares pursuant to the
Offer and/or the Merger will constitute a taxable transaction for United States
federal income tax purposes. For United States federal income tax purposes, a
holder tendering Shares generally would recognize gain or loss in an amount
equal to the difference between the amount of cash received by the holder
pursuant to the Offer and/or the Merger and the holder's tax basis in the
Shares. Generally, gain or loss must be calculated separately for each
identifiable block of Shares (i.e., shares acquired at the same per share cost
in a single transaction). Generally, a holder's gain or loss will be a capital
gain or loss. Any such capital gain or loss will be long term if, as of the date
of the disposition of its Shares, the holder held such Shares for more than one
year. In the case of holders of Shares who are individuals, long-term

capital gains are currently subject to tax at a generally more favorable tax
rate (a maximum rate of 20%). There are limitations on the deductibility of
capital losses.

    In general, a holder of a Company Employee Stock Option who, pursuant to the
Offer and/or the Merger, has such option cancelled in exchange for a cash
payment of an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the price per Share to be
paid pursuant to the Offer and/or the Merger over the exercise price per Share
subject to such option will, for United States federal income tax purposes,
recognize ordinary income to the extent of such excess.

BACKUP UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING.

    Under the United States federal income tax laws, the payments made by the
Depositary to holders of Shares, pursuant to the Offer and/or the Merger may,
under certain circumstances, be subject to backup withholding at a rate of 31%.
To avoid backup withholding with respect to payments made pursuant to the Offer
and/or the Merger, each holder must provide the Depositary with proof of an
applicable exemption from backup withholding or a correct taxpayer
identification number, and must otherwise comply with the applicable
requirements of the backup withholding rules. The Letter of Transmittal provides
instructions on how to provide the Depositary with information to prevent backup
withholding with respect to cash received pursuant to the Offer and/or the
Merger. See Instruction 9 of the Letter of Transmittal. Any amount withheld
under the backup withholding rules is not an additional tax. Rather, the tax
liability of the persons subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the
amount of tax withheld.

    THE FOREGOING IS INTENDED AS A GENERAL SUMMARY ONLY. BECAUSE THE TAX
CONSEQUENCES TO A PARTICULAR HOLDER MAY DIFFER BASED ON THAT HOLDER'S PARTICULAR
CIRCUMSTANCES, EACH HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT HIS OR HER OWN TAX ADVISOR REGARDING
THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE OFFER AND THE MERGER.

Sub that as of April 10, 2001, there were 8,092,572 Shares (excluding 39,200

of the Shares on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotation System was $6.27 per Share.

    Stockholders are urged to obtain a current market quotation for the Shares.

    The Company has never paid dividends on its capital stock, and the Merger
Agreement prohibits the Company from declaring or paying any dividends, except
for the payment of dividends or distributions by a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company to the Company, from the date of the Merger Agreement until the
Effective Time.

10. BACKGROUND OF THE OFFER; PAST CONTACTS OR NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE COMPANY.

    In July of 2000, Foilmark retained JPMorgan, a division of Chase
Securities Inc. ("JPMorgan"), to advise on the Company's strategic alternatives.
The Company Board considered various strategic alternatives and agreed that the
Company should explore the possibility of a strategic transaction. The Company's
management and JPMorgan identified and contacted approximately 60 parties to
determine their interest in strategic transactions involving the Company. Thirty
of these parties expressed an interst in a potential transaction and were sent
confidential information memoranda after executing confidentiality agreements.
By December of 2000, eight of these parties, including Parent, submitted
preliminary indications of interest.

    In January of 2001, five of these parties conducted due diligence
investigations. JPMorgan circulated a bid letter and a form of merger agreement
for these parties to review and use as the basis for final proposals.

    In February of 2001, JPMorgan received final bids from Parent, another
strategic bidder (the "Strategic Bidder") and a financial bidder (the "Financial
Bidder").

    In February of 2001, JPMorgan made a presentation to members of the Company
Board regarding the three final bids submitted, including Parent's. After
evaluation of the three bids as to which bid was in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders, the Company Board agreed to pursue further
discussions with Parent based on several factors, including Parent's knowledge
of the Company, the likelihood of completing Parent's proposed transaction, and
the proposed valuation and consideration offered by Parent.

    In March of 2001, negotiations on the terms of the Merger Agreement and
related agreements commenced among Parent, the Company and their respective
counsel. These negotiations covered all aspects of the transaction, including,
among other things, the representations and warranties made by the parties, the
restrictions on the conduct of their businesses, the conditions to completion of
the Offer and the Merger, the provisions regarding termination, the details of
the "no shop" clause, the amount, triggers and payment of the termination fee
and the consequences of termination and the delivery and terms of the Stock
Option and Tender Agreements.

    On March 15, 2001, the Strategic Bidder submitted a revised bid, increasing
the offer price per Share from an indicated value of approximately $5.30 per
Share to an indicated value of approximately $6.50 per Share (which represented
approximately $2.65 in cash and 2.5 shares of common stock of the Strategic
Bidder for each Share). The Strategic Bidder's revised bid was subject to the
approval of the Strategic Bidder's stockholders and the cash component of the
Strategic Bidder's revised bid was subject to a financing contingency and was
not supported by financing commitments.

    On March 22, 2001, the Company Board held a special telephonic meeting
during which the Company Board discussed the proposed business combination with
Parent. Dechert and Hinckley, Allen & Snyder LLP ("Hinckley"), counsel to the
Company, reviewed the background of the Company's discussions with Parent as
well as the current status of negotiations and reviewed the terms of the
proposed business combination transaction. Representatives of JPMorgan reviewed
the financial terms of the transaction as proposed at that time. The Compny
Board discussed the strategic, business and financial merits and the timing of
the possible transaction with Parent and the terms of Parent's proposal, and
directed management to continue negotiations with Parent.

    On March 23, 2001, subsequent to the completion of additional financial due
diligence, Parent submitted a revised offer. The Company rejected the proposed
revised offer.

    During the weeks of March 26 and April 2, 2001, Parent representatives and
representatives from JPMorgan and certain members of the Company Board had a
series of conversations to discuss the terms and assumptions of the most
recently proposed offer.

    On April 6, 2001, Parent agreed to increase its offer to $6.36 per Share.

    On April 10, 2001, the Company Board held a special telephonic meeting to
review the status of negotiations and discussions with Parent since the Company
Board's March 22, 2001 meeting and reviewed revised drafts of the Merger
Agreement and related agreements. Representatives of JPMorgan, Dechert and
Hinckley also participated. Representatives of Dechert and Hinckley reviewed wth
the Company Board the main legal principles applicable to the proposed business
combination transaction (including the Board's fiduciary duties and authority in
considering the transaction). Representatives of Dechert and Hinckley also
reviewed in detail the principal terms of the proposed Merger Agreement and
related agreements and summarized the remaining open issues and responded to
questions by the Company Board. The Company Board reviewed and discussed the
principal terms of the proposed transaction, including the price to be paid in
the Offer, closing conditions, termination rights, the termination fee, the
Stock Option and Tender Agreements and the Company's ability to consider
alternative proposals. Also at this meeting, JPMorgan reviewed with the Company
Board the financial terms of the transaction proposed at that time and a
financial comparison of Parent's bid with the other bids received and delivered
its opinion to the Company Board to the effect that, as of such date and based
upon and subject to various considerations, the consideration to be received in
the Offer and the Merger, taken together, was fair, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of common stock of the Company. After further deliberation,
the Company Board, by the unanimous vote of all directors present and voting at
the meeting:

    - determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
      thereby, including the Offer and the Merger and the Stock Option and
      Tender Agreements, are consistent with and in furtherance of the long-term
      business strategy of the Company and are advisable and are fair to and in
      the best interest of the Company and its stockholders;

    - approved and adopted the Merger Agreement and the transactions
      contemplated thereby, including the Offer and the Merger and the Stock
      Option and Tender Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby;

    - resolved to recommend acceptance of the Offer and approval and adoption of
      the Merger Agreement by the Company's stockholders; and

    - authorized Frank J. Olsen, Jr. and Robert J. Simon to execute, on behalf
      of the Company, the Merger Agreement and such other documents that certain
      of the Company's officers find necessary or advisable in their sole
      discretion, together with any changes, deletions, additions and
      alterations which such officers approve consistent with the resolutions of
      the Company Board.

    On April 10, 2001, the Merger Agreement was executed by Parent, Sub and the
Company, and Parent and the Company issued a joint press release announcing the
transaction on April 11, 2001.

    On April 20, 2001, Parent and Sub commenced the Offer.

11. THE MERGER AGREEMENT; OTHER ARRANGEMENTS.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

    The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Merger
Agreement, a copy of which is filed as exhibit (d)(1) to the Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO (the "Schedule TO") filed by Parent and Sub on
April 20, 2001 with the SEC in connection with the Offer. The following summary
may not contain all of the information important to you, and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is deemed incorporated by
reference in this Offer to Purchase. Accordingly, we encourage you to read the
entire Merger Agreement. Capitalized terms used in this summary and not
otherwise defined in this Offer to Purchase shall have the meanings set forth in
the Merger Agreement.

    THE OFFER.  The Merger Agreement provides that, following the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions of the Offer set forth in Section 15 of this Offer
to Purchase entitled "Certain Conditions of the Offer," Sub will purchase all
shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn. Parent and
Sub have agreed not to, without the prior consent of the Company (a) reduce

the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer or reduce or
waive the Minimum Tender Condition, (b) reduce the consideration per share of
Company Common Stock to be paid pursuant to the Offer below the Offer Price,
(c) modify or add to the conditions of the Offer, (d) except for the specific
instances described below, extend the Offer, or (e) change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer.

    Sub may, however, without the consent of the Company, extend the Offer
(a) for up to forty-five (45) days, if at the initial expiration date of the
Offer any of the conditions to the Offer are not satisfied or waived, (b) for an
aggregate of twenty (20) business days if all of the conditions to the Offer
have been satisfied but less than ninety percent (90%) of the then outstanding
number of shares have been validly tendered and not withdrawn, provided that Sub
immediately accepts and promptly pays for all shares tendered prior to the date
of the extension, (c) for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC, or (d) in increments of not more than
twenty business days, if at the expiration of the Offer, or any extension
thereof, the Merger cannot be consummated because the waiting period under the
HSR Act shall not have terminated or any foreign antitrust law approvals shall
not have been obtained.

    DIRECTORS.  The Merger Agreement provides that promptly after Sub purchases
and pays for that number of shares of Company Common Stock which represents at
least a majority of the Fully Diluted Shares, Sub shall be entitled to designate
such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company
Board which is equal to the product of the total number of directors on the
Company Board after giving effect to the directors designated pursuant to this
sentence multiplied by the percentage that the number of shares of Company
Common Stock so accepted for payment by Sub bears to total number of Fully
Diluted Shares, and the Company shall, at such time, cause Sub's designees to be
so appointed or elected. However, until the Effective Time, the Company shall
retain as members of the Company Board at least two directors who were directors
as of the date of the Merger Agreement. Following the election or appointment of
Sub's designees and prior to the Effective Time, any amendment or termination of
the Merger Agreement, extension for the performance or waiver of the obligations
of Parent or Sub or waiver of the Company's rights under the Merger Agreement,
requires the concurrence of each member of the Company Board who was a member on
the date of the Merger Agreement.

    THE MERGER.  The Merger Agreement provides that, following satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company in accordance with the DGCL, with the Company
surviving and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Each issued and
outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than shares owned by the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries, Parent or Sub or stockholders, if any, who
are entitled to and who exercise their appraisal rights under the DGCL) will be
converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration, without interest.

    COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS.  Each Company Employee Stock Option outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested, shall be
canceled in exchange for a cash payment (subject to any required withholding of
Taxes and without interest) of an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the
price per share of Company Common Stock to be paid pursuant to the Offer over
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Employee Stock Option, multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common
Stock that otherwise would have been issued upon exercise of such Company
Employee Stock Option. In addition, each of the Company Option Plans and the
Individual Options will be terminated and any provision in a Company Plan that
provides for the issuance, transfer or grant of or an interest in the capital
stock of the Company shall be deleted to ensure that after the Effective Time a
holder of a Company Employee Stock Option or a participant in any Company Plan
will not have any right to acquire capital stock of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation.

    EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN.  The Company Board has agreed to take such
actions under the Company's Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan
("ESPP") as may be necessary or desirable in Parent's reasonable judgment to
extend any Offering Period (as defined in the ESPP)

pending on the date of the Merger Agreement until such time as the Merger
Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms without the Offer or
the Merger being consummated (as so extended, the "Pending Offering Period").
The extension of the Offering Period ensures that the Company's employees do not
exercise any option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under the
ESPP during the term of the Merger Agreement. In addition, prior to Sub's first
acceptance of shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer, the Company Board
will take such actions as may be necessary or desirable in Parent's reasonable
judgment to (i) cancel any Pending Offering Period without any further purchases
of shares of Company Common Stock, (ii) refund all amounts contributed during
the Pending Offering Period, and (iii) terminate the ESPP effective no later
than the date of Sub's first acceptance of shares of Company Common Stock in the
Offer. The Company Board has also made a determination that the consummation of
the Offer constitutes a "change-in-control event" within the meaning of the
ESPP.

    STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL.  The DGCL requires that the Merger be adopted by the
Company Board and, if the "short-form" merger procedure described below is not
available, approved by the holders of a majority of the Company's outstanding
voting securities. The Company Board unanimously adopted and approved the Offer,
the Merger and the Merger Agreement by all members present. As a result, the
only additional action that may be necessary to effect the Merger is approval of
the Merger Agreement by the Company's stockholders if a "short-form" merger
procedure is not available. If required by the DGCL, the Company will call and
hold a special meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable following
the consummation of the Offer for the purposes of considering and voting upon
the adoption of the Merger Agreement. At any such meeting, all shares of Company
Common Stock then owned by Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent will be voted
in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger. If Sub acquires
through the Offer voting power with respect to at least a majority of the Fully
Diluted Shares (which would be the case if the Minimum Tender Condition were
satisfied and Sub were to accept for payment shares of Company Common Stock
tendered pursuant to the Offer), Sub will have sufficient voting power to effect
the Merger without the affirmative vote of any other stockholder of the Company.

    The DGCL also provides for a "short-form" merger procedure if a corporation
owns at least 90% of the outstanding shares of each class of voting stock of a
corporation. A "short-form" merger may be consummated without prior notice to,
or the approval of, the other stockholders. Accordingly, if, as a result of the
Offer, Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent acquires or controls the voting
power of at least 90% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, Sub
intends to effect the Merger without prior notice to, or any action by, any
other stockholder of the Company.

    CONDITIONS TO EACH PARTY'S OBLIGATION TO EFFECT THE MERGER.  The Merger
Agreement provides that the respective obligations of each party to effect the
Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions:
(i) if required, the Company shall have obtained the Company Stockholder
Approval; (ii) the waiting period under the HSR Act shall have been terminated
or shall have expired and any consents, approvals and filings under any foreign
antitrust law, the absence of which would prohibit the consummation of Merger,
shall have been obtained or made; (iii) no temporary restraining order,
preliminary or permanent injunction or other Order or other legal restraint or
prohibition preventing or imposing any conditions or limitations on the
consummation of any of the Transactions shall be in effect; and (iv) Sub shall
have accepted shares of Company Common Stock for payment pursuant to the Offer,
provided that this condition shall not be applicable if, in breach of the Merger
Agreement or the terms of the Offer, Sub fails to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn.

    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  The Merger Agreement contains customary
representations and warranties of the parties which expire as of the Effective
Time. These include representations and warranties of the Company with respect
to, among other things, organization, standing and power; company subsidiaries
and equity interests; capital structure; authorizations, validity of the Merger

(B) cancel any material indebtedness or waive any claims or rights of

(xii) amend any Material Contract involving amounts in excess of $100,000 or

warranties becoming untrue or any condition to the Offer or the Merger not being

    REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS; NOTIFICATION.  Each of the parties to the Merger
Agreement have agreed, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
to the Merger, to use their respective reasonable best efforts to take all
actions necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Offer, the Merger and
the other Transactions, including (i) obtaining all necessary consents and
approvals from Governmental Entities, and making all necessary registrations and
filings with any Governmental Entity, including under the HSR Act,
(ii) obtaining all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties,
(iii) defending any lawsuit or other legal proceeding challenging the Merger
Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the Transactions.

    In addition, the Company and the Company Board have agreed to take all
commercially reasonable action necessary to ensure that no state takeover
statute or regulation is or becomes applicable, and if any state takeover
statute or regulation should become applicable, take all commercially reasonable
action necessary to ensure that the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements.

    Without Parent's prior written consent, the Company shall not (and will not
allow any Company Subsidiary to), commit to any divestitures, licenses, hold
separate arrangements or similar matters affecting business operating practices.
If such divestitures, licenses, hold separate arrangements or similar matters
are contingent on consummation of the Offer, the Company shall commit to, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to commit to and use their reasonable best efforts to effect), any
such divestitures, licenses, hold separate arrangements or similar matters.
However, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to agree
(with respect to Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries) to
any divestitures, licenses, hold separate arrangements or similar matters,
including covenants affecting business operating practices, if such actions
would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

    NO SOLICITATION.  The Merger Agreement provides that until the earlier of
the Effective Time or the termination of the Merger Agreement, the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries shall not (and will use its best efforts to cause each
of its and each of its Subsidiaries' officers, directors or management employees
or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representatives retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries not to) directly or
indirectly (i) solicit, encourage, engage in discussions or negotiate with,
provide information with respect to the Company, enter into an agreement, or
take any other action intended to facilitate any inquiry or effort relating to
an Alternative Acquisition (an "Alternative Acquisition Proposal"), or
(ii) make or authorize any statement, recommendation or solicitation in support
of any possible Alternative Acquisition. However, prior to Sub accepting any
shares of Company Common Stock for payment pursuant to the Offer, the Company
Board may, to the extent required by the its fiduciary obligations under
Delaware law, in response to a proposal for an Alternative Acquisition (as
defined below) that the Company Board determines, in good faith after
consultation with independent counsel and an independent financial advisor, is
or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Company Proposal (as defined
below), that was not solicited by the Company or otherwise resulted from a
breach of the Merger Agreement (subject to providing prior written notice to
Parent), (x) furnish information with respect to the Company to the Person or
group making such Alternative Acquisition Proposal and its representatives
pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with terms not materially more favorable
than those applicable to Parent under the Confidentiality Agreement and
(y) participate in discussions and negotiations with such Person regarding such
Alternative Acquisition Proposal.

    The Company Board may not (i) withdraw or modify its approval or
recommendation of the Merger Agreement, the Offer or the Merger in a manner
adverse to Parent or Sub, (ii) approve or permit the Company to enter into any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, definitive agreement or similar
agreement which is reasonably likely to lead to any Alternative Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend any Alternative Acquisition Proposal or
(iv) propose, agree or resolve to take any of the foregoing actions. However, if
prior to Sub's acceptance for payment of the Company Common Stock pursuant to
the Offer, the Company Board receives a Superior Company Proposal and the
Company Board determines in good faith, that it is necessary to do so in order
to comply with its fiduciary obligations under Delaware law, the Company Board
may, during such period, in response to a Superior Company Proposal that was
unsolicited and did not otherwise result from a breach of its no solicitation
covenant, withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of the Offer, the
Merger and the Merger Agreement and approve or recommend such Superior Company
Proposal.

    The Company must, within 24 hours, advise Parent in writing of any
Alternative Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry that could lead to any
Alternative Acquisition Proposal, which writing shall include the identity of
the Person making such Alternative Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the

material terms of any such Alternative Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. The
Company has also agreed to keep Parent reasonably informed of the status of any
Alternative Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and to provide to Parent copies of
all material correspondence provided to or provided by the Company in connection
with any Alternative Acquisition Proposal.

    "Alternative Acquisition" means any possible business combination with or
any possible acquisition of the Company (whether by way of merger, purchase of
capital stock, purchase of assets or otherwise) or any material portion of its
capital stock or assets.

    "Superior Company Proposal" means any proposal made by a third party to
acquire all or substantially all the equity securities or assets of the Company,
on terms the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment (after
consultation with a financial adviser, with only customary qualifications, and
independent legal counsel) to be superior for the holders of the Company Common
Stock, from a financial point of view, to the Offer and the Merger, taking into
account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and the Merger Agreement,
(including any proposal made by Parent to amend the terms of the Merger
Agreement, the Offer and the Merger) including the likelihood of consummation.

    TERMINATION.  The Merger Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after
approval by the stockholders of the Company:

        (a) by mutual written consent of Parent, Sub and the Company;

        (b) by either Parent or the Company:

            (i) if Sub has not accepted for payment any shares of Company Common
                Stock pursuant to the Offer on or before August 31, 2001 (the
                "Outside Date"), unless the failure to consummate the Merger is
                the result of a breach of the Merger Agreement by the party
                seeking to terminate the Merger Agreement;

            (ii) if any Governmental Entity issues an Order or takes any other
                 action (that has become final and nonappealable) permanently
                 enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger;

           (iii) if Sub shall have failed to commence the Offer within ten
                 business days following the date of the Merger Agreement or the
                 Offer shall have terminated or expired without Sub having
                 purchased any shares of Company Common Stock, provided that
                 this right to terminate is not available to any party whose
                 failure to fulfill its obligations under the Merger Agreement
                 or the failure of whose representations and warranties to be
                 true results in the failure of any such condition; or

            (iv) if the Company Stockholder Approval is not obtained;

        (c) by Parent, if Sub has not accepted for payment any shares of Company
    Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and the Company breaches or fails to
    perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties,
    covenants or agreements contained in the Merger Agreement, and such breach
    or failure to perform gives rise to the failure of a condition to the Offer
    that cannot be cured within 30 days of receiving written notice from Parent
    (provided that Parent is not then in material breach of the Merger
    Agreement);

        (d) by Parent, if the Company Board withdraws or modifies in a manner
    adverse to Parent its approval or recommendation of the Offer, the Merger or
    the Merger Agreement or fails to recommend that its stockholders accept the
    Offer or give the Company Stockholder Approval or if the Company Board fails
    to reaffirm publicly and unconditionally its recommendation to the Company's
    stockholders within 10 business days of Parent's written request to do so;

        (e) by the Company, if Sub has not accepted for payment any shares of
    Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and the Company Board shall have
    finally determined to approve, endorse or recommend an Alternative
    Acquisition Proposal (provided the Company has paid or concurrently pays to
    Parent the Termination Fee described below); or

        (f) by the Company, if Sub has not accepted for payment any shares of
    Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and Parent or Sub breaches or
    fails to perform in any material respect any of its representations,
    warranties, covenants or agreements contained in the Merger Agreement and
    such breach or failure to perform gives rise to the failure of a condition
    to the Merger that cannot be cured within 30 days of receiving written
    notice from the Company (provided that the Company is not then in material
    breach of the Merger Agreement).

    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company cannot terminate the Merger
Agreement until at least seventy-two hours have passed since the Company's
written notice to Parent advising that the Company has received a Superior
Company Proposal, the material terms such Superior Company Proposal and that the
Company intends to accept such Superior Company Proposal.

    EFFECT OF TERMINATION; FEES AND EXPENSES.  The Company shall pay to Parent a
fee in an amount equal to $2,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") if the Merger
Agreement is terminated under paragraphs (c)(but only with respect to a breach
of its no solicitation covenant),(d) or (e) described above under
"--Termination." If Parent receives the Termination Fee, such fee shall be
Parent's exclusive remedy for any breach of the Company's representations,
warranties or covenants contained in the Merger Agreement.

    INDEMNIFICATION; D&O INSURANCE.  The Merger Agreement provides that all
rights to indemnification in favor of the current or former directors, officers
or employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries under their respective
organizational documents (or in any indemnification agreement to which it is a
party) for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time shall survive
the Merger and continue for a period of not less than six years from the
Effective Time.

    In addition, Parent shall maintain for a period of six years from the
Effective Time the Company's current D&O Insurance policy to the extent that it
provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time, provided the
annual premium is not in excess of 150% of the last annual premium paid prior to
the date of the Merger Agreement (the "Maximum Premium"). Parent may, however,
satisfy its obligations by requesting that the Company extend coverage under its
D&O Insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy on terms and conditions no
less advantageous than the existing D&O Insurance, provided the cost of such
coverage does not exceed three times the Maximum Premium. Finally, Parent may
satisfy its obligations under this provision if Parent's D&O Insurance provides
(or is amended to provide) substantially similar coverage for events occurring
prior to the Effective Time for persons who are directors and officers of the
Company on the date of the Merger Agreement.

    CERTAIN EMPLOYEE MATTERS.  Parent has agreed to maintain each Company Plan
as in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement (other than the Company Option
Plans and the ESPP) or provide plans with benefits no less favorable than those
provided under each Company Plan for a period of one year after the Effective
Time. If any employees of the Surviving Corporation become participants in any
substitute plan, credit will be given to employees under such plan for all prior
service with the Company for purposes of determining eligibility only.

GOING PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS.

    The Merger would have to comply with any applicable federal law operative at
the time of its consummation including Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act which
applies to certain "going private" transactions. If applicable, Rule 13e-3
requires, among other things, that certain financial information concerning the
fairness of the Merger and the consideration offered to minority stockholders in
the Merger be filed with the SEC and disclosed to stockholders prior to the
consummation of the Merger. Sub does not believe that Rule 13e-3 will be
applicable to the Merger unless the Merger is consummated more than one year
after the termination of the Offer

CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT.

    The following is a summary of certain provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement. This summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the complete text of the

Confidentiality Agreement, a copy of which is filed with the SEC as
Exhibit (d)(2) to the Schedule TO and incorporated herein by reference.
Capitalized terms not otherwise defined below shall have the meanings set forth
in the Confidentiality Agreement.

    The Confidentiality Agreement has a three-year term and provides that the
Company will make available to Parent certain information concerning its
business, financial condition, operations and assets (the "Evaluation Material")
solely for purposes of evaluating the potential acquisition of all or any
portion of the assets, securities or business of the Company. Parent has agreed
to keep the Evaluation Material confidential, except for disclosure to its
Representatives who need such information in order to evaluate the potential
transaction.

STOCK OPTION AND TENDER AGREEMENTS.

    Parent has entered into Stock Option and Tender Agreements with the
following Stockholders: The Estate of Frank J. Olsen, Sr., Carol J. Robie,
Martin A. Olsen, Gloria Olsen, Frank J. Olsen, Jr., Edward D. Sullivan, Bradford
Venture Partners, L.P., and Overseas Private Investor Partners (collectively,
the "Stockholders"). The following is a summary of certain provisions of the
Stock Option and Tender Agreements. This summary does not purport to be complete
and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Stock
Option and Tender Agreements, copies of which are filed with the SEC as Exhibits
(d)(3)-(9) to the Schedule TO and incorporated herein by reference. Capitalized
terms not otherwise defined below shall have the meanings set forth in the Stock
Option and Tender Agreements.

    The Stock Option and Tender Agreements require each of the Stockholders to
tender their respective Shares to Parent as soon as practicable after
commencement of the Offer. In addition, the Stockholders have granted Parent the
Option to purchase all of their respective Shares for the higher of the Offer
Price in cash or such higher price per Share in cash as Parent or any of its
subsidiaries may offer to pay for Shares in the Offer, beginning on the date
that the Merger Agreement is terminated after an Alternative Acquisition
Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) has been made, proposed,
communicated or disclosed in any manner, and ending on the date (the "Expiration
Date") that is the later of ten business days following (1) such termination of
the Merger Agreement and (2) the receipt by Parent of any of the governmental
consents or the expiration of any waiting periods which would otherwise prevent
the consummation of the Merger. If Parent exercises the Option, but does not
acquire a number of Shares representing at least the Minimum Tender Condition
within twelve months after such exercise, and within such twelve-month period
Parent sells the Shares acquired upon exercise of the Option pursuant to a
merger, liquidation, reorganization or business combination involving the
Company, then upon consummation of such disposition, Parent will pay to the
Stockholders in cash the amount, if any, by which the consideration per Share
received by Parent in the disposition exceeds the Offer Price (or such higher
price per Share as Parent or any of its subsidiaries may offer to pay for Shares
in the Offer), multiplied by the number of Shares sold in the disposition.

    The Stockholders have also agreed to vote all of their respective Shares in
favor of approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger and against any
alternative acquisition. In addition, the Stockholders have granted Parent an
irrevocable proxy to vote all of their respective Shares in favor of approval of
the Merger Agreement and the Merger and against any alternative acquisition.

    The Stock Option and Tender Agreements may be terminated at any time (1) by
mutual written consent of the parties, (2) by either party on or after the
termination of the Merger Agreement other than pursuant to an Applicable
Termination, or (3) by either party on or after the Expiration Date, provided
that Parent's obligations with respect to any disposition within twelve months
after exercise of the Options shall survive any such termination.

LETTER AGREEMENT WITH FRANK J. OLSEN, JR.

    On April 10, 2001, Parent entered into a letter agreement with Frank J.
Olsen, Jr. which, subject to the consummation of the Merger, amends the terms
and conditions of his employment agreement. Pursuant to the letter agreement,
Parent agreed to honor the salary, bonus and other financial elements

of Mr. Olsen's employment agreement and employ Mr. Olsen as a Vice President and
General Manager of Parent. In addition, the letter agreement provides that,
except in connection with a marked negative change in the scope of Mr. Olsen's
duties from his position as Vice President, the Merger will not constitute a
"change of control," "take-over transaction" or a "termination event" for
purposes of the employment agreement.

    The summary of the terms of Mr. Olsen's letter agreement is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the complete text of the letter agreement, which has
been filed as Exhibit d(12) to the Schedule TO, and is incorporated herein by
reference.

12. PURPOSE OF THE OFFER; PLANS FOR THE COMPANY.

    PURPOSE OF THE OFFER.  The purpose of the Offer is to acquire control of,
and the entire common stock equity interest in, the Company. The purpose of the
Merger is to acquire all outstanding Shares not tendered and purchased pursuant
to the Offer. If the Offer is successful, Sub intends to consummate the Merger
as soon as practicable following the satisfaction or waiver of each of the
conditions to the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement.

    PLANS FOR THE COMPANY.  If at least enough Shares equal to the Minimum
Tender Condition are purchased pursuant to the Offer, Parent will designate its
representatives to be a majority of the Company Board. It is also expected that,
initially following the Merger, the business operations of the Company will be
continued by the surviving corporation substantially as they are currently being
conducted. The directors of Sub will be the initial directors of the surviving
corporation, and the officers of the Company will be the initial officers of the
surviving corporation. Certain members of the Company's current management are
not expected to continue with the surviving corporation following the Merger.
Upon completion of the Offer and the Merger, Parent intends to conduct a
detailed review of the Company and its assets, corporate structure,
capitalization, operations, policies, management and personnel. After such
review, Parent will determine what actions or changes, if any, would be
desirable in light of the circumstances which then exist.

    Except as described in this Offer to Purchase, neither Parent nor Sub has
any present plans or proposals that would relate to or result in: (i) any
extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or
liquidation involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) a purchase,
sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, (iii) any change in the Company Board or management, including,
but not limited to, any plans or proposals to change the number or term of
directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the Company Board or to change
any material term of the employment contract of any executive officer, (iv) any
material change in the Company's capitalization, indebtedness or dividend
policy, (v) any other material change in the Company's corporate structure or
business, (vi) a class of securities being delisted from a national securities
exchange or ceasing to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation
system of a registered national securities association, or (vii) a class of
equity securities of the Company becoming eligible for termination of
registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the Exchange Act. See Sections 11
and 13 of this Offer to Purchase--"The Merger Agreement; Other Arrangements" and
"Certain Effects of the Offer," respectively.

13. CERTAIN EFFECTS OF THE OFFER.

    MARKET FOR THE SHARES.  The purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer will
reduce the number of holders of Shares and the number of Shares that might
otherwise trade publicly and could adversely affect the liquidity and market
value of the remaining Shares held by stockholders other than Sub. Sub cannot
predict whether the reduction in the number of Shares that might otherwise trade
publicly would have an adverse or beneficial effect on the market price for, or
marketability of, the Shares or whether such reduction would cause future market
prices to be greater or less than the Offer Price.

    STOCK QUOTATION.  Listing the Shares on the National Association of
Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System is voluntary, so the Company may
terminate such listing at any time. Neither Parent nor Sub has any intention to
cause the Company to seek to terminate the inclusion of the Shares on

the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System prior
to the Merger. However, depending upon the number of Shares purchased pursuant
to the Offer, the Shares may no longer meet the standards for continued
inclusion on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation
System. According to its published guidelines, the National Association of
Securities Dealers considers delisting the Shares if, among other things, the
number of publicly held Shares, as the case may be, falls below 750,000 or the
number of holders of round lots of Shares falls below 400. Shares held by
officers or directors of the Company or their immediate families, or by any
beneficial owner of more than 10% or more of the Shares, ordinarily will not be
considered as being publicly held for this purpose. In the event the Shares are
no longer eligible for listing on the National Association of Securities Dealers
Automated Quotation System, quotations might still be available from other
sources. The extent of the public market for the Shares and the availability of
such quotations would, however, depend upon the number of holders of Shares at
such time, the interest in maintaining a market in Shares on the part of
securities firms, the possible termination of registration of Shares under the
Exchange Act as described below and other factors. If, as a result of the
purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Shares no longer meet the criteria
for continued inclusion in the National Association of Securities Dealers
Automated Quotation System, the market for the Shares could be adversely
affected.

    EXCHANGE ACT REGISTRATION.  The Shares are currently registered under the
Exchange Act. The purchase of the Shares pursuant to the Offer may result in the
Shares becoming eligible for deregistration under the Exchange Act. Such
registration of the Shares may be terminated upon application of the Company to
the SEC if the Shares are not listed on a national securities exchange and there
are fewer than 300 holders of record of the Shares. Termination of registration
of the Shares under the Exchange Act would substantially reduce the information
required to be furnished by the Company to its stockholders and to the SEC and
would make certain provisions of the Exchange Act no longer applicable to the
Company, such as the short-swing profit recovery provisions of Section 16(b) of
the Exchange Act, the requirement of furnishing a proxy statement pursuant to
Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with stockholders' meetings and
the related requirement of furnishing an annual report to stockholders, and the
requirements of Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act with respect to "going
private" transactions. Furthermore, the ability of "affiliates" of the Company
and persons holding "restricted securities" of the Company to dispose of such
securities pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 may
be impaired or eliminated. If registration of the Shares under the Exchange Act
were terminated, the Shares would no longer be "margin securities" or be
eligible for inclusion on the National Association of Securities Dealers
Automated Quotation System

    Sub believes that the purchase of the Shares pursuant to the Offer may
result in the Shares becoming eligible for deregistration under the Exchange Act
and it would be the intention of Sub to cause the Company to make an application
for termination of registration of the Shares as soon as possible after
successful completion of the Merger, if the Shares are then eligible for such
termination.

    MARGIN REGULATIONS.  The Shares are currently "margin securities" under the
Regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the
"Federal Reserve Board"), which has the effect, among other things, of allowing
brokers to extend credit on the collateral of the Shares. Depending upon factors
similar to those described above regarding the market for the Shares and stock
quotations, it is possible that, following the Offer, the Shares would no longer
constitute "margin securities" for the purposes of the margin regulations of the
Federal Reserve Board and therefore could no longer be used as collateral for
loans made by brokers.

14. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.

    The Merger Agreement provides that from the date of the Merger Agreement
until the Effective Time, unless Parent has consented in writing, the Company
may not declare, set aside or pay any dividends on, or make any other
distributions in respect of, any of its capital stock.

15. CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER.

    Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or the Merger Agreement, Sub
shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules
and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act
(relating to Sub's obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly
after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), to pay for any Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer unless (i) there shall have been validly tendered
and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer that number of Shares
which would represent at least a majority of the Fully Diluted Shares (the
"Minimum Tender Condition") and (ii) the waiting period (and any extension
thereof) applicable to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer under the
HSR Act shall have been terminated or shall have expired and any consents,
approvals and filings under any foreign antitrust law, the absence of which
would prohibit the purchase of all Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, shall
have been obtained or made prior to the acceptance of Shares pursuant to the
Offer. The term "Fully Diluted Shares" means all outstanding securities entitled
generally to vote in the election of directors of the Company on a fully diluted
basis, after giving effect to the exercise, conversion or termination of all
options, warrants, rights and securities exercisable or convertible into such
voting securities. Furthermore, notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or
the Merger Agreement, Sub shall not be required to accept for payment or,
subject as aforesaid, to pay for any Shares not theretofore accepted for payment
or paid for, and may terminate or amend the Offer, with the consent of the
Company or if, at any time on or after the date of the Merger Agreement and
before the acceptance of such Shares for payment or the payment therefor, any of
the following conditions exists:

        (a) there shall have been instituted or pending any suit, action or
    proceeding that has a reasonable likelihood of success, (i) challenging the
    acquisition by Parent or Sub of any Shares, seeking to restrain or prohibit
    the making or consummation of the Offer or the Merger or any other
    transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the Stock Option and
    Tender Agreements, or seeking to obtain from the Company, Parent or Sub any
    damages that are material in relation to the Company and its subsidiaries
    taken as a whole, (ii) seeking to prohibit or limit the ownership or
    operation by the Company, Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries of
    any material portion of the business or assets of the Company, Parent or any
    of their respective subsidiaries, or to compel the Company, Parent or any of
    their respective subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate any material
    portion of the business or assets of the Company, Parent or any of their
    respective subsidiaries, as a result of the Offer, the Merger or any of the
    other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the Stock Option
    and Tender Agreements, (iii) seeking to impose limitations on the ability of
    Parent or Sub to acquire or hold, or exercise full rights of ownership of,
    any Shares, including the right to vote the Shares purchased by it on all
    matters properly presented to the stockholders of the Company, (iv) seeking
    to prohibit Parent or any of its subsidiaries from effectively controlling
    in any material respect the business or operations of the Company and the
    subsidiaries of the Company, or (v) which otherwise is reasonably likely to
    have a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent or Sub to perform
    its obligations under the Merger Agreement or on the ability of Parent or
    Sub to consummate the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions or a
    material adverse effect on the business, assets and liabilities (taken
    together), results of operations, financial condition or prospects of the
    Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, or a material adverse effect
    on the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under the Merger
    Agreement or on the ability of the Company to consummate the Offer, the
    Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and
    the Stock Option and Tender Agreements (a "Company Material Adverse
    Effect");

        (b) any statute, rule, regulation, legislation, interpretation,
    judgment, order or injunction shall be enacted, entered, enforced,
    promulgated, amended or issued with respect to, or deemed applicable to, or
    any consent or approval withheld with respect to the Offer, the Merger or
    any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the
    Stock Option and Tender Agreements, by any Governmental Entity that is
    reasonably likely to result, directly or indirectly, in any of the
    consequences referred to in paragraph (a) above;

        (c) except as disclosed in all Company SEC Documents that were filed and
    publicly available prior to the date of the Merger Agreement (the "Filed
    Company SEC Documents") or the letter,

    dated as of the date of the Merger Agreement, delivered by the Company to
    Parent and Sub (the "Company Disclosure Letter"), since the date of the most
    recent audited financial statements included in the Filed Company SEC
    Documents there shall have occurred any event, change, effect or development
    that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to
    have, a Company Material Adverse Effect, except where such event results,
    directly or indirectly, from (i) changes affecting the economy generally,
    (ii) changes affecting the industry in which the Company operates generally,
    (iii) the public announcement or pendency of the Offer, the Merger or the
    transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the Stock Option and
    Tender Agreements, or (iv) compliance by the Company with any of the terms
    of the Merger Agreement;

        (d) (i) it shall have been publicly disclosed or Parent shall have
    otherwise learned that beneficial ownership (determined for the purposes of
    this paragraph as set forth in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange
    Act) of more than 15% of the outstanding Shares has been acquired by another
    Person (including any group as defined in the Exchange Act) or (ii) the
    Company Board or any committee thereof shall have withdrawn or modified in a
    manner adverse to Parent its approval or recommendation of the Offer and the
    Merger Agreement or the Company Board or any committee thereof shall have
    resolved to take any of the foregoing actions;

        (e) any of the representations and warranties of the Company in the
    Merger Agreement shall not be true and correct as of the date of the Merger
    Agreement and as of such time as though made at such time, except (i) to the
    extent such representation and warranty expressly relates to a specific date
    (in which case on and as of such specific date), (ii) to the extent Parent
    had consented in writing to any supplement or amendment to the Company
    Disclosure Letter, or (iii) where the failure to be so true and correct
    would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Company Material
    Adverse Effect;

        (f) the Company shall have failed to perform in any respect any
    obligation or to comply in any respect with any agreement or covenant of the
    Company to be performed or complied with by it under the Merger Agreement;
    except for such failures which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
    result in a Company Material Adverse Effect; or

        (g) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with
    its terms;

which, in the reasonable judgment of Sub or Parent, in any such case, and
regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such condition (including any
action or inaction by Parent or any of its affiliates) makes it inadvisable to
proceed with such acceptance for payment or payment.

    The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Sub and Parent and may
be asserted by Sub or Parent regardless of the circumstances giving rise to such
condition or may be waived by Sub and Parent in whole or in part at any time and
from time to time in their sole discretion. The failure by Parent, Sub or any
other affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights
shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such right
with respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver
with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right shall be
deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

16. CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS; REGULATORY APPROVALS.

    GENERAL.  Sub is not aware of any material pending legal proceeding relating
to the Offer. Based on its examination of publicly available information filed
by the Company with the SEC and other publicly available information concerning
the Company, Sub is not aware of any governmental license or regulatory permit
that is material to the Company's business that might be adversely affected by
Sub's purchase of the Shares as contemplated herein or, except as set forth
below, of any approval or other action by any government or governmental
administrative or regulatory authority or agency, domestic or foreign, that
would be required for the purchase or ownership of Shares by Sub or Parent as
contemplated in the Offer. Should any such approval or other action be required,
Sub currently contemplates that, except as described below under "State Takeover
Statutes," such approval or other action will be sought. There can be no
assurance that any such approval or other action, if needed, would be obtained
or would be obtained without substantial conditions or that if such approval
were

not obtained or such other action were not taken, adverse consequences might not
result to the Company's business, or certain parts of the Company's business
might not have to be disposed of, any of which could cause Sub to elect to
terminate the Offer without the purchase of Shares under certain conditions. See
Section 15 of this Offer to Purchase--"Certain Conditions of the Offer."

    STATE TAKEOVER STATUTES.  A number of states (including Delaware, where the
Company is incorporated), have adopted laws which purport, to varying degrees,
to apply to attempts to acquire corporations that are incorporated in, or which
have substantial assets, stockholders, principal executive offices or principal
places of business or whose business operations otherwise have substantial
economic effects in, such states. Except as described herein, Sub does not know
whether any of these laws will, by their terms, apply to the Offer or the Merger
or any other business combination between Sub or any of its affiliates and the
Company. To the extent that certain provisions of these laws purport to apply to
the Offer or the Merger or other business combination, Sub believes that there
are reasonable bases for contesting such laws. In 1982, in Edgar v. MITE Corp.,
the Supreme Court of the United States invalidated on constitutional grounds the
Illinois Business Takeover Statute which, as a matter of state securities law,
made takeovers of corporations meeting certain requirements more difficult.
However, in 1987 in CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of America, the Supreme Court
held that the State of Indiana could, as a matter of corporate law,
constitutionally disqualify a potential acquiror from voting shares of a target
corporation without the prior approval of the remaining stockholders where,
among other things, the corporation is incorporated in, and has a substantial
number of stockholders in, the state. Subsequently, in TLX Acquisition Corp. v.
Telex Corp., a Federal District Court in Oklahoma ruled that the Oklahoma
statutes were unconstitutional insofar as they apply to corporations
incorporated outside Oklahoma in that they would subject such corporations to
inconsistent regulations. Similarly, in Tyson Foods, Inc. v. McReynolds, a
Federal District Court in Tennessee ruled that four Tennessee takeover statutes
were unconstitutional as applied to corporations incorporated outside Tennessee.
This decision was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit.

    Section 203 of the DGCL ("Section 203"), in general, prevents an "interested
stockholder" (including a person who owns or has the right to acquire 15% or
more of the corporation's outstanding voting stock) from engaging in a "business
combination" (defined to include mergers and certain other actions) with a
Delaware corporation for a period of three years following the date such person
became an interested stockholder. The Company Board has taken all appropriate
action so that neither Parent nor Sub is or will be considered an "interested
stockholder" pursuant to Section 203.

    Neither Parent nor Sub has determined whether any other state takeover laws
or regulations will by their terms apply to the Offer or the Merger, and except
as set forth above, neither Sub nor Parent have attempted to comply with any
state takeover statutes in connection with the Offer or the Merger. Sub and
Parent reserve the right to challenge the validity or applicability of any state
law allegedly applicable to the Offer or the Merger, and nothing in this Offer
to Purchase nor any action taken by Parent or Sub in connection with the Offer
is intended as a waiver of that right. In the event it is asserted that one or
more state takeover statutes is applicable to the Offer or the Merger and an
appropriate court does not determine that it is inapplicable or invalid as
applied to the Offer or the Merger, Sub might be required to file certain
information with, or to receive approvals from, the relevant state authorities
or holders of Shares, and Sub might be unable to accept for payment or pay for
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, or be delayed in continuing or
consummating the Offer or the Merger. In such case, Sub may not be obligated to
accept for payment or pay for any tendered Shares. See Section 16 of this Offer
to Purchase--"Certain Conditions of the Offer."

ANTITRUST IN THE UNITED STATES

    Under the HSR Act and the rules that have been promulgated thereunder by the
FTC, certain acquisition transactions may not be consummated unless certain
information has been furnished to the Antitrust Division and the FTC and certain
waiting period requirements have been satisfied. The purchase of Shares pursuant
to the Offer is subject to such requirements.

    Pursuant to the requirements of the HSR Act, Sub filed a Notification and
Report Form with respect to the Offer and Merger with the Antitrust Division and
the FTC on April 11, 2001. The

waiting period applicable to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer is
scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, fifteen days after such
filing. However, prior to such time, the Antitrust Division or the FTC may
extend the waiting period by requesting additional information or documentary
material relevant to the Offer from Sub. If such a request is made, the waiting
period will be extended until 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the tenth day
after substantial compliance by Sub with such request. Thereafter, such waiting
period can be extended only by court order.

    Any extension of the waiting period will not give rise to any withdrawal
rights not otherwise provided for by applicable law. See Section 4 of this Offer
to Purchase--"Withdrawal Rights." If Sub's purchase of Shares is delayed
pursuant to a request by the Antitrust Division or the FTC for additional
information or documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act, the Offer will be
extended in certain circumstances. See Section 15 of this Offer to
Purchase--"Certain Conditions of the Offer."

    The Antitrust Division and the FTC scrutinize the legality under the
antitrust laws of transactions such as the purchase of Shares by Sub pursuant to
the Offer. At any time before or after the consummation of any such
transactions, the Antitrust Division or the FTC could take such action under the
antitrust laws of the United States as it deems necessary or desirable in the
public interest, including seeking to enjoin the purchase of Shares pursuant to
the Offer or seeking divestiture of the Shares so acquired or divestiture of
substantial assets of Parent or the Company. Private parties (including
individual states) may also bring legal actions under the antitrust laws of the
United States. Sub does not believe that the consummation of the Offer will
result in a violation of any applicable antitrust laws. However, there can be no
assurance that a challenge to the Offer on antitrust grounds will not be made,
or if such a challenge is made, what the result will be. See Section 15 of this
Offer to Purchase--"Certain Conditions of the Offer," including conditions with
respect to litigation and certain governmental actions and Section 11 of this
Offer to Purchase--"The Merger Agreement; Other Arrangements" for certain
termination rights.

FOREIGN REGULATORY MATTERS.

    Completion of the transaction also may require certain approvals by foreign
regulatory authorities. The parties conduct business in a number of foreign
countries. Under the laws of certain foreign nations and multinational
authorities, the transaction may not be completed unless certain filings are
made with these nations' antitrust regulatory authorities or multinational
antitrust authorities and these antitrust authorities approve or clear closing
of the transaction. Other foreign nations and multinational authorities have
voluntary and/or post-merger notification systems. Should any such approval or
action be required, the parties currently contemplate that such approval or
action would be sought.

    Although the parties believe that they will obtain all material required
regulatory approvals in a timely manner, it is not certain that all such
approvals will be received in a timely manner or at all or that foreign or
multinational antitrust authorities will not impose unfavorable conditions for
granting the required approvals.

17. APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

    No appraisal rights are available in connection with the Offer.

    If Sub acquires at least 90% of the Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Merger
may be consummated without a stockholders' meeting and without the approval of
the Company's stockholders.

    Holders of Shares at the Effective Time who do not wish to accept the Merger
Consideration pursuant to the Merger will have the right to seek an appraisal
and to be paid the "fair value" of their Shares at the Effective Time (exclusive
of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
Merger) judicially determined and paid to it in cash provided that such holder
complies with the provisions of such Section 262 of the DGCL.

    The following is a brief summary of the statutory procedures to be followed
in order to dissent from the Merger and perfect appraisal rights under Delaware
law. This summary is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to Section 262, the text of which is set forth in

Schedule II hereto. Any stockholder considering demanding appraisal is advised
to consult legal counsel. Dissenters' rights, if any, will not be available
unless and until the Merger (or a similar business combination) is consummated.

    Stockholders of record who desire to exercise their appraisal rights must
fully satisfy all of the following conditions. A written demand for appraisal of
Shares must be delivered to the Secretary of the Company (x) before the taking
of the vote on the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement if the Merger
is not being effected without a vote of stockholders pursuant to Section 253 of
the DGCL (a "short-form merger"), but rather is being consummated following
approval thereof at a meeting of the Company's stockholders (a "long-form
merger") or (y) within twenty days after the date that the Surviving Corporation
mails to the stockholders a notice (the "Notice of Merger") to the effect that
the Merger is effective and that appraisal rights are available (and includes in
such notice a copy of Section 262 and any other information required thereby) if
the Merger is being effected as a short-form merger without a vote or meeting of
the Company's stockholders. If the Merger is effected as a long-form merger,
this written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any
proxy or vote abstaining from or against the approval and adoption of the Merger
Agreement, and neither voting against, abstaining from voting, nor failing to
vote on the Merger Agreement will constitute a demand for appraisal within the
meaning of Section 262. In the case of a long-form merger, any stockholder
seeking appraisal rights must hold the Shares for which appraisal is sought on
the date the demand is made and, continuously hold such Shares through the
Effective Time, and otherwise comply with the provisions of Section 262.

    In the case of both a short-form merger and a long-form merger, a demand for
appraisal must be executed by or for the stockholder of record, fully and
correctly, as such stockholder's name appears on the Share Certificates. If
Shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee,
guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by the fiduciary. If Shares
are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in
common, such demand must be executed by all joint owners. An authorized agent,
including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for
appraisal for a stockholder of record; however, the agent must identify the
record owner and expressly disclose the fact that, in exercising the demand, he
is acting as agent for the record owner.

    A record owner, such as a broker, who holds Shares as a nominee for others,
may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the Shares held for all or less
than all beneficial owners of Shares as to which the holder is the record owner.
In such case the written demand must set forth the number of Shares covered by
such demand. Where the number of Shares is not expressly stated, the demand will
be presumed to cover all Shares outstanding in the name of such record owner.
Beneficial owners who are not record owners and who intend to exercise appraisal
rights should instruct the record owner to comply strictly with the statutory
requirements with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights before the date of
any meeting of stockholders of the Company called to approve the Merger in the
case of a long-form merger and within twenty days following the mailing of the
Notice of Merger in the case of a short-form merger.

    Stockholders who elect to exercise appraisal rights must mail or deliver
their written demands to: Secretary, Foilmark, Inc., 5 Malcolm Hoyt Drive,
Newburyport, Massachusetts 01950. The written demand for appraisal should
specify the stockholder's name and mailing address, the number of Shares covered
by the demand and that the stockholder is thereby demanding appraisal of such
shares. In the case of a long-form merger, the Company must, within ten days
after the Effective Time, provide notice of the Effective Time to all
stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and have not voted for approval
and adoption of the Merger Agreement.

    In the case of a long-form merger, stockholders electing to exercise their
appraisal rights under Section 262 must not vote for the approval and adoption
of the Merger Agreement or consent thereto in writing. Voting in favor of the
approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement, or delivering a proxy in
connection with the stockholders meeting called to approve the Merger Agreement
(unless the proxy votes against, or expressly abstains from the vote on, the
approval and adoption of the Merger

Agreement), will constitute a waiver of the stockholder's right of appraisal and
will nullify any written demand for appraisal submitted by the stockholder.

    Regardless of whether the Merger is effected as a long-form merger or a
short-form merger, within 120 days after the Effective Time, either the Company
or any stockholder who has complied with the required conditions of Section 262
and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights may file a petition in the
Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the fair value of the
shares of the dissenting stockholders. If a petition for an appraisal is timely
filed, after a hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will
determine which stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights and thereafter
will appraise the Shares owned by such stockholders, determining the fair value
of such Shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment
or expectation of the Merger, together with a fair rate of interest to be paid,
if any, upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair
value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is to take into account all relevant
factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., et al., the Delaware Supreme Court
discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an
appraisal proceeding, stating that "proof of value by any techniques or methods
which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and
otherwise admissible in court" should be considered and that "[f]air price
obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of
a company." The Delaware Supreme Court stated that in making this determination
of fair value the court must consider "market value, asset value, dividends,
earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts which were
known or which could be ascertained as of the date of merger which throw any
light on future prospects of the merged corporation...." The Delaware Supreme
Court has construed Section 262 to mean that "elements of future value,
including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof
as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be
considered." However, the court noted that Section 262 provides that fair value
is to be determined "exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger."

    Stockholders who in the future consider seeking appraisal should have in
mind that the fair value of their Shares determined under Section 262 could be
more than, the same as, or less than the Merger Consideration if they do seek
appraisal of their Shares, and that opinions of investment banking firms as to
fairness from a financial point of view are not necessarily opinions as to fair
value under Section 262. Moreover, Parent intends to cause the Surviving
Corporation to argue in any appraisal proceeding that, for purposes thereof, the
"fair value" of the Shares is less than that paid in the Offer. The cost of the
appraisal proceeding may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and
taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable in the
circumstances. Upon application of a dissenting stockholder, the Delaware Court
of Chancery may order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any
dissenting stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of
experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all Shares entitled to
appraisal. In the absence of such a determination or assessment, each party
bears its own expenses.

    Any stockholder who has duly demanded appraisal in compliance with
Section 262 will not, after the Effective Time, be entitled to vote for any
purpose the Shares subject to such demand or to receive payment of dividends or
other distributions on such Shares, except for dividends or other distributions
payable to stockholders of record at a date prior to the Effective Time.

    At any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any former holder of
Shares shall have the right to withdraw his or her demand for appraisal and to
accept the Merger Consideration. After this period, such holder may withdraw his
or her demand for appraisal only with the consent of the Company as the
Surviving Corporation. If no petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware
Court of Chancery within 120 days after the Effective Time, stockholders' rights
to appraisal shall cease and all stockholders shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration. Inasmuch as the Company has no obligation to file such a
petition, and Parent has no present intention to cause or permit the Surviving
Corporation to do so, any stockholder who desires such a petition to be filed is
advised to file it on a timely basis. However, no petition timely filed in the
Delaware Court of Chancery demanding appraisal shall be dismissed as to any
stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such
approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery
deems just.

    Failure to take any required step in connection with the exercise of
appraisal rights may result in the termination or waiver of such rights.

    APPRAISAL RIGHTS CANNOT BE EXERCISED AT THIS TIME. THE INFORMATION SET FORTH
ABOVE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY WITH RESPECT TO ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE
TO STOCKHOLDERS IF THE MERGER IS CONSUMMATED. STOCKHOLDERS WHO WILL BE ENTITLED

    The foregoing summary of the rights of objecting stockholders under the DGCL
does not purport to be a complete statement of the procedures to be followed by
stockholders of the Company desiring to exercise any available dissenters'
rights. The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to
Section 262. The preservation and exercise of dissenters' rights require strict
adherence to the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

              SECTION 262 OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW
                            DELAWARE CODE ANNOTATED
                             TITLE 8. CORPORATIONS
                       CHAPTER 1. GENERAL CORPORATION LAW
               SUBCHAPTER IX. MERGER, CONSOLIDATION OR CONVERSION
                          8 DEL. C. SECTION 262 (2000)

Section 262. Appraisal rights

        (a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of
    stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of
    this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares
    through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise
    complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in
    favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing
    pursuant to Section 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by
    the Court of Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock
    under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this
    section. As used in this section, the word "stockholder" means a holder of
    record of stock in a stock corporation and also a member of record of a
    nonstock corporation; the words "stock" and "share" mean and include what is
    ordinarily meant by those words and also membership or membership interest
    of a member of a nonstock corporation; and the words "depository receipt"
    mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an
    interest in one or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a
    corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.

        (b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or
    series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to
    be effected pursuant to Section 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant
    to Section 251(g) of this title), Section 252, Section 254, Section 257,
    Section 258, Section 263 or Section 264 of this title:

           (1) Provided, however, that no appraisal rights under this section
       shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which
       stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date
       fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of and to
       vote at the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger
       or consolidation, were either (i) listed on a national securities
       exchange or designated as a national market system security on an
       interdealer quotation system by the National Association of Securities
       Dealers, Inc. or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and
       further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any
       shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the
       merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of
       the surviving corporation as provided in subsection (f) of Section 251 of
       this title.

           (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, appraisal
       rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class
       or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof
       are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation
       pursuant to Sections 251, 252, 254, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title
       to accept for such stock anything except:

           a.  Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from
               such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect
               thereof;

           b.  Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts
               in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts
               in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date
               of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a
               national securities exchange or designated as a national market
               system security on an

               interdealer quotation system by the National Association of
               Securities Dealers, Inc. or held of record by more than 2,000
               holders;

           c.  Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository
               receipts described in the foregoing subparagraphs a. and b. of
               this paragraph; or

           d.  Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and
               cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository
               receipts described in the foregoing subparagraphs a., b. and c.
               of this paragraph.

           (3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware
       corporation party to a merger effected under Section 253 of this title is
       not owned by the parent corporation immediately prior to the merger,
       appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary
       Delaware corporation.

        (c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that
    appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
    class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate
    of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a
    constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the
    assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such
    a provision, the procedures of this section, including those set forth in
    subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is
    practicable.

        (d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

           (1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights
       are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a
       meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to
       the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the
       record date for such meeting with respect to shares for which appraisal
       rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) hereof that
       appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the
       constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this
       section. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such
       stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking
       of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for
       appraisal of such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if
       it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder
       and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such
       stockholder's shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation
       shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such
       action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within
       10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the
       surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each
       constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not
       voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date
       that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or

           (2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to Section
       228 or Section 253 of this title, each constituent corporation, either
       before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or within ten
       days thereafter, shall notify each of the holders of any class or series
       of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal
       rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal
       rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of
       stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a
       copy of this section; provided that, if the notice is given on or after
       the effective date of the merger or consolidation, such notice shall be
       given by the surviving or resulting corporation to all such holders of
       any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation that are
       entitled to appraisal rights. Such notice may, and, if given on or after
       the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify
       such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation.
       Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after
       the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving
       or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares. Such
       demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the

       corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder
       intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder's shares. If such
       notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or
       consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a
       second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation
       notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such
       constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the
       effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or
       resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders
       on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that
       if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of
       the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each
       stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded
       appraisal of such holder's shares in accordance with this subsection. An
       affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer
       agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such
       notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie
       evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the
       stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent
       corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more
       than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the
       notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or
       consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record
       date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the
       record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the
       day on which the notice is given.

        (e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or
    consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who
    has complied with subsections (a) and (d) hereof and who is otherwise
    entitled to appraisal rights, may file a petition in the Court of Chancery
    demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such
    stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days
    after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder
    shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and
    to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within
    120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any
    stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and
    (d) hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the
    corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a
    statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of
    the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands for appraisal
    have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such
    written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after
    such stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the
    surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the
    period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) hereof,
    whichever is later.

        (f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a
    copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation,
    which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the
    Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list
    containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded
    payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their
    shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If
    the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the
    petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in
    Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and
    place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail
    to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on
    the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by
    1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a
    newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington,
    Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the
    notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the
    costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

        (g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the
    stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become
    entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may

    require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and
    who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of
    stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of
    the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such
    direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder.

        (h) After determining the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the
    Court shall appraise the shares, determining their fair value exclusive of
    any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
    merger or consolidation, together with a fair rate of interest, if any, to
    be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such
    fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. In
    determining the fair rate of interest, the Court may consider all relevant
    factors, including the rate of interest which the surviving or resulting
    corporation would have had to pay to borrow money during the pendency of the
    proceeding. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by
    any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the
    Court may, in its discretion, permit discovery or other pretrial proceedings
    and may proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination
    of the stockholder entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name
    appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant
    to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder's
    certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may
    participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that
    such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

        (i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares,
    together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to
    the stockholders entitled thereto. Interest may be simple or compound, as
    the Court may direct. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in
    the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of
    holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the
    corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court's decree
    may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced,
    whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this
    State or of any state.

        (j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed
    upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon
    application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the
    expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal
    proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and
    the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value
    of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

        (k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no
    stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection
    (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or
    to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except
    dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date
    which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation);
    provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed
    within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such
    stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a
    written withdrawal of such stockholder's demand for an appraisal and an
    acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the
    effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection
    (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the
    corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of
    Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of
    the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court
    deems just.

        (l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the
    shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they
    assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized
    and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

    The undersigned hereby tenders to Dudley Acquisition Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Sub") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Illinois Tool Works Inc., a
Delaware corporation, the above described shares of common stock, par value $.01
per share (the "Shares" and the certificates representing such shares, the
"Certificates") of the Company, at a price of $6.36 per Share, net to the seller
in cash, less any required withholding of taxes and without the payment of
interest, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to
Purchase, dated April 20, 2001 (the "Offer to Purchase"), receipt of which is
hereby acknowledged, and in this Letter of Transmittal (the "Letter of
Transmittal," which, together with the Offer to Purchase, as each may be amended
or supplemented from time to time, collectively constitute the "Offer").

    Subject to, and effective upon, acceptance for payment of the Shares
tendered herewith in accordance with the terms of the Offer, the undersigned
hereby sells, assigns and transfers to, or upon the order of, Sub all right,
title and interest in and to all of the Shares that are being tendered hereby,
and irrevocably appoints the Depositary the true and lawful agent,
attorney-in-fact and proxy of the undersigned with respect to such Shares, with
full power of substitution (such power of attorney being deemed to be an
irrevocable power coupled with an interest) to (a) deliver such Certificates or
transfer ownership of such Shares on the account books maintained by the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility, together, in either case, with appropriate
evidences of transfer, to the Depositary for the account of Sub, (b) present
such Shares for transfer on the books of the Company, and (c) receive all
benefits and otherwise exercise all rights of beneficial ownership of such
Shares, all in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the
Offer.

    The undersigned irrevocably appoints designees of Sub as such undersigned's
agents, attorneys-in-fact and proxies, with full power of substitution, to the
full extent of the undersigned's rights with respect to the Shares tendered by
the undersigned and accepted for payment by Sub. All such powers of attorney and
proxies shall be considered irrevocable and coupled with an interest. Such
appointment will be effective when, and only to the extent that, Sub accepts
such Shares for payment. Upon such acceptance for payment, all prior powers of
attorney, proxies and consents given by the undersigned with respect to such
Shares will be revoked without further action, and no subsequent powers of
attorney and proxies may be given nor any subsequent written consents executed
(and, if given or executed, will not be deemed effective). The designees of Sub
will, with respect to the Shares for which such appointment is effective, be
empowered to exercise all voting and other rights of the undersigned as they in
their sole discretion may deem proper at any annual or special meeting of
Company stockholders or any adjournment or postponement thereof, by written
consent in lieu of any such meeting or otherwise. Sub reserves the right to
require that, in order for the Shares to be deemed validly tendered, immediately
upon Sub's acceptance of such Shares, Sub must be able to exercise full voting
rights with respect to such Shares, including, without limitation, voting at any
meeting of stockholders.

    The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that (a) the undersigned has
full power and authority to tender, sell, assign and transfer the undersigned's
Shares tendered hereby, and (b) when the Shares are accepted for payment by Sub,
Sub will acquire good, marketable and unencumbered title to the Shares, free and
clear of all liens, restrictions, charges and encumbrances, and the same will
not be subject to any adverse claim and will not have been transferred to Sub in
violation of any contractual or other restriction on the transfer thereof. The
undersigned, upon request, will execute and deliver any additional documents
deemed by the Depositary or Sub to be necessary or desirable to complete the
sale, assignment and transfer of the Shares tendered hereby.

    All authority herein conferred or agreed to be conferred shall not be
affected by and shall survive the death or incapacity of the undersigned and any
obligation of the undersigned hereunder shall be binding upon the heirs,
personal representatives, successors and assigns of the undersigned.

    Tenders of Shares made pursuant to the Offer are irrevocable, except that
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer may be withdrawn at any time prior to the
Expiration Date, and, unless theretofore accepted for payment by the Sub
pursuant to the Offer, may also be withdrawn at any time after June 19, 2001.
See Section 4 of the Offer to Purchase.

    The undersigned understands that tenders of Shares pursuant to any of the
procedures described in Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase and in the
instructions hereto will constitute a binding agreement between the undersigned
and Sub upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer,
including the undersigned's representation that the undersigned owns the Shares
being tendered.

    Unless otherwise indicated herein under "Special Payment Instructions,"
please issue the check for the purchase price and/or issue or return any
Certificate(s) not tendered or not accepted for payment in the name(s) of the
registered holder(s) appearing under "Description of Shares." Similarly, unless
otherwise indicated herein under

"Special Delivery Instructions," please mail the check for the purchase price

are completed, please issue the check for the purchase price and/or any
Certificate(s) not tendered or accepted for payment in the name of, and deliver

Unless otherwise indicated herein under "Special Payment Instructions," please
credit any Shares tendered herewith by book-entry transfer that are not accepted
for payment by crediting the account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility
designated above. The undersigned recognizes that Sub has no obligation,
pursuant to the Special Payment Instructions, to transfer any Shares from the
name(s) of the registered holder(s) thereof if Sub does not accept for payment
any of the Shares so tendered.

                                  INSTRUCTIONS
             FORMING PART OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER

    1.  GUARANTEE OF SIGNATURES.  No signature guarantee is required on this
Letter of Transmittal if: (a) this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the
registered holder(s) of the Shares (which term, for purposes of this document,
shall include any participant in the Book-Entry Transfer Facility whose name
appears on a security position listing as the owner of the shares) tendered
herewith, unless such holder(s) has completed either the box entitled "Special
Payment Instructions" or the box entitled "Special Delivery Instructions," or
(b) such Shares are tendered for the account of a firm which is a bank, broker,
dealer, credit union, savings association or other entity which is a member in
good standing of a recognized Medallion Program approved by the Securities
Transfer Association Inc., including the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion
Program, the Stock Exchange Medallion Program and the New York Stock Exchange
Medallion Signature Program, or any other "eligible guarantor institution" (as
defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) (each of the
foregoing, an "Eligible Institution"'). In all other cases, all signatures on
this Letter of Transmittal must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution. See
Instruction 5 of this Letter of Transmittal.

    2.  REQUIREMENTS OF TENDER.  This Letter of Transmittal is to be completed
by stockholders either if Certificates are to be forwarded herewith or, unless
an Agent's Message is utilized, if tenders are to be made pursuant to the
procedure for tender by book-entry transfer set forth in Section 3 of the Offer
to Purchase. Certificates evidencing tendered Shares, or timely confirmation (a
"Book-Entry Confirmation") of a book-entry transfer of Shares into the
Depositary's account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility, as well as this Letter
of Transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, with any required
signature guarantees, or an Agent's Message in connection with a book-entry
transfer, and any other documents required by this Letter of Transmittal, must
be received by the Depositary at one of its addresses set forth herein on or
prior to the Expiration Date. Stockholders whose Certificates are not
immediately available or who cannot deliver their Certificates and all other
required documents to the Depositary on or prior to the Expiration Date or who
cannot complete the procedure for delivery by book-entry transfer on a timely
basis may tender their Shares by properly completing and duly executing a Notice
of Guaranteed Delivery pursuant to the guaranteed delivery procedure set forth
in Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase. Pursuant to such procedure: (a) such
tender must be made by or through an Eligible Institution; (b) a properly
completed and duly executed Notice of Guaranteed Delivery, substantially in the
form made available by Sub, must be received by the Depositary on or prior to
the Expiration Date; and (c) the Certificates (or a Book-Entry Confirmation)
representing all tendered Shares in proper form for transfer, in each case,
together with this Letter of Transmittal, properly completed and duly executed,
with any required signature guarantees (or, in the case of a book-entry
delivery, an Agent's Message) and any other documents required by this Letter of
Transmittal, must be received by the Depositary within three National
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System trading days after
the date of execution of such Notice of Guaranteed Delivery. If Certificates are
forwarded separately in multiple deliveries to the Depositary, a properly
completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal must accompany each such
delivery.

    THE METHOD OF DELIVERY OF THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL, CERTIFICATES AND ALL
OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING DELIVERY THROUGH THE BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER
FACILITY, IS AT THE OPTION AND RISK OF THE TENDERING STOCKHOLDER, AND THE
DELIVERY WILL BE DEEMED MADE ONLY WHEN ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY
(INCLUDING, IN THE CASE OF BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER, BY BOOK- ENTRY CONFIRMATION). IF
DELIVERY IS BY MAIL, REGISTERED MAIL WITH RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED AND PROPERLY
INSURED IS RECOMMENDED. IN ALL CASES, SUFFICIENT TIME SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO
ENSURE TIMELY DELIVERY. NO ALTERNATIVE, CONDITIONAL OR CONTINGENT TENDERS WILL
BE ACCEPTED AND NO FRACTIONAL SHARES WILL BE PURCHASED. ALL TENDERING
STOCKHOLDERS, BY EXECUTION OF THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL (OR A FACSIMILE HEREOF
IF BY AN ELIGIBLE INSTITUTION), WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO RECEIVE ANY NOTICE OF THE
ACCEPTANCE OF THEIR SHARES FOR PAYMENT.

    3.  INADEQUATE SPACE.  If the space provided herein is inadequate, the
Certificate numbers and/or the number of Shares and any other required
information should be listed on a separate signed schedule attached hereto.

    4.  PARTIAL TENDERS (NOT APPLICABLE TO STOCKHOLDERS WHO TENDER BY BOOK-ENTRY
TRANSFER).  If fewer than all the Shares evidenced by any Certificate submitted
are to be tendered, fill in the number of Shares which are to be tendered in the
box entitled "Number of Shares Tendered" in the "Description of Shares
Tendered." In such cases, new Certificates for the Shares that were evidenced by
your old Certificates, but were not tendered by you, will be sent to you, unless
otherwise provided in the appropriate box on this Letter of Transmittal, as soon
as practicable after the Expiration Date. All Shares represented by Certificates
delivered to the Depositary will be deemed to have been tendered unless
otherwise indicated.

    5.  SIGNATURES ON LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL, STOCK POWERS AND ENDORSEMENTS.  If
this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the Shares
tendered hereby, the signature(s) must correspond with the name(s) as written on
the face of the Certificate(s) without alteration, enlargement or any change
whatsoever.

    If any of the Shares tendered hereby are owned of record by two or more
joint owners, all such owners must sign this Letter of Transmittal. If any of
the tendered Shares are registered in different names on several Certificates,
it will be necessary to complete, sign and submit as many separate Letters of
Transmittal as there are different registrations of Certificates.

    If this Letter of Transmittal or any Certificates or stock powers are signed
by trustees, executors, administrators, guardians, attorneys-in-fact, officers
of corporations or others acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such
persons should so indicate when signing, and proper evidence satisfactory to Sub
of their authority so to act must be submitted.

    If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the
Shares listed and transmitted hereby, no endorsements of Certificates or
separate stock powers are required unless payment is to be made to, or
Certificates for Shares not tendered or not purchased are to be issued in the
name of, a person other than the registered holder(s). In such latter case,
signatures on such Certificates or stock powers must be guaranteed by an
Eligible Institution.

    If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by a person other than the
registered holder(s) of the Certificate(s) listed, the Certificate(s) must be
endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either case signed
exactly as the name(s) of the registered holder(s) appear on the Certificate(s).
Signatures on such Certificates or stock powers must be guaranteed by an
Eligible Institution.

    6.  STOCK TRANSFER TAXES.  Except as otherwise provided in this Instruction
6, Sub will pay any stock transfer taxes with respect to the transfer and sale
of Shares to it or its order pursuant to the Offer. If, however, payment is to
be made to, or if Certificates for Shares not tendered or accepted for payment
are to be registered in the name of, any person other than the registered
holder(s), or if tendered Certificates are registered in the name of any person
other than the person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal, the amount of any
stock transfer taxes (whether imposed on the registered holder(s) or such
person) payable on account of the transfer to such person will be deducted from
the purchase price, unless satisfactory evidence of the payment of such taxes or
an exemption therefrom is submitted. Except as otherwise provided in this
Instruction 6, it will not be necessary for transfer tax stamps to be affixed to
the Certificate(s) listed in this Letter of Transmittal.

    7.  SPECIAL PAYMENT AND DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS.  If a check is to be issued
in the name of, and/or Certificates for Shares not tendered or not accepted for
payment are to be issued or returned to, a person other than the signer of this
Letter of Transmittal or if a check and/or such Certificates are to be returned
to a person other than the person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal or to an
address other than that shown in this Letter of Transmittal, the appropriate
boxes on this Letter of Transmittal must be completed. A Book-Entry Stockholder
may request that Shares not accepted for payment be credited to such account
maintained at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility as such Book-Entry Stockholder
may designate under "Special Payment Instructions." If no such instructions are
given, such shares not accepted for payment will be returned by crediting the
account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility designated above.

    8.  WAIVER OF CONDITIONS.  Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement (as defined in the Offer to Purchase), the conditions of the Offer may
be waived by Sub in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in its
sole discretion.

    9.  31% BACKUP WITHHOLDING; SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9.  Under U.S. federal income
tax law, a stockholder whose tendered Shares are accepted for payment pursuant
to the Offer may be subject to backup withholding at a rate of 31%. To prevent
backup withholding on any payment made to a stockholder pursuant to the Offer,
the stockholder who is a U.S. person is required to notify the Depositary of
such stockholder's current taxpayer identification number ("TIN") by completing
the enclosed Substitute Form W-9, certifying that the TIN provided on that form
is correct (or that such stockholder is awaiting a TIN), and that (i) such
stockholder has not been notified by the Internal Revenue Service that such
stockholder is subject to backup withholding as a result of failure to report
all interest or dividends or (ii) after being so notified, the Internal Revenue
Service has notified such stockholder that the stockholder is no longer subject
to backup withholding. If the Depositary is not provided with the correct TIN,
such stockholder may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue
Service and payments that are made to such stockholder with respect to shares
pursuant to the Offer may be subject to backup withholding (see below).

    Each stockholder who is a U.S. person is required to give the Depositary the
TIN (e.g., Social Security number or employer identification number) of the
record holder of the Shares. If the Shares are registered in more than one name
or are not registered in the name of the actual owner, consult the enclosed
"Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute
Form W-9" for additional guidance on which number to report. A stockholder who
is a U.S. person who does not have a TIN may check the box in Part 3 of the
Substitute Form W-9 if

such stockholder has applied for a number or intends to apply for a TIN in the
near future. If the box in Part 3 is checked, such stockholder must also
complete the "Certificate of Awaiting Taxpayer Identification Number" below in
order to avoid backup withholding. If the box is checked, payments made will be
subject to backup withholding unless such stockholder has furnished the
Depositary with his or her TIN by the time payment is made. A stockholder who
checks the box in Part 3 in lieu of furnishing such stockholder's TIN should
furnish the Depositary with such stockholder's TIN as soon as it is received.

    Certain stockholders (including, among others, all corporations and certain
foreign individuals) are not subject to these backup withholding requirements.
To avoid possible erroneous backup withholding, a stockholder who is a U.S.
person and who is exempt from backup withholding should complete the Substitute
Form W-9 by providing his or her correct TIN, signing and dating the form, and
writing exempt on the face of the form. A stockholder who is a foreign
individual or a foreign entity should submit to the Depositary a properly
completed Form W-8BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for
United States Tax Withholding, instead of Form W-9, signed under penalty of
perjury, attesting to the stockholder's exempt status. Stockholders are urged to
consult their own tax advisors to determine whether they are exempt from these
backup withholding and reporting requirements.

    If backup withholding applies, the Depositary is required to withhold 31% of
any payments to be made to the stockholder. Backup withholding is not an
additional tax. Rather, the tax liability of persons subject to backup
withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld. If withholding
results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained by filing a tax
return with the Internal Revenue Service. The Depositary cannot refund amounts
withheld by reason of backup withholding.

   report all interests or dividends, or (c) the IRS has notified me that I am no longer subject to backup
   withholding, and

3. I am a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien).

CERTIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS. -- You must cross out item 2 above if you have been notified by the IRS that you are
currently subject to backup withholding because you have failed to report all interest and dividends on your tax

secured property, cancellation of debt, contributions to an individual retirement arrangement (IRA), and generally,
payments other than interest and dividends, you are not required to sign the Certification, but you must provide your
correct TIN. (See the Guidelines.)

   an application to receive a taxpayer identification number to the
   appropriate Internal Revenue Service Center or Social Security
   Administration Office or (2) I intend to mail or deliver an application in

Purchase, dated April 20, 2001 (an "Offer to Purchase") and in the related
Letter of Transmittal (which, together with the Offer to Purchase, as each may
be amended or supplemented from time to time, collectively constitute the
"Offer").

    The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, (1) there being validly
tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer Shares
representing a majority of the total outstanding voting securities of the
Company on a fully-diluted basis after giving effect to the exercise, conversion
or termination of all options, warrants, rights and securities exercisable or
convertible into such voting securities and (2) the applicable waiting period
(and any extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976, as amended, shall have terminated or expired and any consents,
approvals and filings under any foreign antitrust law, the absence of which
would prohibit the purchase of all Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, shall
have been obtained or made prior to the acceptance of Shares pursuant to the
Offer. The Offer also is subject to certain other terms and conditions.

    For your information and for forwarding to your clients for whom you hold

Purchase) or if the procedures for delivery by book-entry transfer, as set forth
in the Offer to Purchase, cannot be completed on a timely basis.

    5.  Letter to stockholders of the Company from Robert J. Simon, Chairman of
the Board of the Company and Frank J. Olsen, Jr. President and Chief Executive

    In accordance with the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver
(where applicable) of the conditions to the Offer, Sub will accept for payment,
purchase and pay for, all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer at the earliest time following expiration of the Offer
when all such conditions shall have been satisfied or waived (where applicable).
For purposes of the Offer, Sub will be deemed to have accepted for payment (and
thereby purchased), shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn if, as
and when Sub gives oral or written notice to the Depositary of Sub's acceptance
for payment of such Shares pursuant to the Offer. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of the Offer, payment for Shares accepted for payment pursuant to
the Offer will be made only after timely receipt by the Depositary of (1) the
certificates or a Book-Entry Confirmation (as defined in the Offer to Purchase)
of a book-entry transfer of such Shares into the Depositary's account at the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) pursuant to
the procedures set forth in Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase; (2) the Letter
of Transmittal to tender Shares, properly completed and duly executed, with any
required signature guarantees, or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an
Agent's Message (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) in lieu of the Letter of
Transmittal; and (3) any other documents required under the Letter of
Transmittal.

    Sub will not pay any commissions or fees to any broker, dealer or other
person (other than the Depositary and the Information Agent, as described in the
Offer to Purchase) in connection with the solicitation of tenders of Shares
pursuant to the Offer. Sub will, however, upon request, reimburse you for
customary clerical and mailing expenses incurred by you in forwarding any of the
enclosed materials to your clients.

    Sub will pay any stock transfer taxes with respect to the transfer and sale
of Shares to it or to its order pursuant to the Offer, except as otherwise
provided in Instruction 6 of the enclosed Letter of Transmittal.

    Your prompt action is requested. We urge you to contact your clients as
promptly as possible. Please note that Offer and withdrawal rights expire at
12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Thursday, May 17, 2001, unless the Offer
is extended.

    In order for a stockholder of the Company to take advantage of the Offer,

book-entry transfer, an Agent's Message in lieu of the Letter of Transmittal)

tendered pursuant to the procedure for book-entry transfer, all in accordance
with the instructions set forth in the Letter of Transmittal and the Offer to

                            ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC.

    Dudley Acquisition Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Sub") and wholly owned
subsidiary of Illinois Tool Works Inc., a Delaware Corporation ("Parent"), is
offering to purchase all of the outstanding shares (the "Shares") of the common
stock, par value $.01 per share, of Foilmark, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), at a purchase price of $6.36 per Share, net to the seller in cash,
without interest thereon. The Offer is being made by Sub upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase dated April 20,
2001 and in the related Letter of Transmittal (which, together with the Offer to
Purchase and any amendments or supplements thereto, collectively constitute the
"Offer").

  THE OFFER AND WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS WILL EXPIRE AT 12:00 MIDNIGHT, NEW YORK CITY
         TIME, ON THURSDAY, MAY 17, 2001, UNLESS THE OFFER IS EXTENDED.

    The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, (i) there being validly
tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer Shares
representing at least a majority of the total outstanding voting securities of
the Company on a fully-diluted basis after giving effect to the exercise,
conversion or termination of all options, warrants, rights and securities
exercisable or convertible into such voting securities and (ii) the applicable
waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, having terminated or expired and any
consents, approvals and filings under any foreign antitrust law, the absence of
which would prohibit the purchase of all Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer,
having been obtained or made prior to the acceptance of the Shares pursuant to
the Offer. The Offer also is subject to certain other terms and conditions
contained in the Offer to Purchase.

    The Offer is being made pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of April 10, 2001 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among Parent, Sub and the
Company. The purpose of the Offer is for Sub to acquire control of, and the
entire equity interest in, the Company. The Merger Agreement provides that,
among other things, Sub will make the Offer and that, as promptly as practicable
after completion of the Offer and the satisfaction or waiver of the other
conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("Delaware law"), Sub will be
merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"), and the Company will be the
surviving corporation. At the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective
Time"), each outstanding Share (other than Shares owned by Parent, Sub or any
subsidiary or affiliate of Parent, Sub or the Company or held in the treasury of
the Company or by stockholders who have

properly perfected appraisal rights under Delaware law) will by virtue of the
Merger, and without any action by the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive $6.36 per Share in cash, or any higher price per Share
paid pursuant to the Offer, without interest thereon.

    The Board of Directors of the Company has by unanimous vote of those
directors present at the meeting (i) approved and declared advisable the Merger
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, (ii) determined that the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are fair to, and in the best
interests of, the stockholders, (iii) recommended that the Company's
stockholders accept the Offer and tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer, and
(iv) recommended that the Company's stockholders approve and adopt the Merger
Agreement.

    For purposes of the Offer, Sub will be deemed to have accepted for payment
(and thereby purchased) Shares tendered and not properly withdrawn as, if and
when Sub gives oral or written notice to American Stock Transfer & Trust Company
(the "Depositary") of Sub's acceptance for payment of such Shares pursuant to
the Offer. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer, payment
for Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer will be made by deposit of
the purchase price for the Shares with the Depositary, which will act as agent
for tendering stockholders for the purposes of receiving payments from Sub and
transmitting payments to tendering stockholders. Under no circumstances will Sub
pay interest on the purchase price for any Shares accepted for payment,
regardless of any extension of the Offer or any delay in making payment. In all
cases, Sub will pay for Shares purchased in the Offer only after timely receipt
by the Depositary of (i) the certificates representing the Shares (the "Share
Certificates") or confirmation of a book-entry transfer of such Shares into the
Depositary's account at the Depositary Trust Company ("DTC") pursuant to the
procedures set forth in the Offer to Purchase, (ii) the appropriate Letter of
Transmittal (or a facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed, with
any required signature guarantees or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an
Agent's Message (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) in lieu of the Letter of
Transmittal and (iii) any other documents required under the Letter of
Transmittal.

    The term "Expiration Date" means 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on
Thursday, May 17, 2001, unless the Offer is extended, in which case the
"Expiration Date" will be the latest time and date the Offer, as extended,
expires. Subject to the limitations set forth in the Offer to Purchase, the
Merger Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, Sub reserves the right, at any time and from time to time
in its sole discretion, to extend the period during which the Offer is open by
giving oral or written notice of such extension to the Depositary. During any
such extension, all Shares previously tendered and not properly withdrawn will
remain subject to the Offer, subject to the right, if any, of a tendering
stockholder to withdraw such stockholder's Shares. Any such extension will be
followed as promptly as practicable by public announcement which will be made no
later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the next business day after the
previously scheduled expiration of the Offer, in accordance with the public
announcement requirements of Rule 14e-1(d) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").

    Tenders of Shares made pursuant to the Offer are irrevocable, except that
such Shares may be withdrawn (i) at any time prior to the Expiration Date and
(ii) at any time after Tuesday, June 19, 2001, unless accepted for payment by
Sub pursuant to the Offer prior to that date. However, pursuant to Rule 14d-7
under the Exchange Act, no withdrawal rights apply to Shares tendered during any
subsequent offering period and no withdrawal rights apply during a subsequent
offering period with respect to Shares tendered in the Offer and accepted for
payment. Sub reserves the right to allow a subsequent offering period in
compliance with the Merger Agreement and Rule 14d-11 but has not determined
whether it will do so at this time. If Sub extends the Offer, is delayed in its
acceptance for payment of Shares, or is unable to accept Shares for payment
pursuant to the Offer for any reason, then, without prejudice to Sub's rights
under the Offer, the Depositary may nevertheless retain tendered Shares on
behalf of Sub, and such Shares may not be withdrawn, except to the extent that
tendering stockholders are entitled to and duly exercise their withdrawal rights
as described in the Offer to Purchase. Any such delay will be by an extension of
the Offer to the extent required by law.

    If Sub does not purchase any tendered Shares pursuant to the Offer for any
reason, or if a holder of Shares submits Share Certificates representing more
Shares than are tendered, Share Certificates representing unpurchased or
untendered Shares will be returned, without expense to the tendering stockholder
(or, in the case of Shares tendered by book-entry transfer into the Depositary's
account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility pursuant to the procedure set forth
in the Offer to Purchase, such Shares will be credited to an account maintained
at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility), as promptly as practicable following the
expiration or termination of the Offer.

    For a withdrawal to be effective, a written or facsimile transmission notice
of withdrawal must be timely received by the Depositary at one of its addresses
set forth on the back cover page of the Offer to Purchase. Any such notice of
withdrawal must specify the name of the person who tendered the Shares to be
withdrawn, the number of Shares to be withdrawn and (if Share Certificates have
been tendered) the name of the registered holder of such Shares, if different
from that of the person who tendered such Shares. If Share Certificates
representing Shares to be withdrawn have been delivered or otherwise identified
to the Depositary, then, prior to the physical release of such Share
Certificates, the serial numbers shown on such Share Certificates must be
submitted to the Depositary and the signature on the notice of withdrawal must
be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution, except in the case of Shares tendered
for the account of an Eligible Institution. If Shares have been tendered
pursuant to the procedure for book-entry transfer as set forth in the Offer to
Purchase, the notice of withdrawal must specify the name and number of the
account at DTC to be credited with the withdrawn Shares, in which case a notice
of withdrawal will be effective if delivered to the Depositary by any method of
delivery described in the first sentence of this paragraph.

    In general, the receipt of cash by the holders of Shares pursuant to the
Offer and/or the Merger will constitute a taxable transaction for United States
federal income tax purposes. Because the tax consequences to a particular holder
may differ based on that holder's particular circumstances, each holder should
consult his or her own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the Offer
and the Merger.

    The information required to be disclosed by Rule 14d-6(d)(1) of the General
Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act is contained in the Offer to
Purchase and is incorporated herein by reference.

    The Company has provided Sub with its stockholder lists and security
position listings for the purpose of disseminating the Offer to holders of
Shares. The Offer to Purchase, the related Letter of Transmittal and other
related materials are being mailed to record holders of Shares whose names
appear on the stockholder list and will be furnished to brokers, dealers,
commercial banks, trust companies and similar persons whose names appear, or
whose nominees appear, on the stockholder lists or, if applicable, who are
listed as participants in a clearing agency's security position listing for
subsequent transmittal to beneficial owners of Shares.

    The Offer to Purchase and the related Letter of Transmittal contain
important information which should be read carefully before any decision is made
with respect to the Offer.

    Questions and requests for assistance and requests for copies of the Offer
to Purchase and the related Letter of Transmittal and all other tender offer
materials may be directed to the Information Agent at the address and telephone
number set forth below and will be furnished promptly at Sub's expense. Sub will
not pay any fees or commissions to any broker or dealer or any other person
(other than the Information Agent) for soliciting tenders of Shares pursuant to
the Offer.

               CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

         SECTION 3.01 EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Sub:

         (a) CAPITAL STOCK OF SUB. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

         (b) CANCELLATION OF TREASURY STOCK AND PARENT-OWNED STOCK. Each share
of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries,
Parent or Sub shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

         (c) CONVERSION OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK AND OPTIONS. (i) Subject to
SECTIONS 3.01(b), and 3.01(d), each issued and outstanding share of Company
Common Stock shall be converted into the Merger Consideration.

                  (ii) As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company
         Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
         canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
         certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall
         cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
         receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificate in
         accordance with SECTION 3.02, without interest.

                  (iii) Company Employee Stock Options shall be treated as set
forth in SECTION 7.04.

         (d) DISSENTERS' RIGHTS. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Dissenters' Shares shall not be converted into Merger
Consideration as provided in SECTION 3.01(c), but rather the holders of
Dissenters' Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such
Dissenters' Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall
waive, withdraw or lose the right to receive payment of fair value under
Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair
value of such holder's Dissenters' Shares shall cease and such Dissenters'
Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective
Time into Merger Consideration as provided in SECTION 3.01(c). The Company
shall provide prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company
for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of
any such demands and any other documents received in connection with any
assertion of rights to payment of fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL,
and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to,
or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

         SECTION 3.02  EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.

         (a) PAYING AGENT. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a
bank or trust company to act as the Paying Agent for the payment of the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of Certificates representing Company Common Stock.
The Surviving Corporation shall provide to the Paying Agent on a timely basis,
as and when needed after the Effective Time, cash necessary to pay for the
shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to SECTION 3.01(c) (such cash being hereinafter referred
to as the "EXCHANGE FUND").

         (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURE. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate or Certificates, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall
be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify)
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore
represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to SECTION
3.01, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered
in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall (A) pay any transfer or

other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate, or (B) establish to the satisfaction of
the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is otherwise not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this SECTION 3.02, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration, without
interest, into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented
by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to SECTION 3.01(c). No
interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any Merger Consideration payable upon
the surrender of any Certificate.

         (c) NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY COMMON STOCK. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE III upon
conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented
to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE III.

         (d) TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock six months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation and any
holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this
ARTICLE III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment
of its claim for Merger Consideration.

         (e) NO LIABILITY. None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any
cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Law. If any
Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the date that is five years after
the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which Merger
Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

         (f) INVESTMENT OF EXCHANGE FUND. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent.

         (g) WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of
Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required
to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the

extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax
Authority, the Surviving Corporation will be treated as though it withheld an
appropriate amount of the type of consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock, sold such consideration
for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of such consideration at
the time of such deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds to the appropriate
Tax Authority.

         (h) LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof as determined in accordance with SECTION 3.01 hereof,
provided that the Person to whom the Merger Consideration is paid shall, as a
condition precedent to the payment thereof, indemnify the Surviving
Corporation in a manner satisfactory to it (including, without limitation,
the posting by such Person of such bond and security as the Surviving
Corporation may reasonably request) against any claim that may be made
against the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Certificate claimed to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

         The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as follows:

         SECTION 4.01 ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND POWER. The Company and each of
the Company Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has
full power and authority and possesses all Permits necessary to enable it to
own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct its
business as presently conducted, other than such Permits the lack of which,

expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each Company
Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business in each jurisdiction (i) listed in
SECTION 4.01 of the Company Disclosure Letter and (ii) where the nature of its
business or its ownership of its properties make such qualification necessary or
beneficial, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified,

organizational documents and partnership, limited liability company and joint
venture agreements (and in each case all amendments thereto) of each of the
Company Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the date hereof have been

Option Plan are Employee Stock Options. Except as set forth above, as of the
date of this Agreement, there are no options, warrants, rights, convertible or
exchangeable securities, "phantom" stock rights, stock appreciation rights,
stock-based performance units, commitments, contracts, arrangements or
undertakings of any kind to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a

         SECTION 4.04 AUTHORIZATION; VALIDITY OF AGREEMENT; NECESSARY ACTION.
(a) The Company has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
each Transaction Agreement to which it is a party and each agreement,
document and instrument to be executed and delivered by or on behalf of it
pursuant to, or in connection with or as contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements and to consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of each Transaction Agreement to which it is a
party and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and
except for the Company Stockholder Approval in the case of the Merger, no
other corporate action on the part of the Company is necessary to authorize
the consummation of the Transactions. The Transaction Agreements to which the
Company is a party have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and
constitute (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent
and Sub), valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable against
the Company in accordance with their respective terms, except to the extent
that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors'
rights generally and subject to general principles of equity.

         (b) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held prior to
execution of any of the Transaction Agreements, duly adopted resolutions by a
unanimous vote of those directors present at the meeting (i) approving and
declaring advisable this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements to which
the Company is a party, the Merger and the other Transactions, (ii) determining
that the terms of the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions are fair to
and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (iii)
recommending that the holders of Company Common Stock accept the Offer and
tender their shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, (iv)
recommending that the Company's stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement
and (v) adopting this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements to which
the Company is a party. Such resolutions are sufficient to render inapplicable
to Parent and Sub and this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements to
which the Company is a party, the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions
the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL. The Company has been advised by each
of its directors and officers that each such Person intends to tender all shares
of Company Common

Stock owned by such Person pursuant to the Offer, except to the extent of any
restrictions created by Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.

         (c) The only vote of holders of any class or series of Company Capital
Stock necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger is the
approval of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock (the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL"). No vote or
approval of any holder of Company Capital Stock is necessary to approve any
Transaction Agreement other than this Agreement or to consummate the Offer or
any Transaction other than the Merger.

         SECTION 4.05 NO CONFLICTS; CONSENTS. Except as set forth in SECTION
4.05 of the Company Disclosure Letter, the execution and delivery by the
Company of each Transaction Agreement to which it is a party do not, and the
consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions and
compliance with the terms hereof and thereof will not, conflict with, or
result in any violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation under, or to increased, additional,
accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements of any Person under, or
result in the creation of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of
the properties or assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary under, any
provision of (i) the Company Charter, the Company By-laws or the comparable
charter or organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary, (ii) any
Material Contract or (iii) subject to the filings and other matters referred
to in the following sentence, any provision of any Order or Applicable Law
applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or their respective
properties or assets, other than, in the cases of CLAUSE (ii) or (iii) above,
any such items that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and could
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except
as set forth in SECTION 4.05 of the Company Disclosure Letter, no Consent of,
or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity is
required to be obtained or made by or with respect to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in connection with the execution, delivery and performance
of any Transaction Agreement to which it is a party or the consummation of
the Transactions, other than (A) compliance with and filings under the HSR
Act, (B) the filing with the SEC of (1) the Schedule 14D-9, (2) a Proxy

position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates

therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. The Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in
all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, except that no representation is made by
the Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein
based on information supplied by Parent or Sub for inclusion or incorporation by
reference therein.

distributing any of its current products to any class of customers, in any

location, or body of water (surface or subsurface), for any illness of or

         SECTION 4.19  REAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY.

         (a) REAL PROPERTY. SCHEDULE 4.19(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter
sets forth a complete list of all real properties that are owned by the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (the "COMPANY OWNED REAL
PROPERTY"). The Company and each Company Subsidiary has good and marketable

occupied by them except for such as are no longer used or useful in the
conduct of its businesses or as have been disposed of in the ordinary and
usual course of business and except for defects in title, easements,
restrictive covenants and similar encumbrances or impediments that, in the

conduct its business as currently conducted. Except as set forth in SECTION
4.19(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, all such properties, other than
properties in which the Company or the Company Subsidiaries has leasehold
interests, are free and clear of all Liens and except for (i) statutory Liens
of carriers, warehousemen, mechanics, repairmen, workmen and materialmen
incurred in the ordinary and usual course of business for amounts not yet
overdue or being contested in good faith, (ii) Liens for Taxes not yet due

conducted (any or all of such liens under CLAUSES (i), (ii) or (iii),
"PERMITTED LIENS"). Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has an
option to purchase any real property. All of the real property leased by the
Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries is identified in SECTION 4.19(a)
of the Company Disclosure Letter (herein referred to as the "COMPANY LEASED
REAL PROPERTY").

                  (i) STATUS OF LEASES. All leases of the Company Leased Real
         Property are identified in SECTION 4.19(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure
         Letter, and true and complete copies thereof have been delivered to
         Parent. Each of said leases has been duly authorized and executed by
         the Company or the Company Subsidiary party thereto, is in full force
         and effect and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of
         the Company or the Company Subsidiary party thereto, and is enforceable
         in accordance with its respective terms, except to the extent that the
         enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
         moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of
         creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of
         equity. The Company or the Company Subsidiary party thereto has not
         received notice of any default under any of said leases, nor, to the
         Knowledge of the Company, has any event occurred which, with notice or
         the passage of time, or both, would give rise to such a default. To the
         Knowledge of the Company, the other party to each

         of said leases is not in default under any of said leases and there
         is no event which, with notice or the passage of time, or both, would
         give rise to such a default.

                  (ii) CONDITION OF REAL PROPERTY. Except as set forth in
         SECTION 4.19()(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter, all premises
         constituting a part of the Company Owned Real Property or the Company
         Leased Real Property are in good operating condition and repair, and
         there are no material defects in the physical condition of any
         buildings or improvements constituting part of the Company Owned Real
         Property or the Company Leased Real Property that, individually or in
         the aggregate, would materially impair the usefulness of the Company
         Owned Real Property or the Company Leased Real Property for its current
         purposes.

                  (iii) COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW. None of the Company or any of
         the Company Subsidiaries has received any notice from any Governmental
         Entity of any violation of any Applicable Law, Order or Permit issued
         with respect to any Company Owned Real Property or Company Leased Real
         Property that has not been heretofore corrected and no such violation
         exists which could have a material adverse effect on the operation of
         any Company Owned Real Property or Company Leased Real Property. All
         improvements located on or constituting part of any Company Owned Real
         Property or Company Leased Real Property and the use and operation
         thereof by Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries are in compliance
         in all material respects with all Applicable Laws or Permits. None of
         the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has received any notice
         of any real estate Tax deficiency or assessment and, to the Knowledge
         of the Company, there is no proposed deficiency, claim or assessment
         with respect to any of the Company Owned Real Property or the Company
         Leased Real Property, or any pending or threatened condemnation
         thereof.

                  (iv) OTHER MATTERS. Neither the Company nor any Company
         Subsidiary leases or subleases any real or personal property as lessor
         or sublessor.

assets and properties, real and personal, used by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries in their business or otherwise held by the Company or a Company
Subsidiary. Except as set forth in SECTION 4.19(b) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Company or one of the Company Subsidiaries has good and valid title
to all assets and properties included in the Financial Statements or thereafter
acquired, in each case free and clear of any Lien.

         SECTION 4.20 INSURANCE. The physical properties, assets, business,
operations, employees, officers and directors of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries are insured to the extent disclosed in SECTION 4.20 of the Company

Subsidiaries pending under any such policies as to which coverage has been
questioned, denied or disputed by the insurer. Said insurance policies and
arrangements are in full force and effect, all premiums with respect thereto are
currently paid, and the Company and the

Company Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms thereof. SECTION 4.20
of the Company Disclosure Letter also sets forth a list of insurance policies
to which other parties (including Affiliates of the Company) are named
insureds which relate to the properties, assets or operations of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary and the names of such other parties. No notice of

Subsidiary with respect to any insurance policy described in SECTION 4.20 of
the Company Disclosure Letter. The Company and each Company Subsidiary carry
insurance in amounts and types of coverage which are adequate and customary
in the industry and against risks and losses which are usually insured
against by Persons holding or operating similar properties and similar
businesses. No claims have been asserted by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary under any of the insurance policies of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or relating to their properties, assets or operations. Each such
insurance policy shall continue to be in full force and effect following
consummation of the Transactions.

         SECTION 4.21 COMPENSATION. SECTION 4.21 of the Company Disclosure

Subsidiary and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts which may
give rise to such Proceedings or disciplinary actions. SECTION 4.23 of the
Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct and complete list of all such
Permits required under any Environmental, Health and Safety Laws.

                                    ARTICLE V

                REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND SUB

         Parent and Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to the
Company as follows:

         SECTION 5.01 ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND POWER. (a) Each of Parent and
Sub is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has all requisite corporate power
and authority to conduct its businesses as presently conducted, other than such
franchises, licenses, Permits, authorizations and approvals the lack of which,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and could not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 5.02 SUB. Sub is a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent and, since
the date of its incorporation, Sub has not carried on any business or conducted
any operations other than the execution of the Transaction Agreements to which
it is a party, the performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and
matters ancillary thereto.

         SECTION 5.03 FINANCING. Parent has or has available to it, and will
make available to Sub all funds necessary to consummate all the Transactions and
pay the related fees and expenses of Parent and Sub.

         SECTION 5.04 OWNERSHIP OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK. Except for the
transactions contemplated by the Stock Option and Tender Agreements, as of the
date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Sub beneficially owns any Company
Common Stock.

         SECTION 5.05 AUTHORIZATION; VALIDITY OF AGREEMENT; NECESSARY ACTION.
Each of Parent and Sub has full corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver each Transaction Agreement to which it is a party and each agreement,
document and instrument to be executed and delivered by or on behalf of Parent
and/or Sub, as the case may be, pursuant to or in connection with the
Transaction Agreements and to consummate the Transactions. The Board of
Directors of Sub (the "SUB BOARD") has adopted a resolution approving this
Agreement. The execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Sub of this
Agreement and the Transaction Agreements to which either is a party and the
consummation of the Transactions have been duly authorized by the Board of
Directors of Parent (the "PARENT BOARD") and the Sub Board and by Parent as the
sole stockholder of Sub and, except as set forth in the SECTION 5.05 of the
Parent Disclosure Letter, no other corporate action on the part of Parent or Sub
or any other Person is necessary to authorize the execution and

delivery by Parent and Sub of this Agreement, any Transaction Agreement or
the consummation of the Transactions. This Agreement, assuming due and valid
authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Company, constitutes,
and when executed and delivered by the Parent and/or Sub, as the case may be,
each other Transaction Agreement will constitute, legal, valid and binding
obligations of each of Parent and Sub, as the case may be, enforceable
against each of them in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors'
rights generally and subject to general principles of equity.

         SECTION 5.06 NO CONFLICTS; CONSENTS. The execution and delivery by
each of Parent and Sub of each Transaction Agreement to which it is a party,
do not, and the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof and thereof will not,
conflict with, or result in any violation of or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation under, or to
increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements of
any Person under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Permitted
Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of the Parent or Sub, any
provision of (i) the charter or organizational documents of Parent or Sub,
(ii) any material Contract to which Parent or Sub is a party or by which any
of their respective properties or assets is bound or (iii) subject to the
filings and other matters referred to in the following sentence, any Order or
Applicable Law applicable to Parent or Sub or their respective properties or
assets, other than, in the case of CLAUSES (ii) and (iii) above, any such
items that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and could not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No Consent
of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity is
required to be obtained or made by or with respect to Parent or Sub in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance of any Transaction
Agreement to which Parent or Sub is a party or the consummation of the
Transactions, other than (A) compliance with and filings under the HSR Act,

connection with this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, the

Parent Disclosure Letter.

         SECTION 5.07 INFORMATION SUPPLIED. None of the information supplied or
to be supplied in writing by Parent or Sub for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in (i) Offer Documents or the Schedule 14D-9 will, at the time such
document is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or at
the time it is first published, sent or given to the Company's stockholders,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, or (ii)
the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the Company's
stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any
untrue

statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The
Offer Documents will comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder,
except that no representation is made by Parent or Sub with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

         SECTION 5.08 BROKERS. Neither Parent nor Sub has entered into any
contract, agreement, arrangement or understanding with any Person which may
result in the obligation of Parent or Sub to pay any finder's fees, brokerage or
agent's commission or other like payments in connection with the negotiations

         (b) OTHER ACTIONS. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any

forth in ARTICLE VIII not being satisfied in all material respects.

         (c) ADVICE OF CHANGES. (i) The Company shall promptly advise Parent in
writing of any change or event having, or which, insofar as can reasonably be
foreseen, would have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                  (ii) After the date hereof, the Company shall have the
         continuing obligation promptly to inform Parent in writing with respect
         to any matter hereafter arising or discovered which would have been
         required to be set forth or described in the Company Disclosure Letter
         or would have been required to be taken as an exception to any
         representation or warranty of the Company in order for the
         representations and warranties of the Company to be true and correct at
         and as of the times such representations and warranties are required to
         be true and correct in accordance with this Agreement; PROVIDED,
         HOWEVER, that no such information supplied to Parent shall be deemed to
         amend or supplement the Company Disclosure Letter or to correct or cure
         any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of the
         Company made in this Agreement.

         SECTION 6.02 NO SOLICITATION. (a) From the date of this Agreement until
the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not (and the Company will use its
best efforts to cause each of its and each of its Company Subsidiaries'
officers, directors or management employees or any investment banker, financial
advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by it or any of
its Subsidiaries not to) directly or indirectly (i) solicit, encourage, engage
in discussions or negotiate with any Person (whether such discussions or
negotiations are initiated by the Company or otherwise) or take any other action
intended or designed to facilitate any inquiry or effort of any Person (other
than Parent) relating to any possible business combination with or any possible
acquisition of the Company (whether by way of merger, purchase of capital stock,
purchase of assets or otherwise) or any material portion of its capital stock or
assets (with any such efforts by any such Person, including a firm proposal to
make such an acquisition, to be referred to as an "ALTERNATIVE ACQUISITION"),
(ii) provide information with respect to the Company to any Person, other than
Parent, relating to a possible Alternative Acquisition by any Person, other than
Parent, (iii) enter into an agreement with any Person, other than Parent,
providing for a possible Alternative Acquisition, or (iv) make or authorize any
statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of any possible Alternative
Acquisition by any Person, other than by Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to the acceptance for payment of Company Common Stock equal to at least
the Minimum Tender Condition pursuant to, and subject to the conditions of, the
Offer, the Company Board (or any

committee thereof) may, to the extent required by the fiduciary obligations
of the Company Board under Delaware law, as determined in good faith by the
Company Board (or any committee thereof), in response to a proposal for an
Alternative Acquisition ("ALTERNATIVE ACQUISITION PROPOSAL") that the Company
Board (or any committee thereof) determines, in good faith after consultation
with independent counsel and an independent financial advisor, is or is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Company Proposal (as defined in
SECTION 6.02(e)), that was not solicited by the Company and that did not
otherwise result from a breach of this SECTION 6.02(a) and subject to
providing prior written notice of its decision to take such action to Parent,
(x) furnish information with respect to the Company to the Person or group
making such Alternative Acquisition Proposal and its representatives pursuant
to a confidentiality agreement with terms not materially more favorable to
the Person making the Alternative Acquisition Proposal than those applicable
to Parent under the Confidentiality Agreement (except that such
confidentiality agreement need not contain any standstill provisions) and (y)
participate in discussions and negotiations with such Person or group and its
representatives to the extent required by the fiduciary duties of the Company
Board regarding such Alternative Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall, and
shall cause its representatives to, cease immediately all discussions and
negotiations that may have occurred prior to the date of this Agreement
regarding any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Alternative Acquisition Proposal. For purposes of this SECTION
6.02 and SECTION 9.02(b)(ii), the term "Person" shall include any group as
defined in the Exchange Act. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood
that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this SECTION 6.02 by any
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representative of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be deemed to be
a breach of this Section by the Company.

         (b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent or Sub, the approval or recommendation by the Company Board or any
such committee of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger, (ii) approve or
cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, definitive agreement or similar agreement constituting or relating
to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to any
Alternative Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend, or propose to
approve or recommend, any Alternative Acquisition Proposal or (iv) agree or
resolve to take actions set forth in CLAUSES (i), (ii) or (iii) of this
sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, during the period prior to the
acceptance for payment of the Company Common Stock equal to the Minimum
Tender Condition pursuant to the Offer, the Company Board receives a Superior
Company Proposal and the Company Board determines in good faith, that it is
necessary to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary obligations under
Delaware law, the Company Board may, during such period, in response to a
Superior Company Proposal that was unsolicited and did not otherwise result
from a breach of SECTION 6.02(a), withdraw or modify its approval or
recommendation of the Offer, the Merger and this Agreement and, in connection
therewith, approve or recommend such Superior Company Proposal.

         (c) The Company promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, shall
advise Parent in writing of any Alternative Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry
with respect to or that could lead to any Alternative Acquisition Proposal, the
identity of the Person or group making any such Alternative Acquisition Proposal
or inquiry and the material terms of any such Alternative Acquisition Proposal
or inquiry. The Company shall (i) keep Parent reasonably informed of the status,
including any change to the details, of any such Alternative Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry and (ii) provide to Parent as soon as practicable after
receipt or delivery thereof with copies of all material correspondence and other
written material sent or provided to the Company from any third party in
connection with any Alternative Acquisition Proposal or sent or provided by the
Company to any third party in connection with any Alternative Acquisition
Proposal. The Company cannot terminate this Agreement pursuant to SECTION
9.01(e) until at least seventy-two (72) hours have expired since the Company
provided Parent with written notice advising Parent (i) that the Company has
received a Superior Company Proposal, (ii) of the material terms and conditions
(including, without limitation, price, sources of financing and any material
contingencies) of such Superior Company Proposal and of the identity of the
Person making such Superior Company Proposal and (iii) that the Company intends
to accept such Superior Company Proposal.

         (d) Nothing contained in this SECTION 6.02 shall prohibit the Company
from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any required
disclosure to the Company's stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the
Company Board, after consultation with independent counsel, failure so to
disclose could be inconsistent with its obligations under Applicable Law;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that except as set forth in SECTION 6.02(b), in no event
shall the Company Board or any committee thereof withdraw or modify, or propose
to withdraw or modify its position with respect to this Agreement, the Offer or
the Merger or adopt, approve or recommend, or propose to adopt, approve or
recommend any Alternative Acquisition Proposal.

         (e) For purposes of this Agreement, "SUPERIOR COMPANY PROPOSAL"
means any proposal made by a third party to acquire all or substantially all
the equity securities or assets of the Company, or other transaction for the
acquisition of all or substantially all the equity securities or assets of
the Company through a tender or exchange offer, a merger, a consolidation, a
liquidation or dissolution, a recapitalization, a sale or a joint venture,
that is on terms which the Company Board determines in its good faith
judgment (after consultation with a financial adviser, with only customary
qualifications, and independent legal counsel) to be superior for the holders
of the Company Common Stock, from a financial point of view, to the Offer and
the Merger, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal
and this Agreement (including any proposal theretofore made by Parent to
amend the terms of this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger) taking into
account the likelihood of consummation in light of all financial, regulatory,
legal and other aspects of such proposal (including, without limitation, any
antitrust or competition law approvals or non-objections).

                                   ARTICLE VII

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

         SECTION 7.01 PREPARATION OF PROXY STATEMENT; STOCKHOLDERS MEETING. (a)
If the approval of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders is required by
Applicable Law, the Company shall, as soon as practicable following the
expiration of the Offer, prepare in accordance with the rules and regulations of
the SEC and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in preliminary form, and each
of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto. The
Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC
or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall
supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of
its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to receipt of
Company Stockholder Approval there shall occur any event that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall
promptly prepare and mail to its stockholders such an amendment or supplement.
The Company shall not mail any Proxy Statement, or any amendment or supplement
thereto, to which Parent reasonably objects. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Company's stockholders as promptly as practicable after filing with the SEC.

         (b) If the approval of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders is
required by Applicable Law, the Company shall, as soon as practicable following
the expiration of the Offer, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of seeking Company Stockholder
Approval. The Company shall, through the Company Board, recommend to its
stockholders that they approve this Agreement and the Merger, except to the
extent that the Company Board shall have withdrawn or modified its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger as permitted by
SECTION 6.02(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Sub or any other Subsidiary
of Parent shall acquire at least 90% of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock, the parties shall, at the request of Parent, take all necessary and
appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as
practicable after the expiration of the Offer without a stockholders meeting in
accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

         (c) Parent shall cause all shares of Company Common Stock purchased
pursuant to the Offer and all other shares of Company Common Stock owned by Sub
or any other Subsidiary of Parent to be voted in favor of the approval of this
Agreement and the Merger.

         SECTION 7.02 ACCESS TO INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY. The Company shall,
and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent, and to
Parent's officers, employees,

accountants, counsel, financial advisers and other representatives,
reasonable access during normal business hours during the period prior to the
Effective Time to all their respective properties, books, Contracts,
commitments, personnel and records and, during such period, the Company
shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly
to Parent (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and
other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of
Federal or state securities laws and (ii) all other information concerning
its business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall, within
two business days of request therefor, provide to Parent the information
described in Rule 14a-7(a)(2)(ii) under the Exchange Act and any information
to which a holder of Company Common Stock would be entitled under Section 220
of the DGCL (assuming such holder met the requirements of such section). All
information exchanged pursuant to this SECTION 7.02 shall be subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms except that the seventh
and eighth paragraphs thereof (regarding standstill) are hereby terminated
and of no further force and effect.

         SECTION 7.03 REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS; NOTIFICATION. (a) Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement each of the
parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions, including (i)
the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals from Governmental Entities, including, without limitation, the
execution of any documents required to be filed in accordance with the New
Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act, and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be
necessary to obtain any necessary approval or waiver from, or to avoid an
action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, including under the HSR
Act, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from
third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement
or any other Transaction Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions,
including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by
any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed and (iv) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of the Transaction
Agreements. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the
Company and the Company Board shall (A) take all commercially reasonable
action necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar statute
or regulation is or becomes applicable to any Transaction or this Agreement
or any other Transaction Agreement, and (B) if any state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement or any
other Transaction Agreement, take all commercially reasonable action
necessary to ensure that the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute
or regulation on the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions.

         (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the
Company shall not, without Parent's prior written consent, commit to any
divestitures, licenses, hold separate arrangements or similar matters, including
covenants affecting business operating practices (or allow its Subsidiaries to
commit to any divestitures, licenses, hold separate arrangements or similar
matters), and the Company shall commit to, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to effect (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to commit to and use their
reasonable best efforts to effect), any such divestitures, licenses, hold
separate arrangements or similar matters as Parent shall request, but solely if
such divestitures, licenses, hold separate arrangements or similar matters are
contingent on consummation of the Offer and (ii) neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to agree (with respect to (A) Parent or its
Subsidiaries or (B) the Company or its Subsidiaries) to any divestitures,
licenses, hold separate arrangements or similar matters, including covenants
affecting business operating practices, if such divestitures, licenses,
arrangements or similar matters, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

         (c) Except as provided below, nothing in this SECTION 7.03 or any other
part of this Agreement shall require Parent to refrain from entering into any
agreement with respect to, or issuing Parent common stock or other consideration
in connection with, a business combination with, or an acquisition of, another
Person or any businesses or assets of another Person after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time (a "SUBSEQUENT TRANSACTION"). In the
event of a Subsequent Transaction, Parent shall agree to any divestitures,
licenses, hold separate arrangements or similar matters (including covenants
affecting business operating practices) on a timely basis that are necessary in
order to obtain approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under applicable competition laws that would not otherwise have been required in
order to obtain such approval but for the Subsequent Transaction. Parent will
promptly advise the Company in writing if it enters into an agreement relating
to a Subsequent Transaction that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse
impact under applicable competition law on the timely completion of the
Transactions and thereafter keep the Company apprised of the status of such
Subsequent Transaction.

         (d) The Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the
status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notice or other communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case
may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any Governmental Entity with respect to
Transactions.

         (e) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent or
Sub shall give prompt notice to the Company, of, and such party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to prevent, or promptly remedy (i) any representation
or warranty made by it contained in any Transaction Agreement that is
qualified as to becoming untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any such
representation or warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) the failure by it to comply with
or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under any Transaction Agreement; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that no such

notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under any other Transaction Agreement.

         SECTION 7.04 STOCK OPTIONS. (a) Except as described in SECTION 7.04(b)
below, as soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Option Plans)
shall adopt, or shall cause to be adopted, such resolutions or take, or cause to
be taken, such other actions as are required to adjust the terms of all
outstanding Company Employee Stock Options (other than the Individual Options)
heretofore granted under any Company Option Plan or otherwise, to provide that
each Company Employee Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (whether or not then vested) shall be canceled as of the
Effective Time in exchange for a cash payment by the Company to be made on the
date following the Effective Time (or as soon as practicable thereafter) of an
amount equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the price per share of Company
Common Stock to be paid pursuant to the Offer over (B) the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Employee Stock Option,
multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which such
Company Employee Stock Option shall not theretofore have been exercised.

         (b) With respect to the Individual Options granted to each of the
individuals identified in SECTION 7.04(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
the Company shall take the actions specifie
