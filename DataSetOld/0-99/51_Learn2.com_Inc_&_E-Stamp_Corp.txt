                        JOINT PROXY STATEMENT-PROSPECTUS

        TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF E-STAMP CORPORATION AND LEARN2.COM, INC.

                 MERGER PROPOSED -- YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

     The boards of directors of E-Stamp Corporation and Learn2.com, Inc. have
agreed to a merger pursuant to which Learn2 will merge with E-Stamp, with
E-Stamp continuing as the surviving company and changing its name to Learn2
Corporation.

     When the merger is completed, each share of Learn2 common stock will be
converted into the right to receive shares of E-Stamp common stock such that the
holders of E-Stamp common stock immediately prior to the merger will hold
approximately 50.1%, and the former holders of Learn2's common stock (including
the holder of Learn2's $10 million convertible debenture) will hold
approximately 49.9%, of the combined company.

     Learn2 common stock trades on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol
"LTWO." On May 8, 2001, the closing price of Learn2 common stock was $0.37 per
share. E-Stamp common stock trades on the Nasdaq National Market under the
symbol "ESTM." On May 8, 2001, the closing price of E-Stamp common stock was
$0.19 per share. After the merger is completed, E-Stamp intends to apply to
change the symbol under which its common stock is traded to "LTWO."

     The boards of directors of both E-Stamp and Learn2 have approved the merger
and recommend that their respective stockholders vote FOR the merger proposal.
This joint proxy statement-prospectus provides you with information regarding
the merger. We strongly urge you to read and consider carefully this document in
its entirety. IN PARTICULAR, YOU SHOULD READ THE "RISK FACTORS" SECTION
BEGINNING ON PAGE 13 FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE VARIOUS RISKS YOU SHOULD CONSIDER
IN EVALUATING THE MERGER.

     Completion of the merger requires the approval of both the Learn2
stockholders and the E-Stamp stockholders. Both E-Stamp and Learn2 have
scheduled a special meeting of their stockholders to vote on these proposals.

     The dates, times and places of the special meetings are as follows:

E-STAMP STOCKHOLDER MEETING    LEARN2 STOCKHOLDER MEETING
                 , 2001                  , 2001
          , local time                , local time

     Your vote is very important. Whether or not you expect to attend the
special meeting, please complete, date, sign and return the accompanying proxy
in the enclosed postage paid envelope so that your shares may be represented at
the meeting. Returning the proxy does not deprive you of your right to attend
the meeting and vote your shares in person. If you do not vote, it will have the
same effect as voting against the merger.

                             QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
                                ABOUT THE MERGER

Q: WHAT IS THE MERGER?

A: E-Stamp will acquire Learn2 through a merger of E-Stamp and Learn2 into a
   single corporation. E-Stamp will be the surviving corporation in the merger.
   Pursuant to the merger, stockholders of Learn2 (including the holder of
   Learn2's $10 million convertible debenture) will hold approximately 49.9% of
   the combined company, and stockholders of E-Stamp will hold approximately
   50.1% of the combined company.

Q: WHY ARE THE TWO COMPANIES PROPOSING TO MERGE?

A: The boards of directors of E-Stamp and Learn2 believe that the merger will
   create a combined company that will have the opportunity to:

    - enhance stockholder value for both E-Stamp and Learn2 stockholders;

    - increase revenue opportunities for the combined company;

    - add working capital for growth of the Learn2 business;

    - introduce new tutorials and expand the Learn2 product offerings into new
      markets;

    - eliminate existing Learn2 indebtedness;

    - increase awareness of the Learn2 brand; and

    - attract and retain qualified employees and customers.

Q: WHAT WILL LEARN2 STOCKHOLDERS RECEIVE AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER?

A: Learn2 stockholders will be entitled to receive, for each share of Learn2
   common stock they own, that number of shares of E-Stamp common stock equal to
   the quotient obtained by dividing (1) 99.5% of the number of outstanding
   shares of E-Stamp common stock by (2) the number of outstanding shares of
   Learn2 common stock. For purposes of this calculation, outstanding shares of
   both E-Stamp and Learn2 common stock shall include options that will be
   vested as of the closing of the merger and have an exercise price that is
   less than or equal to the average closing price of E-Stamp or Learn2 common
   stock, respectively, for the five consecutive trading days immediately
   preceding the E-Stamp or Learn2 special meeting, respectively.

    Based on an estimated 38.1 million shares of E-Stamp common stock and 79.4
    million shares of Learn2 common stock, which assumes the conversion of
    Learn2's $10 million convertible debenture into an estimated 26.4 million
    shares of Learn2 common stock, outstanding immediately prior to the merger,
    the exchange ratio would be approximately 0.478. As a result, the Learn2
    stockholders would receive approximately 0.478 shares of E-Stamp common
    stock for each share of Learn2 common stock that they own. The exchange
    ratio will fluctuate based on, among other things, the number of shares
    issuable under vested stock options of E-Stamp and Learn2 with exercise
    prices equal to or less than the average closing price of each company's
    common stock for the five consecutive trading days immediately prior to the
    special meetings. Assuming that the average closing price of each company's
    common stock for the five consecutive trading days immediately prior to the
    special meetings is less than $1 per share, we estimate that the exchange
    ratio could range from 0.457 to 0.485.

Q: WHAT WILL E-STAMP STOCKHOLDERS RECEIVE AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER?

A: E-Stamp stockholders will continue to hold their existing E-Stamp common
   stock. E-Stamp stockholders immediately prior to the merger will hold
   approximately 50.1% of the combined company when the merger is completed.

                                        vi

Q: WHEN IS THE LEARN2 STOCKHOLDERS' SPECIAL MEETING RELATING TO THE MERGER, AND
   WHAT SPECIFIC PROPOSALS WILL I BE ASKED TO CONSIDER?

A: The Learn2 stockholders' special meeting will take place on             ,
   2001. At the special meeting, Learn2 stockholders will be asked to:

    - adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger of Learn2 with and into
      E-Stamp, including the issuance of approximately 26.4 million shares of
      Learn2 common stock to the holder of Learn2's $10 million convertible
      debenture;

    - approve an amendment of Learn2's Amended and Restated Certificate of
      Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split whereby Learn2 would issue
      one new share of common stock in exchange for not less than two shares nor
      more than ten shares of its outstanding common stock; and

    - elect five directors of Learn2 to serve until the earlier of the 2002
      annual meeting of stockholders or until their respective successors are
      elected and qualified.

   The reverse stock split and the election of directors would be effective only
   if the merger is not completed, and implementation of the reverse stock split
   would be in the discretion of the board of directors.

Q: WHEN IS THE E-STAMP STOCKHOLDERS' SPECIAL MEETING RELATING TO THE MERGER, AND
   WHAT SPECIFIC PROPOSALS WILL I BE ASKED TO CONSIDER?

A: The E-Stamp stockholders' special meeting will take place on                ,
   2001. At the special meeting, E-Stamp stockholders will be asked to:

    - adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger of Learn2 with and into
      E-Stamp, which includes changing E-Stamp's name to "Learn2 Corporation."

    - amend E-Stamp's 1999 Stock Plan to increase the number of shares reserved
      for issuance under the plan by 2,500,000.

Q: WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?

A: After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this
   joint proxy statement-prospectus, please mail your signed proxy card in the
   enclosed return envelope as soon as possible, so that your shares may be
   represented at the special meeting.

Q: WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON'T VOTE?

    - If you fail to respond, it will have the same effect as a vote against the
      merger.

    - If you respond and do not indicate how you want to vote, your proxy will
      be counted as a vote in favor of the merger.

    - If you respond and abstain from voting, your proxy will have the same
      effect as a vote against the merger.

Q: CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I HAVE MAILED MY SIGNED PROXY CARD?

A: Yes. You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the
   special meeting. You can do this in one of three ways:

    - you can send a written notice to the secretary of Learn2 or E-Stamp, as
      appropriate, stating that you would like to revoke your proxy;

    - you can complete and submit a new proxy card; or

    - you can attend the special meeting and vote in person.

                                       vii

    Your attendance at the meeting alone will not revoke your proxy. Only your
    vote at the meeting will revoke your proxy.

Q: IF MY BROKER HOLDS MY SHARES IN "STREET NAME," WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY SHARES
   FOR ME?

A: No. Your broker will not be able to vote your shares without instructions
   from you. If you do not provide your broker with voting instructions, your
   shares will be considered present at the special meeting for purposes of
   determining a quorum but will not be voted in favor of the merger. If you
   have instructed a broker to vote your shares, you must follow directions
   received from your broker to change those instructions.

Q: SHOULD I SEND IN MY STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW?

A: No. If you are a Learn2 stockholder, we will send you written instructions
   for exchanging your Learn2 stock certificates for E-Stamp stock certificates
   after the merger is completed. If you are an E-Stamp stockholder, you will
   retain your existing stock certificates after the merger.

Q: HOW DO LEARN2'S OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS PLAN TO VOTE ON THE MERGER?

A: Learn2's board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and
   the merger and recommends that Learn2's stockholders approve the merger
   agreement and the merger. In addition, all of Learn2's executive officers and
   directors, who hold in the aggregate approximately 16.7% of Learn2's common
   stock, already have agreed to vote in favor of the merger agreement and the
   merger at the Learn2 special meeting.

Q: HOW DO E-STAMP'S OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS PLAN TO VOTE ON THE MERGER?

A: E-Stamp's board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement
   and the merger and recommends that E-Stamp's stockholders approve the merger
   agreement and the merger. In addition, all of E-Stamp's executive officers
   and directors, who hold in the aggregate approximately 19.2% of E-Stamp's
   common stock, already have agreed to vote in favor of the merger agreement
   and the merger at the E-Stamp special meeting.

Q: HOW WILL E-STAMP'S PROPOSED REVERSE STOCK SPLIT AFFECT WHAT LEARN2
   STOCKHOLDERS RECEIVE AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER?

A: At E-Stamp's annual meeting of stockholders to be held on             , 2001,
   E-Stamp intends to submit to its stockholders a proposal to approve an
   amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation authorizing its board of
   directors to effect a reverse stock split of not less than 1-for-3 and not
   greater than 1-for-13. If E-Stamp's stockholders approve the foregoing
   proposal, the board of directors of E-Stamp will have the authority to
   implement any of the foregoing reverse stock splits without seeking further
   stockholder approval following the merger. If E-Stamp's board of directors
   implements a reverse stock split, shares of E-Stamp common stock received by
   Learn2 stockholders in the merger will automatically be combined and
   converted into the smaller number of shares required to implement the reverse
   stock split at the time of filing of the applicable amendment to E-Stamp's
   Certificate of Incorporation.

Q: WILL LEARN2 STOCKHOLDERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE ON E-STAMP'S PROPOSED REVERSE
   STOCK SPLIT?

A: No. E-Stamp's proposed reverse stock split will be submitted to E-Stamp
   stockholders at E-Stamp's annual meeting to be held on             , 2001. If
   approved by E-Stamp stockholders, no further stockholder approval by E-Stamp
   or Learn2 stockholders will be required.

                                       viii

Q: WHEN CAN I SELL THE E-STAMP COMMON STOCK I RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?

A: The shares of E-Stamp common stock you receive in the merger will be freely
   transferable unless you are an "affiliate" of either E-Stamp or Learn2 or
   your shares are subject to any contractual restrictions on transfer.
   Generally, an "affiliate" is considered to be someone who is an executive
   officer or director of a company or someone who owns more than 10% of the
   outstanding stock of a company.

Q: WILL I RECEIVE FRACTIONAL SHARES AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER?

A: No. All fractional shares of E-Stamp common stock will be rounded to the
   nearest whole share.

Q: WHAT ARE THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO STOCKHOLDERS OF THE MERGER?

A: The merger is intended to be treated as a tax-free reorganization for federal
   income tax purposes. If the merger qualifies as a reorganization, Learn2
   stockholders generally will not recognize gain or loss on the exchange of
   their stock in the merger. Tax matters, however, are very complicated and the
   tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on the facts of your
   particular situation. We encourage you to contact your tax advisors to
   determine the tax consequences of the merger to you.

Q: DO EITHER E-STAMP OR LEARN2 STOCKHOLDERS HAVE DISSENTERS' RIGHTS IN
   CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER?

A: No. Under Delaware law, neither E-Stamp nor Learn2 stockholders are entitled
   to dissenters' rights in connection with the merger.

Q: ARE RIGHTS AS AN E-STAMP STOCKHOLDER DIFFERENT THAN RIGHTS AS A LEARN2
   STOCKHOLDER?

A: Yes. At the time of the merger, Learn2 stockholders will become stockholders
   of E-Stamp. There are important differences between the rights of
   stockholders of Learn2 and stockholders of E-Stamp. Please carefully review
   the description of these differences in the section entitled "Comparison of
   Rights of Holders of Learn2 Common Stock and E-Stamp Common Stock" in this
   joint proxy statement-prospectus.

Q: WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS HELD BY LEARN2 EMPLOYEES?

A: All outstanding options to purchase shares of Learn2 common stock, whether or
   not exercisable, will be assumed by E-Stamp and generally be subject to the
   same terms and conditions governing outstanding Learn2 options immediately
   prior to the completion of the merger, except that the number of shares
   E-Stamp common stock into which each outstanding Learn2 option will be
   exercisable and the exercise price will be adjusted appropriately to reflect
   the exchange ratio in the merger.

Q: MAY I EXERCISE STOCK OPTIONS BETWEEN NOW AND THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER?

A: Yes. Any shares of Learn2 received by holders of Learn2 stock options as a
   result of the exercise of Learn2 stock options prior to completion of the
   merger will be exchanged in the merger.

Q: WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE COMPLETED?

A: We are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible. We hope
   to complete the merger in the third quarter of 2001.

Q: WHO WILL BE THE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF E-STAMP FOLLOWING THE MERGER?

A: We have agreed that five of the nine directors of E-Stamp following the
   merger will be selected by the board of directors of E-Stamp, and four will
   be selected by Learn2. Robert H. Ewald, President and Chief Executive Officer
   of E-Stamp, will become the Chairman of the Board of E-Stamp following the
   merger. Donald Schupak will become the Chairman of the Executive Committee of
   the Board of E-Stamp. Stephen P. Gott, President and Chief Executive Officer
   of Learn2, will become the

                                        ix

   President and Chief Executive Officer of E-Stamp, and Marc E. Landy, Chief
   Financial Officer of Learn2, will become the Executive Vice President, Chief
   Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer of E-Stamp. Messrs. Robert H.
   Ewald, Donald Schupak, Marcelo A. Gumucio, Robert J. Cresci, John V. Balen,
   James A. Cannavino, Stephen P. Gott, S. Lee Kling and Ms. Rebecca Saeger will
   be members of the board of directors of E-Stamp immediately following the
   merger.

Q: WHOM SHOULD I CALL WITH QUESTIONS?

A: Learn2 stockholders should call Learn2 investor relations at 877-696-5896
   with any questions about the merger. E-Stamp stockholders should call E-Stamp
   investor relations at 650-919-7500 with any questions about the merger.

agreement:

       ratio, outstanding shares of both E-Stamp and Learn2 common stock

       holder) shall include options that will be vested as of the closing of
       the merger and have an exercise price that is less than or equal to the
       average closing price of E-Stamp or Learn2 common stock, respectively,
       for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the E-Stamp
       or Learn2 special meeting, respectively.

     - All outstanding options, warrants and other rights to purchase Learn2
       common stock will be assumed by E-Stamp and will become options, warrants
       and other rights to purchase E-Stamp common stock. The exercise price and
       number of shares of E-Stamp common stock into which they are convertible
       will be adjusted based on the exchange ratio.

     What E-Stamp Stockholders Will Receive. E-Stamp stockholders will continue
to hold their existing E-Stamp common stock. E-Stamp stockholders immediately
prior to the merger will hold approximately 50.1% of the combined company.

RELATED AGREEMENTS (SEE PAGE 66 - 68, 113)

     Voting Agreements. Learn2 executive officers and directors representing
approximately 16.7% of the outstanding shares of Learn2 common stock have
entered into voting agreements with E-Stamp. E-Stamp executive officers and
directors representing approximately 19.2% of the outstanding shares of E-Stamp
common stock have entered into voting agreements with Learn2. Under the voting
agreements, such persons have agreed to vote in favor of approval of the merger
and adoption of the merger agreement.

     Lock-up Agreements. E-Stamp and Learn2 each intend for the persons who will
serve as either executive officers or directors of E-Stamp after the merger to
enter into lock-up agreements restricting those persons' ability to dispose of
E-Stamp common stock. The lock up agreements will generally prohibit any
transfers of E-Stamp common stock before the merger and for the first six months
following the merger, and permit sales in only limited circumstances during the
following six months.

     RGC Redemption and Termination Agreement. In connection with the merger,
Learn2, E-Stamp and RGC International Investors, LDC entered into an agreement
providing for the redemption and termination of a convertible debenture in the
aggregate principal amount of $10 million issued by Learn2 to RGC. Under the
agreement, Learn2's stockholders must approve the issuance to RGC of shares of
common stock at the Learn2 special meeting in order to redeem and terminate the
debenture. Adoption of the merger agreement by Learn2 stockholders will
constitute approval of this stock issuance to RGC.

     The Private Placement. Pursuant to the merger agreement, E-Stamp loaned
Learn2 $2 million on April 25, 2001 in exchange for Learn2's issuance to E-Stamp
of a $2 million convertible promissory note. The note is due and payable by
Learn2 on April 30, 2002, subject to acceleration of the maturity date under
specified circumstances. The note is convertible into 2,000 shares of Series E
preferred stock of Learn2. These 2,000 shares of Learn2 Series E preferred stock
are initially convertible into an aggregate of 8,000,000 shares of Learn2 common
stock, subject to adjustment of the conversion ratio under specified
circumstances, at any time following the termination of the merger agreement.

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS (SEE PAGE 52)

     The merger is intended to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code. If the merger so qualifies, generally no gain or
loss will be recognized by the holders of shares of Learn2 stock on the exchange
of their shares of Learn2 common stock for shares of E-Stamp common stock. All
Learn2 stockholders should read carefully the discussion in the "Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" section of this joint proxy
statement-prospectus. FURTHER, ALL LEARN2 STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT
THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     We intend to account for the merger under the purchase method of accounting
for business combinations.

COMPLETION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MERGER

     We will complete the merger when all of the conditions to completion of the
merger have been satisfied or waived in accordance with the merger agreement.
The merger will become effective when we file a certificate of merger with the
State of Delaware. We intend to complete the merger during the third quarter of
2001.

(1) Effective January 1, 2000, Learn2 adopted SAB No. 101. Learn2's adoption of
    SAB No. 101 resulted in a change in method of accounting for cooperative
    advertising expenses. In accordance with previously existing accounting
    principles, Learn2 recorded cooperative advertising expenses as a sales and
    marketing expense. During 2000, as a result of new interpretations of
    generally accepted accounting principles by the Securities and Exchange
    Commission through the issuance of SAB No. 101, Learn2 was required to
    change the accounting policy for cooperative advertising to record these
    expenses as a reduction of gross revenues. Pro forma amounts assuming the
    new revenue recognition method was applied on a pro forma basis for the year
    ended December 31, 1999 would be a decrease to both net revenues and sales
    and marketing expenses of $1.3 million.

SUMMARY UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA

     The following summary unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated
financial data of E-Stamp which gives effect to the merger as a purchase
transaction, is derived from the unaudited pro forma combined consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement-
prospectus. The pro forma combined condensed consolidated statement of
operations data for the year ended December 31, 2000 is presented as if the
merger was completed on January 1, 2000 and E-Stamp issued approximately 38
million shares of E-Stamp common stock in the merger. The pro forma combined
condensed consolidated balance sheet data is presented as if the merger was
completed on December 31, 2000. You should read it in conjunction with the
unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements and the
separate audited consolidated financial statements of E-Stamp and Learn2
included in this joint proxy statement-prospectus. See "Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" on page 71.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial
statements are presented in this joint proxy statement-prospectus for
illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the financial
position or results of operations that would have actually been reported had the
merger occurred as of the dates indicated nor are they necessarily indicative of
the financial position or results of operations of E-Stamp and Learn2 on a
consolidated basis in the future.

     The following table sets forth E-Stamp and Learn2 historical and E-Stamp
pro forma combined per share financial information for E-Stamp and Learn2 at and
for the year ended December 31, 2000. The pro forma equivalent per share
information is computed on E-Stamp common stock only, using the E-Stamp pro
forma combined information and an estimated exchange ratio of 0.478 shares of
E-Stamp common stock for each share of Learn2 common stock. The information in
these tables is not necessarily an indicator of future operations and should be
read in conjunction with the historical and unaudited pro forma financial
statements which are furnished within this joint proxy statement-prospectus.

- -------------------------
(1) Net loss per share is determined by dividing net loss by weighted average
    shares outstanding.

(2) The tangible book value per share is computed by dividing stockholders'
    equity less intangible assets by the number of weighted average shares of
    common stock outstanding. The E-Stamp pro forma combined book value per
    share is computed by dividing pro forma stockholders' equity less intangible
    assets by the pro forma number of shares of E-Stamp common stock outstanding
    as of December 31, 2000 assuming the merger had occurred as of that date.

MARKET PRICE INFORMATION

     E-Stamp common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the
symbol "ESTM." Learn2 common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under
the symbol "LTWO."

     The following table sets forth the closing prices per share of E-Stamp
common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market and the closing prices
per share of Learn2 common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market on
(1) April 19, 2001, the last full trading day preceding public announcement that
E-Stamp and Learn2 had entered into the merger agreement and (2)             ,
2001, the last full trading day for which it was practicable to obtain closing

        , 2001..................................

     The following table includes the equivalent price per share of Learn2
common stock assuming that the merger had occurred on April 19, 2001. The
equivalent per share price reflects the value of E-Stamp common stock that would
be received by a Learn2 stockholder for each share of Learn2 common stock
applying the exchange ratio in the merger agreement to the market price of
E-Stamp common stock on that date. The table includes total outstanding shares
of E-Stamp common stock and Learn2 common stock as adjusted for vested stock
options and warrants with exercise prices equal to or less than the average
closing price of the respective company's common stock for the five consecutive
trading days immediately prior to that date. The total outstanding shares of
Learn2 common stock has also been adjusted to include an estimated 26,457,067
shares of Learn2 common stock issuable upon the redemption of Learn2's $10
million convertible debenture.

                                                                                                   EQUIVALENT PRICE

     Because the market price of E-Stamp common stock may increase or decrease
before the completion of the merger, Learn2 stockholders are urged to obtain
current market quotations. In addition, Learn2 stockholders may receive less
than or more than 0.4783 of a share of E-Stamp common stock for each share of
Learn2 common stock depending on the number of shares of E-Stamp common stock
and Learn2 common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger and the
number of shares of E-Stamp common stock and Learn2 common stock issuable under
vested options and warrants with exercise prices equal to or less than the
average closing price of the respective company's common stock during the
five-day measurement period immediately prior to the special meetings.

LISTING ON THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET

     On November 9, 2000, E-Stamp received a notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market
that its common stock had failed to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 over
the previous 30 consecutive trading days as required for continued listing on
The Nasdaq National Market. On March 23, 2001, E-Stamp attended a hearing before
the Nasdaq Qualifications Hearing Panel to determine if its common stock should
continue to be listed on The Nasdaq National Market, and E-Stamp has continued
to correspond with officials at Nasdaq since its hearing. On April 23, 2001 the
Nasdaq Listing Qualification Panel notified E-Stamp it would continue listing
E-Stamp's common stock on The Nasdaq National Market pursuant to an exception
that requires E-Stamp's completion of specified milestones by specified dates.
These milestones include completion of the merger by July 23, 2001 and
compliance with all of The Nasdaq National Market listing requirements after the
closing. In the event that E-Stamp or the combined company fail to meet Nasdaq's
conditions the exception may be revoked. In addition, the exception is

subject to the further review and modification or reversal by the Nasdaq Listing
and Hearing Review Council. If E-Stamp's common stock is delisted from The
Nasdaq National Market, its liquidity and trading price could be impacted
negatively.

     At E-Stamp's annual meeting of stockholders to be held on           , 2001,
E-Stamp intends to submit to its stockholders a proposal to authorize its board
of directors to implement a reverse stock split for the purpose of complying
with the Nasdaq National Market's minimum per share bid price requirements. If
approved by E-Stamp stockholders, E-Stamp's board of directors will have the
authority to implement the reverse stock split without seeking further
stockholder approval.

     The Nasdaq Stock Market has advised Learn2 that its bid price was below
$1.00 per share, the minimum per share bid price required under marketplace Rule
4450(a)(5) to maintain a Nasdaq National Market listing. Learn2 has requested an
exception to Marketplace Rule 4450(a)(5) of the Nasdaq National Market, pending
the consummation of the merger or, if necessary, the reverse stock split. The
principal reasons for the reverse stock split are to increase the effective
marketability and liquidity of Learn2's common stock and to maintain the listing
of Learn2's common stock on the Nasdaq National Market. Learn2's request will be
considered at an oral hearing scheduled for June 1, 2001 before the Nasdaq
Listing Qualification Panel. If Learn2's common stock is delisted from the
Nasdaq National Market, its liquidity and trading price could be negatively
affected.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

     On April 20, 2001 E-Stamp announced that it was in the process of
discontinuing its transportation management solutions business and expected to
complete the process prior to its proposed merger with Learn2.

     On April 26, 2001, Learn2 announced financial results for its first quarter
ended March 31, 2001. Revenues for the first quarter were $5.6 million and the
net loss was $10.9 million. In connection with a reset on the conversion price
of Learn2's $10 million 6% convertible debenture, Learn2 recorded a one-time
non-cash interest expense of $9 million. Excluding the effect of the reset of
the conversion price, the loss for the quarter was $1.9 million.

     On April 26, 2001, E-Stamp announced financial results for its first
quarter ended March 31, 2001. Revenues for the first quarter were $317,000 and
the net loss was $13.9 million. During the first quarter of 2001, E-Stamp
identified indicators of impairment related to goodwill, intangible assets and
fixed assets, resulting in an impairment loss on long-lived assets of $5.7
million for the first quarter of 2001. Excluding the impairment related charge,
the loss for the quarter was $8.2 million.

     On April 30, 2001 E-Stamp sold all of its intellectual property related to
its Internet postage business, including all of its patents, the "E-Stamp" name
and the e-stamp.com Internet domain, to Stamps.com for $7.5 million. "E-Stamp"
is a registered trademark of Stamps.com licensed for limited use to E-Stamp
Corporation.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     You should consider carefully the risks described below before making your
decision to approve the merger. These factors should be considered in
conjunction with the other information contained in this joint proxy
statement-prospectus, the annexes and the exhibits.

     If any of the events, contingencies, circumstances or conditions described
in the following risks actually occur, the business, financial condition or
results of operations of E-Stamp and Learn2 could be harmed.

RISKS RELATED TO THE MERGER

DECREASES IN THE TRADING PRICE OF E-STAMP'S COMMON STOCK WILL REDUCE THE VALUE
OF WHAT LEARN2 STOCKHOLDERS RECEIVE IN THE MERGER.

     Upon completion of the merger, shares of Learn2 capital stock will be
converted into shares of E-Stamp capital stock. Any change in the price of
either Learn2 common stock or E-Stamp common stock will affect the value Learn2
stockholders receive in the merger. The market values of Learn2's common stock
and E-Stamp's common stock have experienced significant volatility, and the
value of the shares of E-Stamp common stock to be received in the merger may go
up or down as the market price of E-Stamp common stock goes up or down. Stock
price changes may result from a variety of factors that are beyond the control
of Learn2 and E-Stamp. Neither party is permitted to "walk away" from the merger
or resolicit the vote of its stockholders solely because of changes in the
market price of either party's common stock.

     The prices of Learn2 common stock and E-Stamp common stock at the closing
of the merger may vary from their respective prices on the date of this joint
proxy statement-prospectus and on the date of the special meetings. Because the
date the merger is completed may be later than the date of the special meetings,
the prices of Learn2's common stock and E-Stamp's common stock on the date of
the special meetings may not be indicative of their respective prices on the
date the merger is completed.

LEARN2 AND E-STAMP MAY NOT REALIZE THE INTENDED BENEFITS OF THE MERGER.

     Learn2 and E-Stamp believe that the merger will provide many benefits to
the combined company. Combining the two companies may, however, be complex, time
consuming and expensive. In addition, the combined company will have a board of
directors comprised of directors from both companies, and management comprised
principally of executive officers from Learn2. There can be no assurance that
Learn2 and E-Stamp will be able to combine their businesses effectively, that
the board of directors and management will be able to work together to
effectively manage the combined company or that the combined company will
realize the benefits of the merger. The failure to realize these benefits could
adversely affect the combined company's business.

LEARN2 OR, IF THE MERGER IS COMPLETED, E-STAMP IS OBLIGATED TO REGISTER THE
SHARES ISSUABLE TO LEARN2'S CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURE HOLDER.

     Learn2's convertible debenture holder has registration rights pursuant to
which Learn2 or, if the merger is completed, E-Stamp is obligated to file a
registration statement covering the shares issuable to it as a result of
conversion or termination of the debenture. Learn2 must register these shares
for resale even if the merger does not occur. As a result, a substantial number
of shares will become eligible for sale in the public market after completion of
the merger, subject to certain contractual restrictions on resale described on
page 113.

IF THE CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER ARE NOT MET, THE MERGER WILL NOT OCCUR.

     Certain conditions must be satisfied or waived to complete the merger.
These conditions are described in detail in the merger agreement. E-Stamp and
Learn2 cannot assure you that each of the conditions will be satisfied. If the
conditions are not satisfied or waived, the merger will not occur or will be
delayed, and

the intended benefits of the merger may not occur. In particular, if E-Stamp
does not have net cash of at least $13 million as of the closing of the merger,
Learn2 is not required to close. If the merger is not completed, Learn2 will
require additional capital resources to achieve growth in its business, which
resources may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.

THE MERGER MAY RESULT IN A LOSS OF OUR EMPLOYEES.

     Despite our efforts to hire and retain quality officers and employees, we
might lose officers and employees following the merger. Competition for
qualified management, sales, engineering and technical employees is intense.
Some employees of Learn2 hold options that will vest as a result of the merger,
and this may affect our ability to retain these officers and employees. In
addition, competitors may recruit officers and employees prior to the merger. As
a result, employees could leave with little or no prior notice. We cannot assure
you that the combined company will be able to attract, retain and integrate
officers and employees following the merger.

E-STAMP MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT SUCCESSFULLY A NEW RESTRUCTURING PLAN IF
THE MERGER DOES NOT OCCUR.

     Based on E-Stamp's current plan to discontinue its business in
transportation management solutions, E-Stamp will be unable to generate revenues
going forward as a standalone entity. Upon consummation of the merger, E-Stamp
intends to continue and grow Learn2's business as a means of generating revenue.
If the merger is not completed, E-Stamp may not be able to implement
successfully a new restructuring plan capable of generating sufficient revenues
to support E-Stamp as a going concern.

FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE PROPOSED MERGER COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT EACH OF E-STAMP'S
AND LEARN2'S STOCK PRICE AND FUTURE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS.

     The merger is subject to the approval of E-Stamp's and Learn2's
stockholders and specified closing conditions. In the event that the merger is
not successfully completed, E-Stamp and Learn2 each may be subject to a number
of material risks, including the following:

     - the price of E-Stamp's and Learn2's common stock may decline to the
       extent that the current market price for its common stock reflects a
       market assumption that the proposed merger will be completed; and

     - costs related to the proposed merger, such as legal, accounting, and
       financial advisory fees, must be paid by E-Stamp and Learn2, even if the
       merger is not completed.

     In addition, in the event that the merger is not completed: the E-Stamp
board of directors may not be able to secure a similar strategic transaction to
provide E-Stamp with a continuing business and the Learn2 board of directors may
not be able to secure a similar strategic transaction to provide Learn2 with
cash for working capital and other purposes.

THE MERGER WILL RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS WHETHER OR NOT COMPLETED.

     The merger will result in significant costs to E-Stamp and Learn2. Direct
transaction costs are estimated at approximately $3.6 million. These costs are
expected to consist primarily of fees for investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants, filing fees and financial printers. A substantial amount of these
costs will be incurred whether or not the merger is completed.

IF THE MERGER IS NOT CONSUMMATED, LEARN2'S $10 MILLION CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURE AND
$2 MILLION PROMISSORY NOTE WILL MATURE.

     According to the terms of the Redemption and Termination Agreement, dated
as of April 19, 2001, by and among Learn2, E-Stamp and RGC International
Investors, LDC, Learn2's $10 million 6% convertible debenture issued to RGC will
not be redeemed until immediately prior to the completion of the merger. In the
event the merger is not consummated, Learn2 may be obligated to repay the

convertible debenture in 2003 as well as the $2 million convertible promissory
note issued to E-Stamp by Learn2 in April 2002. If Learn2's board withdraws its
recommendation of the merger or upon any other event of default, E-Stamp may
declare the entire principal amount with interest immediately due. Under certain
circumstances, delisting of Learn2's common stock from the Nasdaq National
Market could be an event of default under Learn2's $10 million convertible
debenture.

E-STAMP'S PRO FORMA ACCOUNTING FOR THE ACQUISITION OF LEARN2 MAY CHANGE.

     E-Stamp has allocated the total estimated purchase price for the
acquisition of Learn2 on a preliminary basis to assets and liabilities based on
E-Stamp's best estimate of the fair values of these assets and liabilities, with
the excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the purchase
consideration treated as a reduction of goodwill, other intangible assets and
fixed assets of Learn2. This allocation is subject to change pending a final
analysis of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The
impact of these changes could be material to E-Stamp's future results of
operations.

RISKS RELATED TO THE COMBINED COMPANY FOLLOWING THE MERGER

WE MAY LOSE OUR LISTING ON THE NASDAQ STOCK MARKET.

     Each of Learn2 and E-Stamp have received letters from the Nasdaq Stock
Market, Inc. concerning the continued listing of its common stock on the Nasdaq
National Market. Our stock prices have failed to maintain a closing price of
greater than or equal to $1.00 in accordance with Nasdaq's rules. If we are
unable to regain compliance with Nasdaq's rules, our securities, including the
E-Stamp common stock after the merger, could be delisted. In addition, if our
securities are delisted the liquidity and trading price of our securities may be
impacted adversely.

WE HAVE A HISTORY OF LOSSES AND AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT; WE MAY CONTINUE TO
EXPERIENCE LOSSES.

     For the year ended December 31, 2000, Learn2 incurred a net operating loss
of approximately $38 million and had an accumulated deficit of approximately
$164 million. For the year ended December 31, 2000, E-Stamp incurred a net loss
of approximately $113 million and had an accumulated deficit of approximately
$189 million. We expect to continue to incur losses before depreciation and
amortization charges for the foreseeable future. In addition, in connection with
the acquisition of Learn2, we will incur significant accounting charges. These
losses will be substantial, and we may not ever become profitable.

WE MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS.

     We may raise additional funds to develop, acquire and/or market products,
businesses or technologies. These funds may be raised through joint ventures,
the sale of assets, the incurrence of debt, or the issuance of securities. If
additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible
securities, the percentage ownership of stockholders in the combined company
will be reduced. Also, these securities may have rights, preferences or
privileges senior to the combined company's common stock. However, it is
possible that additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to
us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on
acceptable terms, we may not be able to realize our business plan.

WE MAY EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS,
WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR SHARE PRICE TO BE VOLATILE.

     Due to the emerging nature of the e-learning market and a sluggish economy,
we may be unable to forecast our revenues and profitability accurately. Our
revenues and operating results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter
depending on:

     - Our ability to attract and retain customers, and other marketing
       partners.

     - The amount and timing of our operating costs and capital expenditures.

     - The seasonality of our operating results.

     - The future development of the e-learning market.

     - General economic conditions.

     Because many of our costs will be fixed and based on anticipated revenue
levels, variations in, and the timing of, revenue recognition could cause
significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter. As a
result, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our sales and operating results may
not be necessarily meaningful and may not be accurate indicators of future
performance. If our future operating results are below the expectations of
securities analysts or investors, the trading price of the combined company's
common stock is likely to fall.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DEVELOP AWARENESS OF THE LEARN2 BRAND, OUR CUSTOMER BASE MAY
NOT GROW AS EXPECTED.

     Developing the Learn2 brand within our target markets is critical to
achieving widespread acceptance of our tutorials and a broad customer base. We
may not succeed in developing the Learn2 brand if more successful competitors
emerge, we are unable or fail to devote sufficient resources to marketing
efforts, or course performance problems cause customer dissatisfaction. Our
inability to develop the Learn2 brand would hinder growth.

WE WILL OPERATE IN A RAPIDLY CHANGING, COMPETITIVE MARKET AND WE MAY NOT HAVE
ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY.

     The e-learning market is evolving quickly and is subject to rapid
technological change, shifts in customer demands and evolving industry
standards. To succeed, we must continue to expand tutorial offerings and upgrade
technologies. We may not be able to do so successfully. If we fail to anticipate
or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences, or we
have any significant delays in tutorial development or introduction, our
competitors may be able to attract and maintain a greater customer base.

     The e-learning market is characterized by significant price competition. We
may face increasing price pressures from competitors, as customers demand more
value for their budgets. This could result in reduced operating margins, as well
as loss of market share and brand recognition.

     Although the e-learning market is highly fragmented with no single
competitor accounting for a dominant market share, competition is intense. Our
competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the tutorials and
services they offer. Several of our competitors have longer operating histories
and significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources. The lack
of significant entry barriers to the e-learning market will allow other
competitors to enter the market, increasing competition.

OUR BUSINESS WILL SUFFER IF E-LEARNING IS NOT WIDELY ACCEPTED.

     The market for e-learning solutions is new and evolving. We expect that we
will engage in intensive marketing and sales efforts to enable prospective
customers to learn about the benefits of its e-learning solutions. There are a
number of factors that could impact the acceptance of our e-learning solutions,

which are new and largely untested compared to more established training and
educational methods, including:

     - companies that have historically relied on, or invested in, traditional
       training and educational methods may be reluctant or slow to adopt
       Web-based e-learning solutions;

     - many of our potential customers have allocated only a limited portion of
       their budgets to e-learning; and

     - end users may not use e-learning solutions effectively.

     If the market for e-learning fails to develop or develops more slowly than
we expect, we will not achieve our growth and revenue targets and the value of
the combined company's common stock will likely decline.

THE SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS UPON A CONTINUAL SUPPLY OF
CONTENT OTHER THAN RELATED TO LEARN2'S CURRENT LIBRARY.

     Our inability to develop our own content or obtain it from third parties
could result in delays in product introductions or shipments. We will depend on
the quality and reliability of the content licensed and timely delivery of this
content by our sources. Although we will have agreements specifying the terms of
the licenses, these agreements may not be enforceable. We believe that we can
arrange alternate sources for some or all of our content, but our inability to
provide content to our customers and prospects on a timely basis could affect
the performance of its business.

WE MUST DELIVER TUTORIALS THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR OUR BUSINESS
WILL SUFFER.

     To be competitive, we must develop and introduce on a timely basis new
tutorial offerings that meet the needs of companies seeking to use our
e-learning solutions. Furthermore, the viability of our e-learning solutions
depends in large part on our ability to update our tutorials and develop new
content as the underlying subject matter changes.

WE PLAN TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF LEARN2'S TUTORIALS AND MAY DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY
TO ATTRACT EXPERTS OR SPECIALISTS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT THE NECESSARY
EXPERTISE, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ENTER NEW FIELDS.

     Our strategy involves broadening the fields presently covered by Learn2's
tutorials. In particular, to date Learn2 has focused primarily on tutorials in
the information technology area and we are planning to develop and introduce new
tutorial offerings in other fields. These new tutorial offerings may encompass
areas in which we have little or no experience or expertise. Therefore, our
ability to expand our tutorials into these areas may require us to locate and
evaluate third-party experts or specialists who would develop or assist us in
developing the tutorial content. If we are unable to locate and evaluate these
experts, we may fail to develop the tutorials our customers demand or be unable
to pursue new market opportunities. If we do not extend our tutorial offerings
into new fields, our revenue growth could be constrained.

LEARN2'S TUTORIAL CONTENT PROVIDERS SUPPLY THE LEARNING CONTENT OF TUTORIALS AND
ARE GENERALLY NOT RESTRICTED FROM DEVELOPING SIMILAR CONTENT FOR COMPETITORS
WHICH COULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR COMPETITORS TO COMPETE WITH THE COMBINED COMPANY.

     Learn2 relies on independent third parties to provide certain content.
Learn2's agreements with these content providers do not restrict them from
developing tutorials on similar topics for competitors or from competing
directly with the combined company. As a result, our competitors may be able to
duplicate some of our tutorial content.

THE VARIABILITY AND LENGTH OF OUR SALES CYCLE FOR OUR E-LEARNING SOLUTIONS MAY
MAKE OUR OPERATING RESULTS UNPREDICTABLE AND VOLATILE.

     The period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the
first purchase of our product by that customer typically ranges from three to
nine months and in some cases may be as long as two years. Because we will rely
on large sales for a substantial portion of our revenues, these long sales
cycles can have a particularly significant effect on our financial performance
in any quarter. Factors which may contribute to the variability and length of
our sales cycle include:

     - The time required for potential customers to learn about the benefits of
       our e-learning solutions.

     - The time it takes our potential customers to assess the value of
       e-learning solutions compared to more traditional solutions.

     - The time it takes our potential customers to evaluate competitive
       e-learning solutions.

     - Our potential customers' internal budget and approval processes.

     - The extended periods most large corporations and government entities
       require to make purchasing decisions.

     As a result of our lengthy sales cycle, we have only a limited ability to
forecast the timing and size of specific sales and thus to predict quarterly
financial performance.

WE ALSO DEPEND ON MAJOR RETAILERS TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS.

     We will continue to invest resources to expand our relationships with
retailers and to develop relationships with new retailers. However, these
retailers or other retailers may not continue to provide shelf space and
marketing for our products. This failure of retailers to market our products
effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial
condition.

OUR PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED FOR MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGIES.

     Our products are designed primarily for Microsoft technologies. We believe
that Microsoft technologies are and will continue to be, widely utilized by our
customers. However, if these customers do not actually adopt and continue to
utilize these technologies as anticipated or in the future migrate to other
computing technologies that we do not support, we may have to spend significant
capital and other resources including personnel to adapt our products to these
alternative technologies. Learn2's streaming technology does not function in a
Linux environment.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEARN2'S AUTHORING, COMPRESSION, ANIMATION AND STREAMING
TECHNOLOGIES IS COMPLEX.

     The development of Learn2's authoring, compression, animation and streaming
technologies is complex. This can result in lengthy development cycles, extended
testing periods and undetected errors or bugs in the software programs. These
factors can result in loss of market acceptance, loss of reputation and loss of
market share if products of competitors either are available on the market
first, or are viewed as more reliable than our products.

OUR FUTURE GROWTH DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL AND SUCCESSFUL
HIRING AND RETENTION, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO SALES, MARKETING AND
DEVELOPMENT PERSONNEL, AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO HIRE AND RETAIN THE SKILLED
PERSONNEL WE NEED TO SUCCEED.

     We may not be able to retain our key executives and engineers. We expect to
continue to hire additional staff. We may not be successful in attracting,
retaining or motivating key personnel. If we do not succeed in attracting new
personnel, or retaining and motivating existing personnel, our business may be
affected adversely.

WE FACE A RISK OF SYSTEM FAILURE.

     Our operations depend to a significant extent on our ability to maintain
our computer and telecommunications systems. We must also protect our systems
against damage from fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications
failure or similar events. In addition, growth of our customer base may strain
the capacity of our computer operations center and telecommunications systems
and/or lead to degradations in performance or system failure. Any damage to or
loss of our computer and telecommunications networks including our operations
center could affect adversely the performance of our business.

UNAUTHORIZED BREAK-INS TO OUR SERVICE COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

     Our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic
break-ins and similar disruptions, which could lead to interruptions, delays,
loss of data or the inability to complete customer transactions. In addition,
unauthorized persons may improperly access our data, which could harm us.
Actions like these may be very expensive to remedy and could damage our
reputation and discourage new and existing users from purchasing our products
and services.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT OUR GROWTH STRATEGY.

     Successfully achieving our growth plan depends on our ability to:

     - Continue to develop and market our products and services.

     - Maintain and increase our customer base.

     - Effectively integrate businesses and technologies.

     - Continue to identify, attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.

     If we do not successfully implement our growth strategy, our results of
operations will be adversely affected.

WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS, WHICH ARE COSTLY
TO DEFEND AND COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO USE CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES IN THE FUTURE.

     Many parties are developing and improving technologies which compete with
our proprietary technologies and patents. We believe that these parties will
continue to take steps to protect these technologies, including seeking patent
protection. As a result, disputes regarding the ownership of these technologies
could arise in the future.

     Third parties may assert claims against us alleging infringement of
patents, copyrights, trademark rights, trade secret rights or other proprietary
rights or alleging unfair competition. In the event that we determine that
licensing patents or other proprietary rights is appropriate, we may not be able
to license proprietary rights on reasonable terms or at all. As the number of
products in our target markets increase and the functionality of these products
further overlap, we may become subject to infringement claims. We may incur
substantial expenses in defending against third-party infringement claims
regardless of the merit of those claims. In the event that there is a
determination that we have infringed third-party proprietary rights, we could
incur substantial monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in
the future.

OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE COSTLY AND DIFFICULT TO PROTECT.

     We rely on a combination of the following to protect our intellectual
property rights:

     - Patents.

     - Trade secrets.

     - Copyright and trademark laws.

     - Nondisclosure agreements.

     - Other contractual provisions and technical measures.

     None of these protections may be adequate to prevent our competitors from
copying or reverse-engineering our products, concepts, trade names and trade
dress. Furthermore, none of these protections prohibit our competitors from
independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or
superior to our technologies.

     We license certain products under shrink-wrap licenses that are not signed
by our licensees. These shrink-wrap licenses may be unenforceable under the laws
of certain jurisdictions. In addition, the laws of certain countries in which
our products are or may be licensed do not protect us to the same extent as the
laws of the United States.

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND WE MAY BE
LIABLE FOR INFRINGING THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS.

     Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our patents, trademarks or
other proprietary rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations or financial condition. While we enter into
confidentiality agreements with many of our employees, consultants and strategic
partners and generally control access to and distribution of our proprietary
information, the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not
prevent misappropriation. We also attempt to register our trademarks and service
marks. However, we may not receive approval on all of our trademark
registrations or patent applications. Even if they are approved, such trademarks
or patents may be challenged by others or invalidated. In addition, we do not
know whether we will be able to defend our proprietary rights because the
validity, enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in
Internet-related industries is uncertain and still evolving.

     Third parties may assert infringement claims against us. From time to time
in the ordinary course of business we have been and we expect to continue to be,
subject to claims alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of
third parties. These claims and any resulting litigation, if it occurs, could
subject us to significant liability for damages. In addition, even if we
prevail, litigation could be time-consuming and expensive and could result in
the diversion of our time and attention. Any claims from third parties may also
result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to
these claims unless we are able to enter into agreements with the third parties
making these claims.

CHANGES IN LAWS RELATING TO DATA COLLECTION AND USE PRACTICES AND THE PRIVACY OF
INTERNET USERS AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

     Websites usually place certain information ("cookies") on a user's hard
drive usually without the user's knowledge or consent. Websites use cookies for
a variety of reasons. We employ the use of cookies on our Websites. Certain
Internet browsers allow users to modify their browser settings to remove cookies
at any time or to prevent cookies from being stored on their hard drive. In
addition, some Internet commentators, privacy advocates and governmental bodies
have suggested limiting or eliminating the use of cookies. The effectiveness of
our technology could be limited by any reduction or limitation in the use of
cookies. In this regard, there are a large number of legislative proposals
before the United States Congress, foreign governments and other international
regulatory agencies regarding privacy issues and the regulation and use of
cookies. It is not possible to predict whether or when such legislation may be
adopted, and certain proposals, if adopted, could adversely affect our business.
This could be caused by, among other possible provisions, the requirement that
permission be obtained before we use cookies.

WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS.

     Learn2's license agreements with customers typically contain provisions
designed to limit exposure to potential product liability claims. It is
possible, however, that the limitation of liability provisions contained in the
license agreements may not be effective under the laws of certain state and
foreign jurisdictions.

WE FACE LEGAL UNCERTAINTIES RELATING TO THE INTERNET IN GENERAL AND TO OUR
INDUSTRY IN PARTICULAR AND MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO COSTLY GOVERNMENT REGULATION.

     The applicability to the Internet of existing laws is uncertain and
developing with regard to many issues, including sales tax, intellectual
property ownership and infringement, copyright, trademark, trade secret,
obscenity, libel, export of encryption technology and personal privacy.

     There are an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to
liability for information received from or transmitted over the Internet, online
content regulation, user privacy, taxation and quality of products and services.
In addition, it is possible that more laws and regulations may be adopted with
respect to the Internet, such as laws or regulations relating to user privacy,
taxation, e-mail, pricing, Internet access, content, copyrights, distribution
and characteristics and quality of products and services. Various state statutes
govern private post-secondary educational institutions. We are uncertain whether
states will attempt to apply these statutes to regulate the offering of
tutorials over the Internet.

     Changes in existing laws and the adoption of additional laws or regulations
may decrease the popularity or limit expansion of the Internet. A decline in the
growth of the Internet could decrease demand for our tutorials and services and
increase our cost of doing business.

OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED BY CONSUMERS' CONCERNS ABOUT THE SECURITY OF
TRANSACTIONS OVER THE INTERNET.

     We believe that concerns regarding the security of confidential information
transmitted over the Internet, such as credit card numbers, prevent many
potential customers from engaging in online transactions. Our success may depend
on our ability to add sufficient security features to our e-commerce engine and
to instill confidence in those features to our customers. If we fail to do so,
we may not realize our business plan.

WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND INTO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IN WHICH WE HAVE LIMITED
EXPERIENCE.

     A part of our strategy is to develop international markets. Learn2 entered
into distribution or reseller arrangements in Africa, Brazil, Ireland, South
Korea, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. We may not be able to market our
products and services in foreign markets successfully.

     We have limited experience in developing localized versions of our products
and marketing our products and services internationally. We rely on the efforts
and abilities of our international business partners in those activities.

     In addition to uncertainty about our ability to continue to generate
revenues and expand our international presence, we face certain risks inherent
in doing business internationally, including:

     - Local economic and market conditions.

     - Difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights.

     - The need for compliance with a variety of international and United States
       export regulations.

     - Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements.

     - Trade barriers.

     - Difficulties in staffing and managing international operations because of
       distance, language and cultural differences.

     - Longer payment cycles.

     - Currency exchange rate fluctuations.

     - Problems in collecting accounts receivable.

     - Political and economic instability.

     - Seasonal fluctuations in business activity.

     - Potentially adverse tax consequences.

     One or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our
future international presence and, consequently, on our business, operating
results and financial condition.

E-STAMP MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY PHASE OUT ITS CURRENT BUSINESS.

     At the same time E-Stamp announced the merger, it announced plans to
discontinue its current business in transportation management solutions. E-Stamp
can provide no assurance that it will be able to successfully discontinue its
business or transition its current customers to third party providers. E-Stamp
may incur additional liabilities and expenses in connection with the winding
down of its transportation management solutions business, including liabilities
and expenses arising from the termination of existing contracts and other
commitments, that could have a material adverse effect upon E-Stamp's financial
condition and results of operations.

CLAIMS, INCLUDING CLAIMS ASSERTED BY PITNEY BOWES AGAINST E-STAMP, COULD
ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION.

     Pitney Bowes filed a patent infringement lawsuit against E-Stamp in U.S.
District Court in June 1999. The suit alleges infringement of seven patents
owned by Pitney Bowes related to postage application systems and seeks treble
damages, a preliminary and permanent injunction, attorneys' fees and other
unspecified damages. On July 30, 1999, E-Stamp filed an answer to Pitney Bowes'
complaint. Pendency of the litigation can be expected to result in significant
expenses to us and the diversion of management time and other resources, the
extent of which we cannot quantify with any reasonable accuracy. If Pitney Bowes
is successful in its claims against E-Stamp, then E-Stamp may be required to pay
damages to Pitney Bowes.

OTHER EVENTS COULD RESULT IN A DILUTION OF YOUR OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

     We will have approximately 76 million shares of common stock outstanding
and approximately           million shares of common stock equivalents including
warrants and stock options following the merger. These common stock equivalents
also provide for antidilution protection upon the occurrence of stock splits,
redemptions, mergers and other similar transactions. If one or more of these
events occurs the number of shares of our common stock that may be issued upon
conversion or exercise would increase. If converted or exercised these
securities will result in a dilution to your percentage ownership of our common
stock. In addition, if we continue to acquire new companies through the issuance
of common or preferred stock your percentage of ownership may be diluted.

                FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MAY PROVE INACCURATE

     This joint proxy statement-prospectus contains "forward-looking statements"
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements
relate to expectations concerning matters that are not historical facts. Words
such as "projects," "believes," "anticipates," "plans," "expects," "intends,"
and similar words and expressions are intended to identify forward-looking
statements. Although each of E-Stamp and Learn2 believes that such
forward-looking statements are reasonable, neither can assure you that such
expectations will prove to have been correct. Important factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from such expectations are disclosed herein
including, without limitation, in the "Risk Factors" section. All
forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by these
factors and all related cautionary statements. Neither E-Stamp nor Learn2
undertakes any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

                     LEARN2 SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

DATE, TIME AND PLACE OF MEETING

     The special meeting of the stockholders of Learn2 will be held at
          located at                , on        , 2001, at      , local time.

PURPOSE OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

     At the special meeting, Learn2 stockholders will consider and vote upon the
following proposals:

     - To adopt a merger agreement between E-Stamp and Learn2, pursuant to which
       E-Stamp will merge with Learn2, and E-Stamp will be the surviving
       corporation. Adoption of the merger agreement will also constitute
       approval of the merger and the issuance of approximately 26.4 million
       shares of Learn2 common stock to the holder of Learn2's $10 million
       convertible debenture;

     - To approve an amendment of Learn2's Amended and Restated Certificate of
       Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split whereby Learn2 would issue
       one new share of common stock in exchange for not less than two nor more
       than ten shares of outstanding common stock;

     - To elect five directors of Learn2 to serve until the earlier of the 2002
       annual meeting of stockholders or until their respective successors are
       elected and qualified; and

     - To transact such other business as may come before the meeting or at any
       postponements or adjournments of the meeting.

     The reverse stock split and the election of directors would be effective
only if the merger is not consummated.

     YOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE MERGER, THE MERGER
AGREEMENT AND THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT. YOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE
"FOR" ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT AND THE NOMINEES
FOR DIRECTOR.

RECORD DATE; VOTING RIGHTS; PROXIES

     Only holders of Learn2 capital stock at the close of business on
               , 2001, the record date, are entitled to notice of and to vote at
the special meeting. As             , 2001, there were                shares of
Learn2 common stock issued and outstanding. The accompanying form of proxy is
for use at the special meeting. All shares of Learn2 common stock represented by
properly executed proxies will, unless such proxies have been previously
revoked, be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated in such proxies.
IF NO INSTRUCTIONS ARE INDICATED, SHARES OF LEARN2 COMMON STOCK REPRESENTED BY
SUCH PROXIES WILL BE VOTED "FOR" ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THE REVERSE
STOCK SPLIT AND THE NOMINEES FOR DIRECTORS. Learn2 does not know of any matters
other than as described in the notice of special meeting of stockholders that
are to come before the special meeting. If any other matter is properly
presented for action at the special meeting, the persons named in the enclosed
form of proxy will have the discretion to vote on such matters in accordance
with their best judgment.

     A stockholder who has given a proxy may revoke it at any time prior to its
exercise by giving written notice to the Secretary of Learn2, by signing and
returning a later-dated proxy, or by voting in person at the special meeting.
However, mere attendance at the special meeting will not in and of itself have
the effect of revoking the proxy. Votes cast by proxy or in person at the
special meeting will be tabulated by the inspector of election appointed for the
special meeting.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

     Proxies are being solicited by and on behalf of the Learn2 board of
directors. Learn2 has engaged the firm of MacKenzie Partners, Inc. as proxy
solicitors. The fee to such firm for solicitation services is estimated to be
$12,000 plus reimbursement for out of pocket expenses. Learn2 will bear all
expenses in connection with such solicitation. In addition to solicitation by
use of the mails, proxies may be solicited by directors, officers and employees
of Learn2 in person or by telephone or other means of communication. Such
directors, officers and employees will not be compensated additionally for, but
may be reimbursed by Learn2 for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with, such solicitation. Although there is no formal agreement to do so,
arrangements also may be made with brokerage firms, banks, custodians, nominees
and fiduciaries for the forwarding of proxy and solicitation materials to owners
of Learn2 common stock held of record by such persons, and these firms may be
reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in forwarding the proxy and
solicitation materials.

QUORUM; ABSTENTIONS; BROKER NON-VOTES

     The presence in person or by properly executed proxy of holders of a
majority of all the issued and outstanding shares of Learn2 common stock
entitled to vote is necessary to constitute a quorum at the special meeting. For
purposes of determining whether a quorum is present, the inspector of election
will include shares that are present or represented by proxy, even if the
holders of such shares abstain from voting on any particular matter. In the
event that a broker, bank, custodian, nominee or other record holder of Learn2
common stock indicates on a proxy that it does not have discretionary authority
to vote certain shares on a particular proposal -- known as a broker
non-vote -- those shares will not be considered for purposes of determining the
number of shares entitled to vote with respect to a particular proposal on which
the broker has expressly not voted, but will be counted for purposes of
determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business.
Accordingly, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the effect of a "no"
vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement but will not affect the
outcome of the voting on proposals that requires a majority of the shares
present or represented by proxy at the special meeting.

LEARN2 PROPOSAL NO. 1: THE MERGER AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

     At the special meeting, the Learn2 stockholders are being asked to adopt a
merger agreement between E-Stamp and Learn2 pursuant to which E-Stamp will merge
with Learn2, and E-Stamp will be the surviving corporation. Adoption of the
merger agreement will also constitute approval of the merger and the issuance of
approximately 26.4 million shares of common stock to the holder of Learn2's $10
million convertible debenture.

REQUIRED VOTE

     Approval of the merger and adoption of the merger agreement requires the
affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Learn2
common stock.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE LEARN2 BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The board of directors of Learn2 has unanimously approved the merger and
the merger agreement and believes that the merger is advisable and in the best
interests of Learn2 and its stockholders. The Learn2 board of directors,
therefore, unanimously recommends that holders of Learn2 common stock vote FOR
approval of the merger and adoption of the merger agreement.

LEARN2 PROPOSAL NO. 2: REVERSE STOCK SPLIT CHARTER AMENDMENT

     The board of directors of Learn2 has unanimously recommended approval of a
reverse stock split amendment to Learn2's Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation. The reverse stock split amendment will be effective only if the
merger between Learn2 and E-Stamp is not consummated.

     The reverse stock split charter amendment will result in the automatic
conversion of between two and ten shares (as determined by the board of
directors of Learn2) of common stock outstanding as of the time of filing of the
reverse stock split charter amendment with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware into one new share of Learn2 common stock. The Learn2 board of
directors believes that stockholder approval of an exchange ratio range (as
opposed to approval of a specified exchange ratio) in which the reverse stock
split may be effected provides the board of directors with maximum flexibility
to achieve the purposes of the reverse stock split. If the stockholders approve
the reverse stock split charter amendment at the special meeting, the reverse
stock split will be effected, if at all, only upon the termination of the merger
agreement and a determination by the board that the reverse stock split (in an
exchange ratio determined by the board of directors within the limits set forth
herein) is in the best interests of Learn2 and its stockholders at that time. If
the board of directors fails to implement the reverse stock split within 120
days of the termination of the merger agreement, stockholder approval again
would be required prior to implementing any reverse stock split.

     As more fully set forth below, the principal reasons for the reverse stock
split are to increase the effective marketability and liquidity of Learn2's
common stock and to maintain the listing of Learn2's common stock on the Nasdaq
Stock Market's National Market. The Nasdaq Stock Market advised Learn2 on
January 16, 2001 and April 17, 2001 that its bid price was below $1.00 per
share, the minimum per share bid price required under Marketplace Rule
4450(a)(5) to maintain a Nasdaq National Market listing. Learn2 has requested an
exception to Marketplace Rule 4450(a)(5), pending the consummation of the merger
or, if necessary, the reverse stock split. Learn2's request will be considered
at an oral hearing scheduled for June 1, 2001 before a Panel authorized by the
Nasdaq Stock Market's Board of Directors. If the minimum per share bid price
requirement is satisfied by other means prior to the special meeting or the
filing of the reverse stock split charter amendment it is anticipated that the
reverse stock split will be abandoned.

     Learn2's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides for 100
million authorized shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share. As of the
record date,                shares of Learn2's common stock were issued and
outstanding.

     Attached to this joint proxy statement-prospectus as Annex VII is the
proposed text of the reverse stock split charter amendment. Such text is subject
to change as may be required by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
or as the board of directors of Learn2 may deem necessary or advisable to effect
the reverse stock split.

PURPOSES AND REASONS FOR THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT CHARTER AMENDMENT

     The board of directors of Learn2 believes that the reverse stock split is
beneficial to Learn2 and its stockholders. The principal reasons for the reverse
stock split are to increase the effective marketability and liquidity of
Learn2's common stock for Learn2's stockholders and to maintain the listing of
Learn2's common stock on the Nasdaq National Market.

     If Learn2's common stock were to be delisted from the Nasdaq National
Market, it likely would have an adverse effect on the trading and liquidity of
its common stock. In such event, Learn2's common stock would be quoted on the
OTC Bulletin Board, to the extent eligible therefor.

     The board of directors of Learn2 believes that the current price per share
of Learn2's common stock has a tendency to diminish the effective marketability
of Learn2's common stock because of the reluctance of many brokerage firms to
recommend lower-priced stocks to their clients. Additionally, the policies and
practices of a number of brokerage houses tend to discourage individual brokers
within those firms from dealing in lower-priced stocks. Some of these policies
and practices relate to the payment of broker's commissions and to
time-consuming procedures that operate to make the handling of lower-priced
stocks economically unattractive to brokers. The structure of trading
commissions also tends to have an adverse impact upon holders of lower-priced
stocks because the brokerage commission payable on the sale of a lower-priced
stock generally represents a higher percentage of the sales price than the
commission on relatively higher-priced stock.

     The board of directors also believes that the relatively low price of
Learn2's common stock, when compared with the market prices of common stock of
Learn2's competitors, impairs the marketability of Learn2's common stock to
institutional investors and members of the investing public and creates a
negative impression with respect to Learn2. Theoretically, the number of shares
of common stock outstanding should not, by itself, affect the marketability of
Learn2's common stock, the type of investor who acquires it or Learn2's
reputation in the financial community. In practice this may not necessarily be
the case, as many investors view low-priced stock as unduly speculative in
nature and, as a matter of practice, avoid or limit investments in such stocks.
The foregoing factors adversely affect not only the liquidity of Learn2's common
stock, but also Learn2's ability to raise additional capital through a sale of
equity securities.

     The board of directors is hopeful that the decrease in the number of shares
of common stock outstanding as a consequence of the proposed reverse stock
split, and the anticipated corresponding increased price per share, will
stimulate interest in Learn2's common stock and possibly promote greater
liquidity for Learn2's stockholders with respect to those shares presently held
by them. However, the possibility does exist that such liquidity may be affected
adversely by the reduced number of shares which would be outstanding if the
proposed reverse stock split is effected.

     The board of directors is also hopeful that the proposed reverse stock
split will result in a price level for the shares that will mitigate the present
reluctance, policies and practices on the part of brokerage firms referred to
above, diminish the adverse impact of trading commissions on the potential
market for Learn2's shares and enable Learn2's common stock to remain listed on
the Nasdaq National Market. However, the proposed reverse stock split may not
achieve the desired results outlined above and the price per share of Learn2's
common stock immediately after the proposed reverse stock split may not increase
proportionately with the reverse split. In addition, Learn2's common stock may
not meet the other listing requirements for the Nasdaq National Market following
the reverse stock split or Learn2's common stock may be delisted prior to the
date of the special meeting.

     If the stockholders approve the reverse stock split charter amendment at
the special meeting, the reverse stock split will be effected, if at all, only
upon the termination of the merger agreement and a determination by the board of
directors that the reverse stock split (in an exchange ratio determined by the
board of directors within the limits set forth herein which is expected to allow
Learn2's common stock to qualify for continued listing on the Nasdaq National
Market) is in the best interests of Learn2 and its stockholders at that time.
Such determination will be based upon certain factors, including but not limited
to, the then-current price of Learn2's common stock, the availability of
additional working capital, existing and expected marketability and liquidity of
Learn2's common stock, prevailing market conditions and the likely effect on the
market price of Learn2's common stock. Notwithstanding approval of the reverse
stock split by the stockholders, the board of directors will effect the reverse
stock split only if the merger agreement is terminated and Learn2's common stock
has not regained compliance with the Nasdaq listing requirements.

CERTAIN EFFECTS OF THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT CHARTER AMENDMENT

     Based on the           shares of common stock outstanding as of
            , 2001, the following table reflects the approximate percentage
reduction in the outstanding shares of common stock and the approximate number
of shares of common stock that would be outstanding as a result of the reverse
stock split:

                        PROPOSED                                         SHARES
                        REVERSE                           PERCENTAGE      TO BE
                      STOCK SPLIT                         REDUCTION    OUTSTANDING
                      -----------                         ----------   -----------

1 for 2.................................................      50%
1 for 3.................................................      66%
1 for 4.................................................      75%
1 for 5.................................................      80%
1 for 6.................................................      83%
1 for 7.................................................      86%
1 for 8.................................................      87%
1 for 9.................................................      89%
1 for 10................................................      90%

     All outstanding options, warrants, rights and convertible securities will
be appropriately adjusted, as required by their terms, for the reverse stock
split automatically. THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT WILL AFFECT ALL STOCKHOLDERS
EQUALLY AND WILL NOT AFFECT ANY STOCKHOLDER'S PROPORTIONATE EQUITY INTEREST IN
LEARN2. None of the rights currently accruing to holders of Learn2's common
stock, options or warrants to purchase common stock, or securities convertible
into common stock will be affected by the reverse stock split. Following the
reverse stock split, each share of new common stock will entitle the holder
thereof to one vote per share and will otherwise be identical to the old common
stock. The reverse stock split also will have no effect on the number of
authorized shares of common stock or the par value of Learn2's common stock.

EXECUTION AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT CHARTER AMENDMENT

     Each stock certificate representing old common stock will, after the filing
of the reverse stock split charter amendment, represent the appropriate number
of shares of new common stock reflecting the reverse stock split. It will not be
necessary for stockholders to exchange their existing stock certificates.
Stockholders may, however, exchange their certificates if they so choose.

     No scrip or fractional certificates will be issued in the reverse stock
split. In lieu of any such fractional shares, and solely for the purpose of
avoiding the expense and inconvenience of issuing fractional shares, any
stockholder who would otherwise receive a fractional share upon the reverse
stock split proposal will be entitled to receive one additional share of new
common stock. The number of shares of new common stock to be issued in
connection with settling such fractional interests is not expected to be
material.

     The reverse stock split may leave certain stockholders with "odd lots" of
Learn2's common stock (i.e., stock in amounts of less than one hundred shares).
These shares may be more difficult to sell, or require a greater commission per
share to sell, than shares in even multiples of one hundred.

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT

     The following is a summary of the material anticipated federal income tax
consequences of the reverse stock split to stockholders of Learn2. This summary
is based on the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the
Treasury Department Regulations issued pursuant thereto, and published rulings
and court decisions in effect as of the date hereof, all of which are subject to
change. This summary does not take into account possible changes in such laws or
interpretations, including amendments to the Code, applicable statutes,
Regulations and proposed Regulations or changes in judicial

or administrative rulings; some of which may have retroactive effect. No
assurance can be given that any such changes will not adversely affect the
discussion of this summary.

     This summary is provided for general information only and does not purport
to address all aspects of the possible federal income tax consequences of the
reverse stock split and is not intended as tax advice to any person or entity.
In particular, and without limiting the foregoing, this summary does not
consider the federal income tax consequences to stockholders of Learn2 in light
of their individual investment circumstances or to stockholders subject to
special treatment under the federal income tax laws (for example, dealers or
traders, alternative minimum tax provisions, foreign taxpayers, foreign
currencies, acquisitions in connection with compensatory transactions and
regulated investment companies). In addition, this summary does not address any
consequences of the reverse stock split under any state, local or foreign tax
laws. As a result, it is the responsibility of each stockholder to obtain and
rely on advice from his, her or its personal tax advisor as to: (i) the effect
on his, her or its personal tax situation of the reverse stock split, including
the application and effect of state, local and foreign income and other tax
laws; (ii) the effect of possible future legislation and Regulations; and (iii)
the reporting of information required in connection with the reverse stock split
on his, her or its own tax returns. It will be the responsibility of each
stockholder to prepare and file all appropriate federal, state and local tax
returns.

     No ruling from the Internal Revenue Service or opinion of counsel will be
obtained regarding the federal income tax consequences to the stockholders of
Learn2 as a result of the reverse stock split. Accordingly, each stockholder is
encouraged to consult his, her or its tax advisor regarding the specific tax
consequences of the proposed transaction to such stockholder, including the
application and effect of state, local and foreign income and other tax laws.

     Learn2 believes that the reverse stock split will qualify as a
"recapitalization" under Section 368(a)(1)(E) of the Code. As a result, no gain
or loss will be recognized by Learn2 or its stockholders in connection with the
reverse stock split. A stockholder of Learn2 who exchanges his, her or its old
common stock solely for new common stock will recognize no gain or loss for
federal income tax purposes. A stockholder's aggregate tax basis in his, her or
its shares of new common stock received from Learn2 will be the same as his, her
or its aggregate tax basis in the old common stock exchanged therefor. The
holding period of the new common stock received by such stockholder will include
the period during which the old common stock surrendered in exchange therefor
was held, provided all such common stock was held as a capital asset on the date
of the exchange.

TRANSFER AGENT AND REGISTRAR

     Learn2's Transfer Agent and Registrar is American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, New York 11219

REQUIRED VOTE

     Approval of the reverse stock split charter amendment requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of outstanding
shares of Learn2 common stock. The reverse stock split amendment will be
effective only if the merger is not consummated.

LEARN2 PROPOSAL NO. 3: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS OF LEARN2

     At the special meeting, the stockholders of Learn2 will elect five
directors to serve until the 2002 annual meeting of stockholders or until their
respective successors are elected and qualified. The election of directors would
be effective only if the merger is not consummated. The Board of Directors of
Learn2 has recommended the persons named in the table below as nominees for
election as directors. All such persons are presently directors of Learn2. In
the event any nominee should be unable or unwilling to serve as a director at
the time of the special meeting, it is intended that such proxy will be voted
FOR the election, in such nominee's place, of a substitute nominee recommended
by the Board of Directors of Learn2. As of the date of this joint proxy
statement-prospectus, the Board of Directors has no reason to believe that any
nominee will be unable or unwilling to serve as a director if elected.

MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     During the 2000 fiscal year, the Board of Directors of Learn2 met and took
action by unanimous written consent on eight occasions, and no director then in
office attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board
of Directors and meetings of the committees of the Board of Directors on which
he served. The Board of Directors of Learn2 has an Audit Committee and a
Compensation Committee. There is no standing nominating committee.

     The Audit Committee consists of James A. Cannavino, Robert Alan Ezrin and
S. Lee Kling, and met four times during the 2000 fiscal year. The Audit
Committee is responsible for monitoring the integrity of Learn2's financial
reporting process and systems of internal controls regarding finance, accounting
and legal compliance, monitoring the independence and performance of Learn2's
independent auditors and providing an avenue of communication among the
independent auditors, management and the Board of Directors of Learn2.

     The Compensation Committee consists of James A. Cannavino and Robert Alan

Committee has all the authority of the Board of Directors in the management of
the business and affairs of Learn2, except those powers that by law or by
Learn2's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws cannot be
delegated by the Board of Directors.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

     Neither Messrs. Schupak or Gott receives any compensation for his services
as a Director. Learn2's outside directors earn $15,000 per annum, $4,000 per
annum for each committee membership, $1,000 per meeting for each Board of
Directors' meeting in which he participates and $500 for each committee meeting
in which he participates. They are reimbursed for their out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in attending Board of Directors' and committee meetings.

     In March 1997, Learn2 entered into an agreement with The Schupak Group,
Inc. whereby Learn2 paid $12,000 per month to Schupak West, Inc., an affiliate
of The Schupak Group, Inc. for the consulting services of Donald Schupak and
other employees of the Schupak Group, Inc. In January 2000, Learn2's agreement
with The Schupak Group, Inc. was amended to increase the consulting service fees
to $28,666 per month. Additionally, Mr. Schupak is entitled to the reimbursement
of reasonable travel and other expenses incidental to the performance of his
consulting duties. Mr. Schupak is entitled to have the Board of Directors
consider a bonus at the end of each fiscal year.

     On January 6, 2000 Messrs. Schupak, Cannavino and Ezrin were granted
options to purchase 500,000, 285,000 and 40,000 shares, respectively, of
Learn2's common stock originally exercisable at a price of $4.00 per share. Such
options vested immediately.

     On April 10, 2001, Learn2's Board of Directors approved a plan under which
each director, officer and employee would be given the opportunity to exchange
their existing stock options for new stock options with an exercise price of
$0.25 per share, subject to a new vesting schedule that will be approved by
E-Stamp. Messrs. Schupak, Cannavino and Kling have agreed that their previously
vested stock options would be subject to an additional one year of vesting.

     On April 10, 2001, Messrs. Schupak, Cannavino and Kling were granted stock
options to purchase 1,000,000, 165,000 and 300,000, respectively, shares of
common stock at an exercise price of $0.25 per share. Such options are subject
to a one-year vesting period.

     On April 10, 2001, Mr. Gott was granted stock options to purchase 825,000
shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.25 per share, subject to a
three year vesting schedule.

     In lieu of paying compensation for his services as a Director during fiscal
year 2000, on April 10, 2001, Mr. Kling was granted stock options to purchase
60,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.25 per share. Such
options are subject to a one year vesting period.

COMPLIANCE WITH THE EXCHANGE ACT

     Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires
Learn2's directors and executive officers and persons who own beneficially more
than 10% of a registered class of its equity securities to file reports of
ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on a timely basis. Reporting persons are required to furnish Learn2 with copies
of all such forms that they file. Based solely on Learn2's review of such forms,
except as set forth in the remainder of this section, Learn2 believes that all
filing requirements applicable to reporting persons during and with respect to
fiscal year 2000 were complied with on a timely basis. Mr. Schupak transferred
shares of common stock to a partnership and filed a Form 5 required by Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act on or about February 12, 2001.

REQUIRED VOTE

     Directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders
of Learn2's common stock voting in person or by proxy at the special meeting.
The five nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of shares
entitled to be voted for them will be elected as directors of Learn2. Unless
marked otherwise, proxies received will be voted FOR the election of each of the
nominees named above. The election of directors will be effective only if the
merger is not consummated.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The Board of Directors of Learn2 recommends a vote FOR each of the nominee
directors listed above.

                    E-STAMP SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

DATE, TIME AND PLACE OF MEETING

     The date, time and place of the special meeting are as follows:
                                           , 2001
     , local time

PURPOSE OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

     The special meeting is being held so that stockholders of E-Stamp may
consider and vote upon:

     - a proposal to adopt a merger agreement between E-Stamp and Learn2,
       pursuant to which E-Stamp will merge with Learn2, and E-Stamp will be the
       surviving company and change its name to "Learn2 Corporation"; and

     - a proposal to increase the number of shares of E-Stamp common stock
       reserved for issuance under E-Stamp's 1999 Stock Plan by 2,500,000
       shares.

     Adoption of the merger agreement will also constitute approval of the
merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Holders
of E-Stamp stock may also consider and vote upon such other matters as may be
brought properly before the special meeting.

RECORD DATE

     E-Stamp's board of directors has fixed the close of business on
            , 2001, as the record date for determination of E-Stamp stockholders
entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. On the record date,
there were                shares of E-Stamp common stock outstanding, held by
approximately                holders of record.

VOTING BY PROXY

     All shares of E-Stamp common stock represented by properly executed proxies
received before or at the E-Stamp special meeting will, unless the proxies have
been revoked previously, be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated
in those proxies. IF NO INSTRUCTIONS ARE INDICATED, SHARES OF E-STAMP COMMON
STOCK REPRESENTED BY THOSE PROXIES WILL BE VOTED "FOR" ADOPTION OF THE MERGER
AGREEMENT AND "FOR" THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SHARES RESERVED FOR ISSUANCE
UNDER THE 1999 STOCK PLAN. E-Stamp does not know of any matters other than as
described in the notice of special meeting of stockholders that are to come
before the special meeting. If any other matter is presented for action properly
at the special meeting, the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy will
have the discretion to vote on such matters in accordance with their judgment
unless authority to do so is withheld on the proxy card.

     A stockholder who has given a proxy may revoke it at any time prior to its
exercise by giving written notice to the Secretary of E-Stamp, by signing and
returning a later-dated proxy, or by voting in person at the special meeting.
However, mere attendance at the special meeting will not in and of itself have
the effect of revoking the proxy. Votes cast by proxy or in person at the
special meeting will be tabulated by the inspector of election appointed for the
special meeting.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

     E-Stamp and Learn2 will share equally in the expenses incurred in
connection with the printing and mailing of this joint proxy
statement-prospectus. E-Stamp may reimburse expenses incurred by brokerage

firms and other persons representing beneficial owners of shares in forwarding
solicitation material to such beneficial owners. E-Stamp has retained Mellon
Investor Services as proxy solicitors and expects to pay approximately $6,000
for this service. Proxies may also be solicited by certain of E-Stamp's
directors, officers and regular employees, without additional compensation other
than reimbursement of expenses, personally, by telephone or by telefax.

QUORUM; ABSTENTIONS; BROKER NON-VOTES

     The presence in person or by properly executed proxy of holders of a
majority of all the issued and outstanding shares of E-Stamp common stock
entitled to vote is necessary to constitute a quorum at the special meeting. For
purposes of determining whether a quorum is present, the inspector of election
will include shares that are present or represented by proxy, even if the
holders of such shares abstain from voting on any particular matter. In the
event that a broker, bank, custodian, nominee or other record holder of E-Stamp
common stock indicates on a proxy that it does not have discretionary authority
to vote certain shares on a particular proposal -- known as a broker
non-vote -- those shares will not be considered for purposes of determining the
number of shares entitled to vote with respect to a particular proposal on which
the broker has expressly not voted, but will be counted for purposes of
determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business.
Accordingly, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the effect of a "no"
vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement but will not affect the
outcome of the voting on the amendment to the 1999 Stock Plan.

E-STAMP PROPOSAL NO. 1: THE MERGER AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

     At the special meeting the E-Stamp stockholders are being asked to approve
the merger and adopt the merger agreement, which includes changing E-Stamp's
name to "Learn2 Corporation" upon the consummation of the merger. The terms of
the merger and the merger agreement are described in this joint proxy
statement-prospectus.

REQUIRED VOTE

     Approval of the merger and adoption of the merger agreement requires the
affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of E-Stamp
common stock.

     As of April 30, 2001, directors and executive officers of E-Stamp and their
affiliates were beneficial owners of an aggregate of 7,331,537 shares of E-Stamp
common stock, or approximately 19.2% of the outstanding shares of common stock.
All of E-Stamp directors, executive officers and certain of their affiliates
have entered into agreements to vote all shares of E-Stamp capital stock
beneficially owned by them in favor of the proposed merger and the name change.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE E-STAMP BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The board of directors of E-Stamp has unanimously approved the merger
agreement and the merger and believes that the merger is advisable and in the
best interests of E-Stamp and its stockholders. The E-Stamp board of directors,
therefore, unanimously recommends that holders of E-Stamp stock vote FOR
approval of the merger and adoption of the merger agreement.

E-STAMP PROPOSAL NO. 2: AMENDMENT TO 1999 STOCK PLAN

     At the special meeting, the E-Stamp stockholders are being asked to approve
an amendment of the Company's 1999 Stock Plan (the "1999 Plan") to increase the
number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance thereunder by 2,500,000
shares.

     As of May 4, 2001, a total of 4,824,936 shares of common stock have been
reserved for issuance under the 1999 Plan. As of May 4, 2001, 296,170 shares had
been issued upon the exercise of stock options granted under the 1999 Plan, of
which 107,420 shares have been repurchased by E-Stamp, 893,979

options were outstanding and 3,742,207 shares remained available for future
grant. Under the amendment, an additional 2,500,000 shares will be authorized
and available for future grants under the 1999 Plan.

     The 1999 Plan is structured to allow the board of directors broad
discretion in creating equity incentives in order to assist E-Stamp in
attracting, retaining and motivating the best available personnel for the
successful conduct of E-Stamp's business. E-Stamp believes that linking key
employee compensation to corporate performance through the use of stock options
increases employee motivation to enhance stockholder value. Therefore, E-Stamp
has included equity incentives as a significant component of compensation for a
broad range of E-Stamp's employees.

     The board of directors believes that the remaining shares available for
grant under the 1999 Plan are insufficient to accomplish the purposes of the
1999 Plan described above after the consummation of the merger. E-Stamp
anticipates that after the merger there will be a need to hire additional
technical, sales and marketing, and management employees and it will be
necessary to offer equity incentives to attract and motivate these individuals.
In addition, in order to retain the services of valuable employees as E-Stamp
and its employee base grows larger, it will be necessary to grant additional
options to current employees as older options become fully vested.

SUMMARY OF 1999 STOCK PLAN

     The board of directors adopted the 1999 Plan, in August 1999, and our
stockholders approved the 1999 Plan in August 2000. This stock option plan
provides for the grant to employees of incentive stock options within the
meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and for
the grant to employees, directors and consultants of nonstatutory stock options
and stock purchase rights.

     The number of shares reserved under the 1999 Plan is subject to annual
increases, equal to the lesser of:

     - 1,250,000 shares;

     - 3% of the outstanding shares on such date; or

     - a lesser amount determined by the board.

     The stock plan administrator, which is the board of directors or a
committee of the board, administers the 1999 Plan. In the case of options
intended to qualify as "performance based compensation" within the meaning of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the committee will consist of two
or more "outside directors" within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended.

     The administrator determines the exercise price of nonstatutory stock
options granted under the 1999 Plan, but with respect to nonstatutory stock
options intended to qualify as "performance based compensation" within the
meaning of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the exercise price
must be at least equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date
of grant. The exercise price of incentive stock options granted under the 1999
Plan must be at least equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the
date of grant. For any participant who owns stock possessing more than 10% of
the voting power of all classes of our capital stock, the exercise price of any
incentive stock option must equal at least 110% of the fair value on the date of
grant and the term of such incentive stock option must not exceed five years.
The term of all other options granted under the stock option plan may not exceed
10 years.

     Generally, an optionee must exercise an option granted under the 1999 Plan
within three months after the end of the optionee's status as an employee,
director or consultant of E-Stamp, or within 12 months after the optionee's
termination by death or disability, but in no event later than the expiration of
the option's term. Unless determined otherwise by the administrator, an optionee
generally may not transfer options and stock purchase rights granted under the
1999 Plan.

     The administrator determines the exercise price of stock purchase rights
granted under the 1999 Plan. In case of stock purchase rights, unless the
administrator determines otherwise, the restricted stock

purchase agreement entered into in connection with the exercise of the stock
purchase rights contains a repurchase option that we may exercise upon the
voluntary or involuntary termination of the purchaser's service with us for any
reason, including death or disability. The purchase price for shares we
repurchase under the restricted stock purchase agreements will be the original
price paid by the purchaser and may be paid by cancellation of any indebtedness
of the purchaser to us. The repurchase option lapses at a rate that the
administrator determines.

     The 1999 Plan provides that in the event of our merger with or into another
corporation or the sale of substantially all of our assets, the successor
corporation will assume or substitute each option or stock purchase right. If
the outstanding options or stock purchase rights are not assumed or substituted,
the administrator will provide notice to the optionee that he or she has the
right to exercise each outstanding option or stock purchase right as to all of
the shares subject to the option or stock purchase right, including shares that
would not otherwise be exercisable, for a period of 30 days from the date of the
notice. The options and stock purchase rights will terminate upon the expiration
of the 30-day period.

     Unless terminated sooner, the 1999 Plan will terminate automatically in
2009. In addition, the administrator has the authority to amend, suspend or
terminate the 1999 Plan, provided that no such action may affect any share of
common stock previously issued and sold or any option previously granted.

OFFICER AND DIRECTOR PARTICIPATION IN THE 1999 PLAN

     The grant of options under the 1999 Plan to executive officers and
directors, is subject to the discretion of the administrator. Options granted to
officers and directors are described more fully under "E-Stamp Management." As
of the date of this proxy statement, there has been no determination by the
administrator with respect to future awards under the 1999 Plan. Accordingly,
future awards are not determinable.

REQUIRED VOTE

     Approval of the increase to 1999 Plan requires the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares of E-Stamp common stock present or
represented at the special meeting.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE E-STAMP BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The board of directors of E-Stamp has approved the amendment to the 1999
Plan and believes that the increase is in the best interests of E-Stamp and its
stockholders. The E-Stamp board of directors, therefore, recommends that holders
of E-Stamp stock vote FOR the increase in the number of shares reserved for
issuance under the 1999 Plan.

                                   THE MERGER

     This section of this joint proxy statement-prospectus describes material
aspects of the proposed merger. While we believe that the description covers the
material terms of the merger, this summary may not contain all of the
information that is important to you. You should read this entire joint proxy
statement-prospectus, including the annexes and exhibits, carefully for a more
complete understanding of the merger and the terms of the merger agreement.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     In June 2000, E-Stamp engaged Credit Suisse First Boston to assist E-Stamp
in exploring potential strategic transactions.

     From June 2000 through March 2001, E-Stamp's executives and financial
advisors explored various financing alternatives and discussed potential
business combinations with numerous parties. During this period, E-Stamp's board
of directors met on fifteen occasions to review and discuss these potential
transactions.

In October 2000, Learn2 engaged M. Kane & Company, Inc. and Dresdner Kleinwort
Wasserstein as its financial advisors. Learn2 authorized MK & Co. to explore and
evaluate strategic alternatives and extraordinary transactions and DKW to
explore and evaluate potential sources of equity financings.

     Following these engagements, representatives of CSFB, MK & Co. and DKW
contacted representatives of numerous parties that they believed might be
interested in pursuing a transaction with their respective clients. During this
time, Learn2 and E-Stamp became aware of each other.

     On February 8, 2001, Donald Schupak, Chairman of the Board of Learn2,
contacted Robert H. Ewald, President and Chief Executive Officer of E-Stamp, to
suggest that they consider a business combination involving E-Stamp and Learn2.
Mr. Schupak proposed that the combination be accomplished through a
stock-for-stock merger or an investment by E-Stamp.

     On February 13, 2001, Messrs. Schupak, Ewald and Stephen P. Gott, President
and Chief Executive Officer of Learn2, had another conversation to discuss these
matters further and the growth strategies of Learn2 in the e-learning corporate
marketplace.

     During the week of February 19, 2001, the companies began consulting with
their financial and legal advisors about issues raised in the discussions among
their executives. E-Stamp retained Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, PC as its
legal counsel and Learn2 retained Swidler Berlin Shereff Friedman, LLP as its
legal counsel. Working with their financial and legal advisors, E-Stamp and
Learn2 began conducting their due diligence investigations using publicly
available materials and began analyses of a possible combination. These
consultations continued throughout the remaining merger discussions.

     In addition to a business combination, Learn2 also contacted several
parties in connection with a possible equity financing and the possible sale of
certain of its assets. As a result of this process, Learn2 commenced discussions
with certain investors to discuss an equity investment in Learn2. Over the next
several weeks, Learn2 negotiated the terms of an equity financing but no
transaction was ever consummated.

     On February 21, 2001, Mr. Ewald delivered to Mr. Schupak an informal
analysis of the terms of a potential business combination. Messrs. Ewald and
Schupak continued their discussion about a possible business combination,
elaborating on the benefits of the merger and the structure and implementation
of the merger.

     On February 27, 2001, the board of directors of Learn2 discussed the
proposed merger, strategic rationale for a merger, the appropriate exchange
ratio and the governance and management structure of the resulting entity.

     On March 5, 2001, the board of directors of Learn2 continued to discuss the
proposed business combination with E-Stamp. Mr. Schupak presented an update
regarding the status of negotiations with

E-Stamp. The board of directors authorized Learn2's management to continue its
discussions with E-Stamp.

     On March 6, 2001, Mr. Schupak had a conversation with Robert J. Cresci, a
director of E-Stamp, concerning the rationale for the merger, the appropriate
exchange ratio and the governance and management structure of the resulting
entity. The discussions remained at a general level, and no agreement regarding
the specific terms of a possible merger was reached. Over the next month,
Messrs. Cresci and Schupak had periodic telephone conversations to discuss the
proposed combination.

     On March 7, 2001, the board of directors of Learn2 continued to discuss the
proposed business combination with E-Stamp and principal terms of a transaction.

     On March 8, 2001, Mr. Schupak presented to Mr. Ewald a non-binding proposal
outlining the terms for a possible business combination between E-Stamp and
Learn2. The terms of the proposal included the issuance of Learn2 common stock
to the holders of E-Stamp common stock. During that meeting, there were again
discussions, but no agreement, about an appropriate exchange ratio.

     From March 8, 2001 to March 14, 2001, Mr. Ewald and Edward F. Malysz, Vice
President, General Counsel and Acting Chief Financial Officer of E-Stamp,
participated in discussions with representatives of CSFB and WSGR regarding the
Learn2 proposal.

     On March 13, 2001 Mr. Malysz presented Mr. Schupak with a proposed
structure of the transaction in which Learn2 would merge into E-Stamp.

     On March 14, 2001, representatives of CSFB, E-Stamp, DKW, Learn2, WSGR and
SBSF participated in a telephone conference to discuss the alternative
structures for a transaction and the exchange ratio. The meeting concluded with
no definitive agreement on terms of a possible business combination.

     From March 14, 2001 to March 21, 2001, representatives of CSFB, E-Stamp,
DKW and Learn2 participated in additional conversations regarding a potential
transaction.

     On March 19, 2001, E-Stamp executed a non-disclosure agreement with Learn2.

     On March 20, 2001, Mr. Malysz presented to Mr. Schupak a non-binding
proposal outlining revised terms for a possible business combination between
E-Stamp and Learn2. Terms of that proposal included: a proposed merger in which
E-Stamp would be the surviving corporation; an exchange ratio in which Learn2
stockholders would receive approximately 49.9% of the stock in the combined
company; E-Stamp's designation of a majority of the members of the board of
directors of the combined company; and a convertible loan from E-Stamp to
Learn2.

     On March 21, 2001, Michael M. Arons, Vice President and Controller of
Learn2, met with Mr. Malysz at E-Stamp's offices to engage in financial due
diligence on E-Stamp.

     On March 21, 2001, there was a special telephonic meeting of the board of
directors of E-Stamp, which included a discussion of a potential strategic
transaction or business combination with Learn2.

     From March 21, 2001 to March 22, 2001, E-Stamp, Learn2 and their financial
and legal advisors engaged in discussions regarding the March 20th E-Stamp
proposal, and the parties continued to negotiate the terms, valuation and
structure of a potential business combination.

     On March 22, 2001, Mr. Ewald and Roderick Witmond, then Vice President,
Business Development, of E-Stamp met at Learn2's offices in White Plains, New
York with Messrs. Schupak, Gott and Arons and with Marc E. Landy, Executive Vice
President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of Learn2, and Kevin Riley,
President, Learning Services Division of Learn2. At this meeting, Messrs. Ewald
and Witmond continued their diligence investigation on Learn2's business. On
that same day, representatives of E-Stamp also visited Learn2's facilities in
Pryor, Oklahoma and Golden, Colorado.

     On March 22, 2001, the board of directors of Learn2 discussed the March
20th E-Stamp proposal. Learn2's legal counsel advised the board of directors of
its fiduciary obligations in considering a possible

transaction with E-Stamp, and reviewed with the Learn2 board the terms of the
proposed merger and the status of negotiations on those terms. The board of
Learn2 asked questions of Learn2's legal counsel, and a discussion ensued
regarding open issues and strategic alternatives.

     During the evening of March 22, 2001, the parties agreed upon a revised
non-binding proposal to form the basis for the drafting of definitive
transaction documents. Terms of that revised proposal included that the
convertible loan from E-Stamp to Learn2 would be in the amount of $2 million and
that Learn2's obligation to close the merger would be contingent upon E-Stamp
having at least $13 million in available cash at the closing of the proposed
merger. The remaining terms and conditions of the revised proposal were
substantially the same as the March 20th E-Stamp proposal. Legal counsel for
both parties began to prepare and negotiate the definitive agreements for the
transaction.

     On March 23, 2001, Mr. Schupak accompanied Mr. Ewald and representatives of
WSGR to a hearing regarding continued listing of E-Stamp common stock on the
Nasdaq National Market before the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel. At the
hearing, Mr. Ewald and Mr. Schupak responded to various questions from the
members of the panel regarding the terms and conditions of the proposed merger.

     On March 23, 2001, WSGR and SBSF exchanged legal due diligence request
lists concerning Learn2 and E-Stamp. From March 23, 2001 to March 26, 2001,
representatives of WSGR and SBSF conducted legal due diligence on Learn2 and
E-Stamp. During this time period, E-Stamp and CSFB met with representatives of
Learn2 and its financial advisor to conduct further business and financial
diligence on Learn2.

     From March 23, 2001 to March 29, 2001, E-Stamp's and Learn2's executive
officers, legal counsel and other representatives held further discussions to
negotiate the terms of the proposed merger agreement and related documents,
including valuation, the terms of the loan from E-Stamp to Learn2, the terms of
the proposed voting agreements between to be entered into by certain directors
and executive officers of E-Stamp and Learn2, the termination rights contained
in the proposed merger agreement, the conditions upon which any termination fees
would be payable and the amount of such fees, E-Stamp's and Learn2's respective
rights under the proposed merger agreement to consider and negotiate other
acquisition proposals in certain circumstances, and the representations,
warranties and covenants to be made by E-Stamp and Learn2. During this period,
E-Stamp's and Learn2's financial advisors had further discussions regarding
valuation issues, and representatives of E-Stamp and its legal advisors
conducted further due diligence on Learn2's business, prospects, strategy and
financial condition.

     On March 25, 2001, there was a special telephonic meeting of the board of
directors of E-Stamp, which included a discussion of the proposed merger
agreement and related transactions. WSGR discussed the terms of the proposed
merger agreement and related transactions, including the termination rights
contained in the proposed merger agreement, the conditions upon which any
termination fees would be payable and the amount of such fees, and E-Stamp's and
Learn2's respective rights under the proposed merger agreement to consider and
negotiate other acquisition proposals in certain circumstances, and responded to
various questions raised by members of E-Stamp's board of directors regarding
the proposed merger agreement and related transactions. Mr. Malysz reviewed with
the E-Stamp board of directors an executive summary of the terms of the proposed
merger agreement and related transaction, and responded to various questions
raised by members of E-Stamp's board of directors regarding the terms of the
proposed merger agreement and related transaction. CSFB discussed its diligence
on Learn2, and responded to various questions from the E-Stamp board of
directors regarding its diligence on Learn2.

     On March 26, 2001, there was a special telephonic meeting of the board of
directors E-Stamp, which included a discussion of the merger agreement and
related transactions. CSFB made a presentation to the E-Stamp board of directors
regarding the proposed merger, and responded to various questions raised by
members of E-Stamp's board of directors regarding its presentation. After
considering the terms of the proposed transaction, the E-Stamp board of
directors determined that its advisors conduct further diligence on Learn2 and
that Learn2's management be invited to meet with the E-Stamp board of directors.

     On March 28, 2001, E-Stamp engaged Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin to render
an opinion to E-Stamp regarding the fairness of the proposed merger from a
financial point of view to E-Stamp stockholders.

     On March 29, 2001, there was a special meeting of the board of directors of
E-Stamp, which included a presentation by Messrs. Gott and Riley, regarding
Learn2's business, strategy and financial condition. CSFB discussed its
financial due diligence on Learn2, and responded to various questions raised by
members of E-Stamp's board of directors regarding its diligence on Learn2. HLHZ
discussed its analysis of the merger, and responded to various questions raised
by members of E-Stamp's board of directors regarding its analyses. WSGR
discussed its legal due diligence on E-Stamp, and responded to various questions
raised by members of E-Stamp's board of directors regarding its diligence on
Learn2. The board of directors discussed the terms of the proposed merger
agreement, the convertible promissory note and related documents and a
representative from WSGR responded to questions regarding such documents from
the E-Stamp board of directors. After considering the terms of the proposed
transaction, the E-Stamp board of directors determined that further negotiations
regarding the termination of the outstanding Learn2 debenture and a reduction in
the amount payable to the debenture holder at closing were appropriate.

     From March 29, 2001 to April 9, 2001, the parties continued to negotiate
the terms, valuation and structure of a potential merger, including the terms on
which Learn2's outstanding debenture would be retired. Legal counsel for both
parties continued to prepare and negotiate the definitive agreements for the
transaction.

     On April 9, 2001, there was a special meeting of the board of directors of
E-Stamp which included a discussion of the merger agreement and related
transactions. WSGR discussed its further legal due diligence on Learn2, and
responded to various questions raised by members of E-Stamp's board of directors
regarding its legal diligence on Learn2. HLHZ made a presentation to the E-Stamp
board of directors regarding the proposed merger, discussed its analyses of the
merger and responded to various questions raised by members of E-Stamp's board
of directors regarding its analyses. The E-Stamp board of directors discussed
the merger agreement and related documents and a representative from WSGR
responded to questions regarding such documents from the E-Stamp board of
directors. After considering the terms of the proposed transaction, the E-Stamp
board of directors determined that the proposed merger was advisable and in the
best interests of E-Stamp and its stockholders. The E-Stamp board of directors
then approved the merger agreement and the exhibits thereto, and the merger.

     From April 9, 2001 to April 19, 2001, the parties continued to negotiate
the terms of the redemption of Learn2's outstanding debenture and related
transactions.

     On April 10, 2001, the board of directors of Learn2 had a meeting to
consider the proposed transaction. At this meeting, Mr. Schupak and other
members of management reviewed the transaction with the board, including the
strategic reasons for the proposed transaction, the principal terms of the
proposed transaction, a financial review of the proposed transaction, a review
of E-Stamp's financial condition and the results of Learn2's due diligence
review. SBSF discussed the board's fiduciary duties in considering the strategic
business combination and further discussed the terms of the merger agreement and
related documents. The Learn2 board of directors reviewed a draft of the merger
agreement and related documents and a representative of SBSF responded to
questions regarding such documents from the Learn2 board of directors.
Representatives of MK&Co presented to Learn2's board of directors a summary of
its financial analyses related to proposed transaction. In addition, MK&Co.
delivered its opinion that the proposed transaction was fair, from a financial
point of view, to holders of Learn2's common stock (other than Learn2's
management, the holder of Learn2's convertible debenture and their affiliates,
as to which MK & Co. expressed no opinion). Upon completing its deliberations,
the board of directors of Learn2 unanimously approved the merger agreement and
the related agreements and transactions contemplated by those agreements,
declared them advisable and resolved to recommend that Learn2's stockholders
adopt the merger agreement.

     During the afternoon and evening of April 19, 2001, following approval of
the merger agreement and related matters by the E-Stamp board of directors and
the Learn2 board of directors, E-Stamp and Learn2 finalized, executed and
delivered the merger agreement and related documents.

     E-Stamp and Learn2 issued a joint press release announcing the execution of
the merger agreement and the terms of the merger on the morning of April 20,
2001.

LEARN2'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER; BOARD RECOMMENDATION

     At its meeting on April 10, 2001, Learn2's board of directors unanimously:

     - determined that the merger agreement and the merger are advisable, and in
       the best interests of, Learn2 and its stockholders;

     - directed that the merger proposal be submitted for consideration by the
       Learn2 stockholders; and

     - recommend that the Learn2 stockholders vote FOR the merger proposal.

     In the course of reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and
the merger, Learn2's board of directors consulted with Learn2's management, as
well as its outside legal counsel and its legal advisors, and considered the
following material factors:

     - the financial and other terms of the merger and the merger agreement;

     - the financial presentation of MK&Co., including its opinion that the
       merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Learn2
       stockholders (other than Learn2's management, the holder of Learn2's
       convertible debenture and their affiliates, as to which MK&Co. expressed
       no opinion);

     - that the transaction with E-Stamp provided greater value to Learn2
       stockholders than other alternatives;

     - the additional working capital available for growth;

     - the ability of the combined company to retire its debt;

     - the views of senior management at the time that, in light of the
       preceding factor and Learn2's declining stock price, it was unlikely that
       any party would propose a business combination that would be more
       favorable to Learn2 and its stockholders;

     - possible alternatives to the merger including continuing to operate
       Learn2 as an independent entity;

     - the belief that the terms and conditions of the merger agreement,
       including the parties' representations, warranties and covenants, and the
       conditions to their respective obligations, are reasonable;

     - the ability to complete the merger as a tax-free reorganization for U.S.
       federal income tax purposes;

     - current financial market conditions and trading information with respect
       to E-Stamp and Learn2 common stock;

     - the risk of diverting management resources from other strategic
       opportunities and operational matters for an extended period of time;

     - the possibility that the merger might not be completed, and the fact that
       under some circumstances E-Stamp might be required to pay a termination
       fee to Learn2;

     - the substantial costs to be incurred in connection with the merger;

     - the interests of certain directors and executive officers of Learn2 in
       the merger as described in "Interests of Learn2 and Officers and
       Directors in the Merger" on page 51; and

     - the terms and conditions of the E-Stamp voting agreement that require
       directors, executive officers and certain affiliates to vote their shares
       of common stock in favor of the merger.

     In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its
evaluation of the merger and the complexity of these matters, the Learn2 board
did not find it useful to and did not attempt to quantify, rank or otherwise
assign relative weights to these factors. The Learn2 board relied on the
experience and expertise of MK&Co., its financial advisor, for quantitative
analysis of the financial terms of the merger. See "Opinion of Learn2 Financial
Advisor." In addition, the Learn2 board did not undertake to make any specific
determination as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any
particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to the Learn2 board's ultimate
determination, but rather the Learn2 board conducted an overall analysis of the
factors described above, including thorough discussions with and questioning of
Learn2 management and legal and financial advisors. In considering the factors
described above, individual members of the Learn2 board may have given different
weight to different factors.

     The Learn2 board considered all these factors as a whole, and overall
considered the factors to be favorable to and support its determination.

OPINION OF LEARN2 FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not
necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. The
following is a brief summary and general description of the valuation
methodologies utilized by M. Kane & Company, Inc. or MK&Co. This summary does
not purport to be a complete statement of the analyses and procedures applied,
the judgments made or the conclusion reached by MK&Co. or a complete description
of its presentation. MK&Co. believes, and so advised the board of directors of
Learn2, that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting
portions of its analyses and of the factors it considered, without considering
all factors and analyses, could create an incomplete view of the process
underlying its analyses and opinions.

     Learn2 retained MK&Co. to render an opinion to be addressed to the board of
directors of Learn2, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
merger to the public stockholders of Learn2 (other than management of Learn2,
the holder of Learn2's convertible debenture, and their affiliates as to which
MK&Co. expresses no opinion) from a financial point of view (without giving
effect to any other benefits that may inure to any particular stockholder as a
result of the proposed transaction other than in its capacity as a stockholder).
At the April 10, 2001 meeting of the board of directors, MK&Co. presented its
analyses as hereinafter described and delivered its written opinion that as of
such date and based on the matters described therein, the consideration to be
received by the stockholders of Learn2 in connection with the merger is fair to
the public shareholders of Learn2 (other than management of Learn2, the holder
of Learn2's convertible debenture, and their affiliates as to which MK&Co.
expresses no opinion) from a financial point of view (without giving effect to
any other benefits that may inure to any particular shareholder as a result of
the proposed transaction other than in its capacity as a stockholder).

     THE COMPLETE TEXT OF MK&CO.'S OPINION IS ATTACHED HERETO AS ANNEX V. THE
SUMMARY OF THE OPINION SET FORTH BELOW IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE
TO SUCH OPINION. THE LEARN2 STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ SUCH OPINION
CAREFULLY IN ITS ENTIRETY FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURES FOLLOWED, THE
FACTORS CONSIDERED AND THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY MK&CO.

     MK&Co.'s opinion to the board of directors addresses only the fairness from
a financial point of view, of the merger to certain stockholders of Learn2, and
does not constitute a recommendation to the stockholders as to how such
stockholders should vote at the special meeting. MK&Co.'s opinion does not
address Learn2's underlying business decision to effect the merger.

     In connection with the preparation of its opinion, MK&Co. made such
reviews, analyses and inquiries as it deemed necessary and appropriate under the
circumstances. Among other things, MK&Co.:

     1. Reviewed and considered recent historical financial and business
        information, including results of operations and cash flow of Learn2,
        and certain other financial information, contained in documentation
        provided to it by Learn2;

     2. Held discussions with members of the management of Learn2 regarding the
        past and current business operations and financial condition and future
        prospects of Learn2;

     3. Reviewed forecasts supplied to MK&Co. by Learn2 with respect to internal
        projected financial and operating results, including earnings and cash
        flow of Learn2;

     4. Reviewed pro forma operating and cash flow statements and balance sheets
        of Learn2 supplied to MK&Co. by Learn2, assuming consummation of the
        merger;

     5. Reviewed publicly available financial and market data for certain public
        companies engaged in business similar to Learn2;

     6. Reviewed publicly available financial information relating to recent
        acquisitions involving companies comparable to Learn2;

     7. Reviewed the historical stock market prices and trading volumes of the
        outstanding common stock of Learn2; and

     8. Reviewed the principal financial terms of the implementing documentation
        provided to MK&Co. with respect to the merger.

Assumptions and Limitations

     In rendering its opinion, MK&Co. relied upon, without independent
verification or investigation, the accuracy and completeness of the information
available from public sources or provided to MK&Co. by Learn2 and its
representatives. With respect to the internal forecasts regarding the future
financial and operating results of Learn2 and the pro forma information provided
to MK&Co., MK&Co. assumed, without independent verification or investigation,
that such forecasts and pro forma information were prepared on bases reflecting
the best currently available information, estimates and judgments of the
management of Learn2 and that the assumptions underlying the forecasts and pro
forma information were reasonable. MK&Co. did not make or obtain any independent
evaluations or appraisals of the assets or liabilities of Learn2. MK&Co. relied,
without independent verification or investigation, on the financial statements
of Learn2 provided by its management. MK&Co.'s opinion was based upon its
assessment of general economic, financial and market conditions as they existed
and could be evaluated by MK&Co. as of the date of its letter.

     In rendering its opinion, MK&Co. also assumed that the economic and
financial climate, characterized in part by the unfavorable equity capital
market conditions for companies with the recent financial operating performance
similar to Learn2, will generally continue, at least through the period
necessary to consummate the proposed transaction.

     In rendering its opinion, MK&Co. also relied upon the fact that Learn2 was
advised by counsel as to all legal matters with respect to the proposed
transaction, including whether all procedures required by law to be taken in
connection with the proposed transaction, in fact, have been duly, validly and
timely taken. MK&Co. did not make any representation or render any opinion as to
any legal matter.

     Learn2 specifically informed MK&Co. that it reviewed and approved its
assumptions and that it understood that, to the extent that any of the
assumptions or any of the facts on which MK&Co.'s opinion was based proves to be
untrue in any material respect, MK&Co.'s opinion cannot and should not be relied
upon.

Analysis of Historical Performance

     MK&Co. analyzed Learn2's historical financial performance through the
reporting period ended December 31, 2000. Learn2 has been unable to generate
pretax profit since inception. Among other things, MK&Co. noted that, for fiscal
year 2000, Learn2's earnings before depreciation, amortization, interest expense
and income taxes, extraordinary gain and restructuring charges or EBITDA was a
negative $13.3 million; and net loss was $38 million.

Stock Trading History

     MK&Co. examined the history of the trading prices and volume of Learn2's
common stock. The closing price of Learn2's common stock was $0.23 per share on
April 6, 2001, and the average closing price of Learn2's common stock in the ten
trading days ending April 6, 2001 was $0.21.

Comparable Company Analysis

     MK&Co. reviewed selected consolidated financial information, through the
reporting period ended December 31, 2000 (the most recent information publicly
available at the time), of certain other companies in lines of businesses it
believed to be comparable to the business of Learn2. Two groups of comparable
companies were selected for the analysis. The first group did not evidence
significant capital sufficiency or liquidity risk in their public filings and
the second group did. The first group of companies which included: Centra
Software, Inc., Docent, Inc., DigitalThink, Inc., eCollege, Inc., Saba Software,
Inc., SmartForce plc, and Skillsoft Corporation and had an adjusted average
multiple of approximately 9.59X the revenue of the trailing twelve month period
or TTM. The second group of companies included in the analysis were:
Click2Learn, Caliber Learning, Inc., Gilat Communications, Ltd.,
Instructivision, Inc., CollegeLink.com, Inc., and Whitman Education Group and
had an adjusted average multiple of approximately 0.46X the revenue of the TTM.
MK&Co. analyzed, among other things, stock trading data and various financial
operating ratios. An analysis of the selected companies is not mathematical;
rather, it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences
in financial and operating characteristics of the companies available for
comparison.

     The public market value of Learn2 at the time of the analysis was
approximately 0.55 times adjusted average TTM revenue, reflecting, in part,
investors' assessments about Learn2's financial performance and capital
sufficiency and liquidity risk. In contrast, by completing the transaction,
Learn2 could mitigate its capital sufficiency and liquidity risk, making it more
comparable to the first group of e-learning companies. As a result, the value to
Learn2 shareholders in the context of the proposed transaction could be computed
as approximately $34.8 million utilizing the same mode of analysis but the
higher multiple of approximately 9.6X. The computed value to Learn2 stockholders
takes account of both the redemption and termination of that certain $10 million
convertible debenture and the issuance of approximately 33.34% of Learn2's
outstanding common stock immediately prior to the consummation of the merger.

     MK&Co. noted that the utility of this analysis was limited. As a result of
the Company's financial performance, only historical revenues provided a
reliable positive parameter, from among those customarily used, from which to
derive an equity value comparison. (Forward-looking parameters were
problematical because they would all necessarily assume that immediate and
sustainable external financing was available on acceptable terms, an assumption
which had no firm basis in fact.) MK&Co. cautioned that conclusions premised on
excessive reliance on only one of many possible financial parameters (e.g.,
EBITDA, EBIT, net income, tangible book value) could not be regarded with a high
degree of reliability in any case.

Analysis of Selected Transactions

     MK&Co. reviewed four merger and acquisition transactions for which adequate
price and other information was publicly available. These transactions took
place at various times within the last three calendar years and involved
Internet software and e-business companies with working capital deficiencies and
negative operating cash flow. MK&Co. concluded that there were no substantially
identical financial transactions in the e-learning industry involving a target
with the mix of market capitalization and financial performance characteristics
similar to those found at Learn2. The four selected transactions are the
respective acquisitions of:

          (i.) Circle.com by Havas Advertising;

          (ii.) CCRL LLC by Launch Media Inc.;

          (iii.) Resumix, Inc. by HotJobs.com Ltd; and

          (iv.) Trent Graphics, Inc. by Network Event Theater, Inc.

     With respect to the foregoing transactions, MK&Co. analyzed purchase prices
in relation to various financial operating ratios. Like the analysis of the
selected comparable companies, an analysis of selected transactions is not
mathematical; rather, it also involves complex considerations and judgments
concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the
companies and transactions available for comparison and the nature of the
financial market environment contemporaneous with the transaction.

     MK&Co. noted that the utility of this analysis was limited. As a result of
Learn2's financial performance, only historical revenues provided a reliable
parameter, from among those customarily used, from which to derive an equity
value comparison.

     The targets of the financial transactions selected share the following
characteristics with Learn2: (i) the targets had relatively low cash balances;
(ii) the targets had working capital deficiencies; (iii) the targets had
negative EBITDA; and (iv) the targets incurred net losses. The average of equity
value paid to the TTM revenue multiple is 1.07X. MK&Co. then applied a 48.8
percent discount to the TTM, to adjust for the dimunition in the Nasdaq
composite index during the six-month period ending on April 6, 2001, the period
during which Learn2 was investigating alternatives and structured the proposed
merger. Indexing the results of the comparable transaction analysis to the
diminution in value of publicly-traded, Nasdaq-listed companies, as represented
by the Nasdaq composite index, yields an implied value of Learn2 of
approximately $12.0 million.

Projected Financial Statements

     MK&Co. reviewed certain internal projected financial forecasts prepared by
Learn2's management for the 2001 through 2003 fiscal years and noted that, among
other things, Learn2's capital sufficiency and liquidity risk was dependent on
Learn2's management's assumption that Learn2 would collect its accounts
receivable projected in its internal financial forecast in a timely fashion.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

     To conduct a discounted cash flow analysis, MK&Co. reviewed the internal
projected financial forecasts for Learn2, on a stand-alone basis, as prepared by
Learn2's management, for the 2001 through 2003 fiscal years. MK&Co. projected,
based on assumptions it believed to be reasonable, an additional two years to
provide projected data through 2005. The forecasts assume that Learn2 will have
sufficient cash to fund operations; but also takes account of the attendant risk
by applying a discount rate derived from analysis of the rates of return under
contemporaneous capital market conditions required by investors purchasing the
securities of companies with comparable capital sufficiency and liquidity risk.
Based on Learn2's projections, free cash flow (EBITDA less changes in working
capital, less capital expenditure) discounted by an internal rate of return
required by investors purchasing recently issued securities of a company in
comparable financial condition, the present value of the common equity of Learn2
was calculated to be approximately $15.5 million.

     In contrast, the value to Learn2 shareholders in the context of the
proposed transaction, utilizing the same mode of analysis, would be
approximately $110 million. The difference is attributable to the fact that with
access to capital, it will be possible to invest sooner in the expansion of
Learn2's business. Moreover, with the mitigation of capital sufficiency and
liquidity risk, the applicable discount rate is derived from the weighted
average cost of capital for the financially healthier, publicly traded
comparable e-learning companies.

Liquidation Analysis

     MK&Co. also prepared, from information provided by Learn2, a liquidation
analysis based on estimates of current assets, net property, plant and
equipment, and net other assets. After deducting certain fees, an estimated
$10.5 million would remain to satisfy creditors. The material assumptions upon
which

the liquidation analysis was based are as follows: (i) accuracy and completeness
of the information reviewed, without independent verification; (ii) affirmation
by Learn2 and review by Learn2 of the treatment, reasonableness and feasibility
of prospective dispositions of assets and liabilities included in the analysis;
and (iii) estimation and affirmation by Learn2 of collection, legal and
administrative fees incident to liquidation. With respect to estimated
liabilities, in consultation with Learn2, MK&Co. assumed that the convertible
debenture would be paid in full; and therefore unsecured creditors would receive
residual proceeds. If such a scenario were to materialize, the stockholders of
Learn2 would be unlikely to realize any value.

Fairness of the Proposed Transaction Consideration

     MK&Co. believes the merger is fair to Learn2's stockholders (other than
management of Learn2, the holder of Learn2's convertible debenture, and their
affiliates as to which MK&Co. expresses no opinion) from a financial point of
view (without giving effect to any other benefits that may inure to any
particular stockholder as a result of the merger other than in its capacity as a
stockholder) based on a number of factors, including the ones listed below.
MK&Co. did not assign a particular weight to any one of the factors described
below, although MK&Co. viewed as particularly significant Learn2's capital
resources and liquidity risk.

          1. Loss of Value in the Event of Insolvency and Liquidation. MK&Co.
     believed that the proposed merger is fair because, among other things,
     Learn2's stockholders are unlikely to realize any value for Learn2's common
     stock if Learn2 must liquidate.

          2. Negotiation of the Proposed Transaction. The terms of the proposed
     merger were determined through arms-length negotiations between Learn2 and
     E-Stamp.

          3. Potential Substantial Dilution of Equity. If the proposed merger is
     not consummated or the merger agreement is terminated and Learn2 fails to
     meet its internal projected forecasts, Learn2 then in certain circumstances
     would have to raise capital via other means. Based on equity capital market
     conditions existing contemporaneously with the proposed merger, Learn2
     would have difficulty raising equity on terms favorable to Learn2.

Fees and Expenses

     Pursuant to an agreement dated October 31, 2000 and subsequently amended as
of March 21, 2001, in exchange for MK&Co.'s investment banking services related
to the proposed transaction, including its fairness opinion, Learn2 has agreed
to pay MK&Co. a fee equal, as of the date of its opinion, to $200,000 plus
$15,000 per month thereafter until consummation of the merger, or (if greater)
2.0625% of the merger consideration. Learn2 has further agreed to pay to MK&Co.
its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and to indemnify MK&Co. against certain
liabilities and expenses in connection with the rendering of its services.

E-STAMP'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER; BOARD RECOMMENDATION

     On April 9, 2001, the E-Stamp Board of Directors voted unanimously to
approve the merger agreement and the terms of the merger. The board also:

     - determined that the merger agreement and the merger were advisable, and
       in the best interests of, E-Stamp and its stockholders;

     - directed that the merger proposal be submitted for consideration by the
       E-Stamp stockholders; and

     - recommended that the E-Stamp stockholders vote FOR the merger proposal.

     In the course of reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and
the merger, E-Stamp's board of directors consulted with E-Stamp's senior
management, as well as its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors. The
E-Stamp board also considered the following material factors:

     - historical information concerning Learn2's business, financial
       performance, operations, management and competitive positions, including
       public reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission;

     - current financial market conditions and trading information with respect
       to E-Stamp and Learn2 common stock;

     - terms of the merger agreement, including E-Stamp's ability to consider a
       superior acquisition proposal and the circumstances under which the
       E-Stamp board may withdraw its recommendation of the merger;

     - the expected treatment of the merger as a tax-free reorganization for
       U.S. federal income tax purposes;

     - the presentation by Houlihan Lokey regarding the financial information,
       valuation analysis and other factors related to the merger;

     - the interests of certain directors and executive officers of E-Stamp in
       the merger as described in "Interests of Learn2 and E-Stamp Officers and
       Directors in the Merger" on page 51;

     - the risk of diverting management resources from other strategic
       opportunities and operational matters for an extended period of time;

     - the possibility that the merger might not be completed, and the fact that
       under some circumstances E-Stamp might be required to pay a termination
       fee to Learn2; and

     - the substantial costs to be incurred in connection with the merger.

     In analyzing the proposed merger, none of the factors above was viewed by
the E-Stamp board of directors as determinative, and the board did not quantify
or weight any of the factors. Rather, the board made its determination based
upon the total mix of information available to it. Moreover, individual members
of the board may have assigned different values to different factors.

OPINION OF E-STAMP FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not
necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. The
following is a brief summary and general description of the valuation
methodologies utilized by Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin Financial Advisors. The
summary does not purport to be a complete statement of the analyses and
procedures applied, the judgments made or the conclusion reached by HLHZ or a
complete description of its presentation. HLHZ believes, and so advised the
Board of Directors of E-Stamp Corporation, that its analyses must be considered
as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and of the factors
considered by it, without considering all factors and analyses, could create an
incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinions.

     E-Stamp retained HLHZ to render an opinion to be addressed to the Board of
Directors of E-Stamp, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
merger and related transactions disclosed to HLHZ to the stockholders of
E-Stamp. At the April 9, 2001 meeting of the Board of Directors, HLHZ presented
its analysis as hereinafter described and on April 18, 2001 delivered its
written opinion that as of such date and based on the matters described therein,
the consideration to be received by stockholders of E-Stamp in connection with
the merger is fair to them from a financial point of view.

     THE COMPLETE TEXT OF HLHZ'S OPINION IS ATTACHED HERETO AS ANNEX IV. THE
SUMMARY OF THE OPINION SET FORTH BELOW IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE
TO SUCH OPINION. E-STAMP STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ SUCH OPINION CAREFULLY
IN ITS ENTIRETY FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCE-

DURES FOLLOWED, THE FACTORS CONSIDERED AND THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY HLHZ.

     HLHZ's opinion to the Board of Directors addresses only the fairness from a
financial point of view of the merger, and does not constitute a recommendation
to the stockholders as to how such stockholder should vote on the merger. HLHZ's
opinion does not address E-Stamp's underlying business decision to effect the
merger. HLHZ has not been requested to, and did not, solicit third party
indications of interest in acquiring all or any part of the E-Stamp.

     In connection with the preparation of its opinion, HLHZ made such reviews,
analyses and inquiries as they deemed necessary and appropriate under the
circumstances. Among other things, HLHZ:

          1. reviewed E-Stamp's audited financial statements on Form 10-K for
     the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000, which management has indicated
     represented the latest financial statements available at that time;

          2. reviewed E-Stamp's financial projections for the fiscal year ended
     December 31, 2001;

          3. reviewed the E-Stamp Corporation's merger analysis regarding the
     costs of discontinuing its operations;

          4. reviewed the Presentation to the Board of Directors of E-Stamp by
     Credit Suisse First Boston, dated March 26, 2001;

          5. reviewed Learn2's audited financial statements on Form 10-K for the
     fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 and its unaudited financial statements
     on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2000;

          6. reviewed Learn2's draft financial statements on its draft Form 10-K
     for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000, which management has indicated
     represented the latest financial information available at that time;

          7. reviewed Learn2's internal projected financial forecasts prepared
     by management of Learn2, for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2001
     through 2002;

          8. reviewed copies of the following documents relating to the merger:

             (i) the Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among E-Stamp
        Corporation and Learn2.com, Inc. (the "Merger Agreement"), draft dated
        April 17, 2001;

             (ii) draft of the Learn2 Disclosure Letter, distributed on April
        18, 2001;

             (iii) the Agreement by and among Learn2.com, Inc., E-Stamp
        Corporation and RGC International Investors, LDC, draft dated April 11,
        2001, regarding the Convertible Debt;

             (iv) the Convertible Promissory Note by and between E-Stamp and
        Learn2, draft dated April 13, 2001;

             (v) the Option Agreement by and between Learn2.com, Inc. and
        E-Stamp Corporation, draft dated April 17, 2001;

          9. interviewed certain senior management of E-Stamp and Learn2 to
     discuss the operations, financial condition, future prospects and projected
     performance of E-Stamp and Learn2;

          10. reviewed the historical market prices and trading volume for
     E-Stamp's and Learn2's publicly traded securities;

          11. reviewed the trading values and financial condition of certain
     public companies deemed comparable to Learn2; and

          12. conducted such other studies, analyses and inquiries as HLHZ
     deemed appropriate.

     In assessing the financial fairness of the merger to stockholders of
E-Stamp, HLHZ: (i) analyzed the historical trading prices of E-Stamp common
stock and Learn2 common stock, (ii) independently valued the equity of Learn2
using widely accepted valuation methodologies, and (iii) reviewed the valuation
implications to stockholders of E-Stamp of the merger and various alternatives
to the merger.

Analysis and Valuation of Learn2 Common Stock

     As part of its valuation analysis of the common stock of Learn2, HLHZ
analyzed the float and trading volume for Learn2's common stock. HLHZ calculated
the public float as a percent of total shares outstanding. In addition, HLHZ
calculated the ratio of average daily trading volume (over the most recent 90
days) to float and total shares outstanding. HLHZ then compared Learn2's ratios
to the same ratios for publicly traded companies that HLHZ deemed comparable to
Learn2. These comparable companies included Digital Think, Inc., Docent, Inc.,
HealthStream, Inc., Plato Learning, Inc., Saba Software, Inc., SkillSoft
Corporation, and SmartForce Plc. HLHZ noted that Learn2 has a slightly higher
percentage of public float to shares outstanding relative to the comparable
companies, and that Learn2's average daily trading volume as a percentage of
public float was below the mean and median for the comparable companies.

     On April 6, 2001, the last trading day before HLHZ's April 9th presentation
to the Board of Directors of E-Stamp, Learn2's common stock was trading at $0.23
per share, 92% below its 52 week high of $3.03 per share on July 20, 2000. The
stock prices of most of the comparable companies experienced similar declines in
trading prices within the prior 52 weeks.

     HLHZ analyzed Learn2's potential intermediate-term trading price based on
its current trading price as well as by comparing it to the comparable public
companies. Because a number of the companies, including Learn2, are not
profitable on an operating basis HLHZ measured multiples of revenues, and gross
profit. HLHZ computed multiples for the latest twelve months ("LTM"), latest
quarter annualized ("LQA"), projected 2001 fiscal year and projected 2002 fiscal
year.

     HLHZ also analyzed the cash position and cash burn rate of Learn2 and the
comparable companies. It was observed that many of the companies have relatively
large cash balances compared to their revenues and compared to their other
assets. To account for this HLHZ calculated multiples on an enterprise value
("EV") basis and a company value ("Company Value") basis. The Company Value
assumes that the current stock price reflects all of the assets of a company,
including its cash balance. EV is equal to Company Value less cash, and is an
indication of the value of the operations of a company, excluding its cash.

     The following table illustrates the Company Value and Enterprise Value of
each of the comparable companies and of Learn2 as of April 6, 2001:

     Based on its analysis, HLHZ concluded that the Company Value indications
were more relevant than Enterprise Value in determining trading multiples of
revenue and gross profit for the comparable companies and for Learn2. The
multiples of Company Value to LTM revenue of the comparable companies ranged
from 2.2 times revenue to 21.3 times revenue, with a median of 9.3 times
revenue.

Similarly, the multiples for the comparable companies based on LQA revenues
ranged from 1.6 to 12.7 times revenue, with a median of 6.4 times revenue.

     The multiples of Company Value of LTM gross profit of the comparable
companies ranged from 2.8 times gross profit to 81.8 times gross profit, with a
median of 11.1 times gross profit. Similarly, the multiples for the comparable
companies based on LQA gross profit ranged from 2.7 to 21.4 times gross profit,
with a median of 8.1 times gross profit.

     The April 6, 2001 trading price of Learn2 indicates that, both on a
multiple of revenue and a multiple of gross profit, it was trading below the low
end of the range of the comparable companies. This analysis indicated that
Learn2 was potentially undervalued, reflecting, in part, its need for additional
funding and uncertainty regarding the dilution impact of its convertible debt.
HLHZ independently valued Learn2, assuming the liquidity issue and uncertainty
regarding the convertible debt are settled. HLHZ valued Learn2 based on the low
end of the range of trading multiples of historical and projected revenue and
gross profit for the comparable companies. HLHZ selected these multiples based
on a risk analysis of Learn2 compared to the comparable companies. The factors
that were considered in the risk analysis included historical and projected
revenue growth and earnings levels, expected cash requirements or cash
generation, and market liquidity and trading levels. HLHZ is independent
valuation of Learn2 indicated that Learn2's stock could potentially trade up to
a company value in the range of $34 million to $42 million, compared to the
$22.4 million implied by the $0.23 per share trading price. Pro forma for the
merger, in which current E-Stamp stockholders will own 50.1% of the combined
company, this implies a value per E-Stamp share in the range of $0.44 to $0.55
per share, a premium to its recent $0.23 per share price.

Fairness Analysis

     To determine the fairness of the merger to the stockholders of E-Stamp from
a financial point of view HLHZ compared the value of the consideration be
received in the merger by the stockholders of E-Stamp to the value of the most
likely alternatives to the merger. The alternatives HLHZ considered included (i)
a liquidation scenario, and (ii) a status quo scenario in which E-Stamp
continued to operate its existing business as an independent company.

     In considering a liquidation scenario, HLHZ reviewed with E-Stamp
management, its estimate of the costs to wind down its operations, liquidate its
assets and settle its obligations and contingent liabilities, the risks
associated with such activities, and the timing of the distribution to
stockholders of the remaining cash. Based on this analysis, HLHZ estimated that,
the present value of the net cash liquidation proceeds was reasonably stated in
the range of $8.5 million to $13.4 million or $0.22 to $0.35 per share. premium
to the trading price of E-Stamp's common stock on April 6, 2001, the last
trading day before HLHZ's presentation to the board of directors of E-Stamp,
such liquidation value is less than the value the merger is likely to create for
E-Stamp shareholders.

     In considering the status quo alternative, HLHZ considered E-Stamp common
stock's recent trading price and E-Stamp management's 2001 business plan. On
April 6, 2001, the last trading day before HLHZ's presentation to the board of
directors of E-Stamp, the common stock of E-Stamp was trading at $0.08 per
share. This price reflected a significant discount to the cash on the balance
sheet of E-Stamp, and a discount to its liquidation value (discussed above),
implying a negative value for the operations of E-Stamp. Based on management's
projections for E-Stamp's stand-alone operations and on E-Stamp's recent trading
history, HLHZ determined that under a status quo scenario, it was unlikely that
E-Stamp's common stock would trade at or above its liquidation value in the
foreseeable future. Furthermore, it was likely that E-Stamp would be delisted
from the NASDAQ stock market's national market in a status quo scenario.

     HLHZ has relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that
the financial forecasts and projections provided to them have been reasonably
prepared and reflect the best currently available estimates of the future
financial results and condition of E-Stamp and Learn2, respectively, and that
there

has been no material change in the assets, financial condition, business or
prospects of either E-Stamp or Learn2 since the date of the most recent
financial statements made available to them.

     HLHZ did not independently verify the accuracy and completeness of the
information supplied to them with respect to E-Stamp or Learn2 and did not
assume any responsibility with respect to it. HLHZ has not made any physical
inspection or independent appraisal of any of the properties or assets of
E-Stamp or Learn2. HLHZ's opinion is necessarily based on business, economic,
market and other conditions as they exist and can be evaluated by them at the
date of their letter.

     HLHZ is a nationally recognized investment banking firm with special
expertise in, among other things, valuing businesses and securities and
rendering fairness opinions. HLHZ is continually engaged in the valuation of
businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged
buyouts, private placements of debt and equity, corporate reorganizations,
employee stock ownership plans, corporate and other purposes. E-Stamp selected
HLHZ because of its experience and expertise in performing valuation and
fairness analysis. HLHZ does not beneficially own nor has it ever beneficially
owned any interest in E-Stamp or Learn2.

Fees and Expenses

     Pursuant to an agreement dated March 28, 2001, HLHZ was retained by E-Stamp
to analyze the fairness of the consideration to be received by stockholders of
E-Stamp in connection with the merger, from a financial point of view. E-Stamp
has agreed to pay HLHZ a fee of $400,000 plus its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with the rendering of a fairness opinion.
E-Stamp has further agreed to indemnify HLHZ against certain liabilities and
expenses in connection with the rendering of its services.

INTERESTS OF LEARN2 AND E-STAMP OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE MERGER

     In considering the boards of directors' recommendations that you approve
the merger and the merger agreement, you should note that the officers and
directors have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition
to, your interests. Specifically, as a result of or in connection with the
merger:

     - Robert H. Ewald will be the Chairman of the Board of E-Stamp;

     - Donald Schupak will become Chairman of the Executive Committee of the
       Board of E-Stamp;

     - Learn2 directors Donald Schupak, Stephen P. Gott, S. Lee Kling and James
       A. Cannavino will become directors of E-Stamp;

     - Robert H. Ewald, Marcelo Gumucio, Robert J. Cresci, John V. Balen and
       Rebecca Saeger will continue as directors of E-Stamp after the merger;

     - Learn2 officers Stephen P. Gott and Marc E. Landy will become executive
       officers of E-Stamp;

     - Some stock options of Learn2 officers and directors may become fully
       vested;

     - Learn2 directors and executive officers will have the right to continued
       indemnification and insurance coverage by E-Stamp for acts and omissions
       occurring prior to the merger;

     - Robert H. Ewald and Marcelo Gumucio will continue to receive salaries
       after the merger;

     - The E-Stamp compensation committee intends to recommend to the E-Stamp
       board of directors that loans provided to Robert H. Ewald and Marcelo
       Gumucio, having outstanding balances of approximately $290,000 and
       $90,000, respectively, should be forgiven in their entirety prior to the
       merger, together with a tax gross up on the forgiveness;

     - The E-Stamp compensation committee intends to recommend to the E-Stamp
       board of directors that Robert H. Ewald should be paid a cash bonus upon
       consummation of the merger in an amount to be determined by the board of
       directors prior to the merger; and

     - Stock options exercised through the issuance of notes by Messrs. Schupak,
       Cannavino and Ezrin will be repriced to the amounts already paid upon
       exercise and the notes issued by such directors in the principal amounts
       of $1,194,000, $286,667 and $206,667, respectively, will be cancelled and
       any liens thereunder released.

     Upon the closing of the merger, certain of then outstanding Learn2 stock
options, by their terms, may become vested. However, the board of directors of
Learn2 approved a plan under which each director, officer and employee would be
given the opportunity to exchange their existing stock options for new stock
options with an exercise price of $0.25 per share, subject to a new vesting
scheduled that will be approved by E-Stamp and Learn2.

     Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, each Learn2 employee stock
option outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the merger will be
converted, upon completion of the merger, into an option to acquire, on the same
terms and conditions, the number of shares of E-Stamp common stock that is equal
to the aggregate number of shares of Learn2 shares of common stock for which
such option was exercisable multiplied by the exchange ratio.

     For six years after completion of the merger, E-Stamp will indemnify each
current and former officer or director of Learn2 to the extent required under
Delaware law or Learn2's certificate of incorporation or bylaws in effect
immediately prior to the completion of the merger.

     In addition, Learn2's directors and officers will receive, for a period of
six years after the completion of the merger, directors' and officers' insurance
coverage with terms substantially the same as those of Learn2's existing
directors and officers insurance policy for events occurring on or prior to the
completion of the merger through one of the following mechanisms:

     - a directors and officers insurance policy whose annual premium is not
       greater than 200% of the premium of Learn2's policy in effect on the date
       of the merger agreement; or

     - obtaining "tail" coverage under Learn2's existing directors and officers
       insurance policy.

     As a result, Learn2's and E-Stamp's directors and officers generally could
be more likely to vote to approve the merger and the merger agreement than
Learn2 and E-Stamp stockholders.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

     The following are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
merger to holders of Learn2 common stock who, pursuant to the merger, exchange
their Learn2 common stock for E-Stamp common stock, assuming that the merger is
effected as described in the merger agreement and in this joint proxy
statement-prospectus. This discussion is based on existing provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code, currently applicable Treasury regulations, and current
administrative rulings and court decisions, all of which are subject to change,
possibly with retroactive effect.

     This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax considerations
that may be relevant to you in light of your particular circumstances. Factors
that could alter the tax consequences of the merger to you include:

     - if you are a dealer or trader in securities;

     - if you are subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the
       Internal Revenue Code;

     - if you are not a U.S. citizen or resident;

     - if your functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

     - if you are a tax-exempt organization, financial institution or insurance
       company;

     - if you acquired your shares in connection with stock option or stock
       purchase plans or in other compensatory transactions; or

     - if you hold Learn2 common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, or other
       integrated, risk reduction, constructive sale, or conversion transaction.

     This discussion does not address the tax consequences of an exchange of
options or warrants for Learn2 common stock into options or warrants for E-Stamp
common stock. This discussion assumes you hold your shares of Learn2 common
stock as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal
Revenue Code.

     Neither E-Stamp nor Learn2 will request a ruling from the Internal Revenue
Service or an opinion of counsel in connection with the merger. Learn2 and
E-Stamp believe that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

     The following material federal income tax consequences will result from the
merger's qualification as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code:

     - You will not recognize any gain or loss upon your receipt of E-Stamp
       common stock solely in exchange for your shares of Learn2 common stock in
       the merger.

     - The aggregate tax basis of the E-Stamp common stock received by you as a
       result of the merger will be approximately the same as the aggregate tax
       basis of the Learn2 common stock you surrender in the merger.

     - The holding period of the E-Stamp common stock received by you in the
       merger will include the period during which you held the Learn2 common
       stock exchanged therefor.

     - Learn2 will not recognize gain or loss as a result of the transfer of its
       assets to E-Stamp in the merger solely in exchange for E-Stamp common
       stock.

     - E-Stamp will not recognize gain or loss as a result of the receipt of the
       assets of Learn2 in the merger in exchange for the issuance of its common
       stock.

     If the Internal Revenue Service were to challenge successfully the status
of the merger as a reorganization, the tax consequences to you described above
would not, in general, apply and you would be required to recognize gain or loss
as a result of the merger in an amount equal to the difference between your
basis in your Learn2 common stock and the fair market value, as of the closing
of the merger, of the shares of E-Stamp common stock and any other consideration
that you receive. Learn2 would also be required to recognize gain on the
transfer of its assets to E-Stamp as a result of the merger.

     Even if the merger qualifies as a reorganization, you could recognize gain
to the extent that shares of E-Stamp common stock are considered to be received
in exchange for services or property, other than solely for Learn2 common stock.
All or a portion of such gain may be taxable as ordinary income. You may also
recognize gain to the extent that you are treated as receiving, directly or
indirectly, consideration other than E-Stamp common stock in exchange for your
Learn2 common stock.

     LOSS OF NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS.  Learn2 and E-Stamp expect that
the merger will result in an ownership change of Learn2 under Section 382 of the
Internal Revenue Code. Section 382 contains rules that limit the ability of a
company to offset pre-ownership change net operating losses and credit
carryovers against post-ownership change taxable income. As a result, Learn2's
net operating loss carryforwards (aggregating approximately $100 million as of
December 31, 2000) will be limited for use to offset any income of E-Stamp.
E-Stamp's net operating losses (aggregating approximately $133.6 million as of
December 31, 2000) will be limited now or in the future, depending upon the
transactions involving E-Stamp common stock.

     THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR
DESCRIPTION OF ALL POTENTIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF
THE MERGER. IN PARTICULAR, THE DISCUSSION DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX CONSEQUENCES
WHICH MAY VARY WITH YOUR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES. MOREOVER, THE DISCUSSION DOES
NOT ADDRESS ANY NON-INCOME TAX OR ANY FOREIGN, STATE OR LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES
OF THE MERGER. ACCORDINGLY, WE STRONGLY URGE YOU TO CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR
AS TO THE SPECIFIC UNITED STATES FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN INCOME OR
OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO YOU.

LISTING ON THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET OF E-STAMP COMMON STOCK TO BE ISSUED IN
THE MERGER

     E-Stamp intends to have the shares of E-Stamp common stock to be issued in
the merger approved for listing on the Nasdaq National Market before the
completion of the merger. There can be no assurance, however, that E-Stamp's
common stock will be listed on the Nasdaq National Market at the effective time
of the merger or at any time thereafter. See "Risk Factors -- We May Lose Our
Listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market."

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF LEARN2 COMMON STOCK AFTER THE MERGER

     When the merger is completed, Learn2 common stock will be delisted from the
Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange
Act.

DISSENTERS' RIGHTS

     No dissenters' or appraisal rights are available in connection with the
merger.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     E-Stamp intends to account for the merger as a purchase for financial
reporting and accounting purposes, under accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. After the merger, the results of
operations of Learn2 will be included in the consolidated financial statements
of E-Stamp. The purchase price will be allocated based on the fair values of the
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.

     The cost of the acquisition is expected to be less than the fair value of
the net tangible assets of Learn2 acquired. The deficiency will be allocated
first to reduce proportionately the values assigned to non-current assets.
Should non-current assets be reduced to zero, any remaining deficiency will be
recorded as a deferred credit and amortized to income over the expected period
of benefit.

MARKET PRICE INFORMATION

     The following table sets forth, for the quarters indicated, the high and
low closing prices per share of E-Stamp common stock and Learn2 common stock as
reported on the Nasdaq National Market. E-Stamp common stock began trading on
the Nasdaq National Market on October 8, 1999, and Learn2 common stock began
trading on the Nasdaq National Market on October 20, 1994.

     The foregoing table shows only historical comparisons. These comparisons
may not provide meaningful information to you in determining whether to approve
the merger and the merger agreement. Because the proportion of shares of E-Stamp
to be issued to the holders of Learn2 common stock is fixed,

changes in the market price of E-Stamp common stock will affect the dollar value
of E-Stamp common stock to be received by stockholders of Learn2 in the merger.
Learn2 stockholders are urged to obtain current market quotations for E-Stamp
common stock, and to review carefully the other information contained in this
joint proxy statement-prospectus, prior to considering whether to approve the
merger and the merger agreement.

     As of          , 2001, E-Stamp estimates that there were approximately
               holders of record of E-Stamp common stock. To date, E-Stamp has
not declared or paid dividends on its common stock. The board of directors of
E-Stamp does not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the
foreseeable future.

     As of          , 2001, Learn2 estimates that there were approximately
               holders of record of Learn2 common stock. To date, Learn2 has not
declared or paid dividends on its common stock. The Board of Directors of Learn2
presently intends to retain all earnings for use in Learn2's business and
therefore does not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the
foreseeable future.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The following summary of the merger agreement is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the complete text of the merger agreement, which is incorporated
by reference and attached as Annex I to this joint proxy statement-prospectus.
We urge you to read the full text of the merger agreement.

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS OF E-STAMP AFTER THE MERGER

     At the closing of the merger, the certificate of incorporation and the
bylaws of E-Stamp will remain the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of
the surviving corporation. However, the certificate of incorporation of the
surviving corporation will be amended so that the name of the surviving
corporation shall be Learn2 Corporation.

DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF E-STAMP AFTER THE MERGER

     At the closing of the merger:

     - Robert H. Ewald will be the Chairman of the Board of E-Stamp;

       Board of E-Stamp;

     - Learn2 directors Donald Schupak, Stephen P. Gott, S. Lee Kling and James
       A. Cannavino will become directors of E-Stamp;

CONVERSION OF LEARN2 CAPITAL STOCK

     At the closing of the merger, each share of common stock of Learn2 issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the merger will be automatically converted
into the right to receive the number of shares of E-Stamp common stock
calculated pursuant to the exchange ratio, rounded to the nearest whole share.
No fractional shares of E-Stamp common stock will be issued in the merger. The
exchange ratio will equal the quotient obtained by dividing (i) 99.5% of the
number of outstanding shares of E-Stamp common stock by (ii) the number of
outstanding shares of Learn2 common stock. For purposes of the exchange ratio,
outstanding shares of both E-Stamp and Learn2 common stock will include options
that will be vested as of the closing of the merger and have an exercise price
that is less than or equal to the average closing price of E-Stamp or Learn2
common stock, respectively, for the five consecutive trading days immediately
preceding the E-Stamp or Learn2 special meeting, respectively.

PROCEDURE FOR EXCHANGING LEARN2 COMMON STOCK FOR E-STAMP COMMON STOCK

     The merger agreement requires E-Stamp to designate an exchange agent for
the benefit of holders of shares of Learn2 common stock to hold certificates
representing the shares of E-Stamp common stock to be issued in the merger. When
the merger is completed, the exchange agent will mail to you a letter of
transmittal and instructions for surrendering your Learn2 stock certificates in
exchange for E-Stamp stock certificates and any dividends or distributions that
may be issuable.

LEARN2 OPTIONS

     The merger agreement provides that all options outstanding at the closing
of the merger to purchase shares of Learn2 common stock will be assumed by
E-Stamp and become options to purchase common stock of E-Stamp, subject to
adjustment according to the exchange ratio.

LEARN2 NON-SOLICITATION

     Learn2 has agreed to cease, as of the date of the merger agreement, any and
all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
prior to that date with respect to any "Acquisition Proposal," other than an
offer or proposal from E-Stamp.

     An Acquisition Proposal is any offer to acquire, directly or indirectly,
15% or more of the assets of an entity and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or of the capital stock of an entity, whether by asset sale, tender offer,
exchange offer, merger, consolidation, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction.

     Until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated, Learn2
has agreed that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries directly or indirectly
will:

     - encourage, solicit or facilitate any inquiries or proposals that
       constitute or could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
       Proposal relating to Learn2; or

     - participate in any discussions or negotiations or provide any information
       relating to any Acquisition Proposal relating to Learn2.

     The merger agreement provides that these restrictions shall not prohibit
Learn2 from complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. Moreover, the merger agreement allows Learn2 to
participate in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish information
regarding Learn2 pursuant to a confidentiality agreement to, any person or group
if all of the following conditions are met:

     - the person or group has submitted a superior proposal to Learn2's board
       of directors;

     - neither Learn2 nor any of its representatives or subsidiaries has
       breached the non-solicitation provisions contained in the merger
       agreement in connection with the superior proposal;

     - the board of directors of Learn2 determines in its good faith judgment,
       after consultation with its legal counsel, that taking such action is
       necessary to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and

     - the board of directors of Learn2 provides prior written notice to E-Stamp
       of its decision to participate in negotiations and provide information.

     A superior proposal is any proposal or offer made by a third party to
acquire, directly or indirectly, including pursuant to a sale of assets, tender
offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction, for
consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, more than 50% of the
combined voting power of the capital stock of an entity then outstanding or all
or substantially all of the assets of an entity and otherwise on terms which its
board of directors determines in good faith judgment (after consultation with
its financial advisor), to be more favorable to its stockholders than the merger
and which is not subject to the receipt of any necessary financing or which, in
the good faith judgment of its board of directors, is reasonably capable of
being obtained by such third party.

     Learn2 has agreed to inform E-Stamp orally and in writing promptly of any
Acquisition Proposal relating to Learn2 and any request for non-public
information in connection with an Acquisition Proposal relating to Learn2. The
notice shall include the identity of the person making the proposal, inquiry or
contact as well as the material terms and conditions of such proposal, inquiry
or contact.

     Under the merger agreement, the Learn2 directors are allowed to (i)
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to E-Stamp their recommendation in favor
of the merger, (ii) recommend another Acquisition

Proposal relating to Learn2 or (iii) enter into an agreement with respect to
another Acquisition Proposal if:

     - a superior proposal is made;

     - neither Learn2 nor any of its representatives has breached the
       non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement in connection with
       the superior proposal; and

     - the board of directors provides 2 days' prior written notice to E-Stamp
       of its intent to accept such superior proposal, specifying the material
       terms of the superior proposal and identifying the person making the
       superior proposal.

     Regardless of whether there has been a superior proposal, Learn2 is
obligated under the merger agreement to hold and convene the Learn2 special
meeting of stockholders.

E-STAMP NON-SOLICITATION

     E-Stamp has agreed to cease, as of the date of the merger agreement, any
and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties
conducted prior to that date with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, other
than an offer or proposal from E-Stamp.

     Until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated,
E-Stamp has agreed that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries directly or
indirectly will:

     - encourage, solicit or facilitate any inquiries or proposals that
       constitute or could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
       Proposal relating to E-Stamp; or

     - participate in any discussions or negotiations or provide any information
       relating to any Acquisition Proposal relating to E-Stamp.

     The merger agreement provides that these restrictions shall not prohibit
E-Stamp from complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. Moreover, the merger agreement allows E-Stamp to
participate in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish information
regarding E-Stamp pursuant to a confidentiality agreement to, any person or
group if all of the following conditions are met:

     - the person or group has submitted a superior proposal to E-Stamp's board
       of directors;

     - neither E-Stamp nor any of its representatives or subsidiaries has
       breached the non-solicitation provisions contained in the merger
       agreement in connection with the superior proposal;

     - the board of directors of E-Stamp determines in its good faith judgment,
       after consultation with its legal counsel, that taking such action is
       necessary to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and

     - the board of directors of E-Stamp provides prior written notice to
       E-Stamp of its decision to participate in negotiations and provide
       information.

     E-Stamp has agreed to inform Learn2 orally and in writing promptly of any
Acquisition Proposal relating to E-Stamp and any request for non-public
information in connection with an Acquisition Proposal relating to E-Stamp. The
notice shall include the identity of the person making the proposal, inquiry or
contact as well as the material terms and conditions of such proposal, inquiry
or contact.

     Under the merger agreement, the E-Stamp directors are allowed to (i)
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Learn2 their recommendation in favor
of the merger, (ii) recommend another

Acquisition Proposal relating to E-Stamp or (iii) enter into an agreement with
respect to another Acquisition Proposal if:

     - a superior proposal is made;

     - neither E-Stamp nor any of its representatives has breached the
       non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement in connection with
       the superior proposal; and

     - the board of directors provides 2 days' prior written notice to Learn2 of
       its intent to accept such superior proposal, specifying the material
       terms of the superior proposal and identifying the person making the
       superior proposal.

     Regardless of whether there has been a superior proposal, E-Stamp is
obligated under the merger agreement to hold and convene the E-Stamp special
meeting of stockholders.

REGISTRATION STATEMENT AND PROXY STATEMENT

     E-Stamp and Learn2 have agreed to prepare and cause to be filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement on Form S-4,
including this joint proxy statement-prospectus, and to cooperate and provide
promptly information to each other as required or appropriate for inclusion in
the registration statement.

LEARN2 SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

     Learn2 has agreed to convene a special meeting of Learn2 stockholders as
promptly as practicable after the registration statement on Form S-4 is declared
effective, and to use its reasonable efforts to solicit and secure from its
stockholders at the meeting the adoption and approval of the merger agreement
and the merger, as well as the issuance to the holder of Learn2's $10 million
convertible debenture, prior to the merger, of approximately 26.4 million shares
of Learn2 common stock. Learn2 has also agreed that its board of directors will
recommend that its stockholders vote in favor of and adopt and approve the
merger agreement and the merger, and that this recommendation will not be
withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to E-Stamp, subject to limited
exceptions.

     Nothing in the merger agreement prevents the Learn2 board of directors from
withdrawing or changing its recommendation in favor of the merger if the board
reasonably concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel,
that the failure to so withdraw or change its recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations.

E-STAMP SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

     E-Stamp has agreed to convene a special meeting of E-Stamp stockholders as
promptly as practicable after the registration statement on Form S-4 is declared
effective, and to use its reasonable efforts to solicit and secure from its
stockholders at the meeting (i) the adoption and approval of the merger
agreement and the merger, including changing E-Stamp's name to Learn2
Corporation and (ii) amending its 1999 Stock Plan to increase the number of
shares reserved thereunder. E-Stamp has also agreed that its board of directors
will recommend that its stockholders vote in favor of and adopt and approve the
merger agreement and the merger, and that this recommendation will not be
withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Learn2, subject to limited
exceptions.

     Nothing in the merger agreement prevents the E-Stamp board of directors
from withdrawing or changing its recommendation in favor of the merger if the
board reasonably concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside
counsel, that the failure to so withdraw or change its recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations.

DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INDEMNIFICATION

     For six years after completion of the merger, E-Stamp will indemnify each
current and former officer or director of Learn2 to the extent required under
Delaware law or Learn2's certificate of incorporation or bylaws in effect
immediately prior to the completion of the merger.

     In addition, Learn2's directors and officers will receive, for a period of
six years after the completion of the merger, directors' and officers' insurance
coverage with terms substantially the same as those of Learn2's existing
directors and officers insurance policy for events occurring on or prior to the
completion of the merger through one of the following mechanisms:

     - a directors and officers insurance policy whose annual premium is not
       greater than 200% of the premium of Learn2's policy in effect on the date
       of the merger agreement; or

     - obtaining "tail" coverage under Learn2's existing directors and officers
       insurance policy.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT MATTERS

     Following the merger and for one year thereafter, E-Stamp will provide
Learn2 employees and its subsidiaries' employees with benefits plans and
arrangements that are substantially similar, in the aggregate, to those of
Learn2 as in effect immediately prior to the merger, other than with respect to
benefits not available to E-Stamp employees.

     Following the merger, each continuing employee will, to the extent
permitted by applicable law and the applicable third party provider, receive
service credit for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but not
for benefit accrual purposes) for employee benefit plan purposes for service to
Learn2 or its subsidiaries prior to the merger.

                               RELATED AGREEMENTS

THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, E-Stamp loaned Learn2 $2 million on April
25, 2001. In connection with this loan, Learn2 issued to E-Stamp a $2 million
convertible promissory note that bears interest at 10% per annum.

     Maturity Date. The principal amount of the note, together with all accrued
and unpaid interest on the note, is due and payable on April 30, 2002. The note
provides that upon the occurrence of specified events of default, E-Stamp may
accelerate the maturity date of the note. In addition to customary events of
default relating to failure to pay the note when due and bankruptcy proceedings,
the note provides that E-Stamp may declare the principal and accrued and unpaid
interest on the note:

     - immediately due and payable if a default or event of default occurs under
       Learn2's $10 million convertible debenture, which default is not waived
       or cured within any applicable grace period, and which results in the
       acceleration of the maturity date of Learn2's $10 million convertible
       debenture;

     - immediately due and payable if the Learn2 board of directors withdraws,
       modifies or changes in a manner adverse to E-Stamp its approval or
       recommendation of the merger agreement or the merger, or recommends an
       acquisition proposal, as defined in the merger agreement, relating to
       Learn2 with any person other than E-Stamp;

     - immediately due and payable if Learn2 executes an agreement in principle
       or definitive agreement relating to an acquisition proposal, as defined
       in the merger agreement, relating to Learn2 with any person other than
       E-Stamp; and

     - due and payable sixty days after the termination of the merger agreement
       if Learn2 breaches any representation, warranty, covenant or other
       agreement contained in the merger agreement, which breach results in a
       material adverse effect, as defined in the merger agreement, on Learn2
       and cannot or has not been cured within fifteen days after the giving of
       written notice by E-Stamp to Learn2, and which results in E-Stamps
       termination of the merger agreement.

     Conversion Features. The note issued to E-Stamp is convertible into 2,000
shares of Series E preferred stock of Learn2. These shares of Learn2 Series E
preferred stock are convertible into Learn2 common stock at any time following
the termination of the merger agreement. These 2,000 shares of Learn2 Series E
preferred stock are initially convertible into an aggregate of 8,000,000 shares
of Learn2 common stock.

     After the earlier of (1) September 30, 2001, or any later date specified in
any amendment to the merger agreement after which either E-Stamp or Learn2 may
terminate the merger agreement if the merger has not occurred by that date, or
(2) the termination of the merger agreement as a result of the failure of Learn2
stockholders to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger or as a result
of

Learn2's breach of the merger agreement or the documents related to the merger
agreement, the conversion ratio shall be adjusted such that each share of Learn2
Series E preferred stock shall be convertible into that number of shares of
Learn2 common stock determined by dividing $1,000 by the lesser of (1) $0.25 and
(2) the average closing sales price of the Learn2 common stock for the five
trading days immediately prior to the date of conversion. However, the
conversion ratio shall not be adjusted to a ratio that requires approval of
Learn2 stockholders under any applicable law or rule, including the rules of The
Nasdaq Stock Market, until such approval, or exemption therefrom shall have been
obtained by Learn2.

     On all matters submitted to a vote of Learn2 stockholders, each share of
Learn2 Series E preferred stock is entitled to the same number of votes as the
number of shares of Learn2 common stock into which such share of Learn2 Series E
preferred stock is then convertible.

     Restrictions on Transfer. The note and the shares of Learn2 Series E
preferred stock issuable upon the conversion of the note are not transferable
prior to the termination of the merger agreement.

     Registration Rights. E-Stamp is entitled to rights with respect to the
registration under the Securities Act of the shares of Learn2 common stock
issuable to E-Stamp upon conversion of the Learn2 Series E preferred stock
issuable upon conversion of the note. These rights are provided under the terms
of a registration rights agreement between Learn2 and E-Stamp entered into in
connection with the issuance of the note. Learn2 has agreed to register such
shares for public resale by filing a registration statement with the SEC within
120 days after termination of the merger agreement. Learn2 has also agreed to
keep the foregoing registration statement effective at all times until such
shares of Learn2 common stock have been sold or such shares may, in the
reasonable opinion of E-Stamp's counsel, may be immediately sold to the public
without registration or restriction, including without any volume limitations.
Furthermore, in the event Learn2 elects to register any of its shares of common
stock for purposes of effecting any public offering, E-Stamp is entitled to
include the shares of Learn2 common stock issued upon conversion of the Learn2
Series E preferred stock in the registration, but Learn2 may reduce the number
of shares proposed to be registered in view of market conditions. The
registration rights agreement also provides that E-Stamp has specified rights to
require that Learn2 list the Learn2 shares acquired by E-Stamp upon conversion
of the note on The Nasdaq Stock Market or other national securities exchange or
trading system on which shares of Learn2's common stock are listed for trading
or quotation.

LETTER AGREEMENT

     The following summary of the letter agreement is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the complete text of the letter agreement, which is incorporated
by reference and included as an exhibit to the registration statement of which
this joint proxy statement-prospectus forms a part. We urge you to read the full
text of the letter agreement.

     In connection with the merger agreement, Learn2 and E-Stamp entered into a
letter agreement. The letter agreement provides that Learn2, and not E-Stamp,
shall be the surviving corporation in the merger if prior to the record date for
the E-Stamp special meeting:

     - E-Stamp's common stock is delisted from The Nasdaq National Market; and

     - Learn2's common stock continues to be listed on The Nasdaq National
       Market on such date.

     Although under the limited circumstances described above, Learn2, and not
E-Stamp, would be the surviving corporation in the merger, the exchange ratio in
the merger would continue to provide for Learn2 stockholders (including the
holder of Learn2's $10 million convertible debenture) immediately prior to the
merger to hold approximately 49.9%, and for E-Stamp stockholders immediately
prior to the merger to hold approximately 50.1%, of the combined company. The
other terms of the merger agreement, including the provisions governing the
composition of the board of directors of the surviving corporation, would remain
in effect except that E-Stamp and Learn2 have agreed to amend the merger
agreement as necessary to reflect Learn2 as the surviving corporation of the
merger should the circumstances described above occur.

LOCK-UP AGREEMENTS OF E-STAMP DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS FOLLOWING THE
MERGER

     E-Stamp and Learn2 each intend for the persons who will serve as executive
officers and directors of E-Stamp following the merger to enter into lock-up
agreements restricting those persons' ability to dispose of E-Stamp common
stock. Generally, these lock-up agreements will prohibit the sale of E-Stamp
common stock for the six months following the merger and will impose specified
limitations on sales occurring after such six month period and prior to the one
year anniversary of the merger. RGC's agreement to similar trading limitations
on the shares of E-Stamp common stock it will receive in the merger is
contingent upon each person who will serve as an executive officer or director
of E-Stamp following the merger entering into these lock-up agreements. However,
we cannot assure you that each of these persons will enter into a lock-up
agreement. In the event that any of these persons do not agree to a lock-up
agreement, the contractual restrictions on RGC's ability to sell E-Stamp common
stock received by RGC in the merger will terminate.

VOTING AGREEMENTS

The following summary of the voting agreements is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the complete text of the voting agreements, which are incorporated
by reference and attached as annexes II and III to this joint proxy
statement-prospectus. We urge you to read the full text of the voting
agreements.

     In connection with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement,
Learn2 entered into a voting agreement with each of the executive officers and
directors of E-Stamp, and E-Stamp entered into a voting agreement with each of
the executive officers and directors of Learn2.

     Under these voting agreements, each of the executive officers and directors
of E-Stamp and Learn2 agreed to vote all their shares of E-Stamp and Learn2
common stock in favor of the merger and adoption of the merger agreement,
against approval or adoption of resolutions or actions which would cause the
conditions to closing of the merger, as set forth in the merger agreement, not
to be satisfied and against other specified matters. The executive officers and
directors of E-Stamp and Learn2 may vote their shares of E-Stamp and Learn2
common stock on all other matters.

     As of the record date for the E-Stamp special meeting, the E-Stamp
executive officers and directors owned shares of E-Stamp common stock
representing approximately      % of the total voting power of the outstanding
shares of E-Stamp common stock.

     As of the record date for the Learn2 special meeting, the Learn2 executive
officer and directors owned shares of Learn2 common stock representing
approximately      % of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of
Learn2 common stock.

     The voting agreements generally prohibit the executive officers and
directors of E-Stamp and Learn2 from selling, transferring, pledging,
encumbering, assigning or otherwise disposing of any shares of E-Stamp common
stock, except to a person who agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of the
voting agreement and except for transfers that do not prevent the stockholder
from performing his or her obligations under the voting agreements.

     The voting agreements terminate upon the earlier to occur of the completion
of the merger and the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its
terms.

 1. BASIS OF PRO FORMA PRESENTATION

     On April 19, 2001, E-Stamp and Learn2 entered into a merger agreement
whereby each outstanding share of Learn2 common stock will be converted into
approximately 0.478 shares of E-Stamp common stock. Each outstanding option and
warrant to purchase shares of Learn2 common stock will be assumed using the
0.478 ratio. Completion of the merger is conditioned upon the affirmative vote
of both companies' stockholders, among other conditions. E-Stamp expects to
issue approximately 38 million shares of common stock in the merger. The actual
number of shares of E-Stamp common stock to be issued will be determined on the
effective date of the merger based on the number of shares of Learn2 and E-Stamp
common stock actually outstanding on such date. Actual shares outstanding also
includes the number of outstanding stock options of E-Stamp and Learn2 that will
be vested as of the closing of the merger and have an exercise price that is
less than or equal to the average closing price of E-Stamp or Learn2 common
stock, respectively, for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding
the E-Stamp or Learn2 special meeting, respectively. E-Stamp is expected to
account for the merger under the purchase method of accounting.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 2000 combines E-Stamp and Learn2 consolidated financial statements
at December 31, 2000 as if the merger had been consummated on that date. The
unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated statement of operations for
the year ended December 31, 2000 gives effect to the proposed merger of E-Stamp
and Learn2, as if the transaction had been consummated on January 1, 2000.

 2. PRELIMINARY PURCHASE PRICE

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial
statements reflect an estimated purchase price of approximately $18.5 million,
measured using the closing market price of E-Stamp's common stock on the date
the merger was signed, plus the assumed liabilities, and other costs directly
related to the merger as follows (in thousands):

     Purchase price calculation:

Total E-Stamp shares outstanding...........................   38,151
E-Stamp common stock per share market value................  $  0.17

  merger...................................................    6,454

                                                             =======

     The final purchase price allocation, determined upon the closing of the
merger, will be dependent on the actual number of shares of common stock
exchanged, the actual number of options and warrants assumed, actual liabilities
assumed, and actual acquisition related costs. For purposes of presenting the
pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements the allocation is
based upon Learn2's December 31, 2000 consolidated balance sheet which reflects
a valuation of certain non-current assets performed by an independent appraiser
at that date.

              COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
                                 (IN THOUSANDS)

     The following table sets forth the fair value of assets acquired:

Net current assets.........................................  $10,532
Non-current assets:
  Fixed assets.............................................    4,981
  Capitalized software.....................................   14,915
  Other identifiable intangible assets.....................    5,011
  Other non-current assets.................................      539

Total non-current assets                                      25,446

Total......................................................  $35,978
                                                             =======

     The fair value of the net assets acquired of $35,978, exceeded the purchase
price of $18,504, resulting in negative goodwill of $17,474. As a result, the
negative goodwill will be allocated to reduce proportionately the values
assigned to the $25,446 of non-current assets acquired. The preliminary
allocation is as follows:

 3. EFFECTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

     E-Stamp expects to have discontinued all of its existing business
operations prior to the completion of the merger. Accordingly the impact of
these discontinued operations has been excluded in the determination of net loss
from continuing operations.

     E-Stamp's historical balance sheet at December 31, 2000 has been adjusted
to reflect these discontinued operations as if the merger took place on that
date. The remaining assets and liabilities are those E-Stamp believes will
continue.

     (1) Represents the write-down of fixed assets totaling $5.5 million.

     (2) Represents the write-down of goodwill totaling $2.9 million

     (3) Represents the write-down of intangible assets totaling $1.9 million

     (4) Represents the total charge of the write-downs of fixed assets,
         intangible assets, and goodwill, totaling $10.2 million.

     (5) Represents estimated general and administrative expenses that will
         continue after the merger.

 4. PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

Balance Sheet

     The accompanying unaudited pro form combined condensed consolidated balance
sheet as of December 31, 2000 combines the balance sheets of E-Stamp and Learn2
as if the merger was completed on that date and reflects the following pro forma
adjustments:

          (a) As a result of the allocation of negative goodwill to Learn2's
     fixed assets, the net book carrying value at December 31, 2000 of $5.0
     million was reduced by $3.4 million to $1.6 million.

          (b) As a result of the allocation of negative goodwill to Learn2's
     capitalized software, the net book carrying value at December 31, 2000 of
     $14.9 million was reduced by $10.2 million to the fair value of $4.7
     million.

          (c) As a result of the allocation of negative goodwill to Learn2's
     intangible assets, the net book carrying value at December 31, 2000 of $5.0
     million was reduced by $3.4 million to the fair value of $1.6 million.

          (d) As a result of the allocation of negative goodwill to Learn2's
     other assets, the carrying value at December 31, 2000 of $539,000 was
     reduced by $369,000 to the fair value of $170,000.

          (e) To eliminate Learn2 historical goodwill.

          (f) To record estimated direct merger costs of approximately $3.6
     million to be incurred.

          (g) In connection with the merger, prior to the closing of the merger,
     Learn2's $10 million 6% convertible debenture will be retired through the
     exchange of the debenture for shares of Learn2 common stock and the payment
     of $1.0 million, which will represent accrued interest through the actual
     closing of the merger. Therefore, for pro forma purposes, the convertible
     debenture and related accrued interest expense of $9.3 million and
     $485,000, respectively were eliminated.

          (h) To reduce deferred revenue to its fair market value.

          (i) To eliminate the historical equity of Learn2 and record the
     E-Stamp shares issued in the merger. Subject to the closing of the merger,
     stock options issued to three of Learn2's board members will be repriced to
     the amounts already paid and the promissory notes issued by such directors
     to Learn2 in the aggregate principal amount of $1.7 million in connection
     with the exercise of the options, will be cancelled and any liens
     thereunder released.

Statement of Operations

     The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated
statement of operations has been prepared as if the proposed merger of E-Stamp
and Learn2 was completed as of January 1, 2000 and reflects the following pro
forma adjustments:

          (j) To eliminate amortization of Learn2 historical goodwill totaling
     $1.3 million.

          (k) As a result of the purchase accounting allocation, the carrying
     values of fixed assets, capitalized software, and intangible assets, for
     pro forma purposes, depreciation and amortization expense related to those
     assets was reduced by $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.

          (l) As a result of the elimination of Learn2's convertible debenture,
     for pro forma purposes interest expense was reduced by $755,000 for the
     year ended December 31, 2000.

          (m) To eliminate the write-off of Learn2 goodwill and intangibles of
     $17.9 million.

                        NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA
              COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
                                 (IN THOUSANDS)

          (n) Reflects issuance by E-Stamp of approximately 38 million shares of
     common stock in connection with the merger. Shares used to calculate
     unaudited pro forma loss per share exclude the anti-dilutive effect of
     E-Stamp's options including options assumed in the merger.

     The current plan for the combined company is to either terminate or
sublease within the terms of the agreement, its lease on its Mountain View, CA
facility. No adjustments have been made to the pro forma financial statements as
it relates to the resolution of this lease. E-Stamp historical financial
statements reflect rent expense of approximately $4.0 million related to this
lease. Also, as a result of the merger, the combined company plans to take a
restructuring charge of approximately $1.0 to $2.0 million.

                  LEARN2 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

     Through Learn2's subsidiary, eTracks.com, Inc., Learn2 provides permission

customer lists. etracks' services include e-mail creation, delivery, tracking
and response analysis for a high volume of client e-mail accounts in a short

The demand for permission e-mail marketing and tracking services has increased
over the past few years and Learn2 expects that the demand will continue to grow
for the foreseeable future. Learn2 believes that eTracks' technology enables
more robust and useful tracking capabilities than its competitors'.

     Learn2's goal is to become the world's leading provider of engaging
e-learning products and services. To achieve this goal, Learn2 expects to focus
on its four primary objectives: creating a trusted brand, developing and owning
creative and engaging content, enhancing its patented state-of-the-art
technologies and offering services to meet the needs of its clients. In 1999,
Learn2 changed its company name from 7th Level, Inc. to Learn2.com, Inc. Learn2
made the change to create a single recognized brand that more closely aligned
Learn2's corporate identity with its product and service offerings.

HISTORY

     Learn2 was founded in 1993 with the goal of becoming a leading developer
and publisher of interactive entertainment and educational content as well as a
creator of state-of-the-art tools and technologies. In 1998, Learn2's research
and development activities were focused primarily on developing and enhancing
its agent technology. In early 1999, Learn2 recognized that appropriate
applications of this technology were in the delivery of training and learning
and therefore Learn2 abandoned its interactive entertainment business and
focused its efforts on e-learning.

     In 1999, to strengthen its position in the e-learning marketplace, Learn2
acquired three companies that enhanced its brand, content, technologies and
services capabilities: Street Technologies, Inc., a

privately held company that developed and marketed technology-based training
solutions delivered over intranets and the Internet utilizing a patented
streaming technology and provided custom service capabilities; Panmedia
Corporation, a privately held company that produced www.Learn2.com, a popular
Website that offered step-by-step instructions on skills, activities and tasks;
and ViaGrafix Corporation, a publicly traded company which developed, produced
and marketed technology-based training tutorials delivered on CD-ROMs and video
tapes as well as computer aided design or CAD software. The CAD product line was
sold in March 2000. Through eTracks, ViaGrafix also provided permission e-mail
broadcast solutions and conducted e-commerce. These acquisitions provided Learn2
with the Learn2 brand, and a stronger mix of content, technologies and service
offerings.

     As set forth in Note 4 to Learn2's consolidated financial statements,
Learn2 reported results of operations for all periods prior to August 23, 1999
do not reflect the results of ViaGrafix and prior to February 16, 1999 do not
reflect the results of Street Technologies, Inc. Consequently, the results prior
to these dates and Learn2's consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 1998 are
not reflective of its operations and financial position as presently
constituted.

     Effective January 1, 2000, Learn2 has adopted Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
101 "Revenue Recognition In Financial Statements." SAB No. 101 expresses the
views of the Securities and Exchange Commission in applying accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States to certain revenue
recognition issues.

     Learn2's adoption of SAB No. 101 resulted in a change in method of
accounting for cooperative advertising expenses. In accordance with previously
existing accounting principles, Learn2 recorded cooperative advertising expenses
as a sales and marketing expense. During 2000, as a result of new
interpretations of generally accepted accounting principles by the SEC through
the issuance of SAB No. 101, Learn2 was required to change the accounting policy
for cooperative advertising, to record these expenses as a reduction of gross
revenues.

     The effect of the adoption of SAB No. 101 was to decrease both revenues and
sales and marketing expenses by $3.5 million. SAB No. 101 has been adopted as a
change in accounting principle, effective January 1, 2000. The adoption of SAB
No. 101 resulted in no change to current or previously reported earnings, as
this was a reclassification between revenue and sales and marketing expenses.
Learn2 has restated its results for the first three quarters of the year ended
December 31, 2000, as reflected in Quarterly Financial Data on page 86. Pro
forma amounts assuming the new revenue recognition method is applied on a pro
forma basis for the year ended December 31, 1999 was a decrease to both net
revenues and sales and marketing expenses by $1.3 million.

SOURCES OF REVENUE AND REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY

     Learn2 generates revenue primarily from the sales and licensing of computer
software training products and technologies, product development agreements, and
broadcast messaging services.

     Revenue from software license agreements is recognized in accordance with
the provisions of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement
of Position No. 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition." Software product sales
under such license agreements are recognized as revenue upon shipment of the
products to customers, provided that there are no significant vendor obligations
and collection of the related receivable is probable. In circumstances whereby
Learn2 has established vendor specific objective evidence, Learn2 accounts for
insignificant vendor obligations and post-contract support over the service
period.

     Revenue from on-line sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exits, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or
determinable and collectibility is probable. Learn2 defers a portion, generally
10% of the selling price of on-line products for hosting and recognizes that
hosting ratably over the contractual period. Learn2 recognizes the two
components, the software, (or training course) and the service (or hosting)
based on their relative fair values.

     Revenue from physical product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence
of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or
determinable and collectibility is probable. Generally, these criteria are met
at the time product is shipped. A reserve is made at the time the related
revenue is recognized for estimated product returns based on history,
cooperative advertising, or other promotions which may occur under programs
Learn2 has with its customers.

     Revenues from broadcast messaging transactions are recognized at the time
the broadcast is sent, as Learn2 has no further significant obligations.

     Many of Learn2's costs are fixed and are based on anticipated revenue
levels. Learn2 may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any
unexpected revenue shortfall. If Learn2 has a shortfall in revenues in relation
to expenses, or if expenses continue to exceed revenues, then Learn2's results
of operations and financial condition would be affected materially and
adversely. Learn2 expects to incur losses on a quarterly and annual basis for
the foreseeable future, however Learn2 believes it has adequate resources to
realize Learn2's business plan.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     Revenues and gross profits for 2000 increased over 1999 primarily as the
result of the inclusion of the full year of revenues from Learn2's acquisition
of ViaGrafix in 1999. Revenues and gross profits also increased as a result of
volume increases in corporate training revenue and revenue associated with
Learn2's custom business. Operating expenses increased to $53.5 million from
$51.5 million in 1999, and included $17.9 million in goodwill and other
intangible asset impairments, $6.1 million in fixed and intangible asset
amortization, and $600,000 in non-recurring charges in 2000. Operating expenses
for 1999 included the write-off of acquired in-process technology of $24.8
million, fixed and intangible asset amortization of $3.3 million, restructuring
charges of $3.3 million, and non-recurring costs of $300,000. Net loss including
these charges was $38.0 million in 2000 as compared to $41.0 million in 1999.

2000 COMPARED TO 1999

LEARNING SERVICES

     Learning Services revenues primarily consist of corporate learning
products, technologies and services sold or distributed through the Internet and
of physical products sold online, to online merchants and through traditional
retail channels. Cost of revenues consists of the expenses associated with the
production and shipment of Learn2's physical products, costs related to develop
custom courses, for specific customers and content royalties.

     Revenues for Learning Services increased $6.2 million or 53.0% to $17.9
million for 2000 from $11.7 million for 1999. The gross profit for Learning
Services was approximately 75.2% of revenues for 2000 and approximately 80.3% of
revenues for 1999. In 2000, as a result of the adoption of SAB 101, cooperative
advertising expenses of $3.5 million were recorded as a reduction of gross
revenue.

     For 2000, these revenues consisted of corporate learning products,
technologies and services sold, licensed or distributed through the Internet of
approximately $9.2 million, physical learning products sold

online, to online merchants and through traditional retail channels of
approximately $7.6 million, software sales related to Learn2's CAD product line
(sold in March 2000) of approximately $400,000 and other revenue of

legacy revenues of approximately $1.7 million. The 1999 revenues include revenue
from the operations acquired in the ViaGrafix acquisition that relate to
Learn2's Learning Services segment from August 23, 1999. Gross profit fluctuated
from year to year as a result of differences in the composition of revenues.

BROADCAST MESSAGING SERVICES

     Broadcast Messaging Services consists primarily of permission e-mail
marketing and tracking services and e-commerce. Cost of revenues consists of the
expenses associated with the delivery of permission e-mail and tracking
services, including Internet access and personnel related costs incurred to
operate Learn2's marketing and tracking services and cost of merchandise sold
through its e-commerce operations.

     Revenues for Broadcast Messaging Services increased $2.3 million or 115.8%

Website and product design. The 2000 amount includes the research and product
development expenses of ViaGrafix and Street Technologies, Inc., whereas the
1999 amounts include the results of ViaGrafix from August 23, 1999 and the
results of Street Technologies, Inc. from February 16, 1999. The overall
increase is attributable primarily to costs associated with the production and
development of multimedia content.

     Learn2 believes that investment in research and product development is
required to remain competitive. Therefore, Learn2 anticipates continued spending
for research and product development in future periods.

Sales and Marketing

     For 2000, sales and marketing expenses were $12.1 million compared to $10.5
million 1999. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries,

February 16, 1999. The 1999 amount also includes cooperative advertising of
approximately $1.3 million which effective January 1, 2000 has been accounted
for as a reduction of gross revenues. The overall increase is attributable
primarily to increased sales and marketing personnel, costs for print media and
other product related advertising.

     Sales and marketing expenses may increase in future periods in our
continued effort to achieve growth in revenue and as Learn2 introduces new
products.

Restructuring Charges

     Restructuring charges incurred for 1999 were approximately $3.3 million and
related to Learn2's business combinations with Street Technologies, Inc. and
ViaGrafix Corporation of approximately $2.3 million and $1.0 million,

to the write-off of redundant assets, $551,000 related to excess office space
and other costs and $1.4 million in employee severance costs.

Non-recurring Costs

     During the second quarter of 2000, Learn2 completed the integration of the
ViaGrafix and Panmedia mergers which began in 1999. As a result, Learn2 recorded
a non-recurring charge of approximately $641,000 primarily for severance. During
the second quarter of 1999, Learn2 completed its merger with Panmedia
Corporation. Learn2 recorded a non-recurring charge of approximately $277,000
for transaction costs associated with the merger.

Acquired In-process Technology

     In 1999, in connection with Learn2's acquisitions of Street Technologies,
Inc., and ViaGrafix, Learn2 allocated approximately $9.7 million and $15.1
million of their respective purchase prices to acquired in-process technology.
Accordingly these cost were expensed as of the acquisition date. Amounts
allocated to acquired in-process technology relate to projects that had not yet
reached technological feasibility and that, until completion of development, had
no alternative future use. The technologies acquired required substantial
additional development.

Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

     As a result of the operating losses incurred by ViaGrafix, Learn2 reviewed
the recoverability of the goodwill and other intangible assets associated with
its acquisition of ViaGrafix in accordance with its accounting policy for
long-lived assets. Based on an analysis of projected undiscounted cash flows,
Learn2 determined that the carrying value of such goodwill and other intangible
assets was impaired. Accordingly, Learn2 engaged an outside appraiser to assist
with the analysis and based upon the resulting valuation, Learn2 recognized
approximately $17.9 million in impairment charges. The impairment charge was
comprised of approximately $8.9 million of goodwill, $8.5 million of intangible
assets, and $500,000 of capitalized software. The impairment charges are equal
to the difference between the carrying amount of these assets and the estimated
fair value at December 31, 2000.

Interest Expense

     Interest expense was approximately $994,000 for 2000 compared to $146,000

and was attributable to the factors discussed above.

1999 COMPARED TO 1998

     1999 revenues and gross profits increased over 1998 primarily as the result
of the inclusion of the revenues from our acquisitions of Street Technologies
from February 16, 1999 and ViaGrafix from August 23, 1999. Total operating
expenses increased to $51.5 million from $10.1 million in 1998, and included the

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     On April 19, 2001, Learn2 reached an agreement to merger with E-Stamp.
Assuming satisfaction of certain conditions, including receipt of the requisite
stockholder approval, the merger is expected to be consummated in the third
quarter of 2001. Completion of the merger is expected to enhance Learn2's
ability to finance its growth as cash flow and capital markets access of the
combined companies will be greater than prior to the merger. In the event that
the proposed merger with E-Stamp is not consummated, Learn2 believes it will
have sufficient resources for its operating requirements and sufficient
resources to realize its current business plan.

     Since inception Learn2 has financed its operations primarily through
private placements of equity and debt securities and public offerings of
Learn2's common stock. To date, Learn2 continues to use cash and operate at a
loss. Learn2's ability to achieve positive cash flow depends upon a variety of
factors, including the timely introduction and market success of our products,
the costs of developing, producing and marketing these products, adoption of the
Internet as a medium of commerce and delivery of services, and various other
factors, some of which may be beyond Learn2's control. Learn2 is making a
substantial investment in its business and may need to raise additional funds.
In the event that Learn2 needs to raise additional funds Learn2 may not be
successful nor can it predict the terms under which such funds would be
available. If additional funds are not available Learn2 may not be able to meet
its on-going expense unless it changes its business plan, sell non-strategic
assets, curtail expenditures, and/or employ other strategies as required in
these circumstances.

     Net cash used in operating activities was $14.6 million. Cash used in
operating activities resulted primarily from Learn2's net loss and an overall
decrease in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by increases from
non-cash charges. Non-cash charges primarily include the impairment of goodwill
and other intangible assets and depreciation and amortization of fixed and
intangible assets.

     Net cash used in investing activities was $123,000 and consists primarily
of proceeds of $1.6 million from the sale of assets and $902,000 from the sale
of short-term investments, offset by capital expenditures of approximately $2.1
million and capitalized development costs of $602,000.

     Net cash provided by financing activities was $12.3 million and consists of
proceeds of $10.0 million from the issuance of a convertible debenture (as
described below) and $2.3 million from the issuance of common stock under stock
option plans. As of December 31, 2000, Learn2 had $4.8 million of cash and cash
equivalents. As of December 31, 2000, our commitments consisted primarily of
obligations under operating leases. Learn2 has no material commitments for
capital expenditures. Additionally, Learn2 will continue to evaluate possible
acquisitions of complementary products and technologies, which may require the
use of cash.

     On March 10, 2000, Learn2 entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with
RGC International Investors LDC and pursuant thereto it issued a $10.0 million
6% convertible debenture to RGC due March 10, 2003. The debenture is convertible
at any time at the option of the holder at a conversion price of $0.41 per share
(as reset on March 10, 2001). In connection with the reset on March 10, 2001,
Learn2 will record additional interest expense as a result of the reduction of
the original conversion price from $6.00 to $0.41 during the first quarter of
2001. The debenture is subject to anti-dilution provisions. Under certain
conditions, the debenture automatically converts after one year. The conversion
price of the debenture may also be reset to the market value of our common stock
on the second anniversary of the convertible debenture if the price of Learn2's
common stock declines below $0.41 on the second anniversary. In addition, RGC
was granted a five-year warrant to purchase 337,268 shares of Learn2 common
stock exercisable at $7.41 per share. The value of this warrant has been
recorded as a debt discount and is being amortized over the life of the related
debt.

     On April 13, 2001, RGC executed a waiver agreeing not to exercise any of
its rights under the debenture to declare an event of default or convert the
debenture with certain exceptions as provided in the waiver; provided that
Learn2 files a registration statement by July 31, 2001 covering the shares of
Learn2 common stock issuable to RGC under the debenture following the reset of
the conversion price of the debenture. In connection with the merger, E-Stamp,
Learn2 and RGC entered into an agreement dated April 19, 2001 to provide for the
redemption and termination of the debenture upon the consummation of the merger.
Immediately prior to the consummation of the merger, Learn2 will redeem the
debenture (including all outstanding principal and interest thereunder), and RGC
will surrender the debenture, in exchange for, the payment by E-Stamp to RGC of
$1 million and the issuance of approximately 26.4 million shares of Learn2
common stock.

                E-STAMP MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The following discussion of the financial condition and results of
operations of E-Stamp should be read in conjunction with the E-Stamp's
consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those financial
statements included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement-prospectus. This
document contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in
these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but
not limited to, those set forth under "Risk Factors" beginning on page 13 and
elsewhere in this joint proxy statement-prospectus.

OVERVIEW

     E-Stamp's original business model was to provide an Internet postage
service that enabled users to conveniently purchase, download and print Internet
postage directly from their personal computers without the need to maintain a
persistent Internet connection. In 2000, E-Stamp substantially changed its focus
to business users.

     On April 19, 2001, E-Stamp agreed to acquire Learn2. E-Stamp is in the
process of discontinuing its existing transportation management solutions
business.

     In May 2000, E-Stamp acquired two logistics companies, Infinity Logistics
Corporation and Automated Logistics Corp. These companies offered transportation
management and warehouse management solutions to allow enterprise customers to
review carrier rates and shipping options, select a carrier, print shipping
labels, track shipments and create shipping reports.

     During 2000, E-Stamp undertook two corporate restructurings. In July 2000,
E-Stamp restructured its organization to focus on the development, marketing and
sales of its transportation management solutions and reduce its emphasis on its
Internet postage business. In November 2000, E-Stamp restructured the
organization to phase out its Internet postage business. E-Stamp incurred
charges of approximately $20.3 million related to these restructurings. In
connection with the phase-out of the Internet postage business, E-Stamp allowed
customers to return certain items purchased since September 1, 2000 for a full
refund. As a result, it did not recognize revenue on any Internet postage
shipments in the fourth quarter of 2000.

     E-Stamp has incurred net losses in each quarterly and annual period since
E-Stamp's inception and as of December 31, 2000, E-Stamp had accumulated
aggregate losses of $188.7 million. The quarter ended September 30, 1999 was the
first quarter in which E-Stamp generated revenues. Until the acquisition of
Infinity Logistics Corporation and Automated Logistics Corp. in May 2000, all of
its revenues were generated by the Internet postage business. In November 2000,
E-Stamp announced that it was phasing-out its Internet postage business and
ceased recognizing revenue on Internet postage shipments as of October 1, 2000.
E-Stamp currently generate revenues from the sale of its transportation
management and warehouse management solutions and associated hardware and
software and from maintenance and service contracts. Revenues from
transportation management and warehouse management solutions are generally
recognized upon shipment of the associated hardware and software. Revenues from
software license fees are recognized in accordance with AICPA Statement of
Position ("SOP") 97-2 and SOP 98-9 when the software has been delivered,
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, collection is probable, the fee is
fixed or determinable and no significant obligations remain. When significant
obligations remain after the products are delivered, revenues are recognized
only after these obligations are fulfilled. Service and maintenance revenues are
recognized ratably over the contractual period or as the services are provided.
Prior to phasing out its Internet postage business, E-Stamp generated revenues
for its Internet postage products from software license fees, ongoing
convenience fees for the purchase of postage over the Internet, and the sale of
ancillary postage supplies and technology license fees.

     In connection with phasing out the Internet postage business, E-Stamp
allowed customers to return certain items purchased since September 1, 2000 for
a full refund. Consequently E-Stamp did not

recognize revenues on any Internet postage shipments in the fourth quarter of
2000. Software license fees for our Internet postage products were amounts paid
by end-users for a perpetual license to our software. E-Stamp's software package
allowed the end-user to apply for a USPS license. When E-Stamp was notified that
the USPS had approved the license, E-Stamp shipped a secure Internet postage
storage device, which was necessary for the use of its software, to the
end-user. Revenues from software license fees were recognized in accordance with
SOP 97-2 and SOP 98-9. Revenues from software license fees were recognized when
delivery of the secure Internet postage storage device and the software were
complete, when persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed, collection was
probable, the fee was fixed or determinable and no significant obligations
remained.

     Technology license fees represented revenues earned from original equipment
manufacturers, which incorporated our Internet postage technology into their
product. Technology license fee revenues were recognized in accordance with SOP
97-2 and SOP 98-9 when the technology had been delivered, persuasive evidence of
an arrangement existed, collection was probable, the fee was fixed or
determinable and no significant obligations remained. Postage convenience fees
were amounts paid by end-users for the delivery of postage by E-Stamp to the
end-user. The convenience fees were based on the amount of postage ordered by
the end-user. Revenues from postage convenience fees were recognized when the
postage was downloaded into the secure postage storage device. E-Stamp
recognized revenues related to Internet postage supplies when the supplies were
delivered.

     Revenues recognized during 2000 from arrangements deemed to be nonmonetary
exchange of E-Stamp's products and services totaled approximately $976,000.
Revenues from these exchanges were recorded at the fair value of the products
and services provided or received, whichever was more clearly evident. There was
no corresponding cost of revenues related to these transactions. E-Stamp's costs
of revenues for its transportation management and warehouse management solutions
include the costs of manuals, packaging, license fees, hardware costs and
support costs. The cost of revenues for its Internet postage products, services
and supplies included the costs of manuals, packaging, the postage device,
credit card and electronic funds transfer fees, the address management system,
support costs, fulfillment costs and direct costs from the sale of postage
supplies. E-Stamp expects to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable
future and may never achieve profitable operations.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2000 COMPARED TO 1999

REVENUES

     Until E-Stamp's acquisition of Infinity Logistics Corporation and Automated
Logistics Corp. in May 2000, all of E-Stamp's revenues were generated by its
Internet postage products and related technologies. Revenues for 2000 totaled
$5.3 million as compared to $1.3 million for 1999. Revenues generated by its
transportation management and warehouse management products were $1.2 million,
or 22% of net product and services revenues for 2000. Revenues from E-Stamp's
Internet postage products were $4.1 million, or 78% of total net product and
services revenues for 2000. E-Stamp did not recognize any revenue from its
Internet postage products in the fourth quarter of 2000.

COST OF SALES

     Cost of sales includes costs related to product shipments, including
materials, labor and other direct or allocated costs involved in their
manufacture or delivery. It also includes cost of customer support services and
technical support. Cost of sales for 2000 totaled $6.4 million as compared to
$2.4 million for 1999. The gross loss was primarily attributable to our Internet
postage product line because E-Stamp was not able to achieve sufficient revenue
levels in this product line to cover our costs. E-Stamp decided to phase out its
Internet postage business in November 2000 and did not recognize any revenue
from its Internet postage products in the fourth quarter of 2000.

OPERATING EXPENSES

Research and Development.

     Research and development expenses include expenses for the research, design
and development of E-Stamp's two product lines, including expenses such as
salaries and benefits, consulting expenses, and the related facilities,
equipment and information technology costs. Research and development expenses
increased 30% to $18.2 million for 2000 from $14.0 million for 1999. The
increase of $4.2 million in 2000 was primarily attributable to increases in
employee and consulting costs and related facilities and equipment expenses.

Sales and Marketing.

     Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising and
promotional expenses, strategic partner marketing and other marketing program
costs. It also includes expenses such as salaries and benefits, consulting
expenses and related facilities, equipment and information technology costs.
Sales and marketing expenses increased 143% to $54.2 million for 2000 from $22.3
million for 1999. The increase of $31.9 million in 2000 was primarily
attributable to increased spending on marketing programs, advertising and
promotion as well as to increases in employee and consulting costs and related
facilities and equipment expenses.

General and Administrative.

     General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for
administrative and executive staff, fees for professional services, facilities
and office expenses, and depreciation and other equipment costs. General and
administrative expenses increased 11% to $9.3 million for 2000 from $8.4 million
for 1999. The increase of $0.9 million in 2000 was primarily attributable to
increases in employee costs and related facilities, equipment and information
technology costs. The increase in spending was partially offset by a reduction
in non-cash stock compensation charges. The non-cash stock compensation charge
in 1999 was $1.9 million compared to $0.1 million in 2000.

In-process Research and Development.

     In May 2000, E-Stamp acquired Infinity Logistics Corporation and Automated
Logistics Corp. These companies provide transportation management solutions that
allow enterprise customers to review carrier rates and shipping options, select
a carrier, print shipping labels, track shipments and create shipping reports.
Based on an independent appraisal, approximately $1.7 million of the purchase
price has been allocated to in-process research and development related to
Infinity Logistics Corporation products that had not yet reached technological
feasibility and had no alternative future use. This amount was expensed
immediately. As of the acquisition date, in-process research and development of
Infinity Logistics Corporation and Automated Logistics Corp. consisted of the
development of two products, e-Warehouse, which was 80 percent complete, and
DigitalShipper Enterprise, which was 75 percent complete.

     The e-Warehouse product was completed and introduced in July 2000 and the
DigitalShipper Enterprise product was completed and introduced in late June
2000. In March 2001, E-Stamp discontinued offering the e-Warehouse product to
new customers in order to further develop the operability and functionality of
the product. In valuing the in-process technologies of Infinity Logistics
Corporation and Automated Logistics Corp. at the acquisition date, E-Stamp used
a discounted cash flow analysis based on projected net product and services
revenues, cost of revenues, operating expenses and income taxes resulting from
these technologies over a 4-year period. The projected financial results, which
were discounted using a 25 percent rate, were based on expectations for Infinity
Logistics Corporation and Automated Logistics Corp. on a stand alone basis and
excluded any special synergistic benefits that E-Stamp expected to achieve after
the acquisition. The revenue projections for the developed technologies, which
considered the release dates of new products, assumed a gradual decline. The
revenue projections for the in-process research and development were based on
expected trends in technology and timing of new product introductions.

Amortization of Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

     In May 2000, in connection with E-Stamp's acquisition of Infinity Logistics
Corporation and Automated Logistics Corp., E-Stamp recorded goodwill and
intangible assets totaling approximately $5.8 million. This amount will be
amortized over two to five years.

Restructuring Costs.

     During 2000, E-Stamp undertook two corporate restructurings. In July 2000,
E-Stamp restructured our organization to focus on the development, marketing and
sales of its transportation management solutions and reduce E-Stamp's emphasis
on its Internet postage business. In November 2000, E-Stamp restructured the
organization to phase out its Internet postage business. E-Stamp incurred
charges of approximately $20.3 million related to these restructurings. These
charges included $2.3 million for severance payments and benefits continuation
for terminated employees, $13.3 million for asset write-offs, $2.9 million for
contract terminations, and $1.8 for operations shut-down costs.

Amortization of Deferred Stock Compensation.

     Amortization of deferred stock compensation was $8.0 million for 2000,
compared to $10.6 million for 1999. Deferred stock compensation is being
amortized using the graded vesting method. In 2000, E-Stamp recorded deferred
stock compensation of $1.2 million related to a business combination. During
2000, E-Stamp reversed approximately $3.9 million of deferred stock compensation
related to unvested stock options that were forfeited upon the employees'
termination of employment.

Amortization of Deferred Distribution Costs.

     Amortization of deferred distribution costs was $2.9 million for 2000,
compared to $0.9 million for 1999. Deferred distribution costs arose from the
issuance of common stock and warrants in 1999 to investors who signed agreements
to enter into joint venture, joint marketing, cooperation or other technology
agreements for a one year period. These costs were fully amortized as of
December 31, 2000.

Interest Income, Net

     Interest income, net, consists primarily of interest on our cash and cash
equivalents, net of interest expenses attributable to equipment leases. Interest
income, net, increased 96% to $3.8 million for 2000 from $1.9 million for 1999.
The increase in interest income, net, was due to increased interest earned as a
result of increased cash balances resulting from our public offering in November
1999.

Income Taxes

     As of December 31, 2000, E-Stamp had federal and state net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $133.6 million and $80.5 million, respectively.
The net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in
2005 and through 2020, if not utilized. Utilization of the net operating loss
carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the
ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar
state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net
operating loss carryforwards before utilization.

1999 COMPARED TO 1998

Revenues

     Revenues for 1999 totaled $1.3 million. There were no revenues for the year
1998. Revenues were generated from software license fees, postage convenience
fees and sales of postage supplies.

Cost of Sales

     Cost of sales includes costs related to product shipments, including
materials, labor and other direct or allocated costs involved in their
manufacture or delivery. It also includes cost of customer support services and
technical support. Cost of sales for 1999 totaled $2.4 million. There were no
costs of sales for 1998.

OPERATING EXPENSES

Research and Development

     Research and development expenses include expenses for research, design and
development of our Internet postage product line, expenses related to obtaining
patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and server and network
operations. Research and development expenses increased 150% to $14.0 million
for the year 1999 from $5.6 million for the year 1998. The increase of $8.4
million in 1999 was primarily attributable to increases in research and
development employee headcount, and consulting and contractor expenses.

Sales and Marketing

     Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related
benefits for sales and marketing personnel, strategic partner marketing, Web
site development, package design, advertising and promotional expenses, and
tradeshow expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased more than eight times
to $22.3 million for 1999 from $2.7 million for 1998. The increase of $19.6
million in 1999 reflected costs associated with continued development of our
marketing campaigns related to the August 1999 launch of our Internet postage
product line, advertising and strategic partners expenses. The increase also
reflected increases in E-Stamp's sales and marketing personnel.

General and Administrative

     General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for
administrative and executive staff, fees for professional services, depreciation
expense and general office expenses. General and administrative expenses
increased more than four times to $8.4 million for the year 1999 from $1.9
million for the year 1998. The increase of $6.5 million in 1999 was primarily
related to a one-time non-cash stock compensation charge, increased legal
expenses and increases in administrative staff and other professional services.

Amortization of Deferred Stock Compensation

     Amortization of deferred stock compensation was $10.6 million for 1999,
compared to $0.9 million for 1998. E-Stamp recorded aggregate deferred stock
compensation of $26.8 million in the period from July 1, 1998 through December
31, 1999 for options awarded to employees with exercise prices below the deemed
fair value for financial reporting purposes of its common stock on their
respective grant dates.

Amortization of Deferred Distribution Costs

     Amortization of deferred distribution costs was $0.9 million for 1999. In
connection with the issuance of common stock and warrants, E-Stamp and its
investors signed nonbinding letters of intent to negotiate for a period of up to
one year to enter into joint venture, joint marketing, cooperation or technology
development agreements. The excess of the fair value of the common stock and
warrants over the consideration received was $3.8 million and was recorded as
deferred distribution costs, a contra equity account.

Interest Income, Net

     Interest income, net, consists primarily of interest on E-Stamp's cash and
cash equivalents, net of interest expenses attributable to equipment leases.
Interest income, net, increased more than four times to $1.9 million for 1999
from $0.4 million for 1998. The increase in interest income, net, was due to

increased interest earned as a result of increased cash balances resulting from
E-Stamp's initial public offering in November 1999.

     The following tables set forth E-Stamp's unaudited quarterly supplementary
data for each of the eight quarters in the two-year period ended December 31,

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     E-Stamp has financed its operations primarily through private and public
sales of equity securities. During 1999, E-Stamp received approximately $28.9
million in private financings and net proceeds of $125.4 million from its
initial public offering. During 1998, E-Stamp received approximately $16.0
million in private financings

     As of December 31, 2000, E-Stamp had cash, cash equivalents and restricted
cash of approximately $29.0 million. Net cash used in operating activities
totaled $75.4 million, $48.8 million and $9.6 million for the years ended
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998. Cash used in operating activities for each
period resulted primarily from net operating losses in those periods partially
offset by non-cash charges. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $18.7
million, $2.8 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2000,
1999 and 1998.

     Cash used in investing activities for each period resulted primarily from
the acquisition of capital assets, primarily computer and office equipment. In
2000, E-Stamp also used $3.0 million of cash for the acquisition of Infinity
Logistics Corporation and Automated Logistics Corp. and $3.8 million for a
certificate of deposit, which is included in restricted cash, to secure payment
of advertising costs with a vendor. Net cash provided by financing activities
totaled $0.6 million, $160.0 million and $16.0 million for the years ended
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998. Cash provided by financing activities for 2000
resulted primarily from issuance of common stock and collections on notes
receivable from stockholders.

     Cash provided by financing activities in 1999 resulted primarily from
issuance of common stock in E-Stamp's initial public offering and issuance of
redeemable convertible preferred stock. Cash provided by

financing activities in 1998 resulted primarily from the issuance of redeemable
preferred stock. Aggregate noncancelable commitments under facilities operating
leases total $23.8 million, which run through April 2007. In addition, aggregate
noncancelable online advertising commitments for E-Stamp's Internet postage
products related to its agreement with eBay, Inc. were approximately $2.5
million as of December 31, 2000 and have been accrued and included in its
restructuring charges for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2000. E-Stamp has
an outstanding certificate of deposit of $3.8 million securing its payment
obligations to eBay, Inc. E-Stamp also has outstanding $5.0 million in letters
of credit related to these commitments. E-Stamp expects to make cash payments in
2001 totaling $5.9 million related to its corporate restructurings. E-Stamp
believes that its current cash balances and cash flows from operations, if any,
will be sufficient to fund the discontinuation of its business.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition" ("SAB 101"), which
provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and disclosure of revenue in
financial statements filed with the SEC. SAB 101 outlines the basic criteria
that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosures
related to revenue recognition policies. E-Stamp adopted SAB 101 during the
fourth quarter of 2000 and the adoption had no impact on E-Stamp's financial
condition or results of operations.

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities" ("FAS 133"). Learn2 is required to adopt FAS 133 for the
quarter ending March 31, 2001. FAS 133 establishes methods of accounting for
derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those
instruments as well as other hedging activities. Because E-Stamp currently hold
no derivative financial instruments and do not currently engage in hedging
activities, the adoption of FAS 133 will not have a material impact on E-Stamp's
financial condition or results of operations.

     In March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Interpretation No. 44, "Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation -- an Interpretation of APB No. 25" ("FIN 44"). FIN 44 clarifies
the application of APB 25 and, among other issues clarifies the following: the
definition of an employee for purposes of applying APB 25; the criteria for
determining whether a plan qualifies as a non-compensatory plan; the accounting
consequence of various modifications to the terms of the previously fixed stock
options or awards; and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation
awards in a business combination. FIN 44 is effective July 1, 2000, but certain
conclusions in FIN 44 cover specific events that occurred after either December
15, 1998 or January 12, 2000. The application of FIN 44 has not had a material
impact on E-Stamp's financial position or results of operations.

                                LEARN2 BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

     Learn2 together with its subsidiaries is a Learning Service Provider or LSP
for corporate, government and individual clients and customers. Learn2's
offerings include engaging online and physical learning and training products
and complementary services. Learn2 believes its mix of products and services
provides Learn2 with a competitive advantage toward becoming the solutions
provider of choice to Learn2's customers.

     Learn2's products provide an engaging learning experience to corporate and
individual customers through interactive multimedia and animated tutorials and
courseware. Learn2's corporate and government customers have access to these
high quality tutorials and additional features such as reporting and
administration through www.Learn2University.com. Additionally, through
www.Learn2.com, visitors can access Learn2's content that includes tips and
step-by-step instructions on a broad spectrum of skills, activities and tasks,
as well as Learn2's multimedia tutorials. Learn2's e-learning products are also
available on CD-ROM and video and can be purchased from its Website and major
retailers nationwide.

     Through Learn2's subsidiary, eTracks.com, Inc., Learn2 provides permission
e-mail marketing and tracking services to customers that have "opt-in" e-mail
customer lists. eTracks' services include e-mail creation, delivery, tracking
and response analysis for a high volume of client e-mail accounts in a short
period of time. eTracks has also have developed a proprietary member database of
over approximately 500,000 Internet users who have "opted-in" to receive
promotional e-mails. eTracks' clients can supplement their internally developed
customer lists with its member database. In addition, during 2000 and prior,
through periodic e-mails eTracks marketed various electronics and other products
to eTracks' members. The demand for permission e-mail marketing and tracking
services has increased over the past few years and eTracks expects that the
demand will continue to grow for the foreseeable future. eTracks believes that
its technology enables more robust and useful tracking capabilities than its
competitors'.

     Learn2's goal is to become the world's leading provider of engaging
e-learning products and services. To achieve this goal, Learn2 expects to focus
on Learn2's four primary objectives: creating a trusted brand, developing and
owning creative and engaging content, leveraging our patented state-of-the-art
technologies and offering services to meet the needs of its clients. In 1999,
Learn2 changed its company's name from 7th Level, Inc. to Learn2.com, Inc.
Learn2 made the change to create a single recognized brand that more closely
aligned its corporate identity with its product and service offerings.

HISTORY

     Learn2 was founded in 1993 with the goal of becoming a leading developer
and publisher of interactive entertainment and educational content as well as a
creator of state-of-the-art tools and technologies. In 1998, Learn2's research
and development activities were focused primarily on developing and enhancing
its agent technology. In early 1999, Learn2 recognized that appropriate
applications of this technology were in the delivery of training and learning
and therefore Learn2 abandoned its interactive entertainment business and
focused Learn2's efforts on e-learning.

     In 1999, to strengthen Learn2's position in the e-learning marketplace,
Learn2 acquired three companies that enhanced its brand, content, technologies
and services capabilities: Street Technologies, Inc., a privately held company
that developed and marketed technology-based training solutions delivered over
intranets and the Internet utilizing a patented streaming technology and
provided custom service capabilities; Panmedia Corporation, a privately held
company that produced www.Learn2.com, a popular Website that offered
step-by-step instructions on skills, activities and tasks; and ViaGrafix
Corporation, a publicly traded company which developed, produced and marketed
technology-based training tutorials delivered on CD-ROMs and video tapes as well
as computer aided design or CAD software. The CAD product line was sold in March
2000. Through eTracks, ViaGrafix also provided permission e-mail broadcast
solutions and conducted e-commerce. These acquisitions provided Learn2 with the
Learn2.com brand, and a stronger mix of content, technologies and service
offerings.

MARKETPLACE

     Learn2 provides e-learning solutions for corporate, government and
non-profit markets as well as individuals. According to W.R. Hambrecht & Co.,
corporate e-learning is one of the fastest growing and most promising markets in
the education industry. They expect the online training market to nearly double
in size annually through 2003, to approximately $11.5 billion. International
Data Corporation projects similar growth rates for the market. Training Magazine
estimated that domestic corporations with over 100 employees budgeted
approximately $62.5 billion on training, of which approximately 24% was
outsourced. Additionally, Training Magazine estimates that classroom,
instructor-led training represented 73% of the total training delivery market,
whereas Web-based training represented 14% of the market. The remaining 13% was
composed primarily of self-study programs that use books, manuals, videotapes,
or audiocassettes. W.R. Hambrecht & Co. estimates that the continuing education
market in 1999 was $12 billion and the existing education and training
marketplace, including K-12, higher education and corporate training, in the
U.S. alone, is a $722 billion-a-year industry.

     The permission e-mail marketing and tracking industry is in its early
stages of development. Learn2 believes that the industry will evolve over the
next few years as e-mail marketing becomes even more widely used and e-mail
marketers and Web advertisers require more information about the behavior of
their permission e-mail recipients and Website visitors. The permission e-mail
market is becoming increasingly competitive. Participants compete primarily in
the following areas: reporting and tracking capabilities, customer service,
brand recognition, ease of implementation, time-to-market of a campaign and
price.

Learn2 Technologies

     Learn2 owns unique, patented, proprietary technologies that allow it to

       captures to appear clearly and realistically.

     - A patented technology that ensures that the elements of a multimedia
       production including audio, graphics, animation, video and text are
       synchronized.

     - The ability to develop interactive streams, which allow users to assess
       their understanding of a concept during the learning experience.

patented technology that allows users to create quickly, personalized animated
messages to communicate a "call to action" in e-learning and other environments.
The quality and impact of the experience exceeds that which would be experienced
using other technologies. No special programming skills are necessary. Users can
program interactivity to link the characters to Web pages and applications.
Using LearningAgents, Learn2 creates for its customers an engaging e-learning
environment that results in increased comprehension and retention.

Learn2 Services

     Learn2 leverages its technologies and resources to provide Learn2's
customers with engaging, multimedia e-learning solutions. Learn2 works with them
to create custom solutions based upon their specific needs and corporate
objectives. The result is Web-enabled, multimedia content that is hosted on
Learn2's servers and delivered and tracked through the Learn2University learning
management system or LMS. Learn2's customers, by outsourcing a portion or all of
their training and learning requirements to Learn2, benefit from a custom
approach to their e-learning needs, without having to develop and support human
and technology resources for that purpose.

Learn2 Distribution Network

     Learn2's products are available from retailers, catalogs, on the Internet,
through its direct sales force and through resellers and distributors. This
multi-channel approach to product distribution creates a broad market for
Learn2's products, giving Learn2 a competitive advantage.

       and other resellers.

     As one of the first permission e-mail marketing and tracking companies,
eTracks has managed hundreds of permission e-mail campaigns. eTracks is able to
send over five million unique e-mail messages per day and expect to more than
double capacity this year. eTracks proprietary mail transfer agent technology
allows for extensive data mining, broadcasting and tracking, and real-time
reporting. eTracks owns substantially all of its mail transfer agent and
Adaptive Proxy, or AP tracking(TM) technologies. AP tracking utilizes
noninvasive technology, provides tracking and logging information and analysis
that can cross application and server boundaries without requiring eTracks'

BUSINESS STRATEGY AND STRATEGIC DIRECTION

     Learn2's goal is to become the world's leading provider of e-learning
solutions. Learn2's mission is to provide its customers, including corporations,
government agencies, educational organizations and individuals with a complete
engaging, e-learning solution. To achieve this goal, Learn2 expects to promote
Learn2's brand, expand Learn2's content offerings, improve Learn2's
technologies, improve and expand Learn2's service offerings and expand Learn2's
distribution.

Increase Brand Awareness In Learn2's Target Markets

     Learn2 intends to solidify Learn2's position as a leading provider of
e-learning products and services by increasing Learn2's brand name recognition
in Learn2's target markets. Learn2 intends to use advertising, public relations
and marketing programs to promote its brand and build loyalty among businesses,
government agencies and individual customers.

Expand Learn2's Content Offerings

     Learn2 intends to introduce new tutorials and expand its product offerings
into new markets. Learn2 will modify content developed for existing customers in
order to provide similar tutorials to customers in different industries. This
approach allows Learn2 to generate additional revenue opportunities while
leveraging previous tutorial development efforts.

     Learn2 is pursuing relationships with specialized publishers and content
providers to develop tutorials directed toward new markets. For example, Learn2
plans to develop certification, licensing and continuing education tutorials for
professionals in areas such as finance, law and accounting.

Enhance Learn2's Technologies

     Learn2 will continue to invest in its technologies in order to remain on
the cutting edge of multimedia, engaging e-learning solutions and permission
e-mail services.

Develop Long-Term Strategic Relationships With Learn2's Customers

     Learn2 plans to extend its presence within its customers' enterprises by
helping them to understand the value and applicability of its solutions to a
broad range of operational initiatives. In addition, Learn2 will continue to
develop new e-learning solutions that are aligned with its customers' evolving
business objectives.

Leverage Development Alliances And Reseller Relationships

     Learn2 plans to grow both its direct and indirect sales channels to expand
within its existing markets and penetrate new ones.

Expand Learn2's International Presence

     As the rate of Internet adoption accelerates abroad, Learn2 believes that
significant international market demand will exist for e-learning solutions.
Learn2 currently has distributors or resellers in Africa, Brazil, Ireland, South
Korea, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

SUPPLIERS

     Learn2 currently has relationships with several content providers. However,
as an owner of over 80% of our content, Learn2 is not reliant upon any outside
content providers. Learn2 may increase the number of content providers in the
future to broaden the scope of Learn2's subject matter.

Learn2's net revenues in 2000. The following is a representative list of

        Staples

COMPETITION

E-Learning and Training

     Learn2 provides e-learning solutions for corporate, government and
non-profit markets as well as to individuals. The e-learning market is evolving.
The market is fragmented and competitive, with no dominant players. Learn2's
competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and
services they offer. Some of Learn2's competitors have greater financial
resources than Learn2's has. Learn2 anticipates that new competitors will enter
the market, increasing the level of competition. Learn2 believes that the
principal competitive factors in Learn2's market include:

     - Reputation and brand recognition

     - Breadth, depth and quality of content.

     - Technology

     - Services

     - Distribution

     Learn2's competition from a variety of sources, including:

     - "Instructor-led" training companies including IBM, New Horizons and
       Productivity Point International.

     - Corporate training departments.

     - Other e-learning companies including Click2Learn.com, Digital Think,
       Element K, SmartForce, and SkillSoft.

     - Vendors offering computer-based and videotape tutorials including NETg,
       Microsoft Press, Keystone and Video Professor.

     - Book publishers including Hungry Minds, McGraw Hill and Pearson.

Multimedia Streaming and Agent Technologies

     The three most prominent providers of multimedia streaming technologies are
Macromedia, Microsoft Corporation and RealNetworks Inc. StreamMaker is different
than other multimedia streaming technologies because Learn2 engineered it
specifically for use in training and e-learning applications. However, these
other companies have substantial resources.

Permission E-mail Marketing Services

     eTracks' competitors in the permission e-mail marketing and tracking arena
include providers of e-mail based services such as: Double Click, MessageMedia,
Exactis, Responsys.com, Digital Impact, and DeliverE. The majority of these
companies operate with greater financial resources than eTracks does.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND LICENSES

     Learn2's success and ability to compete effectively will depend, in part,
on its ability to protect Learn2's intellectual property. Learn2 relies
primarily on a combination of statutory and common law copyright, trademark and
trade secret laws, customer licensing agreements, employee and third-party
nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect Learn2's proprietary
rights. Learn2 has received patents that are important in the operation of our
business. These patents may not be broad enough to protect Learn2's rights.

     Learn2 generally requires the execution of a license agreement that
restricts copying and use of Learn2's products. In addition, Learn2 has
agreements with resellers and customers that require the other party to pay
Learn2 royalties based on sales or use of Learn2's products. Learn2 may not be
compensated properly if those sales or uses are not reported to Learn2. If
unauthorized copying or misuse of Learn2's products were to occur to any
substantial degree, then Learn2's business could be affected materially and
adversely. It may be possible for a third-party to copy or otherwise obtain and
use Learn2's tutorials or technologies without authorization, or to develop
similar tutorials or technologies independently.

     Learn2 uses employee and third-party confidentiality and non-disclosure
agreements to protect Learn2's trade secrets and unpatented know-how. Learn2
requires its employees to assign to Learn2 all rights in any proprietary
information or technology made or contributed by the employee during his or her
employment with Learn2. In addition, Learn2 regularly enter into non-disclosure
agreements with third parties including consultants, potential strategic
partners and customers. Unfortunately, these agreements cannot guarantee the
confidentiality of Learn2's trade secrets or unpatented know-how, nor can they
prevent third parties from independently developing substantially equivalent
proprietary information or copying, developing, or otherwise obtaining and using
Learn2's proprietary information without authorization.

     Learn2 may resort to litigation to enforce its intellectual property
rights, determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or
defend itself against claims of infringement or invalidity by others. While
Learn2 is not currently engaged in any intellectual property litigation or
proceedings, Learn2 may be in the future. An adverse outcome in a litigation or
similar proceeding could subject Learn2 to significant liabilities to third
parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from others, or require Learn2
to cease marketing or using certain products or services. The cost of addressing
any intellectual property litigation, both in legal fees and the diversion of
management resources, regardless of whether the claim is valid, could be
significant.

     Third parties may claim that Learn2's current or future products infringe
on their proprietary rights. Learn2 may be subject to these claims as the number
of products and competitors in the education and training industry grows and the
functionality of products in the marketplace overlap. Any of these claims, with
or without merit, could result in costly litigation or might require Learn2 to
enter into royalty or licensing agreements. These royalty or license agreements,
if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to Learn2, if at all.

EMPLOYEES

     As of April 10, 2001 Learn2 had a total of 138 full-time employees, of whom
64 were engaged in research and product development, 54 in sales and marketing
and 20 in general and administrative functions. Substantially all of the
employees work in Learn2's offices in Pryor, Oklahoma, Belmont, California,
Golden, Colorado or White Plains, New York. None of Learn2's employees are
subject to a

collective bargaining agreement and Learn2 has not experienced any work
stoppages. Learn2 believes that its relationship with its employees is good.

PROPERTIES

     Learn2 maintains facilities and offices at the following locations:

                                                                   LEASE

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     Learn2 is involved in certain legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary
course of its business. Learn2 is contesting vigorously all such matters and
believe that their ultimate resolution will not have a materially adverse effect
on Learn2's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

                                E-STAMP BUSINESS

     On April 19, 2001, E-Stamp agreed to acquire Learn2 by way of merger
pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated as of April 19, 2001. In
connection with the proposed merger, E-Stamp is discontinuing its existing
transportation management solutions business. Following the completion of the
merger, E-Stamp intends to conduct the business of Learn2, which is described
above under the heading "Learn2 Business."

     Prior to E-Stamp's decision to discontinue its transportation management
solutions business, E-Stamp provided transportation management solutions to a
wide range of customers, including retailers, manufacturers and distributors.
E-Stamp's solutions automated the operation of shipping and distribution centers
by allowing customers to compare multiple shipping carrier rates, print shipping
manifests and shipping carrier labels, and track shipment status. E-Stamp sold
its solutions primarily through a direct sales force. E-Stamp also offered
client evaluation, software products and professional consulting services. As
indicated above, E-Stamp is in the process of discontinuing its transportation
management solutions business. In connection with the discontinuance of
E-Stamp's transportation management solutions business, E-Stamp determined that
certain of its long-lived assets, including property and equipment, goodwill and
other intangible assets, were impaired. E-Stamp incurred a charge of $5.7
million for impairment of long-lived assets in the quarter ended March 31, 2001.

     During 2000, E-Stamp provided an Internet postage service that enabled
users to purchase, download and print Internet postage directly from their
personal computers without the need to maintain a persistent Internet
connection. During 2000, E-Stamp undertook two corporate restructurings. In July
2000, E-Stamp restructured its organization to focus on the development,
marketing and sales of its transportation management solutions and reduce its
emphasis on its Internet postage business. In November 2000, E-Stamp
restructured the organization to phase out its Internet postage business.
E-Stamp incurred charges of approximately $20.3 million related to these
restructurings.

HISTORY

     Prior to September 1996, E-Stamp conducted operations as Post N Mail,
L.L.C., a Texas limited liability company formed in April 1994. From April 1994
until the September 1996 merger with E-Stamp, Post N Mail engaged in discussions
with the U.S. Postal Service regarding non-traditional postal services and, as
use of the Internet became more prevalent, focused on the development of its
Internet postage service. In September 1996, Post N Mail was merged into E-Stamp
Corporation, a Delaware corporation. Following the merger, E-Stamp continued to
develop its Internet postage service. E-Stamp entered the U.S. Postal Service's
three-phase beta test certification process in March 1998 and received final
U.S. Postal Service approval for E-Stamp's Internet postage service on August 9,
1999.

     In May 2000, E-Stamp acquired Infinity Logistics Corporation, a provider of
a Web-enabled warehouse management solutions, and Automated Logistics Corp., a
provider of transportation management solutions. The total purchase price was
$9.0 million and consisted of a combination of cash, stock and assumed
liabilities. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly,
Infinity Logistics Corporation and Automated Logistics Corp.'s results of
operations have been included in E-Stamp's results of operations from May 23,
2000, which was the date of acquisition.

     In November 2000, E-Stamp announced the phase-out of its Internet postage
product line to enable E-Stamp to focus on E-Stamp transportation management
solutions. As part of the transition, E-Stamp reduced its workforce by
approximately 30%, deploying the remaining organization and resources toward the
development, marketing and sale of its transportation management solutions.
E-Stamp discontinued its Internet postage service on December 31, 2000, and
accepted eligible product returns and requests for postage refunds that were
postmarked by February 28, 2001.

     On April 19, 2001, E-Stamp agreed to acquire Learn2 pursuant to an
agreement and plan of merger dated as of April 19, 2001. E-Stamp is in the
process of discontinuing its existing transportation

management solutions business. Following the completion of the merger, E-Stamp
intends to conduct the business of Learn2, which is described above under the
heading "Learn2 Business."

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

     Prior to E-Stamp's decision to discontinue its transportation management
solutions business, E-Stamp's products included DigitalShipper Enterprise, a
transportation management solution, and e-Receive, a receiving solution, which
were based on software licensed from Kewill Electronic Commerce and its
proprietary user interface software. DigitalShipper Enterprise was a
multi-carrier, integrated transportation management solution, targeted at large-
and medium-sized companies. It allowed a customer to compare rates and services
for all of the major small package and freight carriers, review carrier rates
and shipping options, select a carrier, print shipping labels, track shipments
and create shipping reports from one system. e-Receive was an internal receiving
and delivery system for enterprises that use a portable data collection device
to track incoming packages and documents.

PROFESSIONAL SERVICES

     Prior to E-Stamp's decision to discontinue its transportation management
solutions business, E-Stamp's professional services group provided its customers
with expertise and assistance in planning and implementing E-Stamp's solutions.
E-Stamp also provided system upgrades to those customers who purchased E-Stamp's
maintenance and support services. In connection with the discontinuance of
E-Stamp's transportation management solutions business, E-Stamp intends to
transfer its maintenance and support contracts to a third party provider.

SUPPORT AND SOFTWARE UPGRADES

     Prior to E-Stamp's decision to discontinue its transportation management
solutions business, E-Stamp offered its customers software upgrades providing
increased functionality and technological advances incorporating emerging supply
chain execution, transportation management and other industry initiatives. As of
December 31, 2000, a majority of E-Stamp's customers were participating in its
support and upgrade program. In connection with the discontinuance of its
transportation management solutions business, E-Stamp intends to transfer its
maintenance and support contracts to a third party provider.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

     Prior to E-Stamp's decision to discontinue its transportation management
solutions business, E-Stamp's development efforts were focused on improving the
functionality, performance and quality of its existing products. E-Stamp's
research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999
and 2000 were $5.6 million, $14.0 million and $18.2 million, respectively. In
connection with the discontinuance of E-Stamp's transportation management
solutions business, E-Stamp has ceased further product development efforts.

COMPETITION

     The supply chain execution market, which includes transportation management
systems, is highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change.
The principal competitive factors in the supply chain software markets are
product features, functionality, architecture and quality, product suite
integration, ease and speed of implementation, customer service and
satisfaction, vendor and production reputation, product price and support,
product related services, and compliance with industry standards and
requirements. E-Stamp's competitors included iShip, Tan Data, Kewill, Federal
Express, UPS, Neopost, Manhattan Associates, Inc., Manugistics Group, Inc., EXE
Technologies, Inc., Optum Inc. and McHugh Software International, Inc., as well
as smaller independent companies that offer software solutions that compete with
E-Stamp's software solution.

SALES AND MARKETING

     Prior to E-Stamp's decision to discontinue its transportation management
solutions business, E-Stamp generated substantially all of its transportation
management and warehouse management product revenues through our direct sales
force. E-Stamp's marketing programs included advertising, public relations,
trade shows, joint programs with vendors and customer communication programs. In
connection with the discontinuance of its transportation management solutions
business, E-Stamp is no longer pursuing new customers.

CUSTOMERS

     Prior to E-Stamp's decision to discontinue its transportation management
solutions business, E-Stamps provided transportation management and warehouse
management systems to small and medium-sized companies, as well as retailers,
manufacturers, warehouses and distribution centers. Some of its customers
included SanDisk Corporation, iPrint and the California Department of Forestry,
as well as divisions of larger companies, such as Oracle and Sony Music. In
connection with the discontinuance of its transportation management solutions
business, E-Stamp is no longer pursuing new customers.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

     In April 2001, E-Stamp sold all of its patents, and all trademarks and
domain names related to its Internet postage business, to Stamps.com for $7.5
million.

EMPLOYEES

     As of March 31, 2001, E-Stamp employed 30 full-time employees. From time to
time, E-Stamp employed independent contractors to support its research and
development, marketing, sales and support and administrative organizations. None
of its employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, and
E-Stamp has never experienced a work stoppage. E-Stamp believes its relations
with its employees are good.

PROPERTIES

     E-Stamp's headquarters are currently located in a leased facility in
Mountain View, California, consisting of approximately 92,300 square feet. The
lease expires in April 2007. E-Stamp currently utilizes less than one-half of
the leased facility. In connection with E-Stamp's decision to discontinue its
transportation management solutions business, E-Stamp intends to either
terminate its lease or assign its lease to a third party.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     On June 10, 1999, Pitney Bowes filed suit against E-Stamp in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Delaware alleging infringement of Pitney
Bowes' patents. The suit alleges that E-Stamp is infringing seven patents held
by Pitney Bowes related to postage application systems and seeks treble damages,
a preliminary and permanent injunction from further alleged infringement,
attorneys fees and other unspecified damages. On July 30, 1999, E-Stamp filed
its answer to Pitney Bowes complaint in which E-Stamp denied all allegations of
patent infringement and assert affirmative and other defenses based on statutory
and common law grounds, including inequitable conduct on the part of Pitney
Bowes in its procurement of patents in proceedings before the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office. As part of the answer, E-Stamp also brought various
counterclaims against Pitney Bowes claiming Pitney Bowes violation of Section 2
of the Sherman Act and intentional and tortious interference with its business
relations based, in part, upon E-Stamp's allegations that Pitney Bowes has
unlawfully maintained its monopoly power in the postage metering market through
a scheme to defraud the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and its efforts to
discourage potential investors and businesses from investing and entering into
agreements with us. The E-Stamp suit seeks compensatory and treble damages,
injunctive relief and recovery of attorneys fees. On September 21, 1999, Pitney
Bowes filed a motion to strike or dismiss certain of its affirmative

defenses and counterclaims or, in the alternative, to bifurcate discovery and
trial of those counterclaims. On July 28, 2000 the U.S. District Court for the
District of Delaware granted Pitney Bowes' motion to bifurcate discovery and
trial of certain of our defenses and counterclaims. On April 14, 2000, Pitney
Bowes filed a motion to amend their original complaint seeking to assert one
additional patent held by Pitney Bowes and to remove one of the seven originally
asserted patents held by Pitney Bowes. On July 28, 2000, the U.S. District Court
for the District of Delaware granted Pitney Bowes' motion to amend. E-Stamp is
continuing to investigate the claims against us as well as infringement by
Pitney Bowes of our patents, and may assert additional defenses or pursue
additional counterclaims or independent claims against Pitney Bowes in the
future.

     On March 16, 2001, a plaintiff filed a purported consumer class action suit
against E-Stamp in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Kings.
The suit alleges that E-Stamp breached its contracts with the plaintiff and
other customers. The plaintiff seeks compensatory damages and disgorgement of
monies received in connection with the sale of Internet postage products.
E-Stamp is currently investigating the claims against it and intends to
vigorously defend this action. Pendency of the these legal proceedings can be
expected to result in expenses to E-Stamp and the diversion of management time
and other resources.

(1) The table does not include stock options granted to Messrs. Landy and Riley
    in January 2001 for each to purchase 250,000 shares of common stock at an
    exercise price of $0.47 per share, subject to a fifteen month vesting
    schedule. In addition, the table does not include stock options granted to
    Mr. Gott in April 2001 to purchase 825,000 shares of common stock at an
    exercise price of $0.25 per share, subject to a three-year vesting schedule.

(2) Learn2 granted stock options representing 2,912,200 shares of our common
    stock to employees during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000.

(3) On April 10, 2001, Learn2's board of directors approved a plan under which
    each director, officer and employee would be given the opportunity to
    exchange their existing stock options for new stock options with an exercise
    price of $0.25 per share, subject to a new vesting schedule that will be
    approved by E-Stamp.

(4) The potential realizable value illustrates value that might be realized upon
    exercise of the options immediately prior to the expiration of their terms,
    assuming the specified compounded rates of appreciation of the market price
    per share from the date of grant to the end of the option term. Actual
    gains, if any, on stock option exercises are dependent upon a number of
    factors, including the future performance of the Learn2 common stock and the
    timing of option exercises, as well as the optionee's continued employment
    through the vested period. There can be no assurance that the amounts
    reflected in this table will be achieved.
