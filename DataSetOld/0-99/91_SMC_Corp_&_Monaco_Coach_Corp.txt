SUMMARY TERM SHEET    

    Salmon Acquisition, Inc. is offering to purchase all of the outstanding common stock of SMC Corporation for $3.70 per share in cash. The following are
some of the questions you, as a shareholder of SMC Corporation, may have and answers to those questions. This summary highlights important and material information from the Offer to Purchase but might
not include all the information that is important to you. We urge you to read carefully the remainder of this Offer to Purchase and the Letter of Transmittal because the information in this summary is
not complete. Additional important information is contained in the remainder of this Offer to Purchase and the Letter of Transmittal. We have included references to sections to direct you to a more
complete description of the topics contained in this summary. 

Who is offering to buy my shares?  


Our
name is Salmon Acquisition, Inc. We are an Oregon corporation formed for the purpose of making a tender offer for all of the outstanding shares
of common stock of SMC Corporation. We are a wholly owned subsidiary of Monaco Coach Corporation, a Delaware corporation. See "Introduction" and Section 9"Certain Information
Concerning Parent and Purchaser"of this Offer to Purchase. 

What shares are being sought in the Offer?  


We
are seeking to purchase all of the outstanding shares of the common stock of SMC Corporation. See "Introduction" and Section 1"Terms
of the Offer"of this Offer to Purchase. 

How much are you offering to pay, what is the form of payment and will I have to pay any fees or commissions?  


We
are offering to pay $3.70 per share, net to you, in cash. If you are the record owner of your shares and you tender your shares to us in the offer, you
will not have to pay brokerage fees or similar expenses. If you own your shares through a broker or other nominee, and your broker tenders your shares on your behalf, your broker or nominee may charge
you a fee for doing so. You should consult your broker or nominee to determine whether any charges will apply. See "Introduction" and Section 1"Terms of the Offer"of
this Offer to Purchase. 

Do you have the financial resources to make payment?  


Monaco
Coach Corporation, our parent company, will provide us with sufficient funds to acquire all tendered shares and any shares to be acquired in the
merger that is expected to follow the successful completion of the Offer. Monaco Coach Corporation plans to obtain some or all of the funds necessary to purchase the Shares pursuant to the Offer
through borrowing under its existing credit facility with U.S. Bank N.A., and expects to obtain the balance of any required funds from internally generated funds of itself and its subsidiaries. The
offer is not conditioned upon any financing arrangements. See Section 10"Source and Amount of Funds"of this Offer to Purchase. 

Is your financial condition relevant to my decision to tender in the offer?  

    We do not think our financial condition is relevant to your decision whether to tender shares and accept the offer because: 


the
offer is being made for all outstanding shares solely for cash,


the
offer is not subject to any financing condition, and


if
we consummate the offer, we will acquire all remaining shares for the same cash price in the merger. 

How long do I have to decide whether to tender in the offer?  


You
will have at least until 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Wednesday, August 1, 2001, to tender your shares in the offer. Further, if you
cannot deliver everything that is required in order to make a valid tender by that time, you may be able to use a guaranteed delivery procedure, which is described later in this Offer to Purchase. See
Section 1"Terms of the Offer"and Section 2"Procedures for Tendering Shares"of this Offer to Purchase. 

Can the offer be extended and under what circumstances?  

    Yes. We can extend the offer from time to time on one or more occasions under the following circumstances: 


We
may in our discretion extend the offer for a period of time we believe necessary to cause the conditions to our offer to be satisfied, if on a scheduled
expiration date any of the conditions to our offer are not satisfied;


We
may in our discretion extend the offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the Commission or its staff
applicable to the offer;


We
may in our discretion extend the offer if all conditions to our offer have been met but the number of common shares tendered is less than 90% of the
total number of then outstanding common shares, for an aggregate period of not more than 20 business days (for all such extensions) beyond the latest expiration date that would be permitted under
either of the two preceding bullet points; and


We
may elect to provide a "subsequent offering period" for the offer. A subsequent offering period, if one is included, will be an additional period of
time beginning after we have purchased shares tendered during the offer, during which shareholders may tender, but not withdraw, their shares and receive the offer consideration. We do not currently
intend to include a subsequent offering period, although we reserve the right to do so. 

    See
Section 1"Terms of the Offer"of this Offer to Purchase. 

How will I be notified if the offer is extended?  


If
we extend the offer, we will inform Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, N.A., the depositary for the offer, of that fact and will make a public announcement of
the extension, not later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the next business day after the day on which the offer was scheduled to expire. See Section 1"Terms of the
Offer"of this Offer to Purchase. 

What are the most significant conditions to the offer?  

    There is no financing condition to the offer; however: 


We
are not obligated to purchase any tendered shares unless the number of shares validly tendered and not withdrawn before the expiration date of the offer
represents at least 51% of the shares of SMC Corporation outstanding on a fully diluted basis.


We
are not obligated to purchase any tendered shares if before the expiration of the offer there has occurred or been threatened any change, development,
effect or circumstance that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets (including intangible assets), financial condition or results of operations of SMC
Corporation. See Section 12"Purpose of the Offer; the Merger Agreement; Plans for the Company"of this Offer to Purchase. 

    The
offer is also subject to a number of other conditions. See Section 13"Certain Conditions of the Offer"of this Offer to Purchase. 

How do I tender my shares?  


To
tender shares, you must deliver the certificates representing your shares, together with a completed Letter of Transmittal and any other documents
required, to Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, N.A., the depositary for the offer, not later than the time the tender offer expires. If your shares are held in street name, the shares can be tendered by
your nominee through the Depository Trust Company. If you cannot deliver something that is required to be delivered to Wells Fargo by the expiration of the tender offer, you may obtain a little extra
time to do so by having a broker, a bank or other fiduciary that is a member of the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program or other eligible institution guarantee that the missing items will be
received by Wells Fargo within three Nasdaq Stock Market trading days. For the tender to be valid, however, Wells Fargo must receive the missing items within that three trading day period. See
Section 2"Procedures for Tendering Shares"of this Offer to Purchase. 

Until what time can I withdraw previously tendered shares?  


You
can withdraw shares at any time until the offer has expired. This right to withdraw will not apply to any subsequent offering period, if one is
included. See Section 1"Terms of the Offer"and Section 3"Withdrawal Rights"of this Offer to Purchase. 

How do I withdraw previously tendered shares?  


To
withdraw shares, you (or your broker or bank if your shares were held in "street name") must deliver a written notice of withdrawal, or a facsimile of
one, with the required information to Wells Fargo while you still have the right to withdraw the shares. See Section 1"Terms of the Offer"and
Section 3"Withdrawal Rights"of this Offer to Purchase. 

WHAT DOES THE SMC CORPORATION BOARD OF DIRECTORS THINK OF THE OFFER?  


WE
ARE MAKING THE OFFER PURSUANT TO A MERGER AGREEMENT AMONG US, MONACO COACH CORPORATION AND SMC CORPORATION. THE SMC CORPORATION BOARD OF DIRECTORS
APPROVED AND ADOPTED THE MERGER AGREEMENT, OUR TENDER OFFER AND OUR PROPOSED MERGER WITH SMC CORPORATION. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF SMC CORPORATION HAS DETERMINED THAT THE OFFER AND THE MERGER ARE
ADVISABLE AND FAIR TO AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF SMC CORPORATION AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS AND RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS TENDER THEIR SHARES IN THE TENDER OFFER. SEE THE "INTRODUCTION" TO THIS OFFER
TO PURCHASE. 

What are your plans if you consummate the offer but all the shares are not tendered in the offer?  


If
we accept for payment and pay for at least 51% of the shares of SMC Corporation outstanding on a fully diluted basis, we intend to cause a merger to
occur between us and with SMC Corporation in which all of the shareholders who did not tender their shares will receive $3.70 per share in cash. If that merger takes place, Monaco Coach Corporation
will as a result thereof own all of the shares of SMC Corporation, and all other shareholders of SMC Corporation will receive $3.70 per share in cash (or any higher price per share that is paid in the
offer). 


It
is not anticipated that there will be any appraisal rights available in connection with the offer. See Section 12"Purpose of the
Offer; the Merger Agreement; Plans for the Company"of this Offer to Purchase. 

If I decide not to tender, how will the offer affect my shares?  


If
the merger takes place, shareholders who do not tender in the offer will receive the same amount of cash per share that they would have received had
they tendered their shares in the offer, subject to their right, if any, to pursue appraisal under Oregon law. Therefore, if the merger takes place, the only difference to you between tendering your
shares and not tendering your shares (unless appraisal rights apply to the merger, which is not anticipated, and you perfect your appraisal rights in compliance with Oregon law) is that you will be
paid earlier if you tender your shares. However, if the merger does not take place, the number of shareholders and of shares of SMC Corporation that are still in the hands of the public may be so
small that there may no longer be an active public trading market (or, possibly,
any public trading market) for the shares. Also, the shares may no longer be eligible to be traded on Nasdaq Stock Market or any other securities exchange, and SMC Corporation may cease making filings
with the SEC or otherwise cease being required to comply with the SEC's rules relating to publicly held companies. See Section 7"Effect of the Offer on the Market for the Shares;
Nasdaq Listing; Exchange Act Registration; Margin Regulations"and Section 12"Purpose of the Offer; the Merger Agreement; Plans for the Company"of this
Offer to Purchase. 

What is the market value of my shares as of a recent date?  


On
June 22, 2001, the last trading day before SMC Corporation and Monaco Coach Corporation announced that they had signed the merger agreement, the
last sale price of the shares reported on Nasdaq Stock Market was $3.00 per share. On July 2, 2001, the last sale price of the shares was $3.65 per share. We advise you to obtain a recent
quotation for shares of SMC Corporation in deciding whether to tender your shares. See Section 6"Price Range of the Shares; Dividends on the Shares"of this Offer to
Purchase. 

To whom can I talk if I have questions about the tender offer?  


You
can call Innisfree M&A Incorporated at (888) 750-5834 (toll free) or Salomon Smith Barney Inc. at
(800) 220-7501 (toll free). Innisfree is acting as the information agent and Salomon Smith Barney is acting as the dealer manager for our tender offer. See the back cover of this
Offer to Purchase.

shareholders, if any, who are entitled to and properly exercise appraisal rights under Oregon law) will be converted into the right to receive the price per Share paid pursuant to the Offer in cash,
without interest thereon. The Merger Agreement is more fully described in Section 12. 

    THE
BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY HAS APPROVED AND ADOPTED THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY AND DETERMINED THAT THE OFFER AND THE MERGER ARE
ADVISABLE AND FAIR TO AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS. ACCORDINGLY, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY RECOMMENDS THAT
THE SHAREHOLDERS TENDER THEIR SHARES IN THE OFFER. THE FACTORS CONSIDERED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY IN ARRIVING AT ITS DECISION TO APPROVE THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THE OFFER, THE MERGER
AND THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND TO RECOMMEND THAT SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY ACCEPT THE OFFER AND TENDER THEIR SHARES PURSUANT TO THE OFFER ARE DESCRIBED IN THE
COMPANY'S SOLICITATION/ RECOMMENDATION STATEMENT ON SCHEDULE 14D-9 (THE "SCHEDULE 14D-9"), WHICH HAS BEEN FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE "COMMISSION")
AND IS BEING MAILED TO SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY CONCURRENTLY HEREWITH. THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS THE ABILITY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES SET FORTH IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT TO WITHDRAW
SUCH RECOMMENDATION. 

    MCDONALD
INVESTMENTS INC. ("MCDONALD") HAS ACTED AS THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR. THE OPINION OF MCDONALD DATED JUNE 25, 2001 THAT, AS OF SUCH DATE, THE CONSIDERATION
TO BE RECEIVED IN THE OFFER AND THE MERGER 

BY THE HOLDERS OF SHARES IS FAIR TO SUCH HOLDERS FROM A FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW IS SET FORTH IN FULL AS AN ANNEX TO THE SCHEDULE 14D-9. SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO, AND SHOULD, CAREFULLY
READ THE SCHEDULE 14D-9 AND SUCH OPINION IN THEIR ENTIRETY. 

    THE
OFFER IS CONDITIONED UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THERE BEING VALIDLY TENDERED AND NOT WITHDRAWN PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATE (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 1 HEREOF) THAT NUMBER OF SHARES
THAT WOULD REPRESENT AT LEAST 51% OF THE FULLY DILUTED SHARES (AS DEFINED ON THE FRONT COVER OF THIS OFFER TO PURCHASE) ON THE DATE OF PURCHASE (AS DEFINED ON THE FRONT COVER OF THIS OFFER TO
PURCHASE). 

    THE
COMPANY'S CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MATHEW M. PERLOT, AND ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CURTIS W. LAWLER, TOGETHER HELD ON JUNE 23, 2001 A TOTAL OF 4,035,700
SHARES, WHICH CONSTITUTED MORE THAN 51% OF THE FULLY DILUTED SHARES OF THE COMPANY AS OF SUCH DATE. MESSRS. PERLOT AND LAWLER HAVE AGREED WITH PARENT PURSUANT TO CERTAIN SHAREHOLDER'S AGREEMENTS DATED
JUNE 23, 2001 (THE "SHAREHOLDER'S AGREEMENTS") TO TENDER ALL OF THEIR SHARES IN THE TENDER OFFER. IF THEY SO TENDER AS REQUIRED BY THE SHAREHOLDER'S AGREEMENTS, IT IS ACCORDINGLY ANTICIPATED THAT THE
MINIMUM CONDITION WILL BE SATISFIED. 

    Consummation
of the Merger is subject to a number of conditions, including approval by shareholders of the Company, and Shares having been purchased pursuant to the Offer. 

    The
Company has informed Purchaser that, as of June 23, 2001, there were: (a) 5,745,599 Shares issued and outstanding; (b) 733,000 Shares subject to outstanding
options to purchase Shares from the Company; and (c) approximately 6,478,599 Fully Diluted Shares (as defined on the cover of this Offer to Purchase). Based upon the foregoing and assuming that
no Shares are otherwise issued after June 23, 2001, the Minimum Condition will be satisfied if at least 3,304,086 Shares are validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date. The
actual number of Shares required to be tendered to satisfy the Minimum Condition will depend upon the actual number of Fully Diluted Shares on the date that Purchaser accepts Shares for payment
pursuant to the Offer. The Company's Chairman of the Board of Directors, Mathew M. Perlot, and its Chief Executive Officer, Curtis W. Lawler, who together held a total of 4,035,700 Shares, or
approximately 70% of the Shares outstanding, on June 23, 2001, have agreed with Parent pursuant to the Shareholder's Agreements to tender all of their shares in the tender Offer. If
Messrs. Perlot and Lawler tender their shares in accordance with the terms of the Shareholder's Agreements, and if the Company complies with certain covenants contained in the Merger Agreement
not to issue any additional securities, the Minimum Condition should be satisfied. If the Minimum Condition is satisfied, and Purchaser accepts for payment Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer,
Parent will be able to elect a majority of the members of the Company's Board of Directors and to effect the Merger without the affirmative vote of any other shareholder of the Company. See
Section 12. 

    Certain
U.S. federal income tax consequences of the sale of Shares pursuant to the Offer and the conversion of Shares pursuant to the Merger are described in Section 5. 

THIS OFFER TO PURCHASE AND THE RELATED LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND SHOULD BE READ CAREFULLY AND IN THEIR ENTIRETY BEFORE ANY
DECISION IS MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE OFFER.

THE TENDER OFFER    

1.  Terms of the Offer  

    Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer, Purchaser will accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered prior to the Expiration
Date and not theretofore withdrawn in accordance with Section 3. The term "Expiration Date" means 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Wednesday, August 1, 2001, unless and until
Purchaser shall have extended the period of time during which the Offer is open in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, in which event the term "Expiration Date" shall mean the latest
time and date on which the Offer, as so extended by Purchaser, will expire. 

    Purchaser
may, without the consent of the Company, and expressly reserves the right (but shall not be obligated) to extend the Offer, and thereby delay acceptance for payment of, and
the payment for, any Shares, by giving oral or written notice of such extension to the Depositary, (a) if at the Expiration Date any of the conditions to Purchaser's obligation to purchase
Shares are not satisfied, until such time as such conditions are satisfied or waived, (b) for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the Commission or the
staff thereof applicable to the Offer, or (c) if all conditions to Purchaser's obligation to accept for payment and pay for Common Shares are satisfied or waived but the number of Shares
tendered is less than 90% of the then outstanding number of Shares, for an aggregate period of not more than 20 business days (for all such extensions) beyond the latest expiration date that would
otherwise be permitted by clause (a) or (b) of this sentence. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL INTEREST BE PAID ON THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR TENDERED SHARES, REGARDLESS OF ANY EXTENSION OF OR
AMENDMENT TO THE OFFER OR ANY DELAY IN PAYING FOR SUCH SHARES. 

    Purchaser
expressly reserves the right (but shall not be obligated), at any time and from time to time, to waive any condition to the Offer or modify the terms of the Offer, by giving
oral or written notice of such waiver or modification to the Depositary, except that, without the consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not (i) reduce the number of Shares subject to the
Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price or change the form of consideration to be paid pursuant to the Offer, (iii) amend or waive the Minimum Condition or impose additional conditions to the
Offer, (iv) except as set forth in the preceding paragraph, extend the Offer, or (v) otherwise amend the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of Shares. 

    If
by 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Wednesday, August 1, 2001 (or any date or time then set as the Expiration Date), any of or all the conditions to the Offer have not
been satisfied or waived, Purchaser, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, reserves the right (but shall not be obligated)
(a) to terminate the Offer and not accept for payment or pay for any Shares and return all tendered Shares to tendering shareholders, (b) except as set forth above with respect to the
Minimum Condition, to waive all the unsatisfied conditions and accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered prior to the Expiration Date and not theretofore validly withdrawn,
(c) as set forth above, to extend the Offer and, subject to the right of shareholders to withdraw Shares until the Expiration Date, retain the Shares that have been tendered during the period
or periods for which the Offer is extended, or (d) except as set forth above, to amend the Offer. 

    Any
extension, waiver, amendment or termination will be followed as promptly as practicable by public announcement thereof. An announcement in the case of an extension will be made no
later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the next business day after the previously scheduled Expiration Date. Without limiting the manner in which Purchaser may choose to make any public
announcement, subject to applicable law (including Rules 14d-4(d), 14d-6(c) and 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
Act"), which require that material changes be promptly disseminated to holders of Shares), Purchaser will have no obligation to publish, advertise or otherwise communicate 

any such public announcement other than by issuing a release to the PR Newswire news service. As used in this Offer to Purchase, "Business Day" has the meaning set forth in
Rule 14d-1 under the Exchange Act. 

    If
Purchaser makes a material change in the terms of the Offer or the information concerning the Offer or waives a material condition of the Offer, Purchaser will disseminate
additional tender offer materials and extend the Offer to the extent required by Rules 14d-4(d), 14d-6(c) and 14e-1 under the Exchange Act. The minimum
period during which an offer must remain open following material changes in the terms of such offer or information concerning such offer, other than a change in price or a change in the percentage of
securities sought, will depend upon the facts and circumstances then existing, including the relative materiality of the changed terms or information. With respect to a change in price or a change in
the percentage of securities sought, a minimum period of 10 business days is generally required to allow for adequate dissemination to shareholders. 

    Pursuant
to Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act, although Purchaser does not currently intend to do so, Purchaser may, subject to certain conditions, elect to
provide a subsequent offering period of from three business days to 20 business days in length following the expiration of the Offer on the Expiration Date and acceptance for payment of the Shares
tendered in the Offer (a "Subsequent Offering Period"). A Subsequent Offering Period would be an additional period of time, following the expiration of the Offer and the purchase of Shares in the
Offer, during which shareholders may tender Shares not tendered in the Offer. A Subsequent Offering Period, if one is included, is not an extension of the Offer, which already will have been
completed. 

    During
a Subsequent Offering Period, if any, tendering shareholders will not have withdrawal rights and Purchaser will promptly purchase and pay for any Shares tendered at the same
price paid in the Offer. Rule 14d-11 provides that Purchaser may provide a Subsequent Offering Period so long as, among other things, (i) the initial 20-business
day period of the Offer has expired, (ii) Purchaser offers the same form and amount of consideration for Shares in the Subsequent Offering Period as in the initial Offer, (iii) Purchaser
immediately accepts and promptly pays for all securities tendered during the Offer prior to its expiration, (iv) Purchaser announces the results of the Offer, including the approximate number
and percentage of Shares deposited in the Offer, no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the next business day after the Expiration Date and immediately begins the Subsequent Offering
Period, and (v) Purchaser immediately accepts and promptly pays for Shares as they are tendered during the Subsequent Offering Period. Purchaser will be able to include a Subsequent Offering
Period, if it satisfies the conditions above, after August 1, 2001. 

    PURCHASER
DOES NOT CURRENTLY INTEND TO INCLUDE A SUBSEQUENT OFFERING PERIOD IN THE OFFER, ALTHOUGH IT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO DO SO IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION. PURSUANT TO RULE
14d-7 UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT, NO WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS APPLY TO SHARES TENDERED DURING A SUBSEQUENT OFFERING PERIOD AND NO WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS APPLY DURING THE SUBSEQUENT OFFERING PERIOD WITH
RESPECT TO SHARES TENDERED IN THE OFFER AND ACCEPTED FOR PAYMENT. THE SAME CONSIDERATION WILL BE PAID TO SHAREHOLDERS TENDERING SHARES IN THE OFFER OR IN A SUBSEQUENT OFFERING PERIOD, IF ONE IS
INCLUDED. 

    The
Company has provided Purchaser with the Company's shareholder lists and security position listings for the purpose of disseminating the Offer to holders of Shares. This Offer to
Purchase, the related Letter of Transmittal and other relevant materials will be mailed to record holders of Shares, and will be furnished to brokers, dealers, banks, trust companies and similar
persons whose names, or the names of whose nominees, appear on the shareholder lists, or, if applicable, who are listed as participants in a clearing agency's security position listing, for subsequent
transmittal to beneficial owners of Shares. 

2.  Procedures for Tendering Shares  

    Valid Tender.
  For a shareholder validly to tender Shares pursuant to the Offer: (a) the certificates for
tendered Shares, together with a Letter of Transmittal (or facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed, any required signature guarantees and any other required documents, must, prior to
the
Expiration Date, be received by the Depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the back cover of this Offer to Purchase; (b) in the case of a transfer effected pursuant to the
book-entry transfer procedures described under "Book-Entry Transfer", either a Letter of Transmittal (or facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed, and any
required signature guarantees, or an Agent's Message (as defined below), and any other required documents, must be received by the Depositary at one of such addresses, such Shares must be delivered
pursuant to the book-entry transfer procedures described below and a Book-Entry Confirmation (as defined below) must be received by the Depositary, in each case prior to the
Expiration Date; or (c) the tendering shareholder must, prior to the Expiration Date, comply with the guaranteed delivery procedures described below under "Guaranteed Delivery". 

    The
valid tender of Shares pursuant to one of the procedures described above will constitute a binding agreement between the tendering shareholder and Purchaser upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Offer. 

    THE
METHOD OF DELIVERY OF SHARES, THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND ALL OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING DELIVERY THROUGH THE BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER FACILITY (AS DEFINED
BELOW), IS AT THE ELECTION AND RISK OF THE TENDERING SHAREHOLDER. SHARES WILL BE DEEMED DELIVERED ONLY WHEN ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY (INCLUDING, IN THE CASE OF A BOOK-ENTRY
TRANSFER, BY BOOK-ENTRY CONFIRMATION). IF DELIVERY IS BY MAIL, REGISTERED MAIL WITH RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, PROPERLY INSURED, IS RECOMMENDED. IN ALL CASES, SUFFICIENT TIME SHOULD BE
ALLOWED TO ENSURE TIMELY DELIVERY. 

    Book-Entry Transfer.
  The Depositary will establish an account with respect to the Shares at The Depository
Trust Company (the "Book-Entry Transfer Facility") for purposes of the Offer within two business days after the date of this Offer to Purchase. Any financial institution that is a
participant of the Book-Entry Transfer Facility's system may make book-entry delivery of Shares by causing the Book-Entry Transfer Facility to transfer such Shares
into the Depositary's account in accordance with the Book-Entry Transfer Facility's procedures for such transfer. HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH DELIVERY OF SHARES MAY BE EFFECTED THROUGH
BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER INTO THE DEPOSITARY'S ACCOUNT AT THE BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER FACILITY, THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL (OR FACSIMILE THEREOF), PROPERLY COMPLETED AND DULY EXECUTED,
WITH ANY REQUIRED SIGNATURE GUARANTEES, OR AN AGENT'S MESSAGE, AND ANY OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS, MUST BE, IN ANY CASE, RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY AT ONE OF ITS ADDRESSES SET FORTH ON THE BACK COVER OF
THIS OFFER TO PURCHASE PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATE FOR A VALID TENDER OF SHARES BY BOOK-ENTRY. The confirmation of a book-entry transfer of Shares into the Depositary's
account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility as described above is referred to herein as a "Book-Entry Confirmation". DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS TO THE BOOK-ENTRY
TRANSFER FACILITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER FACILITY'S PROCEDURES DOES NOT CONSTITUTE DELIVERY TO THE DEPOSITARY. 

    The
term "Agent's Message" means a message, transmitted by the Book-Entry Transfer Facility to, and received by, the Depositary and forming a part of a
Book-Entry Confirmation, which states that the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility has received an express acknowledgment from the participant in the Book-Entry Transfer Facility tendering the Shares that such participant has
received and agrees to be 

bound by the terms of the Letter of Transmittal and that Purchaser may enforce such agreement against the participant. 

    Signature Guarantees.
  No signature guarantee is required on the Letter of Transmittal if (a) the Letter of
Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) (which term, for purposes of this Section 2, includes any participant in the Book-Entry Transfer Facility's system whose name
appears on a security position listing as the owner of the Shares) of Shares tendered therewith and such registered holder has not completed either the box entitled "Special Delivery Instructions" or
the box entitled "Special Payment Instructions" on the Letter of Transmittal, or (b) such Shares are tendered for the account of a financial institution (including most commercial banks,
savings and loan associations and brokerage houses) that is a participant in the Security Transfer Agents Medallion Program, Nasdaq Stock Market Medallion Signature Guarantee Program or the Stock
Exchange Medallion Program (such participant, an "Eligible Institution"). In all other cases, all signatures on the Letter of Transmittal must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution. See
Instructions 1 and 5 to the Letter of Transmittal. If the certificates for Shares are registered in the name of a person other than the signer of the Letter of Transmittal, or if payment is to be made
or certificates for Shares not tendered or not accepted for payment are to be returned to a person other than the registered holder of the certificates surrendered, the tendered certificates must be
endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either case signed exactly as the name or names of the registered holders or owners appear on the certificates, with the signatures on the
certificates or stock powers guaranteed as aforesaid. See Instructions 1 and 5 to the Letter of Transmittal. 

    Guaranteed Delivery.
  If a shareholder desires to tender Shares pursuant to the Offer and such shareholder's
certificates for Shares are not immediately available or the book-entry transfer procedures cannot be completed on a timely basis or time will not permit all required documents to reach
the Depositary prior to the Expiration Date, such shareholder's tender may be effected if all the following conditions are met: 

    (a) such
tender is made by or through an Eligible Institution; 

    (b) a
properly completed and duly executed Notice of Guaranteed Delivery, substantially in the form provided by Purchaser, is received by the Depositary at one of its
addresses set forth on the back cover of this Offer to Purchase prior to the Expiration Date; and 

    (c) either
(i) the certificates for tendered Shares together with a Letter of Transmittal (or facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed, and any
required signature guarantees, and any other
required documents are received by the Depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the back cover of this Offer to Purchase within three Trading Days after the date of execution of such Notice of
Guaranteed Delivery or (ii) in the case of a book-entry transfer effected pursuant to the book-entry transfer procedures described above under "Book-Entry
Transfer", either a Letter of Transmittal (or facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed, and any required signature guarantees, or an Agent's Message, and any other required documents,
is received by the Depositary at one of such addresses, such Shares are delivered pursuant to the book-entry transfer procedures above and a Book-Entry Confirmation is received
by the Depositary, in each case within three Trading Days after the date of execution of such Notice of Guaranteed Delivery. A "Trading Day" is any day on which the Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq") is
open for business. 

    The
Notice of Guaranteed Delivery may be delivered by hand to the Depositary or transmitted by telegram, facsimile transmission or mail to the Depositary and must include a guarantee
by an Eligible Institution in the form set forth in such Notice of Guaranteed Delivery. 

    Other Requirements.
  Notwithstanding any provision hereof, payment for Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer
will in all cases be made only after timely receipt by the Depositary of 

(a) certificates for (or a timely Book-Entry Confirmation with respect to) such Shares, (b) a Letter of Transmittal (or facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly
executed, with any required signature guarantees (or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an Agent's Message in lieu of the Letter of Transmittal) and (c) any other documents
required by the Letter of Transmittal. Accordingly, tendering shareholders may be paid at different times depending upon when certificates for Shares or Book-Entry Confirmations with
respect to Shares are actually received by the Depositary. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL INTEREST BE PAID BY PURCHASER ON THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE SHARES, REGARDLESS OF ANY EXTENSION OF THE OFFER OR
ANY DELAY IN MAKING SUCH PAYMENT. 

    Appointment.
  By executing a Letter of Transmittal (or facsimile thereof), (or, in the case of a book-entry
transfer, by delivery of an Agent's Message, in lieu of a Letter of Transmittal), a tendering shareholder will irrevocably appoint designees of Purchaser as such shareholder's
attorneys-in-fact and proxies in the manner set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, each with full power of substitution, to the full extent of such shareholder's rights with
respect to the Shares tendered by such shareholder and accepted for payment by Purchaser and with respect to any and all other Shares or other securities or rights issued or issuable in respect of
such Shares on or after the date of this Offer to Purchase. All such proxies will be considered coupled with an interest in the tendered Shares. Such appointment will be effective when, and only to
the extent that, Purchaser accepts for payment Shares tendered by such shareholder as provided herein. Upon the effectiveness of such appointment, all prior powers of attorney, proxies and consents
given by such shareholder with respect to such Shares or other securities or rights will, without further action, be revoked and no subsequent powers of attorney, proxies, consents or revocations may
be given (and, if given, will not be effective). The designees of Purchaser will thereby be empowered to exercise all voting and other rights with respect to such Shares and other securities or rights
in respect of any annual, special or adjourned meeting of the Company's shareholders, actions by
written consent in lieu of any such meeting or otherwise, as they in their sole discretion deem proper. Purchaser reserves the right to require that, in order for Shares to be deemed validly tendered,
immediately upon Purchaser's acceptance for payment of such Shares, Purchaser must be able to exercise full voting, consent and other rights with respect to such Shares and other securities or rights,
including voting at any meeting of shareholders. 

    Determination of Validity.
  All questions as to the validity, form, eligibility (including time of receipt) and
acceptance of any tender of Shares will be determined by Purchaser in its sole discretion, which determination will be final and binding. Purchaser reserves the absolute right to reject any or all
tenders determined by it not to be in proper form or the acceptance for payment of or payment for which may, in the opinion of Purchaser, be unlawful. Purchaser also reserves the absolute right to
waive any defect or irregularity in the tender of any Shares of any particular shareholder whether or not similar defects or irregularities are waived in the case of other shareholders. No tender of
Shares will be deemed to have been validly made until all defects or irregularities relating thereto have been cured or waived. None of Purchaser, Parent, the Company, the Depositary, the Information
Agent, the Dealer Manager or any other person will be under any duty to give notification of any defects or irregularities in tenders or incur any liability for failure to give any such notification.
Purchaser's interpretation of the terms and conditions of the Offer (including the Letter of Transmittal and the instructions thereto and any other related documents thereto) will be final and
binding. 

    Backup Withholding.
  In order to avoid "backup withholding" of U.S. federal income tax on payments of cash pursuant to
the Offer, a shareholder surrendering Shares in the Offer must, unless an exemption applies, provide the Depositary with such shareholder's correct taxpayer identification number ("TIN") on a
Substitute Form W-9 and certify under penalties of perjury that such TIN is correct and that such shareholder is not subject to backup withholding. If a shareholder does not provide
such shareholder's correct TIN or fails to provide the certifications described above, the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") may impose a penalty on such shareholder and payment of cash 

to such shareholder pursuant to the Offer may be subject to backup withholding at a rate of 31%. All shareholders surrendering Shares pursuant to the Offer should complete and sign the main signature
form and the Substitute Form W-9 included as part of the Letter of Transmittal to provide the information and certification necessary to avoid backup withholding (unless an
applicable exemption exists and is proved in a manner satisfactory to Purchaser and the Depositary). Certain shareholders (including, among others, all corporations and certain foreign individuals and
entities) are not subject to backup withholding. Noncorporate foreign shareholders should complete and sign the main signature form and a Form W-8BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status
of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding, a copy of which may be obtained from the Depositary, in order to avoid backup withholding. See Instruction 9 to the Letter of Transmittal. 

3.  Withdrawal Rights  

    Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3 hereof, tenders of Shares are irrevocable. Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer may be withdrawn
pursuant to the procedures set forth below at any time prior to the Expiration Date, except (i) that tendered Shares may also be withdrawn at any time after September 3, 2001 unless
accepted for payment before then as provided in this Offer to Purchase, and (ii) as provided below with respect to a Subsequent Offering Period. 

    For
a withdrawal to be effective, a written or facsimile transmission notice of withdrawal must be timely received by the Depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the back
cover of this Offer to Purchase and must specify the name of the person having tendered the Shares to be withdrawn, the number of Shares to be withdrawn and the name of the registered holder of the
Shares to be withdrawn, if different from the name of the person who tendered the Shares. If certificates for Shares have been delivered or otherwise identified to the Depositary, then, prior to the
physical release of such certificates, the serial numbers shown on such certificates must be submitted to the Depositary and, unless such Shares have been tendered by an Eligible Institution, any and
all signatures on the notice of withdrawal must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution. If Shares have been tendered pursuant to the book-entry transfer procedures described in
Section 2, any notice of withdrawal must also specify the name and number of the account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility to be credited with the withdrawn Shares and otherwise
comply with the Book-Entry Transfer Facility's procedures. Withdrawals of tenders of Shares may not be rescinded, and any Shares properly withdrawn will thereafter be deemed not validly
tendered for purposes of the Offer. However, withdrawn Shares may be retendered by again following one of the procedures described in Section 2 at any time prior to the Expiration Date. 

    All
questions as to the form and validity (including time of receipt) of any notice of withdrawal will be determined by Purchaser in its sole discretion, which determination will be
final and binding. None of Purchaser, Parent, the Company, the Depositary, the Information Agent, the Dealer Manager or any other person will be under any duty to give notification of any defects or
irregularities in any notice of withdrawal or incur any liability for failure to give any such notification. 

    In
the event Purchaser provides a Subsequent Offering Period following the Offer, no withdrawal rights will apply to Shares tendered during such Subsequent Offering Period or to
Shares tendered in the Offer and accepted for payment. 

4.  Acceptance for Payment and Payment  

    Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer (including, if the Offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of any such extension or
amendment), Purchaser will accept for payment and will pay for all Shares validly tendered prior to the Expiration Date and not properly withdrawn in accordance with Section 3 hereof promptly
after the Expiration Date. Purchaser, subject to the Merger Agreement, expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to delay acceptance for 

payment of or payment for Shares in order to comply in whole or in part with any applicable law. Any such delays will be effected in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange
Act (relating to a bidder's obligation to pay for or return tendered securities promptly after the termination or withdrawal of such bidder's offer). 

    In
all cases, payment for Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer will be made only after timely receipt by the Depositary of: (a) the certificates for such Shares,
together with a Letter of Transmittal (or facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed, and any required signature guarantees; or (b) in the case of a transfer effected pursuant to
the book-entry transfer procedures described in Section 2, a Book-Entry Confirmation and either a Letter of Transmittal (or facsimile thereof), properly completed and
duly executed, and any required signature guarantees, or an Agent's Message, and any other required documents. Accordingly, tendering shareholders may be paid at different times depending upon when
certificates for Shares or Book-Entry Confirmations with respect to Shares are actually received by the Depositary. 

    The
per Share consideration paid to any shareholder pursuant to the Offer will be the highest per Share consideration paid to any other shareholder pursuant to the Offer. 

    For
purposes of the Offer, Purchaser will be deemed to have accepted for payment, and thereby purchased, Shares validly tendered to Purchaser and not properly withdrawn as, if and
when Purchaser gives oral or written notice to the Depositary of Purchaser's acceptance for payment of such Shares. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer, payment for Shares
accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer will be made by deposit of the purchase price therefor with the Depositary, which will act as an agent for tendering shareholders for the purpose of
receiving payment from Purchaser and transmitting payment to tendering shareholders whose Shares have been accepted for payment. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL INTEREST BE PAID ON THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR
TENDERED SHARES, REGARDLESS OF ANY EXTENSION OF OR AMENDMENT TO THE OFFER OR ANY DELAY IN PAYING FOR SUCH SHARES. 

    If
Purchaser is delayed in its acceptance for payment of or payment for Shares or is unable to accept for payment or pay for Shares pursuant to the Offer for any reason, then, without
prejudice to Purchaser's rights under the Offer (but subject to compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to a bidder's obligation to pay for or return tendered
securities promptly after the termination or withdrawal of such bidder's offer) and the terms of the Merger Agreement (requiring that Purchaser pay for Shares accepted for payment promptly after the
Expiration Date)), the Depositary may, nevertheless, on behalf of Purchaser, retain tendered Shares, and such Shares may not be withdrawn except to the extent tendering shareholders are entitled to do
so as described in Section 3 hereof. 

    If
any tendered Shares are not accepted for payment pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Offer for any reason, the certificates for such Shares will be returned (and, if
certificates are submitted for
more Shares than are tendered, new certificates for the Shares not tendered will be sent) in each case without expense to the tendering shareholder (or, in the case of Shares delivered by
book-entry transfer of such Shares into the Depositary's account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility pursuant to the book-entry transfer procedures described in
Section 2 hereof, such Shares will be credited to an account maintained at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility), as promptly as practicable after the expiration or termination of the
Offer. 

5.  Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences  

    The receipt of cash pursuant to the Offer or the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), and may also be a taxable transaction under applicable state, local or foreign income or other tax laws. Generally, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a tendering
shareholder will recognize gain or loss 

equal to the difference between the amount of cash received by the shareholder pursuant to the Offer or Merger and the shareholder's aggregate adjusted tax basis in the Shares tendered by the
shareholder and purchased pursuant to the Offer or converted into cash in the Merger, as the case may be. Gain or loss will be calculated separately for each block of Shares tendered and purchased
pursuant to the Offer or converted into cash in the Merger, as the case may be. 

    If
tendered Shares are held by a tendering shareholder as capital assets, gain or loss recognized by such shareholder will be capital gain or loss, which will be long-term
capital gain or loss if such shareholder's holding period for the Shares exceeds one year. In the case of a tendering noncorporate shareholder, long-term capital gains will be eligible for
a maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of 20%. In addition, there are limits on the deductibility of capital losses. 

    A
shareholder (other than certain exempt shareholders including, among others, all corporations and certain foreign individuals) that tenders Shares may be subject to 31% backup
withholding unless the shareholder provides its TIN and certifies under penalty of perjury that such TIN is correct (or properly certifies that it is awaiting a TIN) and certifies as to no loss of
exemption from backup withholding and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. A shareholder that does not furnish a required TIN or that does not otherwise
establish a basis for an exemption from backup withholding may be subject to a penalty imposed by the IRS. See "Backup Withholding" under Section 2 hereof. Each shareholder should complete and
sign the Substitute Form W-9 included as part of the Letter of Transmittal so as to provide the information and certification necessary to avoid backup withholding. 

    If
backup withholding applies to a shareholder, the Depositary is required to withhold 31% of any amounts which would otherwise be paid to such shareholder. Backup withholding is not
an additional
tax. Rather, the amount of the backup withholding can be credited against the U.S. federal income tax liability of the person subject to the backup withholding, provided that the required information
is given to the IRS. If backup withholding results in an overpayment of tax, a refund can be obtained by the shareholder by filing a U.S. federal income tax return. 

    The
foregoing discussion is based on the Code, regulations issued thereunder, judicial decisions and administrative rulings, all of which are subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect. The foregoing discussion may not be applicable with respect to Shares received pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation or with respect to
holders of Shares who are subject to special tax treatment under the Codesuch as non-U.S. persons, insurance companies, dealers or brokers in securities or currencies,
tax-exempt organizations and financial institutionsand may not apply to a holder of Shares in light of individual circumstances, such as holding Shares as a hedge or as part
of a hedging, straddle, conversion, synthetic security, integrated investment or other risk-reduction transaction. SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS TO DETERMINE THE
PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM (INCLUDING THE APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN INCOME AND OTHER TAX LAWS) OF THE OFFER AND THE MERGER.

    On
June 22, 2001, the last full trading day before the public announcement of the execution of the Merger Agreement, the last reported sales price of the Shares on Nasdaq was
$3.00 per Share. On July 2, 2001, the last reported sales price of the Shares on Nasdaq was $3.65 per Share. SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO OBTAIN CURRENT MARKET QUOTATIONS FOR THE SHARES. 

7.  Effect of the Offer on the Market for the Shares; Nasdaq Listing; Exchange Act Registration; Margin Regulations  

    Market for the Shares.
  The purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer will reduce the number of holders of Shares and the
number of Shares that might otherwise trade publicly and could adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the remaining Shares held by the public. 

    Nasdaq Listing.
  Parent intends to cause the shares to be delisted from Nasdaq promptly upon completion of the Merger. 

    Even
if the Merger is not completed, if Shares are purchased pursuant to the Offer the Company may no longer meet the requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq, depending upon the
number of Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer. According to Nasdaq's published guidelines, Nasdaq would consider disqualifying the Shares for listing on the Nasdaq National Market (though not
necessarily from the Nasdaq SmallCap Market) if, among other possible grounds, the number of publicly held Shares falls below 750,000, the total number of beneficial holders of round lots of Shares
falls below 400 holders, or the market value of publicly held Shares over a 30 consecutive business day period is less than $5,000,000. Furthermore, Nasdaq would consider delisting the Shares from
Nasdaq altogether if, among other possible grounds, the number of publicly held Shares falls below 500,000, the total number of beneficial holders of round lots of Shares falls below 300, or the
market value of publicly held Shares over a 30 consecutive business day period is less than $1,000,000. Shares held by officers or directors of the Company, or by any beneficial owner of more than 10%
of the Shares, are not considered to be publicly held for this purpose. According to the Company, as of June 23, 2001, there were 5,745,599 Shares outstanding. If, as a result of the purchase
of Shares pursuant to the Offer or otherwise, the Shares no longer meet the requirements of Nasdaq for continued listing and the Shares 

are either no longer eligible for the Nasdaq National Market or are delisted from Nasdaq altogether, the market for Shares will be adversely affected. 

    If
Nasdaq were to delist the Shares, it is possible that the Shares would continue to trade on other securities exchanges or in the over-the-counter market and
that price quotations would be reported by such exchanges. The extent of the public market for the Shares and the availability of such quotations would, however, depend upon the number of holders of
Shares remaining at such time, the level of interest in maintaining a market in Shares on the part of securities firms, the possible termination of registration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as
described below, and other factors. 

    Exchange Act Registration.
  The Shares are currently registered under the Exchange Act. Such registration may be
terminated upon application of the Company to the Commission if the Shares are neither listed on a national securities exchange nor held by 300 or more holders of record. Termination of registration
of the Shares under the Exchange Act would reduce the information required to be furnished by the Company to its shareholders and to the Commission and would make certain provisions of the Exchange
Act no longer applicable to the Company, such as the short-swing profit recovery provisions of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act and the requirement of furnishing a proxy statement pursuant to
Section 14(a) or 14(c) of the Exchange Act in connection with shareholders' meetings and the related requirement of furnishing an annual report to shareholders. Furthermore, the ability of
"affiliates" of the Company and persons holding "restricted securities" of the Company to dispose of such securities pursuant to Rule 144 or 144A promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, may be impaired or eliminated. Purchaser intends to seek to cause the Company to apply for termination of registration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as soon after the completion of
the Offer as the requirements for such termination are met. 

    Margin Regulations.
  The Shares are currently "margin securities" under the regulations of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board"), which has the effect, among other things, of allowing brokers to extend credit on the collateral of the Shares. Depending upon factors similar to
those described above regarding listing and market quotations, it is possible that, following the Offer, the Shares would no longer constitute "margin securities" for the purposes of the margin
regulations of the Federal Reserve Board and therefore could no longer be used as collateral for loans made by brokers. 

8.  Certain Information Concerning the Company  

    The Company is an Oregon corporation with its principal offices at 20545 Murray Road, Bend, Oregon 97708, telephone number (541) 389-1144.
According to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000, the Company's principal business is manufacturing motor coaches. 

    Certain Company Projections.
  During the course of discussions between representatives of Parent and the Company, the
Company provided Parent or its representatives with certain non-public business and financial information about the Company. This information included the following projections of sales
and net income for the Company for the year 2001: 

(in thousands)

Sales

$

178,492

Net Income

    The
projections for fiscal year 2001 were based in part upon actual financial information for the first fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2001. The Company has advised Purchaser
and Parent that the Company does not as a matter of course make public any projections as to future performance or earnings, and that the projections set forth above are included in this Offer to
Purchase only because 

this information was provided to Parent in connection with Parent's evaluation of the proposed acquisition of the Company by Parent pursuant to the Offer and Merger. The projections were not prepared
with a view to public disclosure or compliance with the published guidelines of the Commission or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants regarding
projections or forecasts. The projections do not purport to present operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and the Company's independent auditors have not examined or
compiled the projections and accordingly assume no responsibility for them. The Company has advised Purchaser and Parent that its internal financial forecasts (upon which the projections provided to
Parent and Purchaser were based in part) are, in general, prepared solely for internal use and capital budgeting and other management decisions and are subjective and susceptible to interpretations
and periodic revision based on actual experience and business developments. The Company has advised Parent and Purchaser that, although the projections are presented with numerical specificity, the
projections reflect numerous assumptions made by management of the Company, with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters,
including effective tax rates consistent with historical levels for the Company and expected debt payments, all of which are difficult to predict, many of which are beyond the Company's control, and
none of which were subject to approval by Parent or Purchaser. The foregoing information is forward-looking in nature and inherently subject to significant uncertainties, risks and contingencies,
including industry performance, general business and economic conditions, customer requirements, competition, adverse changes in applicable laws, regulations or rules governing environmental, tax,
accounting and other matters. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the assumptions made in preparing the projections will prove accurate or that any of the projections will be realized. It is
expected that there will be differences between actual and projected results, and actual results may be materially greater or less than those contained in the projections. The Company has informed
Parent that the Company's actual financial results for the month of April 2001 were in fact lower than the Company's projection for that month, and that the Company expects its financial
results for the second quarter to be lower than its projection for that quarter. The inclusion of the projections herein are not an indication that any of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or their
respective affiliates or
representatives considered or consider the projections to be a reliable prediction of future events, and the projections should not be relied upon as such. None of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or
any of their respective affiliates or representatives has made or makes any representation to any person regarding the ultimate performance of the Company compared to the information contained in the
projections, and none of them intends to update or otherwise revise the projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the
event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the projections are shown to be in error. The projections have not been adjusted to reflect the effects of the Offer or the Merger or the potential
combined operations of Parent and the Company or any alterations Parent may make to the Company's operations or strategy after consummation of the Merger. 

    Available Information.
  The Company is subject to the informational requirements of the Exchange Act and, in accordance
therewith, is required to file reports and other information with the Commission relating to its business, financial condition and other matters. Certain information as of particular dates concerning
the Company's directors and officers, their remuneration, stock options and other matters, the principal holders of the Company's securities and any material interest of such persons in transactions
with the Company is required to be disclosed in the Company's proxy statements distributed to the Company's shareholders and filed with the Commission. Such reports, proxy statements and other
information should be available for inspection at the public reference facilities of the Commission at 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549, and at the regional offices of the Commission
located at Seven World Trade Center, 13th Floor, New York, New York 10048 and Northwestern Atrium Center, 500 West Madison Street, Suite 1400, Chicago, Illinois 60661. Copies of such information
should be obtainable, by mail, upon payment of the Commission's 

customary charges, by writing to the Commission's principal office at 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. The Commission also maintains a web site on the internet at http://www.sec.gov
that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding registrants that are filed electronically with the Commission. 

    Except
as otherwise stated in this Offer to Purchase, the information concerning the Company contained herein has been taken from or based upon publicly available documents on file
with the Commission and other publicly available information. Although Parent and Purchaser do not have any knowledge that any such information is untrue, neither Purchaser nor Parent takes any
responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of such information or for any failure by the Company to disclose events that may have occurred and may affect the significance or accuracy of any such
information. 

9.  Certain Information Concerning Parent and Purchaser  

    Purchaser, an Oregon corporation that is a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, was organized to acquire the Company and has not conducted any unrelated
activities since its organization. All outstanding shares of capital stock of Purchaser are owned by Parent. 

    Parent
is a Delaware corporation. The principal office of Parent is located at 91320 Industrial Way, Coburg, Oregon 97408, telephone (541) 686-8011. The principal
office of Purchaser is located at care of Parent. 

    The
name, citizenship, business address, present principal occupation or employment and five-year employment history of each of the directors and executive officers of
Purchaser and Parent are set forth in Schedule I hereto. 

    During
the last five years, none of Purchaser or Parent or, to the best knowledge of Purchaser or Parent, any of the persons listed on Schedule I to the Offer to Purchase
(i) has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or (ii) was a party to any judicial or administrative proceeding (except for
matters that were dismissed without sanction or settlement) that resulted in a judgment, decree or final order enjoining the person from future violations of, or prohibiting activities subject to,
federal or state securities laws, or a finding of any violation of such laws. 

    Except
as described in this Offer to Purchase, neither Purchaser nor Parent, nor, to the knowledge of Purchaser or Parent, any of the persons listed in Schedule I or any
associate or majority-owned subsidiary of Purchaser or Parent or any of the persons so listed, beneficially owns any equity security of the Company, and neither Purchaser nor Parent nor, to the
knowledge of Purchaser or Parent, any of the other persons or entities referred to above, or any of the respective directors, executive officers or subsidiaries of any of the foregoing, has effected
any transaction in any equity security of the Company during the past 60 days. 

    Except
as described in this Offer to Purchase or the Schedule TO filed by Parent with the Commission and to which this Offer to Purchase constitutes an exhibit (the "Schedule TO"),
(a) there have not been any contacts, transactions or negotiations between Purchaser or Parent, any of their respective subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of Purchaser or Parent, any of the
persons listed in Schedule I, on the one hand, and the Company or any of its directors, officers or affiliates, on the other hand, that are required to be disclosed pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the Commission and (b) neither Purchaser nor Parent nor, to the knowledge of Purchaser or Parent, any of the persons listed in Schedule I has any contract, arrangement,
understanding or relationship with any person with respect to any securities of the Company. 

    Because
the only consideration in the Offer and Merger is cash and the Offer covers all outstanding Shares, and in view of the absence of a financing condition and the amount of
consideration payable in relation to the financial capacity of Parent and its affiliates, Purchaser believes 

the financial condition of Parent and its affiliates is not material to a decision by a holder of Shares whether to sell, tender or hold Shares pursuant to the Offer. 

10.  Source and Amount of Funds  

    The Offer is not conditioned on any financing arrangements. 

    The
total amount of funds required by Purchaser to purchase all outstanding Shares pursuant to the Offer and to pay fees and expenses related to the Offer and the Merger is estimated
to be approximately $24.5 million. Purchaser plans to obtain all funds needed for the Offer and the Merger through capital contributions or loans that will be made by Parent, either directly or
through one or more wholly owned subsidiaries of Parent, to Purchaser. Parent plans to obtain some or all of the funds necessary to purchase the Shares pursuant to the Offer through borrowing under
its existing credit facility (the "Credit Facility") with U.S. Bank N.A. ("U.S. Bank") and expects to obtain the balance of any required funds from internally generated funds of itself and its
subsidiaries. 

    In
addition to the consideration to be paid by Purchaser to tendering shareholders pursuant to the Offer, Parent intends to borrow an additional estimated approximately $15 to
18 million under its Credit Facility for the purpose of refinancing the Company's credit facility (likewise with U.S. Bank). 

    No
alternative financing plans or arrangements have been made in the event that Parent is unable to obtain sufficient funds in connection with the Offer and the Merger through
borrowings under the Credit Facility or from internally generated funds. Parent intends to repay borrowings under the Credit Facility from working capital and funds provided by future operations. 

11.  Contacts and Transactions with the Company; Background of the Offer  

    On February 16, 2001, the Company issued a press release disclosing that the Company had retained McDonald as its financial advisor to explore strategic
alternatives for the Company. 

    On
March 13, 2001, McDonald contacted Parent to determine whether Parent might be interested in pursuing an acquisition of or other potential business combination with the
Company. Parent indicated that it might be interested in such a transaction and, on March 21, 2001, Parent and McDonald, acting on behalf of itself and as agent for the Company, entered into a
confidentiality agreement concerning information to be provided to Parent by McDonald and the Company. After signing the confidentiality agreement on March 26, 2001, McDonald provided general
information and financial information concerning the Company to Parent for the purposes of determining whether it might be interested in
pursuing a transaction with the Company. Parent retained Salomon Smith Barney as its exclusive financial advisor in connection with a possible transaction involving the Company. 

    Following
review of the information provided to it, and review of public information about the Company, on April 27, 2001 Parent provided to Mathew M. Perlot, Chairman
of the Company, in care of McDonald, a non-binding indication of interest in acquiring the Company subject, among other things, to satisfactory completion of a due diligence process and execution of a
definitive agreement. McDonald responded by indicating that the Company was interested in having further discussions with Parent. 

    Senior
management of Parent and the Company, together with representatives of McDonald and Salomon Smith Barney, Stoel Rives LLP ("Stoel Rives"), legal advisors to the Company,
PricewaterhouseCoopers, independent auditors of Parent, and Ball Janik LLP, legal advisors to Mr. Perlot and Curtis W. Lawler, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, attended a meeting
on May 10, 2001 at the offices of Stoel Rives in Portland, Oregon. The parties discussed a potential acquisition of the Company by Parent and the form such an acquisition might take, which
discussion primarily focused on a potential purchase of all of the equity interest in the Company by Parent. The 

Company indicated at that meeting that an acquisition by Parent of the assets of the Company would not be acceptable. At the meeting, it was agreed that Parent would be given further access to the
Company's business information and the due diligence process began immediately. 

    Also
on May 10, 2001, management of Parent and Parent's representatives were granted access to a data room which contained due diligence information about the Company. 

    At
a regular meeting of Parent's Board of Directors held on May 17, 2001, a possible transaction with the Company was discussed. Messrs. Kay L. Toolson, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer, John W. Nepute, President, Richard E. Bond, Senior Vice President, Secretary and Chief Administrative Officer, and P. Martin Daley, Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer of Parent, attended the meeting. Management discussed the findings of its due diligence to date and discussion ensued regarding the potential merits and risks of such a
transaction. The Board affirmed the authority of Parent's officers to proceed with its due diligence process and authorized management to proceed with its investigation of a possible business
transaction with the Company and negotiation of the terms of such a transaction. The Board of Directors indicated to management that the transaction should be structured as a cash tender offer. 

    During
the latter half of May and the first half of June, Parent continued its due diligence investigation of the Company, including visits to the Company's manufacturing facilities.
On May 16, 2001, Stoel Rives sent an initial draft merger agreement to Parent and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati
("WSGR"), counsel to Parent. On June 13, 2001, WSGR sent a revised version of the draft merger agreement to Stoel Rives reflecting comments by WSGR and Parent. 

    Following
plant visits and evaluation of the items presented in the data room and throughout the diligence process, and following receipt of a revised version of the draft merger
agreement, on June 18, 2001, Parent's Board of Directors held a special telephonic meeting. Messrs. Toolson, Nepute, Bond and Daley, as well as representatives of WSGR, participated in the
telephone meeting. Management presented the results of the due diligence investigation of the Company. Discussion ensued regarding the benefits and risks of a potential business combination with the
Company and potential valuations of the Company. At the conclusion of the meeting, Parent's Board of Directors authorized Parent and its officers to make an offer to acquire the Company in the form of
a cash tender offer up to a given per share price ceiling, to negotiate, execute and deliver a definitive acquisition agreement, and to that end to make all related filings with the Commission and
take all other appropriate actions in furtherance of the foregoing. 

    On
June 18, pursuant to the Board's authorization and at Parent's direction, Salomon Smith Barney conveyed an offer to the Company. On June 19, Mr. Toolson subsequently
held a telephone conversation with Mr. Perlot to discuss Parent's offer. After some price negotiation, and upon Mr. Perlot's agreement to reduce certain retirement payments which would
have been due to him and to Mr. Lawler from the Company pursuant to certain retirement agreements between the Company and each of Mr. Perlot and Mr. Lawler, Mr. Toolson and Mr.
Perlot ultimately agreed on an acquisition price of $3.70 per Share for all outstanding shares of the Company in the form of a cash tender offer and back end merger, subject to approval by the
Company's Board of Directors. 

    Legal
advisors to each of the Company and Parent negotiated the terms of the Merger Agreement throughout the week of June 18. 

    On
June 21, 2001, the Company's Board of Directors held a meeting at which the Company's legal advisors and management updated the Company's Board of Directors on the status of
negotiations with Parent and informed the Board of Directors that nearly all substantive issues had been resolved, the Company's legal advisors made a presentation to the Board of Directors regarding
the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors and reviewed with the Board of Directors the terms of the proposed merger agreement with Parent and the regulatory filings and approvals that would be
required in connection 

with the proposed transaction, and McDonald made a financial presentation to the Board of Directors and rendered its written opinion to the Board of Directors to the effect that, as of that date, the
per Share consideration was fair to the Company shareholders from a financial point of view. The Board of Directors adjourned its meeting and agreed to meet again on June 22, 2001. 

    The
Company's Board of Directors met again on June 22, 2001. The Company's legal advisors and management updated the Board of Directors on the status of negotiations with Parent and
informed the Board of Directors that all substantive issues had been resolved. Afterwards, the Board of Directors by a unanimous vote of the directors present determined the Merger was fair to, and in
the best interests of, the Company and its shareholders and approved the terms of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the agreement, and authorized the execution of the Merger
Agreement and recommended that Company shareholders tender all their shares in the Offer. 

    On
June 22, 2001, the last trading day before the Merger Agreement was signed, the closing price of Company Common Stock was $3.00 per Share. 

    On
Saturday, June 23, 2001, Parent and the Company executed the Merger Agreement. Mr. Perlot and Mr. Lawler, who together own approximately 70% of the Company's outstanding
Common Stock, executed and delivered the Shareholder's Agreements agreeing to tender their Shares in the Offer. The agreement was announced in separate press releases issued by each of Parent and the
Company prior to the open of the stock exchanges on Monday, June 25, 2001. 

    During
the Offer, Parent intends to have ongoing contacts and negotiations with the Company and its directors, officers and shareholders. Other than as to Mr. Richard A.
Rouse, a director of Parent, who bought 5,000 Shares of the Company on October 21, 1998 at $5.00 per Share and sold all those Shares at a loss on June 15, 2000 for $3.1187 per Share, and
as to Mr. Kay L. Toolson, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Parent, who bought 10,000 Shares of the Company on dates ranging from October 16 to October 20, 1998
at an average purchase price of $4.99 per Share and sold all those Shares, along with an additional 100 Shares previously acquired by Mr. Toolson in 1995, at a loss on July 28, 2000 for
$3.25 per Share, to the knowledge of Parent and Purchaser, there have not been any transactions during the past two years between Parent or Purchaser or their executive officers or directors on the
one hand and the Company or any of its affiliates or any executive officer or director of the Company on the other hand that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the Commission. 

12.  Purpose of the Offer; the Merger Agreement; Plans for the Company  

Purpose  

    The purpose of the Offer and Merger is to enable Parent to acquire the entire equity interest in, and thus control of, the Company. The Offer, as the first
step in the acquisition of the Company, is intended to facilitate the acquisition of all the outstanding Shares or, if less, all Shares tendered and not withdrawn from the Offer, subject to the
conditions set forth above. The purpose of the Merger is to acquire any and all outstanding Shares not tendered and purchased pursuant to the Offer. 

Plans for the Company  

    If the Minimum Condition and the other conditions to the Offer have been satisfied and Purchaser purchases all shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, Parent
intends and will have the right to designate representatives to the Company's Board of Directors who will constitute a majority thereof and therefore control the Company. Following completion of the
Offer and the Merger, Parent intends to integrate the Company's operations with those of Parent under the direction of Parent's management. Parent's principal reason for acquiring the Company is to
complement Parent's operations and increase Parent's share of the Class A motor coach market. Parent intends to continue to review the Company 

and its assets, corporate structure, dividend policy, capitalization, operations, properties, policies, management and personnel and to consider, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, what, if
any, changes would be desirable in light of the circumstances then existing, and reserves the right to take such actions or effect such changes as it deems desirable. 

The Merger Agreement  

    The Merger Agreement provides that, following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions described below under "Conditions to the Merger", Purchaser will be
merged with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation, and each issued Share (other than Shares owned by Parent, Purchaser, or the Company, or by a subsidiary of Parent,
Purchaser or the Company, or by those shareholders, if any, who are entitled to and who properly exercise appraisal rights under Oregon law) will be converted into the right to receive the price per
Share paid pursuant to the Offer in cash, without interest thereon. 

    Vote Required to Approve Merger.
  The Oregon Business Corporation Act (the "OBCA") requires that, unless Purchaser has
acquired 90% or more of the Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Merger must be approved by the holders of a majority of the shares of the Company's stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the
question. Other than the Shares, there are no shares of any class of the Company's stock outstanding and the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation do not contain any provision that would reduce
the vote required by the Company's shareholders for approval of the Merger. Consequently, the Company will call and hold a meeting of its shareholders promptly following the consummation of the Offer
for the purposes of voting upon the approval of the Merger. At such meeting all Shares then owned by Parent or Purchaser will be voted in favor of the approval of the Merger. If Purchaser
acquiresthrough the Offer, the Merger Agreement or otherwisevoting power with respect to a majority of the outstanding Shares (which would be the case if the Minimum
Condition (as defined on the cover of this Offer to Purchase) were satisfied and Purchaser were to accept for payment Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer), it would have sufficient voting power to
effect the Merger without the affirmative vote of any other shareholder of the Company. The Company's
Chairman of the Board of Directors, Mathew M. Perlot, and its Chief Executive Officer, Curtis W. Lawler, who together hold approximately 70% of the Shares outstanding on June 23, 2001, have
agreed with Parent to tender all of their shares in the tender Offer. 

    Conditions to the Merger.
  The Merger Agreement provides that the respective obligations of each party to effect the
Merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including the following: (a) the Offer shall have been completed; (b) if required (i.e. if, following completion
of the Offer Purchaser owns less than 90% of the Shares), the Merger shall have been approved by a majority of the shareholders of the Company in accordance with the OBCA (the "Company Shareholders
Approval") prior to the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"); and (c) no order, statute, rule, regulation, executive order, stay, decree, judgment or injunction shall have been
enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by any court or other any nation or government, any state or other political subdivision thereof or any entity, authority or body exercising executive,
legislative, judicial or regulatory functions of or pertaining to government, including, without limitation, any governmental or regulatory authority, agency, department, board, commission or
instrumentality, any court, tribunal or arbitrator and any self-regulatory organization (a "Governmental Authority") which prohibits or prevents the completion of the Merger (collectively,
"Restraints") which has not been vacated, dismissed or withdrawn prior to the Effective Time. 

    Termination of the Merger Agreement.
  The Merger Agreement may be terminated, and the Offer and the Merger may be
abandoned, at any time prior to the Effective Time of the Merger: 

    (a) by
mutual written consent of Parent and the Company (
provided
 that after completion of the Offer and the election to
the Company's Board of Directors of the directors designated by Parent (the "Board Designation Date"), the unanimous vote of the Independent Directors (as defined under "Board of Directors") shall
also be required); 

    (b) by
either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently enjoining,
restraining or otherwise prohibiting the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and such order, decree or ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable; 

    (c) by
Parent if: 

     (i) the
Company shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its covenants or other agreements contained in the Merger Agreement, which
breach or failure to perform is incapable of being cured or has not been cured within 5 days after the giving of written notice thereof to the Company (but not later than the expiration of the
period, if any, by which the Offer is extended by Purchaser); 

    (ii) any
representation or warranty of the Company shall not have been true and correct when made (without for this purpose giving effect to qualifications of
materiality contained in such representation and warranty), if such failure to be true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a "Material Adverse Effect",
which is defined to mean any change, effect or circumstance that, individually or when taken together with all other similar changes, effects or circumstances that have occurred during the period
relevant to the determination of such Material Adverse Effect, is or is reasonably likely to be materially adverse to the business, assets (including intangible assets), financial condition or results
of operations of the Company and any Company's subsidiaries or Parent and its subsidiaries, as the case may be, in each case taken as a whole; 
provided,
however
, that effects of changes that arise from (i) any changes in economic, regulatory, or political conditions generally, (which changes do not disproportionately
affect the Company in a material way), (ii) the United States securities markets, (iii) compliance with the Merger Agreement or pendency or completion of the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement and (iv) the effect of the public announcement of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including any effect on customers or employees of the Company,
shall be excluded from the definition of "Material Adverse
Effect" and from any determination as to whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred or may occur; or 

    (iii) any
representation or warranty of the Company shall cease to be true and correct at any later date (without for this purpose giving effect to qualifications of
materiality contained in such representation and warranty) as if made on such date (other than representations and warranties made as of a specified date) other than as a result of a breach or failure
to perform by the Company of any of its covenants or agreements under the Merger Agreement if such failure to be true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect; 
provided, however
, that such representation or warranty is incapable of being cured or has not been cured within
5 days after the giving of written notice thereof to the Company (but not later than the expiration of the period, if any, by which the Offer is extended by Purchaser); 

provided, however
, that the
right to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to this subsection (c) shall not be available to Parent if Purchaser
or any other affiliate of Parent shall acquire Shares pursuant to the Offer; 

    (d) by
Parent if, whether or not permitted to do so by the Merger Agreement, (i) the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof shall have
withdrawn or modified in a 

manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser its approval or recommendation of the Offer, the Merger Agreement, the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by the foregoing; (ii) the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof shall have approved or recommended to the shareholders of the Company any Company Takeover Proposal (as defined below) or Alternative Transaction (as
defined below); (iii) the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof shall have approved or recommended that the shareholders of the Company tender their Common Shares in any
tender or exchange offer that is an Alternative Transaction; (iv) the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof shall have taken any position or made any disclosures to the
Company's shareholders permitted pursuant to the section hereof entitled "No Solicitation" below which has the effect of any of the foregoing; or (v) the Board of Directors of the Company or
any committee thereof shall have resolved to take any of the foregoing actions; 

    (e) by
either Parent or the Company if, as the result of the failure of the Minimum Condition or any of the other conditions to the Offer, the Offer shall have
terminated or expired in accordance with its terms without Purchaser having purchased any Shares pursuant to the Offer, 
provided that
 if the failure to
satisfy any of the conditions to the Offer shall be a basis for termination of the Merger Agreement under any other clause of this section entitled "Termination of the Merger Agreement", a termination
pursuant to this clause (e) shall be deemed a termination under such other clause; 

    (f)  by
either Parent or the Company if the Offer shall not have been completed on or before August 11, 2001, 
provided
that
 the right to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to this clause (f) shall not be available to any party whose failure to perform any of its obligations under
the Merger Agreement results in the failure of the Offer to be completed by such time; 

    (g) by
the Company, if Parent or Purchaser shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in the Merger Agreement, which breach or failure to perform is incapable of being cured or has not been cured within 5 days after the giving of written notice thereof to
Parent; or 

    (h) by
the Company in order to accept a Superior Proposal (as defined below) by a third party, provided (i) the Company has given Parent five business days
advance notice of the Company's intention to accept such Superior Proposal, (ii) the Company shall in fact accept such third party Superior Proposal, (iii) the Company shall have paid
the fee and expenses contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and (iv) the Company shall have complied in all respects with the provisions of the section hereof entitled "No Solicitation" below. 

        No Solicitation.
  The Merger Agreement provides that: 

    (a) The
Company shall not, directly or indirectly, through any officer, director, employee, representative or agent of the Company or any of the Company's subsidiaries,
solicit or encourage the initiation of (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries or proposals regarding any merger, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including without
limitation by way of a tender offer) or similar transactions involving the Company or any Company's subsidiaries that if completed would constitute an Alternative Transaction (as defined below) (any
of the foregoing inquiries or proposals being referred to herein as a "Company Takeover Proposal"). Nothing contained in the Merger Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from
(i) furnishing information to a third party which has made a bona fide Company Takeover Proposal that is a Superior Proposal (as defined below) not solicited in violation of the Merger
Agreement, provided that such third party has executed an agreement with confidentiality provisions substantially similar to those then in effect between the Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality
Agreement") or (ii) subject to compliance with the other terms of this section entitled "No Solicitation", considering and negotiating a bona fide Company Takeover Proposal that is a Superior
Proposal not solicited in violation of the Merger Agreement. For purposes of the Merger 

Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means any proposal made by a party to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, all of the equity securities of the
Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors or all the assets of the Company (other than a 
de minimis
 amount of assets not material
to the conduct of the Company's business), on terms which the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably believes (after due consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, which may be McDonald) to be more favorable from a financial point of view to its shareholders than the Offer and the Merger taking into account at the time of determination all factors
relating to such proposed transaction deemed relevant by the Board of Directors of the Company, including, without limitation, the financing thereof, the proposed timing thereof and all other
conditions thereto and any changes to the financial terms of the Merger Agreement proposed by Parent and Purchaser. "Alternative Transaction" means any of (i) a transaction
pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) other than Parent or its affiliates (a "Third Party") acquires or would acquire more than 20% of the outstanding shares of any class of equity
securities of the Company, whether from the Company or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger or other business combination involving the Company pursuant to
which any Third Party acquires more than 20% of the outstanding equity securities of the Company or the entity surviving such merger or business combination, (iii) any transaction pursuant to
which any Third Party acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of Company's subsidiaries and securities of the entity surviving any
merger or business combination including any of the Company's subsidiaries) of the Company or any Company's subsidiaries having a fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors of the
Company in good faith) equal to more than 20% of the fair market value of all the assets of the Company and the Company's subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction, or
(iv) any other consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving the Company or any of the Company's subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement; 

    (b) The
Company shall immediately notify Parent and Purchaser after receipt of any Company Takeover Proposal, or any modification of or amendment to any Company
Takeover Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of the Company's subsidiaries in connection with a Company Takeover Proposal or for access to the properties,
books or records of the Company or any subsidiary by any person or entity that informs the Board of Directors of the Company or such subsidiary that it is considering making, or has made, a Company
Takeover Proposal. Such notice to Parent and Purchaser shall be made orally and in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the person making the Company Takeover Proposal or intending to make the
Company Takeover Proposal or requesting non-public information or access to the books and records of the Company, the terms of any such Company Takeover Proposal or modification or
amendment to a Company Takeover Proposal, and whether the Company is providing or intends to provide the person making the Company Takeover Proposal with access to information concerning the Company
as provided in the preceding paragraph. The Company shall also immediately notify Parent and Purchaser, orally and in writing, if it enters into negotiations concerning any Company Takeover Proposal. 

    (c) Except
as set forth in this section entitled "No Solicitation", neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or
modify, or indicate publicly its intention to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors or such committee of the Offer or the Company
Proposals, (ii) approve or recommend, or indicate publicly its intention to approve or recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal or (iii) cause the Company to enter into any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement (each, a "Company Acquisition Agreement") related to any Company Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that prior to the Effective Time the Board of Directors of the Company 

determines in good faith, after due consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so constitutes a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders under applicable law,
the Board of Directors of the Company may (subject to this and the following sentences) approve or recommend a Superior Proposal and, in connection therewith, withdraw or modify its approval or
recommendation of the Offer or the Company Proposals, but only at a time that is after the fifth
business day following Parent's receipt of written notice advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company has received a Superior Proposal and, in the case of any previously received
Superior Proposal that has been materially modified or amended, such modification or amendment and specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, modification or amendment. 

    (d) Nothing
contained in this section entitled "No Solicitation" shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the Company's shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, with the
advice of outside counsel, failure so to disclose could be determined to be a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders under applicable law; 
provided,
however
, that neither the Company nor its Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall, except as permitted by the preceding paragraph, withdraw or modify, or indicate
publicly its intention to withdraw or modify, its position with respect to the Offer or the Company Proposals or approve or recommend, or indicate publicly its intention to approve or recommend, a
Company Takeover Proposal. 

    Fees and Expenses; Termination Fee.
  The Merger Agreement provides that except as set forth below, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Offer, the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or
not the Merger is consummated. 

    The
Company has agreed that if the Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to 

     (i) paragraph (d)
of the section entitled "Termination of the Merger Agreement" above; 

    (ii) paragraph (h)
of the section entitled "Termination of the Merger Agreement" above; or 

    (iii) paragraph (e)
or (f) of the section entitled "Termination of the Merger Agreement" above and, with respect to this clause (iii),
(A) at the time of such termination, there shall be outstanding a clearly expressed Company Takeover Proposal which has been made directly to the shareholders of the Company or has otherwise
become publicly known or there shall be outstanding an announcement by any third party of a clearly expressed intention to make an Company Takeover Proposal (in each case whether or not conditional
and whether or not such proposal shall have been rejected by the Board of Directors of the Company) and (B) an Alternative Transaction shall be publicly announced by the Company or any third
party within 12 months following the date of such termination and such transaction shall at any time thereafter be completed on substantially the terms theretofore announced; 

    then
the Company shall pay to Parent the sum of $850,349 less any amounts paid to Parent under the following paragraph. Any payment required by this section shall be made as promptly
as practicable but in no event later than two business days following termination of the Merger Agreement in the case of
clause (i) above, upon termination of the Merger Agreement in the case of clause (ii) above and, in the case of clause (iii) above, upon completion of such Company Takeover
Proposal. 

    The
Company has further agreed that if the Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to paragraph (c)(i), (c)(ii), (e) or (f) of the section entitled "Termination
of the Merger Agreement" above (and, in the case of paragraph (e) or (f), only when (A) there is a failure of a condition set forth in paragraph (g) of Section 13 entitled
"Certain Conditions of the Offer" below with respect to 

representations and warranties made as of the date of the Merger Agreement, or (B) there is a failure under the conditions set forth in paragraphs (h) or (j) of Section 13
entitled "Certain Conditions of the Offer" below), the Company will pay to Parent, as promptly as practicable but in no event later than two business days following termination of the Merger
Agreement, the amount of all documented and reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Parent, Purchaser and their affiliates (including but not limited to fees and expenses of counsel and accountants
and out-of-pocket expenses (but not fees) of financial advisors) in an aggregate amount not to exceed $250,000 in connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby. 

    Conduct of Business.
  The Merger Agreement provides that: 

    Except
as set forth in the Company's disclosure letter, unless Parent shall otherwise consent in writing and except as expressly contemplated by the Merger Agreement or in the
Company's disclosure letter, during the period from the date of the Merger Agreement to the Effective Time, (i) the Company shall conduct, and it shall cause the Company's subsidiaries to
conduct, its or their businesses in the ordinary course and consistent with past practice, and the Company shall, and it shall cause the Company's subsidiaries to, use its or their reasonable best
efforts to preserve substantially intact its business organization, to keep available the services of its present officers and employees and to preserve the present commercial relationships of the
Company and the Company's subsidiaries with persons with whom the Company or the Company's subsidiaries do significant business and (ii) without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
neither the Company nor any of the Company's subsidiaries will: 

    (A) amend

    (B) authorize
for issuance, issue, grant, sell, pledge, dispose of or propose to issue, grant, sell, pledge or dispose of any shares of, or any options, warrants,

    (C) split,
combine or reclassify any shares of its capital stock or declare, pay or set aside any dividend or other distribution (whether in cash, stock or property or

declare or pay any cross-border dividends), make or allow any Company subsidiary to make any cross-border capital contributions, or directly or indirectly redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire or
offer to acquire any shares of its capital stock or other securities; 

    (D) (a)
create or incur any indebtedness for borrowed money or issue any debt securities, except pursuant to the Company's credit agreements, loan agreements and
equipment leases as in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement, or (b) make any loans or advances, except in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice; 

    (E) (a)

    (K) except

    (N) other
than actions permitted under the Merger Agreement, including but not limited to the section entitled "No Solicitation" above, take any action that the Company
knows at the time of taking such action would likely result in any of the conditions to the Offer set forth in Section 13 entitled "Certain Conditions of the Offer" below not to be satisfied;
or 

    (O) take,
or agree in writing or otherwise to take, any of the foregoing actions or any action which would make any of the representations or warranties of the Company
contained in the Merger Agreement untrue or incorrect in any material respect at or prior to the Effective Time. 

    The
Company shall, and the Company shall cause each of the Company's subsidiaries to, comply with all laws and Company material contracts applicable to it or any of its properties,
assets or business and to maintain in full force and effect all the Company permits necessary for such business, except in any such case for any failure so to comply or maintain that would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. 

    Board of Directors.
  Promptly upon the purchase by Parent of Shares pursuant to the Offer (and provided that the Minimum
Condition has been satisfied), Parent shall be entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Board of Directors of the Company as will give Parent, subject
to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act, representation on the Board of Directors of the Company equal to at least that number of directors which equals the product of the total
number of directors on the Board of Directors of the Company (giving effect to the directors appointed or elected pursuant to this sentence and including current directors serving as officers of the
Company) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of Common Shares beneficially owned by Parent or any affiliate of Parent (including for purposes of this section such Common Shares as
are accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer, but excluding Common Shares held by the Company) bears to the number of Common Shares outstanding. At such time, if requested by Parent, the Company
will also cause each committee of the Board of Directors of the Company to include persons designated by Parent constituting the same percentage of each such committee as Parent's designees are of the
Board of Directors of the Company. The Company shall, upon request by Parent, promptly increase the size of the Board of Directors of the Company or exercise reasonable best efforts to secure the
resignations of such number of directors as is necessary to enable Parent's designees to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Company in accordance with the terms of this section and to cause
Parent's designees so to be elected; 
provided, however,
 that, in the event that Parent's designees are elected to the Board of Directors of the Company,
until the Effective Time the Board of Directors of the Company shall have at least two directors who were directors on the date of the Merger Agreement, one of whom will be Mathew M. Perlot and one of
whom will be a director who is neither an officer of the Company nor a designee, shareholder, affiliate or associate (within the meaning of the federal securities laws) of Parent (such directors the
"Independent Directors"). Subject to applicable law, the Company shall promptly take all action necessary pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Securities
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under this section and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 mailed to shareholders
promptly after the commencement of the Offer (or in an amendment thereof or an information statement pursuant to Rule 14f-1 if Parent has not theretofore designated directors) the
information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors as is required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this
section. Parent will supply the Company, and be solely responsible for, any information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and
Rule 14f-1. Notwithstanding anything in the Merger Agreement to the contrary, subsequent to the election of the directors designated by Parent referred to in the first sentence of
this section to the Company's Board of Directors and prior to the Effective Time, the unanimous vote of the Independent Directors shall be required to (i) amend or terminate the Merger
Agreement on behalf of the 

Company, (ii) exercise or waive any of the Company's rights or remedies under the Merger Agreement, (iii) extend the time for performance of Parent's obligations under the Merger
Agreement, (iv) take any other action by the Company in connection with the Merger Agreement required to be taken by the Board of Directors of the Company, or (v) amend the Company's
Restated Articles of Incorporation or the Company's Restated Bylaws, each as in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement. 

    Stock Options.
  The Merger Agreement provides that each option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time to
purchase Common Shares (a "Company Option") under the Company's 1994 Stock Incentive Plan (as amended to the date of the Merger Agreement) (the "1994 Plan") or any other stock option plan or agreement
of the Company, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall at the Effective Time be automatically converted in its entirety into and represent solely the right to receive an amount in cash equal
to the positive difference, if any, between the Price Per Share and the per share exercise price of the Company Option multiplied by the number of Common Shares for which the Company Option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to reduction only for any applicable withholding taxes. Except with respect to the right to receive an amount in cash as set forth in the
preceding sentence, each such Company Option shall at the Effective Time be automatically cancelled and terminated and of no further force or effect, and except as set forth in the preceding sentence
the holder thereof shall receive no consideration in connection with such cancellation and termination. The Company has represented to Parent and Purchaser that all outstanding Company Options have
exercise prices in excess of the Price Per Share. As a consequence, no consideration will be paid by Purchaser to holders of Company Options in connection with the Offer or Merger. 

    Employee Benefit Matters.
  The Merger Agreement provides that the Company and all Company subsidiaries agree to
terminate any and all group severance, separation or salary continuation plans, programs or arrangements (other than (i) the individual retirement agreements, as amended, between the Company
and Mathew M. Perlot and the Company and Curtis W. Lawler, (ii) the individual change of control agreements between the Company and William L. Rich, the Company and Steven D. Bettis, and the
Company and L. Michael Cary, and (iii) that certain severance plan established by the Board of Directors of the Company on February 21, 2001 for certain key employees of the Company), no
later than the business day prior to the Effective Date unless Parent provides written notice to Company that any such plans, programs or arrangements shall not be terminated. Furthermore, the Company
and all Company subsidiaries agree to take corporate action to terminate any and all plans intended to
include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement no later than the business day prior to the day the Company becomes a member of the Parent's controlled group of corporations, as defined in
Section 1563(a) of the Code (the "Controlled Group Date") unless Parent provides written notice to Company that any such 401(k) plans shall not be terminated. The Company has acknowledged that
the Controlled Group Date may be prior to the Effective Time and that it is the Company's sole responsibility to ensure that corporate action is taken to terminate any and all 401(k) plans at least
one business day prior to the Controlled Group Date. Unless Parent provides written notice to the Company instructing the Company not to terminate its group severance, separation or salary
continuation plans, programs or arrangements and/or 401(k) plans, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such plans, programs or arrangements have been terminated pursuant to resolutions
of the Company's Board of Directors. The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such plans, programs or arrangements as Parent may reasonably require. 

    The
Merger Agreement further provides that as of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the surviving corporation to honor and satisfy all obligations and liabilities with respect to
employee plans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the surviving corporation shall not be required to continue any particular employee plan after the Effective Time, and any employee plan may be amended
or terminated in accordance with its terms and applicable law. To the extent that any employee plan is 

terminated or amended after the Effective Date so as to eliminate the future benefits that are being provided with respect to participants thereunder, Parent shall arrange for each individual who is
then a participant in such terminated or amended plan to participate in a Parent benefit plan ("Parent Benefit Plan"), to the extent similarly situated employees of the Parent participate in such
Parent Benefit Plan, in accordance with the eligibility criteria thereof, provided that (i) such participant shall receive full credit for years of service with the Company or any of the
Company subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for all purposes for which such service was recognized under the applicable employee plan (other than for sabbatical benefits and for benefit accrual
purposes under any defined benefit pension plan), including, but not limited to, recognition of service for eligibility, vesting (including acceleration thereof pursuant to the terms of the applicable
employee plan), and entitlement to commence benefits, 
provided, however
, that no service credit for benefit accrual purposes shall be provided in any
circumstance that would result in duplicative accrual of benefits, and 
provided, further,
 that relevant insurance carriers, outsider providers or the
like are able to honor such commitments on terms reasonably acceptable to Parent, provided, however, that Parent shall use its best efforts to ensure that the Company's employees who become Parent's
employees as of the Effective Date shall be given the opportunity to participate in Parent's 401(k) plan, subject to the terms and conditions of such plan, within thirty (30) days after the
Effective Date, (ii) Parent shall cause any and all pre-existing condition limitations (to the extent such limitations did not apply to a pre-existing condition under
the employee plans) and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans to be waived with respect to such participant and his or her eligible dependents, 
provided,
however
, that the relevant insurance carriers, outsider providers or the like are able to honor such commitments on terms reasonably acceptable to Parent, and
(iii) Parent shall cause the Parent Benefit Plans that are group welfare plans to provide such participant with credit towards any applicable deductibles, co-payments and similar
exclusions for expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time, 
provided, however
, that the relevant insurance carriers, outsider providers or the like
are able to honor such commitments on terms reasonably acceptable to Parent. The provisions of this section are described solely for purposes of disclosure, and the corresponding provisions of the
Merger Agreement constitute an obligation solely to the Company, and
neither are intended to and nor do they create rights in any person other than the Company itself (i.e. do not create any third party beneficiary rights). 

    Indemnification and Insurance.
  The Merger Agreement provides that from and after the Effective Time, the surviving
corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless all past and present officers and directors (the "Indemnified Parties") of the Company and of the Company subsidiaries to the full extent such persons may
be indemnified by the Company pursuant to Oregon law, the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation and Restated Bylaws, as each is in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement, for acts and
omissions (x) arising out of or pertaining to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or arising out of the Offer documents or (y) otherwise with respect to any acts or
omissions occurring or arising at or prior to the Effective Time and shall advance reasonable litigation expenses incurred by such persons in connection with defending any action arising out of such
acts or omissions, provided that such persons provide the requisite affirmations and undertaking, as set forth in Section 60.397 of the OBCA. 

    In
addition, Parent will provide, or cause the surviving corporation to provide, for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time, the Company's current directors and
officers an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring or arising at or prior to the Effective Time (the "D&O Insurance") that is no less favorable than the
existing policy or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, however, that Parent and the surviving corporation shall not be required to
pay an annual premium for the D&O Insurance in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance, but in such case shall purchase as much such coverage as possible
for such amount. 

    The portion of the Merger Agreement corresponding to this section is intended to benefit the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent,
Purchaser, the Company and the surviving corporation. Parent has guaranteed the performance by the surviving corporation of the indemnified obligations pursuant to the portion of the Merger Agreement
corresponding to this section. 

    Reasonable Best Efforts.
  The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Company,
Parent and Purchaser each agree to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to complete and make
effective as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, obtaining all consents from Governmental Authorities and other third parties
required for the completion of the Offer and the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Company, Parent and
Purchaser have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to satisfy the other conditions of the closing of
the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement. 

    Representations and Warranties.
  The Merger Agreement contains various customary representations and warranties,
including representations relating to: corporate organization and good standing; capitalization; authorization to enter into the Merger Agreement; compliance with laws; financial statements;
litigation; material contracts and compliance therewith; employee benefit plans; taxes; intellectual property; labor matters; owned and leased premises; environmental matters; product liability and
recalls; customers; interested party transactions; and various other matters. 

    Procedure for Amendment, Extension, Waiver or Termination.
  The Merger Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time prior to the Effective Time; 
provided, however
, that after the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, no amendment shall be made which decreases
the Merger Consideration, and after the Company Shareholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not be made any amendment that by law requires further approval by the shareholders of the Company
without the further approval of such shareholders. The Merger Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties. 

    At
any time prior to the Effective Time, a party may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other parties contained in the Merger Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to the Merger Agreement or (c) subject to the
proviso of the previous paragraph, waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements or conditions contained in the Merger Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to the
Merger Agreement to assert any of its rights under the Merger Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights. 

    The
foregoing summary of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to, and is in no way intended to modify, supplement or supersede the terms and conditions of,
the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 99.(d)(1) to the Schedule TO. The Merger Agreement should be read in its entirety for a more complete description of the matters
summarized above. 

The Confidentiality Agreement  

    Pursuant to that certain letter agreement dated March 21, 2001 by and among Parent and McDonald, on behalf of itself and as agent for the Company,
concerning confidentiality (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), the Company and Parent agreed to keep confidential certain information provided by the Company or its representatives. The Confidentiality
Agreement also contains 

customary standstill provisions. The Merger Agreement provides that the Confidentiality Agreement remains in force and effect according to its terms. 

Appraisal Rights  

    No dissenters' rights are available in connection with the Offer. Under the OBCA, dissenters' rights are not available in a merger to holders of any shares of
any stock which, like the Company's common stock, are listed for quotation on the Nasdaq National Market System. Accordingly, if the Company's common stock remains listed on the Nasdaq National Market
System following completion of the Offer, the Company's shareholders will have no dissenters' rights in connection with the Merger. If, however, the Company's common stock is not quoted on the Nasdaq
National Market System on the record date for determining shareholders eligible to vote on the Merger, shareholders of the Company may have certain rights under the OBCA to dissent, and demand
appraisal of, and to obtain payment for the fair value of their Shares. Such rights, if the statutory procedures were complied with, could lead to a judicial determination of the fair value of the
Shares (excluding any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger) to be required to be paid in cash to such dissenting holders for their Shares. In addition, such
dissenting shareholders would be entitled to received payment of a fair rate of interest from the date of consummation of the Merger on the amount determined to be the fair value of their Shares. In
determining the fair value of the Shares, an Oregon court would be required to take into account all relevant factors. Accordingly, such determination could be based upon considerations other than, or
in addition to, the market value of the Shares. Therefore, the value so determined in any appraisal proceeding could be different from the price being paid in the Offer. 

    The
foregoing summary of the Appraisal Provisions does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 60.551 through 60.594 of the OBCA. 

Going-Private Transactions  

    The Commission has adopted Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act, which is applicable to certain "going private" transactions. Purchaser does
not believe that Rule 13e-3 will be applicable to the Merger unless the Merger is consummated more than one year after the termination of the Offer. If applicable,
Rule 13e-3 requires, among other things, that certain financial information concerning the fairness of the Merger and the consideration offered to minority shareholders in the
Merger be filed with the Commission and disclosed to shareholders prior to the consummation of the Merger. 

13.  Certain Conditions of the Offer  

    The Merger Agreement provides that, notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any
applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Purchaser's obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly
after termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for, and (subject to any such rules or regulations) may delay the acceptance for payment of any tendered Shares and (except as provided in the Merger
Agreement) amend or terminate the Offer as to any Shares not then paid for if (i) the Minimum Condition has not been satisfied, (ii) any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act shall
not have expired or been terminated prior to the expiration of the Offer, or (iii) at any time after the date of the Merger Agreement and before the time of payment for any Shares (whether or
not any Shares have theretofore been accepted for payment or paid for pursuant to the Offer), any of the following conditions exists: 

    (a) there
shall be in effect an injunction or other order, decree, judgment or ruling by a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction or a law shall have been
promulgated or enacted by a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction which in any such case (i) restrains 

or prohibits the making or completion of the Offer or the completion of the Merger, (ii) prohibits or restricts the ownership or operation by Parent (or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries)
of any portion of the Company's business or assets if it would substantially deprive Parent and/or its affiliates or subsidiaries of the benefit of ownership of the Company's business or assets, or
compels Parent (or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries) to dispose of or hold separate any portion of the Company's business or assets if it would substantially deprive Parent and/or its affiliates
or subsidiaries of the benefit of ownership of the Company's business or assets, (iii) imposes material limitations on the ability of
Purchaser effectively to acquire or to hold or to exercise full rights of ownership of the Shares, including, without limitation, the right to vote Shares purchased by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer
or the Merger on all matters properly presented to the shareholders of the Company, or (iv) imposes any material limitations on the ability of Parent and/or its affiliates or subsidiaries
effectively to control in any material respect the business and operations of the Company; or 

    (b) there
shall have been instituted, pending or threatened an action by a Governmental Authority seeking to restrain or prohibit the making or completion of the Offer
or completion of the Merger, or to impose any other restriction, prohibition or limitation referred to in the foregoing paragraph (a); or 

    (c) the
Merger Agreement shall have been terminated by the Company or Parent in accordance with its terms; or 

    (d) there
shall have occurred (i) any general suspension of, or limitation on prices for, trading in the Shares on Nasdaq (other than any coordinated trading
halt as a result of a specified increase or decrease in a market index, (ii) a declaration of a banking moratorium or any general suspension of payments in respect of banks in the United States
or (iii) in the case of any of the foregoing existing at the time of the execution of the Merger Agreement, a material acceleration or worsening thereof; or 

    (e) Parent
and the Company shall have agreed that Purchaser shall amend the Offer, terminate the Offer or postpone the payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer; or 

    (f)  any
of the representations and warranties made by the Company in the Merger Agreement shall not have been true and correct when made, or shall thereafter have
ceased to be true and correct prior to the closing of the Merger (other than representations and warranties made as of a specified date) (in each case without, for this purpose, giving effect to
qualifications of materiality contained in such representation and warranties), if such failure to be true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, or the Company shall not have performed each obligation and agreement and complied with each covenant to be performed and complied with by it under the Merger Agreement in all
material respects; 
provided, however
, that such breach or failure to perform is incapable of being cured or has not been cured within 5 days
after the giving of written notice thereof to the Company; 
provided
, further that no such 5-day cure period shall require extension of the
Offer beyond the 20 business days extension period permitted under the Agreement; or 

    (g) Parent
shall not have received an officer's certificate from the Company, executed by the Company's Chairman of the Board and by the Company's Chief Executive
Officer, dated as of the expiration date of the Offer, certifying that all of the representations and warranties made by the Company in the Merger Agreement were true and correct when made and
continue to be true and correct as of the date of such certificate (other than representations and warranties made as of a specified date, as to which shall be certified that such representations and
warranties were true and correct as of such date)
(in each case without, for this purpose, giving effect to qualifications of materiality contained in such representation and warranties), and that the Company has performed 

each obligation and agreement and complied with each covenant to be performed and complied with under the Merger Agreement in all material respects; or 

    (h) the
Company's Board of Directors shall have modified or amended its recommendation of the Offer in any manner adverse to Parent or shall have withdrawn its
recommendation of the Offer, or shall have recommended acceptance of any Company Takeover Proposal or shall have resolved to do any of the foregoing; or 

    (i)  any
change, development, effect or circumstance shall have occurred or be threatened that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to the Company; or 

    (j)  either
Mathew M. Perlot or Curtis W. Lawler shall have materially breached any representation or warranty, or materially failed to perform or announced any
intention to materially fail to perform any material agreement or covenant, of such person under the shareholder's agreements entered into by such persons with Parent. 

    The
foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser and may be asserted by Parent or Purchaser regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such condition
and may be waived by Parent or Purchaser, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, in the sole discretion of Parent. The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of
the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any right, the waiver of such right with respect to any particular facts or circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other
facts or circumstances, and each right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time. 

    If
the Offer is terminated pursuant to the foregoing provisions, all tendered Shares not accepted for payment shall be promptly returned to the tendering shareholders. 

14.  Certain Legal Matters  

    Except as described in this Section 14, based on a review of publicly available filings made by the Company with the Commission and other publicly
available information concerning the Company and
discussions of representatives of Parent with representatives of the Company, none of Purchaser, Parent or the Company is aware of any license or regulatory permit that appears to be material to the
business of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that might be adversely affected by Purchaser's acquisition of Shares (and the indirect acquisition of the stock of the Company's
subsidiaries) as contemplated herein or of any approval or other action by any Governmental Authority that would be required or desirable for the acquisition or ownership of Shares by Purchaser as
contemplated herein. Should any such approval or other action be required or desirable, Parent and Purchaser currently contemplate that such approval or other action will be sought, except as
described below under "State Takeover Laws". While (except as otherwise expressly described in this Section 14) Purchaser does not presently intend to delay the acceptance for payment of or
payment for Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer pending the outcome of any such matter, there can be no assurance that any such approval or other action, if needed, would be obtained or would be
obtained without substantial conditions or that failure to obtain any such approval or other action might not result in consequences adverse to the Company's business or that certain parts of the
Company's business might not have to be disposed of if such approvals were not obtained or such other actions were not taken or in order to obtain any such approval or other action. If certain types
of adverse action are taken with respect to the matters discussed below, Purchaser could, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, decline to accept for payment or pay for any
Shares tendered. See Section 13 for a description of certain conditions to the Offer. 

    State Takeover Laws.
  The Company and certain of its subsidiaries conduct business in a number of states throughout the
United States, some of which have adopted laws and regulations applicable to offers to acquire shares of corporations that are incorporated or have substantial assets, shareholders and/or a principal
place of business in such states. In 
Edgar v. MITE Corp.
, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Illinois Business Takeover Statute, which
involved state securities laws that made the takeover of certain corporations more difficult, imposed a substantial burden on interstate commerce and was therefore unconstitutional. In 

CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of
America
, however, the Supreme Court of the United States held that a state may, as a matter of corporate law and, in
particular, those laws concerning corporate governance, constitutionally disqualify a potential acquiror from voting on the affairs of a target corporation without prior approval of the remaining
shareholders, PROVIDED that such laws were applicable only under certain conditions, in particular, that the corporation has a substantial number of shareholders in and is incorporated under the laws
of such state. The Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Oregon. 

    In
general, Sections 60.825 to 60.845 of the OBCA prevent an "interested shareholder" (including a person who owns or has the right to acquire 15% or more of the corporation's
outstanding voting stock) from engaging in a "business combination" (defined to include mergers and certain other actions) with an Oregon corporation for a period of three years following the date
such person became an interested shareholder unless prior to the date that such shareholder became an interested shareholder the board of directors of the company approved either the business
combination or the transaction which resulted in the shareholder becoming an interested shareholder. As a result, and irrespective of the constitutionality of these provisions, since the Company's
Board of Directors has approved the Merger Agreement these provisions of the OBCA will not prevent Purchaser from completing the anticipated Merger with the Company. 

    An
additional Oregon takeover statute is found in Sections 60.801 to 60.816 of the OBCA (the "Control Share Act"). The Control Share Act generally provides that a person (the
"Acquiror") who acquires voting stock of an "issuing public corporation" (a corporation with one hundred or more shareholders, its principal place of business in Oregon, and either ten percent or ten
thousand of its shareholders in Oregon) in a transaction that results in the Acquiror holding more than 20%, 33

/

% or 50% of the total voting power of the corporation (a "Control Share
Acquisition") cannot vote the shares it acquires in the Control Share Acquisition except in certain circumstances. Under Oregon law a corporation may provide in its Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws
that the Control Share Act does not apply to the corporation. The Company's Bylaws provide that the Control Share Act does not apply to acquisitions of the Company's voting shares and thus does not
apply to the Offer and the Merger. 

    Neither
Parent nor Purchaser has determined whether any other state takeover laws and regulations will by their terms apply to the Offer, and, except as set forth above, neither
Parent nor Purchaser has presently sought to comply with any state takeover statute or regulation. Parent and Purchaser reserve the right to challenge the applicability or validity of any state law or
regulation purporting to apply to the Offer or the Merger, and neither anything in this Offer nor any action taken in connection herewith is intended as a waiver of such right. In the event it is
asserted that one or more state takeover statutes is applicable to the Offer or the Merger and an appropriate court does not determine that such statute is inapplicable or invalid as applied to the
Offer or the Merger, Parent or Purchaser might be required to file certain information with, or to receive approval from, the relevant state authorities, and Purchaser might be unable to accept for
payment or pay for Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, or be delayed in consummating the Offer. 

Antitrust  

    United States Antitrust Law.
  Under the provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "HSR Act") applicable to the Offer, the acquisition of Shares under the Offer may be consummated 

without any need for Parent to file an HSR Notification and Report Form (an "HSR Filing") with respect to the Offer with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade
Commission (the "FTC"). 

    Despite
the face that no HSR Filing will be required in order to complete the Offer and the Merger, the Antitrust Division and the FTC frequently scrutinize the legality under the
antitrust laws of transactions such as Purchaser's proposed acquisition of the Company. At any time before or after
Purchaser's acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Antitrust Division or the FTC could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest,
including seeking to enjoin the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer or the consummation of the Merger or seeking the divestiture of Shares acquired by Purchaser or the divestiture of substantial
assets of the Company or its subsidiaries or Parent or its subsidiaries. Private parties may also bring legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. There can be no assurance
that a challenge to the Offer on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, of the result thereof. 

    Other Foreign Laws.
  The Company and Parent and certain of their respective subsidiaries conduct business in several
foreign countries where regulatory filings or approvals may be required or desirable in connection with the consummation of the Offer. Certain of such filings or approvals, if required or desirable,
may not be made or obtained prior to the expiration of the Offer. Purchaser and the Company are analyzing the applicability of any such laws and currently intend to take such action as may be required
or desirable. If any foreign Governmental Authority takes any action prior to the completion of the Offer that might have certain adverse effects, Purchaser will not be obligated to accept for payment
or pay for any Shares tendered. 

15.  Fees and Expenses  

    Salomon Smith Barney is acting as Dealer Manager for the Offer and as financial advisor to Parent in connection with Parent's proposed acquisition of the
Company, for which services Salomon Smith Barney will receive customary compensation. Parent also has agreed to reimburse Salomon Smith Barney for reasonable travel and other
out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable fees and expenses of its legal counsel, and to indemnify Salomon Smith Barney and certain related parties against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising out of its engagement. In the ordinary course of business, Salomon Smith Barney and its affiliates may actively trade or
hold the securities of Parent and the Company for their own account and for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. 

    Parent
and Purchaser have retained Innisfree to act as the Information Agent and Wells Fargo to serve as the Depositary in connection with the Offer. The Information Agent and the
Depositary each will receive reasonable and customary compensation for their services, be reimbursed for certain reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and be indemnified against
certain liabilities and expenses in connection therewith, including certain liabilities and expenses under the U.S. federal securities laws. 

    Neither
Purchaser nor Parent will pay any fees or commissions to any broker or dealer or other person (other than the Dealer Manager) in connection with the solicitation of tenders of
Shares pursuant to the Offer. Brokers, dealers, banks, trust companies and other members will be reimbursed by Purchaser upon request for customary mailing and handling expenses incurred by them in
forwarding material to their customers. 

16.  Miscellaneous  

    The Offer is not being made to (nor will tenders be accepted from or on behalf of) holders of Shares in any jurisdiction in which the making of the Offer or
the acceptance thereof would not be in compliance with the laws of such jurisdiction. Neither Purchaser nor Parent is aware of any jurisdiction in which the making of the Offer or the acceptance
thereof would not be in compliance with the laws 

of such jurisdiction. To the extent Purchaser or Parent becomes aware of any state law that would limit the class of offerees in the Offer, Purchaser will amend the Offer and, depending on the timing
of such amendment, if any, will extend the Offer to provide adequate dissemination of such information to holders of Shares prior to the expiration of the Offer. In any jurisdiction the securities,
blue sky or other laws of which require the Offer to be made by a licensed broker or dealer, the Offer is being made on behalf of Purchaser by the Dealer Manager or one or more registered brokers or
dealers licensed under the laws of such jurisdiction. 

    NO
PERSON HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED TO GIVE ANY INFORMATION OR TO MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION ON BEHALF OF PURCHASER OR PARENT NOT CONTAINED HEREIN OR IN THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND, IF GIVEN
OR MADE, SUCH INFORMATION OR REPRESENTATION MUST NOT BE RELIED UPON AS HAVING BEEN AUTHORIZED. 

    Parent
and Purchaser have filed with the Commission the Schedule TO pursuant to Rule 14d-3 under the Exchange Act, together with exhibits, furnishing certain
additional information with respect to the Offer, and may file amendments thereto. In addition, the Company has filed the Schedule 14D-9 pursuant to Rule 14d-9
under the Exchange Act, together with exhibits, setting forth its recommendation with respect to the Offer and the reasons for such recommendation and furnishing certain additional related
information. Such Schedules and any amendments thereto, including exhibits, should be available for inspection and copies should be obtainable in the manner set forth in Section 8 (except that
such material will not be available at the regional offices of the Commission).

Ladies and Gentlemen: 

    The
undersigned hereby tenders to Salmon Acquisition, Inc., a Oregon corporation (the "Purchaser") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Monaco Coach Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), the above-described shares of Common Stock, (the "Shares"), of SMC Corporation, an Oregon corporation (the "Company"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
the Purchaser's Offer to Purchase dated July 5, 2001 (the "Offer to Purchase"), and this Letter of Transmittal (which, together with any amendments or supplements thereto or hereto,
collectively constitute the "Offer"), receipt of which is hereby acknowledged. 

    Upon
the terms of the Offer, subject to, and effective upon, acceptance for payment of, and payment for, the Shares tendered herewith in accordance with the terms of the Offer, the
undersigned hereby sells, assigns and transfers to, or upon the order of, the Purchaser all right, title and interest in and to all the Shares that are being tendered hereby (and any and all other
Shares or other securities or rights issued in respect thereof on or after the date of the Offer to Purchase) and irrevocably constitutes and appoints Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, N.A. (the
"Depositary"), the true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact of the undersigned, with full power of substitution (such power of attorney being deemed to be an irrevocable power coupled with an
interest), to the full extent of the undersigned's rights with respect to such Shares (and any such other Shares or securities or rights) (a) to deliver certificates for such Shares (and any
such other Shares or securities or rights) or transfer ownership of such Shares (and any such other Shares or securities or rights) on the account books maintained by the Book-Entry Transfer Facility
together, in any such case, with all accompanying evidences of transfer and authenticity to, or upon the order of, the Purchaser, (b) to present such Shares (and any such other Shares or
securities or rights) for transfer on the Company's books and (c) to receive all benefits and otherwise exercise all rights of beneficial ownership of such Shares (and any such other Shares or
securities or rights), all in accordance with the terms of the Offer. 

    The
undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the undersigned has full power and authority to tender, sell, assign and transfer the tendered Shares (and any and all other Shares
or other securities or rights issued or issuable in respect of such Shares on or after the date of the Offer to Purchase) and, when the same are accepted for payment by the Purchaser, the Purchaser
will acquire good title thereto, free and clear of all liens, restrictions, claims and encumbrances and the same will not be subject to any adverse claim. The undersigned will, upon request, execute
any additional documents deemed by the Depositary or the Purchaser to be necessary or desirable to complete the sale, assignment and transfer of the tendered Shares (and any such other Shares or other
securities or rights). 

    All
authority conferred or agreed to be conferred pursuant to this Letter of Transmittal shall be binding upon the successors, assigns, heirs, executors, administrators and legal
representatives of the undersigned and shall not be affected by, and shall survive, the death or incapacity of the undersigned. Except as stated in the Offer to Purchase, this tender is irrevocable. 

    The
undersigned hereby irrevocably appoints Richard E. Bond, and any other designee of the Purchaser, the attorney-in-fact and proxy of the undersigned, with full power of
substitution, to vote at any annual, special or adjourned meeting of the Company's Shareholders or otherwise in such manner as such attorney-in-fact and proxy or his substitute shall in his sole
discretion deem proper with respect to, to execute any written consent concerning
any matter as each such attorney-in-fact and proxy or his substitute shall in his sole discretion deem proper with respect to, and to otherwise act as such attorney-in-fact and proxy or his substitute
shall in his sole discretion deem proper with respect to, the Shares tendered hereby that have been accepted for payment by the Purchaser prior to the time any such action is taken and with respect to
which the undersigned is entitled to vote (and any and all other Shares or other securities or rights issued or issuable in respect of such Shares on or after the date of the Offer to Purchase). This
appointment is effective when, and only to the extent that, the Purchaser accepts for payment such Shares as provided in the Offer to Purchase. This power of attorney and proxy are irrevocable and are
granted in consideration of the acceptance for payment of such Shares in accordance with the terms of the Offer. Upon such acceptance for payment, all prior powers of attorney, proxies and consents
given by the undersigned with respect to such Shares (and any such other Shares or securities or rights) will, without further action, be revoked and no subsequent powers of attorney, proxies,
consents or revocations may be given (and, if given, will not be deemed effective) by the undersigned. 

    The
undersigned understands that the valid tender of Shares pursuant to any of the procedures described in Section 2 of the Offer to Purchase and in the Instructions hereto will
constitute a binding agreement between the undersigned and the Purchaser upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer. 

    Unless otherwise indicated herein under "Special Payment Instructions", please issue the check for the purchase price and/or return any certificates for Shares not tendered or
accepted for payment in the name(s) of the registered holder(s) appearing under "Description of Shares Tendered". Similarly, unless otherwise indicated herein under "Special Delivery Instructions",
please mail the check for the purchase price and/or return any certificates for Shares not tendered or accepted for payment (and accompanying documents, as appropriate) to the address(es) of the
registered holder(s) appearing under "Description of Shares Tendered". In the event that both the "Special Delivery Instructions" and the "Special Payment Instructions" are completed, please issue the
check for the purchase price and/or return any certificates for Shares not tendered or accepted for payment (and any accompanying documents, as appropriate) in the name of, and deliver such check

accepted for payment by crediting the account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility designated above. The undersigned recognizes that the Purchaser has no obligation pursuant to the "Special Payment
Instructions" to transfer any Shares from the name of the registered holder thereof if the Purchaser does not accept for payment any of the Shares so tendered.

INSTRUCTIONS
  FORMING PART OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER    

    1.
  Guarantee of Signatures.
  No signature guarantee is required on this Letter of Transmittal
(a) if this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) (which term, for purposes of this Instruction, includes any participant in the Book-Entry Transfer Facilities' system
whose name appears on a security position listing as the owner of the Shares) of Shares tendered herewith, unless such registered holder(s) has completed either the box entitled "Special Payment
Instructions" or the box entitled "Special Delivery Instructions" on this Letter of Transmittal or (b) if such Shares are tendered for the account of a firm that is a participant in the
Security Transfer Agents Medallion Program or Nasdaq Stock Market Guarantee Program or the Stock Exchange Medallion Program or by any other "eligible guarantor institution", as such term is defined in
Rule 17Ad-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (each, an "Eligible Institution"). In all other cases, all signatures on this Letter of Transmittal must be guaranteed by an
Eligible Institution. See Instruction 5. 

    2.
  Requirements of Tender.
  This Letter of Transmittal is to be completed by Shareholders either if
certificates are to be forwarded herewith or, unless an Agent's Message (as defined below) is utilized, if delivery of Shares is to be made pursuant to the procedures for book-entry transfer set forth
in Section 2 of the Offer to Purchase. For a Shareholder validly to tender Shares pursuant to the Offer, either (a) a Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly
executed, together with any required signature guarantees or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an Agent's Message, and any other required documents, must be received by the Depositary at one of
its addresses set forth herein prior to the Expiration Date (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) and either certificates for tendered Shares must be received by the Depositary at one of such
addresses or Shares must be delivered pursuant to the procedures for book-entry transfer set forth herein (and a Book-Entry Confirmation (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) must be received by the
Depositary), in each case, prior to the Expiration Date, or (b) the tendering Shareholder must comply with the guaranteed delivery procedures set forth below and in Section 2 of the Offer to
Purchase. 

    Shareholders
whose certificates for Shares are not immediately available or who cannot deliver their certificates and all other required documents to the Depositary or complete the
procedures for book-entry transfer prior to the Expiration Date may tender their Shares by properly completing and duly executing the Notice of Guaranteed Delivery pursuant to the guaranteed delivery
procedures set forth in Section 2 of the Offer to Purchase. Pursuant to such procedures, (a) such tender must be made by or through an Eligible Institution, (b) a properly completed and
duly executed Notice of Guaranteed Delivery substantially in the form provided by the Purchaser must be received by the Depositary prior to the Expiration Date and (c) the certificates for all
tendered Shares in proper form for transfer (or a Book-Entry Confirmation with respect to all such Shares), together with a Letter of Transmittal (or facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly
executed, with any required signature guarantees, or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an Agent's Message, and any other required documents, must be received by the Depositary within three
trading days after the date of execution of such Notice of Guaranteed Delivery as provided in Section 2 of the Offer to Purchase. A "trading day" is any day on which Nasdaq Stock Market is open for
business. 

    "Agent's
Message" means a message transmitted by the Book-Entry Transfer Facility to, and received by, the Depositary and forming a part of a Book-Entry Confirmation, that states that
such Book-Entry Transfer Facility has received an express acknowledgment from the participant in such Book-Entry Transfer Facility tendering the Shares that such participant has received and agrees to
be bound by the terms of the Letter of Transmittal and that the Purchaser may enforce such agreement against such participant. 

    THE
METHOD OF DELIVERY OF SHARES, THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND ALL OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING DELIVERY THROUGH ANY BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER FACILITY, IS AT THE ELECTION AND RISK
OF THE TENDERING SHAREHOLDER. SHARES WILL BE DEEMED DELIVERED ONLY WHEN ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY (INCLUDING, IN THE CASE OF A BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER, BY BOOK-ENTRY CONFIRMATION). IF DELIVERY
IS BY MAIL, REGISTERED MAIL, WITH RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, PROPERLY INSURED, IS RECOMMENDED. IN ALL CASES, SUFFICIENT TIME SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO ENSURE TIMELY DELIVERY. 

    No
alternative, conditional or contingent tenders will be accepted and no fractional Shares will be purchased. All tendering Shareholders, by execution of this Letter of Transmittal
(or facsimile thereof), waive any right to receive any notice of the acceptance of their Shares for payment. 

    3.
  Inadequate Space.
  If the space provided herein is inadequate, the certificate numbers and/or the
number of Shares should be listed on a separate schedule attached hereto. 

    4.
  Partial Tenders (Applicable to Certificate Shareholders Only).
  If fewer than all the Shares
evidenced by any certificate submitted are to be tendered, fill in the number of Shares that are to be tendered in the box entitled "Number of Shares Tendered". In any such case, new certificate(s)
for the remainder of the Shares that were evidenced by the old certificate(s) will be sent to the registered holder, unless otherwise provided in the appropriate box on this Letter of Transmittal, as
soon as practicable after the acceptance of payment of, and payment for the Shares tendered herewith. All Shares represented by certificates delivered to the Depositary will be deemed to have been
tendered unless otherwise indicated. 

    5.
  Signatures on Letter of Transmittal, Stock Powers and Endorsements.
  If this Letter of Transmittal is
signed by the registered holder of the Shares tendered hereby, the signature must correspond with the name as written on the face of the certificate(s) without any change whatsoever. 

    If
any of the Shares tendered hereby are owned of record by two or more joint owners, all such owners must sign this Letter of Transmittal. 

    If
any tendered Shares are registered in different names on several certificates, it will be necessary to complete, sign and submit as many separate Letters of Transmittal as there
are different registrations of certificates. 

    If
this Letter of Transmittal or any certificates or stock powers are signed by trustees, executors, administrators, guardians, attorneys-in-fact, officers of corporations or others
acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such persons should so indicate when signing, and proper evidence satisfactory to the Purchaser of their authority so to act must be submitted. 

    When
this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered owner(s) of the Shares listed and transmitted hereby, no endorsements of certificates or separate stock powers are required
unless payment is to be made to or certificates for Shares not tendered or accepted for payment are to be issued to a person other than the registered owner(s). Signatures on such certificates or
stock powers must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution. 

    If
this Letter of Transmittal is signed by a person other than the registered owner(s) of certificates listed, the certificates must be endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock
powers, in either case signed exactly as the name or names of the registered owner or owners appear on the certificates. Signatures on such certificates or stock powers must be guaranteed by an
Eligible Institution. 

    6.
  Stock Transfer Taxes.
  The Purchaser will pay any stock transfer taxes with respect to the transfer
and sale of Shares to it or its order pursuant to the Offer. If, however, payment of the purchase price is to be made to, or if certificates for Shares not tendered or accepted for payment are to be
registered in the name of, any person(s) other than the registered owner(s), or if tendered certificates are registered in the name of any person(s) other than the person(s) signing this Letter of
Transmittal, the amount of any stock transfer taxes (whether imposed on the registered owner(s) or such person(s)) payable on account of the transfer to such person(s) will be deducted from the
purchase price unless satisfactory evidence of the payment of such taxes or exemption therefrom is submitted. 

    Except
as provided in this Instruction 6, it will not be necessary for transfer tax stamps to be affixed to the certificates listed in this Letter of Transmittal. 

    7.
  Special Payment and Delivery Instructions.
  If a check is to be issued in the name of, and/or
certificates for Shares not accepted for payment are to be returned to, a person other than the signer of this Letter of Transmittal or if a check is to be sent and/or such certificates are to be
returned to a person other than the signer of this Letter of Transmittal or to an address other than that shown above, the appropriate boxes on this Letter of Transmittal should be completed. 

    8.
  Waiver of Conditions.
  The Purchaser reserves the absolute right in its sole discretion to waive any
of the specified conditions (other than the Minimum Condition (as defined in the Offer to Purchase)) of the Offer, in whole or in part, in the case of any Shares tendered. 

    9.
  31% Backup Withholding.
  In order to avoid backup withholding of U.S. federal income tax on payments
of cash pursuant to the Offer, a Shareholder surrendering Shares in the Offer must, unless an exemption applies, provide the Depositary with such Shareholder's correct taxpayer identification number
("TIN") on Substitute Form W-9 below in this Letter of Transmittal and certify under penalties of perjury that such TIN is correct and that such Shareholder is not subject to backup withholding. If a
Shareholder does not provide such Shareholder's correct TIN or fails to provide the certifications described above, the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") may impose a $50 penalty on such
Shareholder and payment of cash to such Shareholder pursuant to the Offer may be subject to backup withholding of 31%. 

    Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the amount of the backup withholding can be credited against the Federal income tax liability of the person subject to the backup
withholding, provided that the required information is given to the IRS. If backup withholding results in an overpayment of tax, a refund can be obtained by the Shareholder upon filing an income tax
return. 

    The
Shareholder is required to give the Depositary the TIN (I.E., social security number or employer identification number) of the record owner of the Shares. If the Shares are held
in more than one name or are not in the name of the actual owner, consult the enclosed "Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9" for additional guidance
on which number to report. 

    The
box in Part 3 of the Substitute Form W-9 may be checked if the tendering Shareholder has not been issued a TIN and has applied for a TIN or intends to apply for a TIN in the near
future. If the box in Part 3 is checked, the Shareholder or other payee must also complete the Certificate of Awaiting Taxpayer Identification Number below in order to avoid backup withholding.
Notwithstanding that the box in Part 3 is checked and the Certificate of Awaiting Taxpayer Identification Number is completed, the Depositary will withhold 31% on all payments made prior to the time a
properly certified TIN is provided to the Depositary. However, such amounts will be refunded to such Shareholder if a TIN is provided to the Depositary within 60 days. 

    Certain
Shareholders (including, among others, all corporations and certain foreign individuals and entities) are not subject to backup withholding. Noncorporate foreign Shareholders
should complete and sign the main signature form and a Form W-8, Certificate of Foreign Status, a copy of which may be obtained from the Depositary, in order to avoid backup withholding. Shareholders
should consult their tax advisors about qualifying for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such exemption. See the enclosed "Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer
Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9" for more instructions. 

    10.
  Requests for Assistance or Additional Copies.
  Questions and requests for assistance may be directed
to Innisfree M&A Incorporated (the "Information Agent") or to Salomon Smith Barney Inc. (the "Dealer Manager") at their respective addresses listed below. Additional copies of the Offer to Purchase,
this Letter of Transmittal, the Notice of Guaranteed Delivery and the Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9 may be obtained from the Information Agent
or from brokers, dealers, banks, trust companies or other nominees. 

    11.
  Lost, Destroyed or Stolen Certificates.
  If any certificate representing Shares has been lost,
destroyed or stolen, the Shareholder should promptly notify the Depositary by checking the box immediately preceding the special payment/special delivery instructions and indicating the number of
Shares so lost, destroyed or stolen, or call the Depositary at (800) 468-9716. The Shareholder will then be instructed by the Depositary as to the steps that must be taken in order to replace the
certificate. This Letter of Transmittal and related documents cannot be processed until the procedures for replacing lost or destroyed certificates have been followed. 

    IMPORTANT:
THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL (OR A MANUALLY SIGNED FACSIMILE THEREOF) TOGETHER WITH ANY SIGNATURE GUARANTEES, OR, IN THE CASE OF A BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER, AN AGENT'S MESSAGE,
AND ANY OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS, MUST BE RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATE AND EITHER CERTIFICATES FOR TENDERED SHARES MUST BE RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY OR SHARES MUST BE
DELIVERED PURSUANT TO THE PROCEDURES FOR BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER, IN EACH CASE PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATE, OR THE TENDERING SHAREHOLDER MUST COMPLY WITH THE PROCEDURES FOR GUARANTEED DELIVERY.

(2) Civil Penalty for False Information with Respect to Withholding.
If you make a false statement with no reasonable
basis which results in no imposition of backup withholding, you are subject to a penalty of $500. 

(3) Criminal Penalty for Falsifying Information.
Falsifying certifications or affirmations may subject you to criminal
penalties including fines and/or imprisonment.

Notice of Offer to Purchase for Cash

All Outstanding Shares of Common Stock

of

SMC Corporation

at

$3.70 Net Per Share

by

Salmon Acquisition Inc.,

a wholly owned subsidiary of

Monaco Coach Corporation  

    Salmon Acquisition, Inc., an Oregon corporation ("Purchaser") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Monaco Coach Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), is offering to purchase all outstanding shares of common stock (the "Shares") of SMC Corporation, an Oregon corporation (the "Company"), at $3.70 per Share, net to the seller
in cash, without interest thereon, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated July 5, 2001, and the related Letter of Transmittal (which, together
with any amendments or supplements thereto, collectively constitute the "Offer"). Tendering shareholders who have Shares registered in their names and who tender directly to Wells Fargo Bank
Minnesota, N.A. (the "Depositary") will not be obligated to pay brokerage fees or commissions or, except as set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, transfer taxes on the purchase of Shares by
Purchaser pursuant to the Offer. Shareholders who hold their Shares through a broker or bank should consult with such institution as to whether it charges any service fees. The purpose of the Offer is
to acquire for cash as many outstanding Shares as possible as a first step in acquiring the entire equity interest in the Company. Following the consummation of the Offer, Purchaser intends to effect
the Merger (as defined below). 

THE
OFFER AND WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS WILL EXPIRE AT 12:00 MIDNIGHT, NEW YORK CITY TIME, ON WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 1, 2001, UNLESS THE OFFER IS EXTENDED. 

    The
Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, there being validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date (as defined below) that number of Shares which would
constitute at least 51% of the outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis. The Offer is being made pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of June 23, 2001 (the "Merger
Agreement") among Parent, Purchaser and the Company pursuant to which, following the consummation of the Offer and the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, Purchaser will be merged with and
into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the "Merger"). At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding Share (other than Shares owned by
Parent, Purchaser or the Company or any subsidiary of Parent or the Company or by shareholders, if any, who are entitled to and properly exercise appraisal rights under Oregon law) will be converted
into the right to receive the price per Share paid pursuant to the Offer in cash, without interest, as set forth in the Merger Agreement and described in the Offer to Purchase. 

    THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY HAS APPROVED AND ADOPTED THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY AND DETERMINED THAT THE OFFER AND THE MERGER ARE
ADVISABLE AND FAIR TO AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS. ACCORDINGLY, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY RECOMMENDS THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS TENDER THEIR SHARES IN THE
OFFER. 

    For
purposes of the Offer, Purchaser will be deemed to have accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer, and thereby purchased, Shares validly tendered to Purchaser and not properly
withdrawn as, if and when Purchaser gives oral or written notice to the Depositary of Purchaser's acceptance for payment of such Shares. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer,
payment for Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer will be made by deposit of the purchase price therefor with the Depositary, which will act as an agent for tendering shareholders for the
purpose of receiving payment from Purchaser and transmitting payment to tendering shareholders whose shares have been accepted for payment. 

    In
all cases, payment for Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer will be made only after timely receipt by the Depositary of (a) the certificates for such Shares or
timely confirmation of book-entry transfer of such Shares into the Depositary's account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) pursuant to
the procedures set forth in Section 2 of the Offer to Purchase, (b) a Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed, with any required signature
guarantees or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an Agent's Message (as
defined in the Offer to Purchase) and (c) any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL INTEREST BE PAID BY PURCHASER ON THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE
SHARES, REGARDLESS OF ANY EXTENSION OF THE OFFER OR ANY DELAY IN PAYING FOR SUCH SHARES. 

    The
term "Expiration Date" means 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Wednesday, August 1, 2001, unless and until Purchaser shall have extended the period of time during
which the Offer is open in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, in which event the term "Expiration Date" shall mean the latest time and date at which the Offer, as so extended by
Purchaser, will expire. Purchaser may, without the consent of the Company, and Purchaser expressly reserves the right (but shall not be obligated) to, extend the Offer, and thereby delay acceptance
for payment of, and the payment for, any Shares, by giving oral or written notice of such extension to the Depositary, (a) if at the Expiration Date any of the conditions to Purchaser's
obligation to purchase Shares are not satisfied, until such time as such conditions are satisfied or waived, (b) for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of
the Securities Exchange Commission (the "Commission") or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer or (c) if all conditions to Purchaser's obligation to accept for payment and pay for Shares
are satisfied or waived but the number of Shares tendered is less than 90% of the then outstanding number of Shares, for an aggregate period of not more than 20 business days (for all such extensions)
beyond the latest expiration date that would otherwise be permitted under clause (a) or (b) of this sentence. 

    If
all of the conditions to the Offer are not satisfied on the Expiration Date, then Purchaser may extend the Offer for one or more periods of time until such conditions are satisfied
or waived. Any such extension will be followed by public announcement thereof no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the next business day after the previously scheduled Expiration
Date. During any such extension, all Shares previously tendered and not withdrawn will remain subject to the Offer, subject to the right of a tendering shareholder to withdraw such shareholder's
Shares. Except as otherwise provided below, tenders of Shares are irrevocable. 

    Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer may be withdrawn pursuant to the procedures set forth below at any time prior to the Expiration Date, except (i) that tendered Shares may also be
withdrawn 

at any time after September 3, 2001 unless accepted for payment before then as provided in this Offer to Purchase, and (ii) as provided below with respect to a subsequent offering period. For a
withdrawal to be effective, a written or facsimile transmission notice of withdrawal must be timely received by the Depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the back cover of the Offer to
Purchase and must specify the name of the person having tendered the Shares to be withdrawn, the number of Shares to be withdrawn and the name of the registered holder of the Shares to be withdrawn,
if different from the name of the person who tendered the Shares. If certificates for Shares have been delivered or otherwise identified to the Depositary, then prior to the physical release of such
certificates, the serial numbers shown on such certificates must be submitted to the Depositary and, unless such Shares have been tendered by an Eligible Institution (as defined in the Offer to
Purchase), any and all signatures on the notice of withdrawal must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution. If Shares have been tendered
pursuant to the book-entry transfer procedures described in Section 2 of the Offer to Purchase, any notice of withdrawal must also specify the name and number of the account at the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility to be credited with the withdrawn Shares and otherwise comply with the Book-Entry Transfer Facility's procedures. Withdrawals of tenders of Shares
may not be rescinded, and any Shares properly withdrawn will thereafter be deemed not validly tendered for purposes of the Offer. However, withdrawn shares may be retendered by again following one of
the procedures described in Section 2 of the Offer to Purchase at any time prior to the Expiration Date. 

    Under
the Merger Agreement and pursuant to Rule 14d-11 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
Act"), Purchaser may, subject to certain conditions, elect to provide a subsequent offering period following the Expiration Date. Purchaser does not currently intend to provide a subsequent offering
period in the Offer, although it reserves the right to do so in its sole discretion. Under the Exchange Act, no withdrawal rights apply to Shares tendered during a subsequent offering period and no
withdrawal rights apply during the subsequent offering period with respect to Shares tendered in the Offer and accepted for payment. The same consideration will be paid to shareholders tendering
shares in the Offer or in a subsequent offering period, if one is included. See Section 1 of the Offer to Purchase. All questions as to the form and validity (including time of receipt) of
notices of withdrawal will be determined by Purchaser, in its sole discretion, which determination will be final and binding. None of Purchaser, Parent, the Company, the Depositary, the Information
Agent (set forth below), the Dealer Manager or any other person will be under any duty to give notification of any defects or irregularities in any notice of withdrawal or incur any liability for
failure to give any such notification. 

    The
Company has provided Purchaser with the Company's shareholder lists and security position listings for the purpose of disseminating the Offer to holders of Shares. The Offer to
Purchase and the related Letter of Transmittal and other relevant materials will be mailed to record holders of Shares and furnished to brokers, dealers, banks, trust companies and similar persons
whose names, or the names of whose nominees, appear on the Company's shareholder lists, or, if applicable, who are listed as participants in a clearing agency's security position listing, for
subsequent transmittal to beneficial owners of Shares. 

    The
receipt of cash pursuant to the Offer or the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may also be a taxable transaction under applicable
state, local or foreign tax laws. In general, a shareholder who receives cash in exchange for Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Merger will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and such shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the Shares exchanged therefor. Provided that such Shares constitute capital
assets in the hands of the shareholder, such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the holder has held the Shares for more than one year
at the time of sale. The maximum U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to individual taxpayers on long-term capital gains is 20%, and the deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations. All shareholders should consult with their own tax 

advisors as to the particular tax consequences of the Offer and the Merger to them, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and any state, local or foreign income and
other tax laws and of changes in such tax laws. For a more complete description of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Offer and the Merger, see Section 5 of the Offer to
Purchase. 

    Purchaser
expressly reserves the right (but shall not be obligated), at any time and from time to time, to waive any condition to the Offer or modify the terms of the Offer, subject
to (a) the terms of the Merger Agreement, which contain certain conditions that may not be waived and modifications that may not be made without the consent of the Company, and (b) the
rules and regulations of the Commission. 

    The
information required to be disclosed by paragraph (d)(1) of Rule 14d-6 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act is contained in the
Offer to Purchase and is incorporated herein by reference. 

    The
Offer to Purchase and Letter of Transmittal contain important information and should be read carefully and in their entirety before any decision is made with respect to the offer. 

    Questions
and requests for assistance may be directed to the Information Agent or the Dealer Manager, as set forth below. Requests for copies of the Offer to Purchase, the Letter of
Transmittal and all other tender offer materials may be directed to the Information Agent as set forth below, or brokers, dealers, banks, trust companies or other nominees, and copies will be
furnished promptly at Purchaser's expense. No fees or commissions will be payable to brokers, dealers or other persons (other than the Dealer Manager) for soliciting tenders of Shares pursuant to the
Offer.

    Re:

Retirement Agreement and Release of Claims

Dear
Mat: 

    This
letter (this "
Amendment
") amends the Retirement Agreement and Mutual Release of Claims dated February 23, 2001 between you
and SMC Corporation (the "
Company
"), a copy of which is attached hereto as 
Exhibit A 
(the
"
Retirement Agreement
"). Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Retirement Agreement. 

    The
Company, Monaco Coach Corporation ("
Monaco
"), and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Monaco, are parties to an Agreement and Plan of
Merger dated as of even date herewith, (the "
Merger Agreement
"), pursuant to which the Company will, if the merger is consummated, become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Monaco (the "Merger"). 

    In
consideration of the mutual promises in the Merger Agreement, the consideration to be received by you as a shareholder of the Company upon consummation of the merger, and other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, you and the Company agree as follows: 

    1.
  Effect of Amendment.
  Except as expressly set forth in this Amendment, the Retirement Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect. 

    2.
  Current Status of Employment.
  Pursuant to the Retirement Agreement, you became an "employee advisor"
of the Company and received one payment under that agreement. In addition, an automobile was transferred to you pursuant to Section 2.2 of the Retirement Agreement. At the meeting of the Board
of Directors of the Company on April 27, 2001, you agreed to return to work as a full-time employee of the Company while the Company evaluates purchase offers. Until the Effective
Date (defined below) you have agreed to continue to provide services as Chairman and President of the Company on a full-time basis. You have agreed to continue such employment until the
consummation of the Merger (the "
Effective Date
"). Until the Effective Date, you will continue to receive the same compensation and benefits paid to you
during your employment prior to your execution of the Retirement Agreement and shall not receive any payments or benefits pursuant to the Retirement Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event will you be required to continue your employment beyond August 31, 2001. 

    3.
  Retirement.

    3.1
  If Merger is Consummated.
  Upon consummation of the Merger, you will retire as an employee of the
Company. You will thereafter not be an employee of the Company or a member of its Board of Directors and will not receive payment of any advisory or consulting fees from the Company. Your rights under
Section 1, 2.1, 2.2 and 2.4 of the Retirement Agreement shall be terminated, and in lieu thereof you will have the following rights: 

    (a)
  Health Insurance.
  The Company will continue, at its expense, to provide health insurance benefits
to you comparable in the aggregate to those provided by the Company on the date of this Amendment. Such benefits shall be continued until your death. We 

acknowledge that you may not readily be insurable, and that the cost of such benefits may be substantial. As long as the following Medicare health coverage is comparable in the aggregate to the health
coverage which is currently provided by the Company, the Company will either directly pay or will reimburse you for the payments you make to obtain Medicare Part B insurance until your death.
In addition, until your death, the Company will either directly pay or will reimburse you for the payments you make to obtain a Medigap Policy (the "
Supplemental
Insurance
") which provides insurance to supplement Medicare Part A and Part B Coverage under the Original Medicare Plan choice. Several options exist regarding
Supplemental Insurance coverage and you and the Company must mutually agree, in good faith, about which Supplemental Insurance option best provides the substantially similar benefits referenced above
prior to incurring any liability for Supplemental Insurance or you will not be reimbursed. If the Company does not directly pay the premiums hereunder, then reimbursement will be made by the Company
within thirty (30) days of receipt of evidence of payment. If (i) the coverage under the Medicare Part B benefits and Supplemental Insurance are not at any time comparable in the
aggregate to the health insurance coverage provided to you by the Company on the date of this Amendment (a "Gap in Coverage"), (ii) you notify the Company of the Gap in Coverage within sisty
(60) days of its occurrence, and (iii) the Company agrees that there is a Gap in Coverage (which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld), then the Company will self insure or
otherwise purchase alternative insurance so as to provide benefits comparable in the aggregate. 

    (b)
  Consulting Services; Use of Aircraft.
  You agree to provide consulting services as an independent
contractor to Monaco as requested and directed by the Chairman or President of Monaco for a period of two (2) years following consummation of the merger transaction for up to two
(2) weeks per year. As consideration for such consulting services, you shall be entitled from time to time to use one of the Company's jet aircraft, as designated by the Company, and flight
crew for up to twenty (20) hours of flight time annually to destinations of your choice during such two (2) year period, upon reasonable notice to the Company for scheduling such use.
Any such use shall be completely at Company expense except for any personal income tax liability that you may incur as a result of such use. 

    (c)
  Release of Claims.

The release of claims by the Company set forth in
Section 6.1 of the Retirement Agreement shall not be applicable with respect to activities relating to the Merger transaction and, accordingly, will not operate to discharge any liability for
any claim that Monaco (or its acquisition subsidiary) might have relating to your activities in connection with the Merger transaction, without regard to whether the Company has been merged into
Monaco, or its acquisition subsidiary, at the time the claim accrues or is commenced.

    3.2
  If Merger is Not Consummated.
  If the Merger is not consummated pursuant to the Merger Agreement,
the provisions of Section 3.1 of this Amendment shall not apply and you shall, upon the Effective Date of your retirement, be entitled to all rights under the Retirement Agreement, including
those set forth in Section 1, 2.1, 2.2 and 2.4. 

    If the provisions of this Amendment are acceptable, please sign a copy of this letter and return it to me. 

Sincerely, SMC CORPORATION

Retirement Agreement and Appointment as an Employee Advisor

Dear

Chairman of the Board of Directors. You have agreed to continue such employment until the earlier of (i) consummation of the Merger or (ii) the termination of your services by the Board
of Directors (the "
Effective Date
"). Until the Effective Date, you will continue to receive the same benefits paid to you during your employment prior
to your execution of the Retirement Agreement and shall not receive any payments or benefits pursuant to the Retirement Agreement. Nothwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will you be required to
continue your employment beyond August 31, 2001. 

    3.
  Retirement.

    3.1
  If Merger is Consummated.
  Upon consummation of the Merger, you will retire as an employee of the
Company. You will thereafter not be an employee of the Company or a member of its Board of Directors and will not receive payment of any advisory or consulting fees from the Company. Your rights under

be continued until your death. We acknowledge that you may not readily be insurable, and that the cost of such benefits may be substantial. As long as the following Medicare health coverage is

Amendment (a "Gap in Coverage"), (ii) you notify the Company of the Gap in Coverage with sixty(60) days of its occurrence, and (iii) the Company agrees that there is a Gap in coverage
(which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld), then the Company will self insure or otherwise purchase alternative insurance so as to provide comparable benefits in the aggregate. 

    3.2
  If Merger is Not Consummated.
  If the Merger is not consummated pursuant to the Merger Agreement,
the provisions of Section 3.1 of this Amendment shall not apply and you shall, upon the Effective Date of your retirement, be entitled to all rights under the Retirement Agreement, including

    4.1 The
Company hereby releases and forever discharges you from any claims, demands, actions, suits, causes of action, debts, accounts or controversies of any nature

Ladies
and Gentlemen: 

    You
have advised us that you are acting on behalf of SMC Corporation (the "Company") in its consideration of a possible sale of its business, and you have agreed to discuss
with us our possible interest in acquiring the Company. As a condition to entering into such discussions, you and the Company have required that we agree to keep strictly confidential all information
provided to us with respect to this matter. 

    This
letter will confirm our agreement with you and the Company to retain in strict confidence all oral or written information furnished to us by or on behalf of the Company, its
representatives or agents, whether furnished before or after the date of this letter, and all notes, analyses, compilations, studies or other documents, whether prepared by us or others, which contain
or otherwise reflect such information (collectively, "Confidential Information"). For purposes of this agreement, Confidential Information does not include information which (i) is or becomes
generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by us, (ii) was available to us on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure by or on behalf of the Company, or
(iii) becomes available to us on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company or its representatives who is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Company, its
representatives or its agents or otherwise prohibited from transmitting the information to us by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation. 

    We
will use any Confidential Information only for the purpose of evaluating the proposed transaction and will not use it for any other purpose. Without the specific prior written
consent of the Company or as expressly otherwise permitted by the terms hereof, we also will not disclose any Confidential Information to any other person or entity other than our directors, officers,
employees and advisors who require such material for the purpose of evaluating the proposed transaction (provided that such persons shall be informed by us of the confidential nature of the
Confidential Information and of the fact that its use is subject to the terms of this agreement). We agree to be jointly and severally liable for any breach of this agreement by any of those persons
to whom we provide any Confidential Information and we agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Company from any damage, loss, cost or liability, including legal fees, arising out of or resulting from
such breach. 

    Without
the prior written consent of the Company, we and our representatives will not disclose to any person (i) the fact that the Confidential Information has been made
available to us or that we have inspected any portion of the Confidential Information, (ii) the fact that any discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a possible transaction, or
(iii) any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any possible transaction, including the status thereof, unless and only to the extent that such disclosure (after making
reasonable efforts to avoid such disclosure and after advising and consulting with the Company about your intention to make, and the proposed contents of, such 

disclosure) is, in the opinion of our counsel, required to be made by us in order to satisfy our obligations under applicable United States securities laws. 

    In
the event that we or our representatives are requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, Civil Investigative Demand
or similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information, it is agreed that we or such representative, as the case may be, will provide the Company with prompt notice of such request(s) so
that it may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive our compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy
is not obtained, or that the Company grants a waiver hereunder, we may furnish that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Information which, in the written opinion of our counsel, we are
legally compelled to disclose and will exercise our best efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded any Confidential Information so furnished. 

    Without
the prior written consent of the Company, (i) neither we nor those of our Representatives who are aware of the Evaluation Material and/or the possibility of an
Acquisition Transaction will initiate or cause to be initiated any communications with any employee of the Company concerning the Confidential Information or any possible transaction and
(ii) none of our directors, officers or employees who are aware of the Confidential Information and/or the possibility of a transaction will, for the two-year period from the date of this
letter agreement, solicit or cause to be solicited the employment of or hire any employee of the Company who has not been involuntarily terminated by the Company. 

    We
agree that, for a period of two years from the date of this agreement, unless such action shall have been specifically invited in writing by the Board of Directors of the Company,
neither we nor any of our affiliates or Advisors will, directly or indirectly, (a) effect or seek, offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect, participate in or cause or in any
way assist any other person to effect or seek, offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect or participate in (i) any acquisition of any securities (or beneficial ownership
thereof) or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) any tender or exchange offer or merger or other business combination involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
(iii) any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other extraordinary transaction with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (iv) any "solicitation"
of "proxies" (as such terms are used in the proxy rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission) or consents to vote any voting securities of the Company, (b) form, join or in any
way participate in a "group" (as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) with respect to any of the types of matters set forth in (a) above, (c) otherwise act, alone or
in concert with others, to seek to control or influence the management, the Board of Directors or policies of the Company, (d) take any action which might force the Company to make a public
announcement regarding any of the types of matters set forth in (a) above, or (e) enter into any discussions or arrangements with any third party with respect to any of the foregoing. We
also agree during any such period not to request the Company (or its directors, officers, employees, stockholders or agents), directly or indirectly, to amend or waive any provision of this paragraph
(including this sentence). 

    We
acknowledge that we are aware, and will advise our representatives, that the federal securities laws prohibit any person who has received from an issuer material, non-public
information from purchasing or selling securities of such issuer or from communicating such information to any other person under
circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities. 

    If
we determine not to proceed with a transaction or upon the written request of the Company, we will promptly deliver to the Company all documents or other materials furnished by the
Company to us or our representatives constituting Confidential Information, together with all copies thereof. In the event of such request, all other documents or other matter constituting
Confidential Information in our 

possession or in the possession of our representatives will be destroyed, with any such destruction confirmed by us in writing to the Company. 

    We
acknowledge that a breach of our obligations hereunder will cause irreparable harm to the Company for which monetary damages are not adequate compensation. Therefore, without
prejudice to the rights and remedies otherwise available to it, the Company shall be entitled to equitable relief by way of injunction if we or any of our representatives breach or threaten to breach
any of the provisions of this agreement. For such purpose, we hereby consent to jurisdiction of the United States District Court for Oregon and waive any obligation the Company may have to post a bond
or other security as a condition to obtaining such injunctive or other equitable relief. 

    Although
we understand that the Company has endeavored to include in the Confidential Information information known to it which it believes to be relevant for the purpose of our
investigation, we acknowledge that neither you, the Company nor its agents or its representatives makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential
Information. We agree that neither you, the Company nor its agents or its representatives shall have any liability to us or any of our representatives resulting from the use of the Confidential
Information by us or such representatives. Only those representations and warranties that may be made to us or our affiliates in a definitive written agreement for a proposed transaction, when, as and
if executed and subject to such limitations and restrictions as maybe specified therein, shall have any legal effect, and we agree that if we determine to engage in a transaction such determination
will be based solely on the terms of such written agreement and on our own investigation, analysis and assessment of the business to be acquired. 

    We
acknowledge that the Company reserves the right to reject any and all offers to acquire the Company. 

    This
