                        JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS
                  MERGER PROPOSED: YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

    The boards of directors of eXcelon Corporation and C-bridge Internet
Solutions, Inc. have agreed upon a merger combining eXcelon and C-bridge. Under
the terms of the merger agreement, which was signed on May 22, 2001, Comet
Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of eXcelon, will merge with and
into C-bridge, and C-bridge will become a wholly owned subsidiary of eXcelon.
eXcelon will be the surviving publicly traded company.

    In the merger, C-bridge stockholders will receive 1.2517 shares of eXcelon
common stock in exchange for each share of C-bridge common stock they hold.
Assuming that no options to purchase C-bridge common stock are exercised before
the closing of the merger, eXcelon expects to issue approximately 26,980,039
shares of its common stock to C-bridge stockholders in the merger, based on the
number of shares of C-bridge common stock outstanding on June 4, 2001. eXcelon
common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "EXLN."

    Completion of the merger is subject to approval by the stockholders of both
companies. eXcelon has scheduled its annual meeting of stockholders to approve
the issuance of eXcelon common stock in the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. C-bridge has scheduled a special meeting
of stockholders to vote on a proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement.
Both meetings will take place on July   , 2001. Only stockholders of record as
of June   , 2001 are entitled to vote at the respective meetings. At each
meeting, stockholders will also be asked to give management the discretionary
authority to adjourn the meeting to a later date or dates, but not after
            , 2001, in order to solicit additional proxies in favor of the
merger.

    At the eXcelon annual meeting, eXcelon stockholders will also be asked to
elect a new, combined board of eight directors, to approve an amendment to
eXcelon's 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares in
the plan to 2,200,000, and to approve an amendment to eXcelon's 1996 Incentive
and Nonqualified Stock Option Plan to increase the number of shares in the plan
to 7,700,000 shares.

    A copy of the merger agreement is included as Annex A to this proxy
statement/prospectus. You should read this entire proxy statement/prospectus,
including the annexes, carefully.

    Your vote is very important. Whether or not you plan to attend the special
meeting of C-bridge or the annual meeting of eXcelon, please take the time to
vote by completing and mailing the enclosed proxy card or vote by using the
Internet or by telephone. If you are a C-bridge stockholder and you sign, date
and mail your proxy card without indicating how you want to vote, your proxy
will be voted in favor of the merger and the adjournment proposal. If you are an
eXcelon stockholder and you sign, date and mail your proxy card without
indicating how you want to vote, your proxy will be voted in favor of the merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the adjournment
proposal, the election of the new board of directors of the combined company and
the proposals to amend eXcelon's stock plans.

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

    THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ARE INTENDED TO ADDRESS BRIEFLY SOME
COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS REGARDING THE MERGER. THESE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS MAY
NOT ADDRESS ALL QUESTIONS THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO YOU. PLEASE REFER TO THE MORE
DETAILED INFORMATION CONTAINED ELSEWHERE IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS, THE
ANNEXES TO THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS AND THE DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY
REFERENCE IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS.

Q: WHAT AM I BEING ASKED TO VOTE UPON?

A: C-bridge's board of directors and eXcelon's board of directors have approved
    a merger agreement which provides that eXcelon will acquire C-bridge by
    merging a wholly owned subsidiary of eXcelon with C-bridge. C-bridge will
    become a wholly owned subsidiary of eXcelon, and eXcelon will be the
    surviving publicly traded company. C-bridge's and eXcelon's boards of
    directors are asking their respective stockholders to provide the necessary
    approvals to complete the merger.

Q: WHAT WILL I RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?

A: C-bridge stockholders will receive 1.2517 shares of eXcelon common stock for
    each share of C-bridge common stock owned by them at the closing of the
    merger. No fractional shares of eXcelon common stock will be issued.
    C-bridge stockholders will instead receive cash for any fractional share to
    which they would otherwise be entitled. eXcelon stockholders will continue
    to own the shares of eXcelon common stock that they currently own.

Q: WHAT PERCENTAGES OF THE COMBINED COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK WILL THE CURRENT
    STOCKHOLDERS OF C-BRIDGE AND EXCELON HOLD AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE
    MERGER?

A: Assuming that no options to purchase C-bridge common stock or eXcelon common
    stock are exercised before the merger is completed, immediately after the
    completion of the merger the current eXcelon stockholders will own
    approximately 52.4%, and the current C-bridge stockholders will own
    approximately 47.6%, of the outstanding common stock of the combined
    company.

Q: WHAT HAVE THE MARKET PRICES OF C-BRIDGE AND EXCELON COMMON STOCK BEEN
    RECENTLY?

A: As reported on the Nasdaq National Market, on June 13, 2001, the last sale
    price per share of the C-bridge common stock was $1.84, and the last sale
    price per share of the eXcelon common stock was $1.64.

Q: WHAT ARE THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO ME?

A: As a general matter, neither you, eXcelon nor C-bridge will recognize any
    gain or loss for federal income tax purposes in the merger. Tax matters are
    very complicated and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend
    on the facts of your own situation. You should consult your tax advisors for
    a full understanding of the tax consequences of the merger to you.

Q: WHAT VOTE IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE THE MERGER?

A: Under Delaware law, the approval of the proposal to approve and adopt the
    merger agreement will require the affirmative vote of the holders of a
    majority of the outstanding shares of C-bridge's common stock. Abstentions
    and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote against the
    proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. The C-bridge board of
    directors recommends that its stockholders vote FOR the proposal to approve
    and adopt the merger agreement.

    Because a subsidiary of eXcelon, rather than eXcelon itself, is merging with
    C-bridge, Delaware law does not require that eXcelon stockholders approve
    and adopt the merger agreement. However, under the rules of the Nasdaq Stock
    Market, eXcelon must obtain stockholder approval of the issuance of eXcelon
    common stock in connection with the merger, including upon the

    exchange of C-bridge common stock, upon the exercise of C-bridge stock
    options that eXcelon will assume in the merger and upon the exercise of
    rights to purchase C-bridge common stock under the C-bridge employee stock
    purchase plan that will be converted into rights to purchase eXcelon common
    stock as a result of the merger. The approval of the issuance of eXcelon
    common stock in the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
    merger agreement will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the
    shares of eXcelon common stock cast at the annual meeting. Abstentions and
    broker non-votes will not count as votes cast on the proposal and,
    accordingly, will not affect the outcome of the vote on that proposal. The
    eXcelon board of directors recommends that its stockholders vote FOR the
    proposal to approve the issuance of eXcelon common stock in the merger and
    the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Q: WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON'T VOTE ON THE MERGER?

A. If you are a C-bridge stockholder, your failure to vote on the merger will
    have the same effect as a vote against the merger.

    If you are an eXcelon stockholder, your failure to vote on the merger will
    not affect the outcome of the vote on the merger. However, your failure to
    vote could prevent the formation of a quorum, which would prevent a vote on
    the merger.

Q: HAVE ANY STOCKHOLDERS OF C-BRIDGE AGREED TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE MERGER?

A: Yes. The directors, executive officers and several stockholders of C-bridge,
    who collectively held, as of June 4, 2001, approximately 47.8% of the
    C-bridge common stock outstanding on that date, have each agreed to vote in
    favor of the merger.

Q: HAVE ANY STOCKHOLDERS OF EXCELON AGREED TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE MERGER?

A: Yes. The directors and executive officers of eXcelon, who collectively held,
    as of June 4, 2001, approximately 4.6% of the eXcelon common stock
    outstanding on that date, have each agreed to vote in favor of the merger.

Q: DO THE DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF EXCELON HAVE ANY SPECIAL INTERESTS
    IN THE MERGER THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN THOSE OF EXCELON STOCKHOLDERS?

A: Yes. For example, under the merger agreement, all the current directors of
    eXcelon will continue to serve on eXcelon's board after the merger. In
    addition, three of eXcelon's current executive officers, Robert N. Goldman,
    the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of eXcelon, Satish Maripuri, the
    President and Chief Operating Officer of eXcelon, and Lacey P. Brandt, the
    Chief Financial Officer of eXcelon, have each entered into an employment
    agreement with eXcelon that will become effective at the time of the merger.
    Robert N. Goldman will also receive additional compensation from eXcelon
    upon completion of the merger.

Q: DO THE DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF C-BRIDGE HAVE ANY SPECIAL
    INTERESTS IN THE MERGER THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN THOSE OF C-BRIDGE
    STOCKHOLDERS?

A: Yes. For example, under the merger agreement, three current directors of
    C-bridge will serve on eXcelon's board after the merger. In addition, Joseph
    M. Bellini, the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating
    Officer of C-bridge, has entered into an employment agreement with eXcelon
    that will become effective at the time of the merger. The agreement provides
    for the grant to Mr. Bellini at the time of the merger of options to
    purchase 1,000,000 shares of eXcelon common stock that will vest over a
    four-year period.

Q: ARE THERE ANY APPRAISAL OR DISSENTERS' RIGHT IN THE MERGER?

A: No. Neither C-bridge's stockholders nor eXcelon's stockholders have appraisal
    or dissenters' rights in connection with the merger.

Q: WHAT ARE THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSALS?

A: In the adjournment proposals, C-bridge and eXcelon are asking their
    stockholders to grant their respective managements the discretionary
    authority to adjourn the C-bridge special meeting and the eXcelon annual
    meeting, respectively, to a date or dates not later than       , 2001 if the
    number of shares voting in favor of approval and adoption of the merger
    agreement or, in eXcelon's case, the approval of the issuance of shares of
    eXcelon common stock in the merger and the other transactions contemplated
    by the merger agreement, is insufficient to approve the proposal. Adjourning
    the stockholder meetings to a later date will provide additional time to
    solicit proxies in favor of the proposals.

    The board of directors of each company recommends that its stockholders vote
    FOR the adjournment proposal.

Q: WHAT VOTES ARE REQUIRED TO APPROVE THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSALS?

A: For C-bridge, approval of the adjournment proposal will require the
    affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of C-bridge
    common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special
    meeting and entitled to vote. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the
    same effect as a vote against this proposal.

    For eXcelon, the adjournment proposal will require the affirmative vote of a
    majority of the shares of eXcelon common stock cast at the annual meeting.
    Abstentions and broker non-votes will not count as votes cast on the
    proposal and, accordingly, will not affect the outcome of the vote on that
    proposal.

Q: WHAT ELSE ARE STOCKHOLDERS BEING ASKED TO VOTE ON AT THE EXCELON ANNUAL
    MEETING?

A: eXcelon stockholders are also being asked to vote on a proposal to elect a
    new board of eight directors of the combined company, to approve an
    amendment to eXcelon's 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase the
    number of shares in the plan to 2,200,000 shares, and to approve an
    amendment to eXcelon's 1996 Incentive and Nonqualified Stock Option Plan to
    increase the maximum number of shares in the plan to 7,700,000 shares.

    eXcelon's proposal to elect a new board of directors of the combined company
    is subject to completion of the merger. If the merger is completed on or
    before October 31, 2001, the election of the new board, if approved, will
    become effective on the date of the merger. If the merger is not completed
    by that date, or if the merger agreement is terminated on or before that
    date, then the election of the new board will have no effect, and eXcelon
    will schedule another stockholder meeting to elect directors.

Q: WHAT VOTE IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE EACH OF THE ADDITIONAL PROPOSALS?

A: The election of each of the eight directors to the new board of directors of
    the combined company will require the affirmative vote of a plurality of the
    shares cast at the annual meeting. The proposals to approve the amendments
    to eXcelon's 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and 1996 Incentive and
    Nonqualified Stock Option Plan will require the affirmative vote of a
    majority of the shares of eXcelon common stock cast at the annual meeting.
    Abstentions, broker non-votes and votes withheld from the election of any
    director will not count as votes cast for or against any proposal and,
    accordingly, will not affect the outcome of the vote on any proposal.

    The eXcelon board of directors recommends that its stockholders vote FOR the
    proposal to elect eight directors as a new board of directors of the
    combined company, FOR the proposal to amend eXcelon's 1996 Employee Stock
    Purchase Plan and FOR the proposal to amend eXcelon's 1996 Incentive and
    Nonqualified Stock Option Plan.

Q: WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?

A: Please mail your signed proxy card in the enclosed return envelope as soon as
    possible, or vote by telephone or using the Internet, so that your shares
    may be represented at your annual meeting or special meeting. Please see the
    instructions included with your proxy card.

Q: IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY MY BROKER, WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY
    SHARES FOR ME?

A: If you are a C-bridge stockholder and do not provide your broker with
    instructions on how to vote your shares held in "street name," your broker
    will not be permitted to vote them and you will, in effect, be voting
    against the merger. You should be sure to provide your broker with
    instructions on how to vote your shares. Please check the instructions
    provided by your broker to see if it offers telephone or Internet voting.

    In the case of eXcelon stockholders, if you do not give voting instructions
    to your broker, your broker may be unable to vote your shares in favor of
    the merger, and your shares may not participate in the vote on the merger
    taken at the annual meeting.

Q: WHAT IF I WANT TO CHANGE MY VOTE?

A: A vote can be changed at any time before the proxy is voted at the eXcelon
    annual meeting or the C-bridge special meeting. If you hold your shares in
    "street name" through your broker, you can send a written notice to your
    broker stating that you would like to revoke your proxy, or you can complete
    and deliver new voting instructions to your broker. You may also appear at
    the annual meeting or the special meeting, as the case may be, with a signed
    revocation and a legal proxy from your broker allowing you to vote your
    shares in person. If your shares are held in your own name and not in
    "street name" by your broker, you may revoke your proxy by sending your
    company a written notice of revocation bearing a later date then your proxy,
    by completing and delivering a new proxy or by appearing at the annual
    meeting or the special meeting, as the case may be, and voting in person.

Q: SHOULD I SEND MY STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW?

A: No. After the merger is completed, C-bridge stockholders will receive written
    instructions for exchanging their stock certificates. eXcelon stockholders
    will keep their current stock certificates.

Q: WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE COMPLETED?

A: We are working to complete the merger as soon as possible. We expect to
    complete the merger promptly following the approval of our stockholders at
    the eXcelon annual meeting and the C-bridge special meeting.

INTERESTS OF C-BRIDGE'S MANAGEMENT AND CERTAIN STOCKHOLDERS IN THE MERGER (SEE
PAGE 68)

    In considering the recommendation of C-bridge's board of directors that
C-bridge stockholders vote in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the
merger agreement, the C-bridge stockholders should be aware that C-bridge's
directors and officers may have interests in the merger that are different from,
or in addition to, the interests of the C-bridge stockholders in the merger. For
example, Joseph M. Bellini, the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Operating Officer of C-bridge, has entered into an employment agreement with
eXcelon that will become effective at the closing of the merger. The agreement
provides for the grant to Mr. Bellini at the time of the merger of options to
purchase 1,000,000 shares of eXcelon common stock that will vest over a
four-year period.

INTERESTS OF eXCELON'S MANAGEMENT AND CERTAIN STOCKHOLDERS IN THE MERGER (SEE
PAGE 58)

    In considering the recommendation of eXcelon's board of directors that
eXcelon stockholders vote in favor of the proposal to approve the issuance of
eXcelon common stock in the merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement, the eXcelon stockholders should be aware that eXcelon's
directors and officers may have interests in the merger that are different from,
or in addition to, the interests of the eXcelon stockholders in the merger. For
example, Robert N. Goldman, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of eXcelon,
Satish Maripuri, the President and Chief Operating Officer of eXcelon, and Lacey
P. Brandt, the Chief Financial Officer of eXcelon, have each entered into
employment agreements with eXcelon that will become effective at the closing of
the merger. Mr. Goldman will also receive additional compensation from eXcelon
upon completion of the merger.

OWNERSHIP OF eXCELON COMMON STOCK FOLLOWING THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 69)

    Assuming that no options to purchase C-bridge common stock are exercised
before the closing of the merger, eXcelon will issue approximately 26,980,039
shares of its common stock to C-bridge stockholders in the merger. Immediately
following the merger, existing eXcelon stockholders will own approximately
52.4%, and former C-bridge stockholders will own approximately 47.6%, of the
outstanding common stock of eXcelon. Our calculation of the percentage ownership
of eXcelon common stock following the merger is based on each company's
outstanding common stock as of June 4, 2001, and assumes that no options to
purchase C-bridge or eXcelon common stock are exercised between that date and
the closing of the merger.

MANAGEMENT OF eXCELON FOLLOWING THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 70)

    If the eXcelon stockholders approve the proposals presented at the eXcelon
annual meeting, after the merger, eXcelon's board of directors will consist of
eight directors, four of whom are current directors of eXcelon, Robert M. Agate,
Gerald B. Bay, Kevin J. Burns and Robert N. Goldman, and four of whom are
designated by C-bridge and include three current directors of C-bridge, Joseph
L. Badaracco, Jr., Joseph M. Bellini and Raymond J. Lane, and Jeffrey Horing,
who is not currently a director of C-bridge or eXcelon. Robert N. Goldman will
continue as the Chairman of the Board of eXcelon and Joseph M. Bellini will
become Chief Executive Officer of eXcelon. Mark A. Cosway will become President
of eXcelon. Satish Maripuri will serve as the Chief Operating Officer of eXcelon
and Lacey P. Brandt will continue as Chief Financial Officer of eXcelon. In
addition, eXcelon will employ several other members of C-bridge's management as
senior executives.

VOTING AGREEMENTS (SEE PAGE 79)

    As required by the merger agreement, the directors, executive officers and
several stockholders of C-bridge, who collectively owned, as of June 4, 2001,
10,299,666 shares, or approximately 47.8%, of the C-bridge common stock
outstanding on that date, entered into irrevocable proxy and voting agreements
with eXcelon, which authorize eXcelon to vote their shares in favor of the
merger and, in some cases, require those persons not to dispose of their
C-bridge common stock pending completion of the merger. The directors and
executive officers of eXcelon, who collectively owned, as of June 4, 2001,
1,356,599 shares, or approximately 4.6% of the eXcelon common stock outstanding
on that date, entered into equivalent irrevocable proxy and voting agreements
with C-bridge, which authorize C-bridge to vote their shares in favor of the
merger and require those persons not to dispose of their eXcelon common stock
pending completion of the merger.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS (SEE PAGE 81)

    Three executive officers of eXcelon and one executive officer of C-bridge
have signed employment agreements with eXcelon and will be employed, or continue
to be employed, by eXcelon after the completion of the merger. eXcelon signed
new employment agreements with Robert M. Goldman, the current Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of eXcelon, and Joseph M. Bellini, the Chairman, Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer of C-bridge. These agreements will
replace the existing employment agreements that Messrs. Goldman and Bellini have
with eXcelon and C-bridge, respectively. eXcelon also signed employment
agreements with Satish Maripuri, the current President and Chief Operating
Officer of eXcelon, and Lacey P. Brandt, the current Chief Financial Officer of
eXcelon. These agreements will replace the existing severance agreements that
Mr. Maripuri and Ms. Brandt have with eXcelon. All of these employment
agreements will become effective upon the completion of the merger.

      warranty, covenant or agreement in the merger agreement and the breach has
      not been cured within five business days after written notice by the
      non-breaching party. The merger agreement may not be terminated as a

      state court in effect preventing consummation of the merger;

    - by either party if there is any final action taken or any statute, rule,
      regulation or order enacted by any governmental entity which would make
      consummation of the merger illegal, prohibit eXcelon's ownership or
      operation of all or a material portion of C-bridge's business or compel
      eXcelon to dispose of or hold separate all or any material portion of the
      business or assets of C-bridge or eXcelon as a result of the merger;

    - by either party if C-bridge's stockholders do not approve and adopt the
      merger and the merger agreement, provided that C-bridge may not terminate
      the merger agreement in these circumstances if it is in material breach of
      the merger agreement;

    - by either party if eXcelon's stockholders do not approve the merger and
      the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, provided that
      eXcelon may not terminate in these circumstances if it is in material
      breach of the merger agreement;

    - by either party if the merger is not consummated by October 31, 2001. The
      right to terminate the merger agreement in this circumstance is not
      available to any party whose willful failure to fulfill any material
      obligation under the merger agreement has been the cause of, or resulted
      in, the failure of the merger to be completed on or before that date; and

    - by either party if eXcelon's or C-bridge's board of directors accepts or
      approves a superior proposal, or recommends a superior proposal to its
      stockholders.

      accountants' and financial advisors' fees;

    - if the merger agreement is terminated by either party because either
      party's board of directors accepts, approves or recommends to its
      stockholders a superior proposal, then the party that accepts, approves or

      fee of $3,000,000 and reimburse the other party for all of its reasonable

         SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL DATA
                     (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)

    The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information
of eXcelon and C-bridge has been derived from eXcelon's and C-bridge's financial
statements, selected financial data and related notes included elsewhere or
incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus. This information
does not incorporate or assume any cost savings or synergies of operations of
the combined company. The pro forma combined condensed statement of operations
data account for the merger as a purchase transaction and assume that the merger
had occurred at the beginning of the periods presented. The pro forma combined
condensed balance sheet data assume that the acquisition occurred on March 31,
2001.

    The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information includes
estimates. The purchase price of the C-bridge common stock exchanged in the
merger has been allocated on a preliminary basis to assets and liabilities based
on eXcelon management's best estimates of their fair value, and the excess of
the purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets
acquired has been allocated to intangible assets. This allocation is subject to
change pending a final analysis of the total purchase cost and the fair value of
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The impact of these changes could
be material.

    The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information is
presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of
the operating results or financial position that would have occurred if the
merger had been consummated at the assumed time, nor is it necessarily
indicative of the future operating results or financial position of the combined
company.

COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA

    The following table presents specified historical per share data of eXcelon
and C-bridge and unaudited pro forma per share data of the combined company
after giving effect to the merger and the issuance of 1.2517 shares of eXcelon
common stock for each share of C-bridge common stock. This data is derived from
and should be read in conjunction with the selected historical consolidated
financial data included in this proxy statement/prospectus and separate
historical consolidated financial statements of eXcelon and C-bridge that are
included or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus. The
unaudited pro forma combined financial data are not necessarily indicative of
the operating results that would have been achieved had the merger occurred at
the beginning of the

periods presented and is not necessarily indicative of the future results of
operations of the combined company.

    The pro forma combined net loss per equivalent C-bridge share amount was
calculated by multiplying the pro forma combined net loss per eXcelon share
amount by the exchange ratio of 1.2517.

    The historical book value per common share was calculated by dividing
stockholders' equity by the number of shares of common stock outstanding at
March 31, 2001. The pro forma combined book value per eXcelon common share was
calculated by dividing pro forma stockholders' equity by the pro forma number of
shares of eXcelon common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2001, assuming the
merger had occurred as of that date. The pro forma combined book value per
equivalent C-bridge common share was calculated by multiplying the pro forma
combined book value per eXcelon common share by the exchange ratio of 1.2517.

    No pro forma adjustments have been included in this data to reflect
potential effects of:

    - the efficiencies which may be obtained by combining eXcelon and C-bridge
      operations, or

    - the cost of restructuring, integrating or consolidating these operations.

    The following table provides the closing price per share of eXcelon common
stock and C-bridge common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market on
May 22, 2001, the last full trading day preceding public announcement of the

    eXcelon and C-bridge believe that the C-bridge common stock presently trades
on the basis of the value of the eXcelon common stock, discounted primarily for
the uncertainties associated with the merger. Apart from the publicly disclosed
information concerning eXcelon that is included and incorporated by reference in
this proxy statement/prospectus, eXcelon cannot state with certainty what
factors account for changes in the market price of the eXcelon common stock.

    We urge you to obtain current market quotations for eXcelon common stock and
C-bridge common stock before voting on the merger. We cannot predict the market
prices for either eXcelon common stock or C-bridge common stock at any time
before the completion of the merger or the market price for eXcelon common stock
after the completion of the merger. Because the exchange ratio is fixed, the
exchange ratio will not be adjusted to compensate C-bridge stockholders for
decreases in the market price of eXcelon common stock that could occur before
the merger becomes effective. If the market price of eXcelon common stock
decreases or increases before the completion of

the merger, the value of the eXcelon common stock to be received in the merger
in exchange for C-bridge common stock would correspondingly decrease or
increase.

    Neither eXcelon nor C-bridge has declared or paid cash dividends on its
capital stock. Under the merger agreement, each of eXcelon and C-bridge has
agreed not to pay cash dividends before the completion of the merger without the
written consent of the other. The board of directors of each of eXcelon and
C-bridge presently intends to retain all earnings for use in its business and
has no present intention to pay cash dividends before or after the merger.
eXcelon is currently negotiating with Silicon Valley Bank for a credit facility
whose terms are likely to prohibit eXcelon from declaring or paying cash
dividends on its common stock.

                                  RISK FACTORS

    IN CONSIDERING HOW TO CAST YOUR VOTE ON THE MERGER PROPOSAL, YOU SHOULD
CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MERGER AND WITH OWNERSHIP OF
THE EXCELON COMMON STOCK FOLLOWING THE MERGER. THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
DESCRIBED BELOW ARE NOT THE ONLY RISKS THAT THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL FACE. IF
ONE OR MORE OF THESE RISKS OCCURS, THE COMBINED COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,
FINANCIAL CONDITION OR PROSPECTS WILL SUFFER AND THE PRICE OF THE COMBINED
COMPANY'S STOCK IS LIKELY TO FALL. THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT IN THE COMBINED
COMPANY COULD DECLINE AS A RESULT.

                          RISKS RELATED TO THE MERGER

IF eXCELON AND C-BRIDGE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE THEIR RESPECTIVE
BUSINESSES, THE COMBINED COMPANY MAY NOT REALIZE THE EXPECTED BENEFITS FROM THE
MERGER.

    The merger of eXcelon and C-bridge involves the combination of two companies
that have previously operated independently. eXcelon and C-bridge entered into
the merger agreement with the expectation that the merger will result in
benefits to the combined company. However, integrating the operations of
C-bridge with those of eXcelon after the merger may be difficult, time consuming
and costly. Any failure by eXcelon and C-bridge to integrate their operations
successfully could have a material adverse effect on the business of the
combined company. The difficulties involved in integrating the companies, which
could be substantial, include the following:

    - management and key personnel could be distracted from the day-to-day
      business of the combined company;

    - the business cultures of the two companies could prove to be incompatible;

    - managing the combined company's geographically dispersed operations could
      be difficult and costly;

    - implementing uniform controls, systems and procedures, especially
      information and accounting systems, could be costly and time consuming;
      and

    - key officers and technical, sales and customer support personnel may not
      be satisfied or happy in the combined company and may elect to leave.

THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE eXCELON COMMON STOCK TO BE ISSUED FOR EACH SHARE OF
THE C-BRIDGE COMMON STOCK IS FIXED, AND WILL NOT BE ADJUSTED IF THE STOCK PRICE
OF EITHER COMPANY INCREASES OR DECREASES.

    The ratio at which the C-bridge common stock will be converted into the
eXcelon common stock is fixed at 1.2517 shares of the eXcelon common stock for
each share of the C-bridge common stock, and this ratio will not be adjusted in
the event of any increase or decrease in the market price of eXcelon's or
C-bridge's common stock. The respective market prices of the eXcelon common
stock and the C-bridge common stock at the time the merger is effective may vary
from their respective prices at the time that the exchange ratio was
established, their respective prices on the date of this document and their
respective prices on the date of the eXcelon and C-bridge stockholder meetings.
This variation could be the result of a number of factors, including:

    - changes in the business, operations or prospects of eXcelon or C-bridge;

    - the timing of completion of the merger;

    - the prospects of the combined company;

    - market assessments of the likelihood that the merger will be completed;

    - regulatory considerations; or

    - general market and economic conditions.

    As a result, neither the market value of the eXcelon common stock that
C-bridge stockholders will receive in exchange for their shares, nor the market
value of the C-bridge common stock to be exchanged for eXcelon shares, is
certain. In considering whether or not to approve the merger and the
transactions contemplated thereby, stockholders of C-bridge and stockholders of
eXcelon should obtain current market quotations for the eXcelon common stock and
the C-bridge common stock.

SOME OF THE RESPECTIVE STOCKHOLDERS, DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF C-BRIDGE AND
eXCELON MAY HAVE INTERESTS IN THE MERGER THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF OTHER
STOCKHOLDERS.

    In considering the recommendation of C-bridge's board of directors to adopt
the merger agreement, C-bridge stockholders should be aware of potential
conflicts of interest, and of the benefits available to, some of C-bridge's
stockholders, directors and officers. These stockholders, directors and officers
may have interests in the merger that are in addition to, or differ from, those
of other C-bridge stockholders as a result of, among other things:

    - voting agreements entered into by eXcelon and some of C-bridge's
      directors, officers and stockholders;

    - arrangements regarding the election of directors and officers of the
      combined company;

    - the employment arrangement between Joseph M. Bellini, C-bridge's Chairman,
      Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and eXcelon that will
      be effective upon the consummation of the merger;

    - eXcelon's agreement to grant registration rights to some of C-bridge's
      stockholders;

    - eXcelon's assumption in the merger of outstanding C-bridge stock options
      owned by C-bridge's officers and directors; and

    - agreements by eXcelon to cause the combined company to indemnify, and
      purchase liability insurance for, C-bridge's directors and officers.

    You should read "The Merger--Interests of C-bridge's management and certain
stockholders in the merger" for a more complete description of the interests and
benefits listed above.

    In considering the recommendation of eXcelon's board of directors to approve
the issuance of eXcelon common stock in the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, eXcelon stockholders should be aware of
potential conflicts of interest, and of the benefits available to, some of
eXcelon's stockholders, directors and officers. These stockholders, directors
and officers may have interests in the merger that are in addition to, or differ
from, those of other eXcelon stockholders as a result of, among other things:

    - voting agreements entered into by C-bridge and some of eXcelon's directors
      and officers;

    - arrangements regarding the election of directors and officers of the
      combined company;

    - employment arrangements between some officers of eXcelon and eXcelon that
      will be effective upon the consummation of the merger;

    - additional compensation to be paid to Robert N. Goldman, eXcelon's current
      Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and

    - indemnification and liability insurance.

stockholders in the merger" for a more complete description of the interests and
benefits listed above.

THE TERMINATION FEE, EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS AND VOTING AGREEMENTS
MAY DISCOURAGE OTHER COMPANIES FROM TRYING TO ACQUIRE C-BRIDGE OR eXCELON.

    In the merger agreement, C-bridge agreed to pay eXcelon a termination fee,
and reimburse eXcelon for its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with
the merger, in specified circumstances, including where C-bridge agrees to be
acquired by a third party or approves or recommends to its stockholders a
proposal to be acquired by a third party. In addition, stockholders who held, as
of June 4, 2001, approximately 47.8% of the common stock of C-bridge outstanding
on that date have signed voting agreements agreeing to vote in favor of the
merger proposal and against any proposal relating to the acquisition of C-bridge
by a third party. These agreements could discourage other companies from trying
to acquire C-bridge even though another company might be willing to offer
greater value to C-bridge stockholders than eXcelon has offered in the merger.
In addition, payment by C-bridge of the termination fee and of eXcelon's
expenses could have an adverse effect on C-bridge's financial condition.

    In the merger agreement, eXcelon agreed to pay C-bridge a termination fee,
and reimburse C-bridge for its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection

of June 4, 2001, approximately 4.6% of the common stock of eXcelon outstanding
on that date have signed voting agreements agreeing to vote in favor of the
merger proposal and against any proposal relating to the acquisition of eXcelon
by a third party. These agreements could discourage other companies from trying
to acquire eXcelon even though another company might be willing to offer greater
value to eXcelon than eXcelon will receive by virtue of the merger. In addition,
payment by eXcelon of the termination fee and of C-bridge's expenses could have
an adverse effect on eXcelon's financial condition.

                     RISKS RELATED TO THE COMBINED COMPANY

OUR NEW BUSINESS MODEL MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.

    Historically, eXcelon has derived a majority of its revenue from the
licensing of its Object Design object data management and XML-based
business-to-business, or B2B, software products, while C-bridge has derived
substantially all its revenue from the provision of Internet professional
services. The combined company will adopt a new business model focused on
providing platform-based enterprise commerce management solutions. Under this
new business model, we will derive our revenues primarily from significant
engagements in which our professional consultants provide business consulting
and diagnostic services to identify the e-commerce management needs of large
enterprises, recommend technical solutions that incorporate appropriate elements
of the eXcelon suite of XML-based B2B products, supervise the customization and
implementation by third party systems integrators of the recommended software
applications, and assist the customer to deploy the applications. This new
business model will require significant changes in the way each of our companies
has historically conducted its business. It may be more difficult than we expect
to integrate our sales and marketing, professional services and product
development organizations to operate under this new business model. In addition,
it may be more difficult than we anticipate to integrate our respective
methodologics, tools, processes and offered consulting services. Our customers
may not want to continue to do business with the combined company under this new
business model; for example, customers who have used C-bridge's Internet
professional services may prefer to purchase services in the future from a
vendor that does not offer its own proprietary technology. We may also encounter
difficulties we cannot predict; for example, we may find it difficult to manage
the customization and implementation services that we anticipate will be
provided by third party systems integration firms over which we have little or
no control. If, for these or any other reasons, we cannot successfully implement
our new business model, or if our customers do not want to do business with the
combined

company under this new business model, the revenues, results of operation and
the financial condition of the combined company will be seriously harmed.

OUR RECENT LOSSES, C-BRIDGE'S LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY, AND THE RECENT
RESTRUCTURING OF eXCELON'S BUSINESS MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE THE PROSPECTS
FOR FUTURE SUCCESS OF THE COMBINED COMPANY.

    eXcelon incurred substantial losses in 1999 and 2000, and C-bridge has
incurred substantial losses since its inception. The combined company had an
accumulated deficit of approximately $54,973,000 on a pro forma basis at
March 31, 2001, assuming the merger had occurred on March 31, 2001, and we
expect the combined company will continue operating at a loss in the near term,
and will incur a loss for 2001. C-bridge was incorporated in 1996, and has only
a limited operating history upon which you can base an evaluation of C-bridge's
business and prospects. eXcelon restructured its business in January 2001,
dividing its business operations into separate divisions focusing on its new
XML-based B2B product line and its original Object Design object data management
product line, and reorganizing its sales and marketing, professional services
and research and development staffs. Because of the recent reorganization of
eXcelon's business, eXcelon's historical results of operations may not give you
an accurate indication of its future results of operations or prospects.

    As a result, neither of our companies has an established history of
profitable operations from which you can judge the prospects for future success
of our current business operations, or of the combined company.

THE EXPENSE REDUCTION PROGRAMS UNDERTAKEN BY OUR COMPANIES MAY DISRUPT OUR
BUSINESS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO
ACHIEVE OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES.

    Both of our companies have implemented expense reduction programs in
response to recent declines in market demand for Internet-related products and
services. Since December 31, 2000, C-bridge has reduced its workforce by
approximately 46%. In January 2001, in connection with the restructuring of its
business operations, eXcelon reduced its workforce by approximately 10%. We
anticipate that we will reduce our combined headcount further after the merger
as we consolidate our facilities and operations and integrate our two
businesses. Restructuring charges associated with these expense reduction
programs will negatively affect the results of operations of the combined
company in the near term. Also, the effect of these reductions in personnel, and
uncertainty created by the possibility of future reductions, could disrupt our
operations, make it more difficult for both of our companies to retain key
personnel and recruit new personnel, and adversely affect the ability of the
combined company to achieve its business objectives.

OUR REVENUES COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BY THE LOSS OF A MAJOR CLIENT OR
PROJECT.

    In recent years, eXcelon has not been dependent on a small number of
customers for a significant portion of its revenues. However, in 2000,
C-bridge's three largest clients, Chevron, Seagate and Firmenich, accounted for
approximately 41% of its total net revenues, and in 1999 its four largest
clients accounted for approximately 62% of its total net revenues. As we
implement a new business model based on significant engagements for large
enterprises, our dependence on major clients and projects for a significant
portion of our revenues will increase. As a result, if the combined company
loses any major client or any client cancels or significantly reduces the scope
of a large project, the combined company's revenues, results of operations and
financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.

    The combined company's revenues and earnings may fluctuate significantly
from quarter to quarter, based on the actions of a single significant client.
Although the companies that comprise our largest clients in any given quarter
may change from quarter to quarter, we expect that a significant

portion of our revenues will come from a relatively small number of clients for
the foreseeable future, resulting in our continued dependence on significant
clients.

THE COMBINED COMPANY'S REVENUES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY FLUCTUATE
SIGNIFICANTLY ON A QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL BASIS, WHICH COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR
BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND STOCK PRICE.

    The revenues and results of operations of eXcelon and C-bridge have each
fluctuated significantly in the past, and we expect that the revenues and
results of operations of the combined company will also fluctuate significantly
from quarter to quarter and from year to year. If our revenues or net income for
any period fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the
market price of the eXcelon common stock could fall significantly. Our future
results of operations in any period may fluctuate for many reasons, including:

    - changes in the level of demand for our solutions, products and services;

    - the number, timing, scope and contractual terms of our projects;

    - the accuracy of our estimates of our revenues;

    - the time required to complete, and delays in completing, our projects;

    - the unanticipated termination of any of our projects;

    - seasonal factors;

    - our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel;

    - our efficiency in utilizing our employees;

    - the number, timing and significance of new products, services or solutions
      introduced by our competitors;

    - the length of the sales cycles associated with our offerings of products
      and services;

    - our ability to develop, market and introduce new and enhanced products,
      services and solutions on a timely basis;

    - the level of service and price competition;

    - our ratios of fixed-priced contracts versus time-and-materials contracts;

    - the timing of collection of our accounts receivable;

    - changes in operating expenses;

    - changes in the percentages of our revenue that we receive from different
      products or services; and

    - general economic conditions.

    Many of these factors are outside of our control. Moreover, because a
substantial portion of the combined company's operating expenses, such as rent,
employee compensation, marketing programs and overhead, are fixed, any of these
factors could cause significant variations in the combined company's quarterly
or annual results of operations.

THE TIMING OF THE RECEIPT OF THE COMBINED COMPANY'S SOFTWARE REVENUES WILL CAUSE
THE COMBINED COMPANY'S TOTAL REVENUES TO BE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.

    Historically, eXcelon's revenues have been difficult to predict because it
has typically received the majority of its revenues derived from sales of its
software in the last month of each quarter, with a

concentration of revenues in the latter half of that month. We expect this
revenue trend to continue with respect to the combined company. This pattern,
common to many software companies, will make it difficult to forecast the
combined company's revenues accurately, increasing the possibility of the
combined company missing quarterly revenue and income targets. Our inability to
obtain orders in large volume or to make shipments in the period immediately
before the end of the quarter may cause our results for that quarter to fall
short of our revenue and income targets. For these reasons, we believe that you
should not rely on eXcelon's historical results of operations as an indication
of the combined company's future performance.

THE PROJECT-BY-PROJECT NATURE OF THE COMBINED COMPANY'S CONSULTING REVENUES WILL
CAUSE THE COMBINED COMPANY'S TOTAL REVENUES TO BE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.

    Historically, C-bridge's revenues have been difficult to predict because its
consulting clients have generally retained it on a project-by-project basis,
rather than under long-term contracts. These projects vary in size, scope and
duration. Most of these clients can reduce or cancel their contracts with little
or no notice and without penalty. Following the merger, our consulting revenues
derived from project-by-project arrangements, which may represent an increasing
percentage of the combined company's revenues, will continue to be difficult to
predict. A client that accounts for a significant portion of our revenues in a
particular period may not account for a similar portion of ours revenues in
future periods. A client may or may not engage us for further services once a
project is completed. As a result, our consulting services revenues will not be
recurring from period-to-period. If a significant consulting client, or a number
of clients, terminate, significantly reduce or modify their contracts with us,
our results of operations will be materially and adversely affected. If a client
postpones, modifies or cancels a consulting project, we will have to reassign
our consultants to other projects to minimize the adverse impact on our
operating results. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in
efficiently reassigning our consultants to new projects in the event of project
terminations. These factors will make the total revenues of the combined company
difficult to predict. For these reasons, we believe that you should not rely on
C-bridge's historical results of operations as an indication of the combined
company's future performance.

REVENUES DERIVED FROM eXCELON'S OBJECT DESIGN PRODUCT LINE MAY DECLINE, WHICH
COULD SIGNIFICANTLY HARM THE COMBINED COMPANY'S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL RESULTS AND
PROSPECTS.

    The majority of eXcelon's revenues to date has been derived from its Object
Design line of object data management products and related services. We expect
market demand for object data management products in general to remain stable or
decrease in the future. The combined company's future revenues from the Object
Design product line will depend to a substantial degree on our ability both to
keep our existing customers and to attract and retain new customers for these
products.

    A significant portion of eXcelon's revenues to date has been derived from
sales of its Object Design products to customers in a limited number of
industries, such as the telecommunications industry, some of which have been
decreasing their rate of capital expenditures, including expenditures for
products such as the Object Design products. We cannot assure you that we will
be able to maintain demand for our Object Design products in the
telecommunications industry or other vertical markets in which our Object Design
products have been widely implemented. If revenues from sales to customers in
our traditional markets decline and we are unable to create demand for our
Object Design products in new vertical markets, the combined company's revenues
could decline, our ability to support the levels of expenditure we believe are
necessary to support the growth of our enterprise commerce management solutions
business could be impaired, and the combined company's business and prospects
could be significantly harmed.

THE COMBINED COMPANY'S BUSINESS MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY HARMED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO
IMPROVE OUR SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS.

    In order to achieve broad market acceptance of our enterprise commerce
management solutions products and services, including the eXcelon B2B product
line, we must improve the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, by
enhancing our reputation and strengthening our brand, increasing the market
reach and effectiveness of our distribution channel partners, and increasing the
productivity of our sales force. While we believe that the merger will
significantly improve the sales and marketing capabilities of the combined
company, we cannot assure you that our efforts to improve our sales and
marketing performance will be successful. If we are unsuccessful in these
efforts, our sales revenues may decrease and the combined company's business and
operating results may be significantly harmed.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ADAPT TO CHANGES IN THE MARKET FOR B2B E-COMMERCE
SOLUTIONS AGAINST CURRENT OR FUTURE COMPETITORS.

    The market for enterprise commerce management solutions is rapidly changing
and intensely competitive. We expect the market for enterprise commerce
management solutions to continue to evolve at a rapid pace. As an example, the
difficulties experienced in the last year by many online retailers and other
web-based consumer businesses have resulted in reduced demand for eXcelon's B2B
products from these businesses. As a result, eXcelon was required to reorient
its B2B sales force and marketing efforts to focus on enterprise customers
rather than web-based consumer businesses. We may not be able to successfully
develop and target our enterprise commerce management solutions and our sales
and marketing efforts to changing market demands. Our potential inability to
successfully develop and target our products and services to the changing market
for enterprise commerce management solutions may harm the combined company's
business, operating results and financial condition.

WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION AND MAY LOSE BUSINESS TO OUR COMPETITORS, MANY OF
WHOM HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE AND RESOURCES THAN WE DO.

    Following the merger, our business model will focus on selling enterprise
commerce management solutions products and services, including B2B products and
services and Internet professional services, as well as Object Design object
data management products and services. The markets for these products and
services are highly competitive and subject to rapid change. We expect
competition to intensify as the number of new technologies and entrants into
these markets increases. Increased competition may result in reduced margins,
loss of sales or decreased market share, which could harm our business,
operating results and financial condition.

    We expect competitors for our enterprise commerce management solutions to
include both competitors for our B2B products and services and competitors for
our Internet professional services. Competitors for the combined company's B2B
products and services will include, among others:

    - large software vendors, such as IBM, Microsoft, SAP, PeopleSoft, Siebel
      Systems and Documentum;

    - vendors of proprietary enterprise application integration, or EAI,
      solutions, such as Mercator Software, NEON Systems, See Beyond, TIBCO
      Software, Vitria Technology and webMethods;

    - application server vendors who have added XML capabilities to their
      products, such as BEA Systems, Art Technology Group and SilverStream
      Software; and

    - companies and trading vendors who have added XML capabilities to their
      products, such as Ariba, CommerceOne and Covisint.

Competitors for the combined company's Internet professional services will
include, among others:

    - Internet service firms, such as Proxicom, Razorfish, Scient, and Viant;

    - Systems integrators, such as Accenture, Cambridge Technology Partners, Cap
      Gemini, EDS, and Sapient;

    - Management consulting firms, such as Bain, Booz-Allen & Hamilton, Boston
      Consulting Group and McKinsey;

    - Computer hardware and service vendors, such as Compaq, DEC,
      Hewlett-Packard and IBM; and

    - Advertising agencies, such as Bates, DDB Needham, Grey Advertising,
      McCann-Erickson and Ogilvy & Mather.

Competitors for the combined company's Object Design object data management
products and services will include, among others:

    - IBM;

    - Computer Associates;

    - Oracle;

    - Informix;

    - Novell;

    - Progress Software Corporation;

    - Sybase; and

    - Versant.

    In addition, our customers and companies with whom we have strategic
relationships may become our competitors in the future. Many of our competitors
and potential competitors have more experience in providing Internet-related
consulting services and developing Internet-based software, larger technical
staffs, larger customer bases, more established distribution channels, greater
brand recognition and greater financial, research and development, marketing and
other resources than the combined company will have. Our competitors may be able
to develop products and services that are superior to our software and services,
or that achieve greater customer acceptance. Our competitors may be able to
respond more quickly to technological developments and changes in customers'
needs. In many cases, we will compete with the in-house technical staff of our
prospective clients. In addition, negotiating and maintaining favorable customer
and strategic relationships is critical to our business. Our competitors may be
able to negotiate strategic relationships on more favorable terms than we are
able to negotiate. Many of our competitors may also have well-established
relationships with our existing and prospective customers.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS TO OUR SOFTWARE
IN A TIMELY AND EFFICIENT MANNER.

    Because our software is complex, internal quality assurance testing or
customer testing may reveal product performance issues or desirable feature
enhancements that could cause us to postpone releasing new versions of our
software. In addition, the reallocation of resources associated with any
postponement could delay the development and release of future enhancements to
our currently available software. If we do not complete future enhancements of
our software in a timely and efficient manner, it could harm our revenues and
results of operations.

WE MUST KEEP PACE WITH RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES, EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS
AND CHANGING CLIENT REQUIREMENTS.

    The combined company's success will depend, in part, on its ability to keep
pace with:

    - rapidly changing technology;

    - evolving industry standards and practices;

    - frequent new service and product introductions and enhancements; and

    - changing user and client requirements and preferences.

    To be successful, we must adapt to our rapidly changing market by
continually improving the performance, features and reliability of our services
and software products. We depend on our ability to produce innovative products
to remain competitive. We could incur substantial costs to modify our software
products, services or infrastructure in order to adapt to changes in our market.
Our business could be harmed if we incur significant costs to adapt to these
changes but do not generate increased revenues to cover these costs, or if we
are unable to adapt rapidly to these changes. Any delay in the release of our
products or failure of released products to meet market expectations regarding
functionality and features could undermine our competitive position.

WE MAY LOSE MONEY ON FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS.

    Generally, C-bridge's client contracts have provided for payment on a time
and materials basis. For the year ended December 31, 2000, C-bridge derived
approximately 6% of its professional services revenues from fixed-price
contracts, compared to 30% for the year ended December 31, 1999. After the
merger, we do not plan to increase the percentage of revenues received from
fixed-price contracts; however, competitive pressures may force us to increase
our reliance on revenues from fixed-price contracts. If we fail to estimate
accurately the resources and time required for an engagement, to manage client
expectations effectively or to complete fixed-price engagements within our
budget, we would be subject to cost overruns, potentially leading to losses on
these engagements.

THE COMBINED COMPANY MAY BE UNABLE TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS,
WHICH COULD SERIOUSLY HARM ITS BUSINESS.

    The business of the combined company will depend, in part, on its
intellectual property rights and its ability to protect those rights. If we are
unable to prevent our clients and others from obtaining and using our
technologies without our permission, our business could suffer serious harm.
Currently, eXcelon has few patents and patent applications, and C-bridge has no
patents or patent applications. Existing trade secret and copyright laws afford
only limited protection for our intellectual property rights. Third parties may
attempt to disclose, obtain or use our software, solutions or technologies,
particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may
not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. We may not
detect infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property, which
would result in lost revenues. If third parties develop technologies that are
similar or superior to ours, we may not have sufficient rights to prevent the
use of their technologies, which could seriously limit the market for our
software, solutions or technologies.

THE BUSINESS OF THE COMBINED COMPANY MAY INFRINGE THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES.

    Third parties may have or obtain patents, copyrights or other intellectual
property rights relating to technologies that the combined company will use in
its business. These third parties may assert

infringement claims against us. If we are unsuccessful in any intellectual
property litigation, we may be forced to do one or more of the following:

    - cease selling or using technology or services that incorporate the
      challenged intellectual property;

    - obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms, if at
      all, to use the relevant technology;

    - reconfigure our products or services to avoid using the technology;

    - refund license fees or other payments that we have previously received;
      and

    - pay substantial damages for previous infringement.

    Generally, C-bridge develops intellectual property, including software
applications, for specific client engagements. Disputes regarding the ownership
of and rights to use this intellectual property may arise, which could affect
the combined company's ability to resell or reuse this intellectual property. We
generally indemnify our clients against any third-party intellectual property
claims. The award of one or more large claims for damages against us or for
which we have indemnified our clients could adversely affect the combined
company's financial condition and results of operations.

THE COMBINED COMPANY MAY NEED ADDITIONAL FINANCING TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE.

    We may need to raise additional funds in the future if we:

    - decide to expand faster than planned;

    - develop new or enhanced services or products ahead of schedule;

    - need to respond to competitive pressures; or

    - decide to acquire complementary products, businesses or technologies.

If we cannot raise the funds we need, we may be unable to engage in these or
other necessary business activities, which could seriously harm our competitive
position. Factors such as market conditions or our operating performance could
impair our ability to obtain financing, and we may be unable to raise funds on
terms we find acceptable. If we raise funds by selling equity or convertible
debt securities, the sale may dilute your ownership interest in eXcelon.
Moreover, we may issue securities that have rights, preferences and privileges
senior to the eXcelon common stock. The terms of any financing may include
restrictive financial and operating covenants that could limit our ability to
compete and expand.

OUR INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION PLANS MAY NOT SUCCEED.

    A key element of our strategy is to expand our operations in international
markets. We expect to derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales by
our foreign subsidiaries and to distributors outside the United States.
Following the completion of the merger, we expect to have professionals
operating in London, England; Theale, England; Wiesbaden, Germany; Stockholm,
Sweden; Oslo, Norway; Hoofddorp, The Netherlands; Geneva, Switzerland; Toronto,
Canada; Melbourne, Australia; Hong Kong; and Tokyo, Japan. We may have
difficulty managing our international operations because of distance, as well as
language and cultural differences. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
successfully market and deliver, or maintain or increase demand for, our
products and services in foreign markets.

    Other risks related to our international operations include:

    - fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the conversion to the euro by
      all members of the European Union by year-end 2003;

    - difficulties arising from staffing and managing foreign operations;

    - longer payment cycles and problems in collecting accounts receivable;

    - reduced protection for intellectual property rights in certain countries;

    - restrictions on the import and export of sensitive U.S. technologies, such
      as data security and encryption technologies that we may wish to use in
      solutions we develops for foreign customers;

    - legal and regulatory requirements of different countries, such as
      differing tax or labor laws; and

    - potential political and economic instability.

FUTURE ACQUISITIONS OR INVESTMENTS COULD DISRUPT OUR ONGOING BUSINESS, DISTRACT
OUR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES, INCREASE OUR EXPENSES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR
BUSINESS.

    The combined company may expand its operations by acquiring existing
businesses, as well as through internal growth. The success of any acquisition
will depend on, among other things, our ability to integrate acquired personnel,
operations, products and technologies into our organization effectively, to
retain and motivate key personnel of acquired businesses and to retain customers
of acquired firms. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify
suitable acquisition opportunities, obtain any necessary financing on acceptable
terms or successfully integrate acquired personnel and operations with our
existing personnel and operations. We may compete with other companies for
acquisition targets, which could result in increased prices for acquisition
targets and reduce the pool of companies available for acquisition. Any
acquisition- or integration-related activities could disrupt our ongoing
business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and
materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Any future
acquisitions could involve other risks as well, including the assumption of
additional liabilities and potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities.

THE FAILURE OF OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES TO MEET CLIENT EXPECTATIONS COULD RESULT
IN LOSSES AND NEGATIVE PUBLICITY.

    Our professional services and software applications are often critical to
our clients' businesses. These services and software applications are complex
and may contain known or undetected errors or performance problems. Any defects
or errors in these applications or in the services we provide or our failure to
meet client expectations could result in:

    - delayed or lost revenues resulting from adverse client reactions;

    - our providing additional products or services to clients at no charge;

    - negative publicity regarding the combined company and its products and
      services, which could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain
      clients; and

    - claims for substantial damages against us, regardless of our
      responsibility for any damages.

Any of these outcomes could seriously harm our business, financial condition and
results of operations. Any provisions that we may have in our client agreements
to limit our liability for damages may not be sufficient to protect us from
claims by our clients. Any claims asserted against us may not be covered by our
insurance or could exceed the limits of our insurance. We may be unable to
continue or increase our insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all,
which could expose us to significant losses.

THE FUTURE SUCCESS OF THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL DEPEND ON THE CONTINUED SERVICES
OF KEY EXECUTIVES FROM EACH COMPANY.

    We may be unable to achieve our business objectives without the services of
key executives from both eXcelon and C-bridge, particularly the following
individuals:

    - Robert N. Goldman, who will serve as eXcelon's Chairman of the Board after
      the merger;

    - Joseph M. Bellini, who will serve as eXcelon's Chief Executive Officer
      after the merger;

    - Mark A. Cosway, who will serve as eXcelon's President after the merger;

    - Satish Maripuri, who will serve as eXcelon's Chief Operating Officer and
      chairman of eXcelon's Leadership Council after the merger;

    - Richard C. Putz, who will serve as eXcelon's Chief Marketing Officer after
      the merger;

    - Lacey P. Brandt, who will serve as eXcelon's Chief Financial Officer after
      the merger; and

    - Philip Lee, who will serve as eXcelon's President, Object Design Division
      after the merger.

Most of these individuals have signed employment agreements with eXcelon that
will become effective upon completion of the merger. However, these employment
agreements and the compensation we provide to these employees may be
insufficient to ensure that we retain their services. Moreover, we do not
maintain key-person life insurance on any of our executive officers.

THE FUTURE SUCCESS OF THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL ALSO DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY UPON
ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN OTHER HIGHLY SKILLED TECHNICAL, MANAGERIAL,
SALES AND MARKETING PERSONNEL.

    In order to achieve our business objectives, we must attract and retain
highly skilled technical, managerial, sales and marketing personnel,
particularly personnel with skills related to the Internet and its rapidly
changing technologies. The loss of a significant number of personnel could
impair our ability to complete existing projects, bid for new projects, complete
the development or enhancement of our existing products or develop new products.
Uncertainty about the completion of the merger, the business prospects of the
combined company or the workforce requirements of the combined company may make
it more difficult for us to retain our key personnel. Competition for personnel
in the high technology industry is intense, and we are unable to predict the
degree of attrition we may experience as a result of the merger or other
factors. Many competing employers are able to offer their employees
significantly greater compensation and benefits or more attractive lifestyle
choices, career paths, or geographic locations than the combined company will be
able to offer.

THE DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS OF THE COMBINED
COMPANY WILL EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER ITS AFFAIRS.

    Immediately after the merger, the directors, executive officers and
principal stockholders of the combined company will own approximately 14,248,691
shares, or approximately 25.2%, of the eXcelon common stock expected to be
outstanding at that time, based upon shares of C-bridge and eXcelon outstanding
as of June 4, 2001. These stockholders acting together will have the ability to
exert substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by eXcelon's
stockholders, including the election and removal of directors, any merger or
consolidation involving eXcelon, and the sale of substantially all of the assets
of eXcelon. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying,
deferring or preventing a change in control or impeding a merger, consolidation,
takeover or other business combination that you, as a stockholder, may otherwise
view favorably.

               RISKS RELATED TO THE COMBINED COMPANY'S INDUSTRIES

IF RECENT MARKET TRENDS AFFECTING INTERNET-RELATED BUSINESSES CONTINUE OR
WORSEN, OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS AND OUR REVENUES COULD BE SERIOUSLY HARMED.

    Recent market trends, including the recent downturn in spending on
information technology and services by Internet-related businesses, have
adversely affected demand for the products and services of companies like
eXcelon and C-bridge. As a result, both eXcelon's and C-bridge's revenues have
declined since 2000. If these negative trends continue or worsen, the business
prospects of the combined company could be seriously harmed, and we may be
unable to achieve the levels of revenue that will be required for the combined
company to operate profitably.

THE FAILURE OF OUR XML-BASED PRODUCTS TO ACHIEVE BROAD MARKET ACCEPTANCE, DELAY
IN SUCH ACCEPTANCE OR THE INTRODUCTION OF A COMPETING STANDARD PERCEIVED TO BE
SUPERIOR IN THE MARKET COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

    eXcelon's B2B product line is currently based in large part upon XML, or
eXtensible Markup Language, an emerging standard for sharing data over the
Internet. While we anticipate that XML will achieve broad market acceptance in
the near future, the acceptance of XML within the B2B industry has been slower
than expected. If a competing standard for sharing data over the Internet were
perceived to be superior to XML, the market may not accept an XML-based product.
If a new standard were perceived to be superior to XML, our software might not
be compatible with the new standard or we might not be able to develop products
using this standard in a timely manner, which could materially harm our
revenues, results of operation and financial condition.

THE BARRIERS TO ENTER THE INTERNET PROFESSIONAL SERVICES BUSINESS ARE LOW.

    We expect to derive a significant portion of our revenues following the
merger from the Internet professional services business. We have no patented or
other proprietary technology that would preclude or inhibit competitors from
entering the Internet professional services market. Our competitors may
independently develop and patent or copyright technologies that are superior or
substantially similar to our Internet professional services technologies. There
are relatively low barriers to entry into the Internet professional services
business as costs to develop and provide Internet professional services are low.
As a result, we expect to continue to face additional competition from new
entrants into this market, including companies formed by its former employees.
This competition could reduce our revenues and harm our business.

OUR BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT ON THE CONTINUED GROWTH IN USE OF THE INTERNET AND OF
THE MARKET FOR INTERNET PROFESSIONAL SERVICES.

    C-bridge has historically derived most of its revenue from projects
involving the Internet, and eXcelon has derived a significant portion of its
revenue from its XML-based B2B products. Following the merger, the combined
company's business will be adversely affected if use of the Internet and the
market for enterprise commerce management solutions do not continue to develop
or develop more slowly than expected. Internet usage may be inhibited for a
number of reasons, including:

    - inadequate Internet infrastructure;

    - security concerns;

    - inconsistent quality of service; or

    - unavailability of cost-effective, high-speed access services.

    The market for enterprise commerce management solutions is relatively new
and evolving rapidly. Demand and market acceptance for recently introduced
products and services are subject to a high

level of uncertainty. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability
to provide services that are accepted by existing and future clients as an
integral part of their business models.

    If use of the Internet grows, the Internet infrastructure may not be able to
support the demands placed on it and the performance and reliability of the
Internet may decline. Many web sites, including those of our clients, have
experienced a variety of interruptions in their service as a result of outages
and other delays occurring throughout the Internet network infrastructure. If
these outages or delays frequently occur in the future, use of the Internet
could grow more slowly than anticipated or decline.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF, AND LEGAL UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING, THE INTERNET
COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

    Any new law or regulation pertaining to the Internet, or the application or
interpretation of existing laws, could increase our cost of doing business or
otherwise materially and adversely effect our business, results of operations
and financial condition. Laws and regulations directly applicable to Internet
communications, commerce and advertising are becoming more prevalent. The laws
governing the Internet, however, remain largely unsettled, even in areas where
there has been some legislative action. It may take years to determine whether
and how existing laws governing intellectual property, copyright, privacy,
obscenity, libel and taxation apply to the Internet. Uncertainty in the
application of existing laws may reduce demand for our services. In addition,
the growth and development of e-commerce may prompt calls for more stringent
consumer protection laws, both in the United States and abroad.

                        RISKS RELATED TO YOUR INVESTMENT

THE eXCELON COMMON STOCK IS LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIAL PRICE AND VOLUME
FLUCTUATIONS, WHICH COULD PREVENT YOU FROM RESELLING YOUR SHARES AT A PROFIT.

    The market prices and trading volumes of the eXcelon common stock and the
C-bridge common stock have been highly volatile and subject to wide
fluctuations. We expect that, after the merger, the market price and trading
volume of the eXcelon common stock will continue to experience substantial
fluctuations in price and volume. As a result, you may be unable to sell your
shares of eXcelon common stock at or above the price at which you acquired your
shares. These fluctuations may arise from many factors, including the following:

    - actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;

    - additions or departures of key personnel;

    - our level of operating expenses;

    - changes in securities analysts' recommendations or predictions of our
      future financial performance;

    - announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations, new
      products, new services, contracts, acquisitions or strategic partnerships;

    - changes in business or regulatory conditions that affect us;

    - trading of our common stock;

    - developments with respect to intellectual property rights;

    - conditions and trends in the database, business-to-business software,
      Internet professional services and other industries;

    - changes in the market valuations of other companies in these industries;

    - adoption of new accounting standards affecting the industries in which we
      participate; and

    - general economic, political and market conditions unrelated to our
      operating performance, such as recessions or international currency
      fluctuations.

Many of these factors are beyond our control. In addition, the stock market has
recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have
particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many companies
in the database, business-to-business software and Internet professional
services and other technology industries. These fluctuations have often been
unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies.
These market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the eXcelon
common stock. Following periods of volatility in the market price of a security,
stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation against
the issuer of the security. If any of our stockholders were to institute a
lawsuit against us, we would likely incur substantial costs defending the
lawsuit. A stockholder lawsuit could also divert the time, attention and
resources of our management and result in substantial settlement or damages
payments by us.

THE SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE EXCELON COMMON STOCK
OUTSTANDING AFTER THE MERGER COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF
THE eXCELON COMMON STOCK.

    Based on the number of shares of the C-bridge common stock outstanding on
June 4, 2001, eXcelon expects to issue approximately 26,980,039 shares of its
common stock in connection with the merger. Except for the eXcelon common stock
that will be held by affiliates of C-bridge or eXcelon upon completion of the
merger, all of these shares will be immediately tradable in the public market.
Sales into the public market of a substantial number of shares of the eXcelon
common stock after the merger, or the issuance by eXcelon of a large number of
shares of its common stock in connection with future acquisitions or financings,
could have a negative effect on the market price of the eXcelon common stock.
The perception that stockholders may sell a large number of shares of the
eXcelon common stock could also have a negative effect on the market price of
the eXcelon common stock.

           CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

    We may make forward-looking statements in this proxy statement/prospectus
and in the documents we incorporate by reference, all of which are subject to
risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements contain information
concerning possible or assumed future business success or financial results, and
include, but are not limited to, statements as to expectations regarding:

    - future revenue opportunities;

    - eXcelon's integration of C-bridge's business, operations and services;

    - the combined company's new business model;

    - future expense levels, including selling, research and development,
      general and administrative expenses, and capital expenditures;

    - enhancements to existing products and the development of new products and
      services;

    - strategic relationships;

    - future capital needs;

    - the emergence of new technologies;

    - management changes or the loss of key employees;

    - industry trends; and

    - future financial results.

    When we use words like "believe," "expect," "anticipate" or similar words,
those statements are forward-looking statements. In particular, statements
regarding expected strategic benefits, advantages and other effects of the
merger described in "The Merger--eXcelon's reasons for the merger" beginning on
page 47 and "The Merger--C-bridge's reasons for the merger" beginning on page 59
and elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus are forward-looking statements.

    You should note that an investment in shares of eXcelon common stock
involves risks and uncertainties that affect the combined company's future
business success or financial results. Actual results could differ materially
from those anticipated expressly or implicitly in these forward-looking
statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth in "Risk
Factors" and elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus and in the other
documents incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus.

    We believe that it is important to communicate our expectations to you.
However, there may be events in the future that we are not able to predict
accurately or over which we have no control. We undertake no obligation to
update any forward-looking statements we may make. You should be aware that the
occurrence of the events described in the "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this
proxy statement/prospectus and the documents we incorporate by reference could
materially and adversely affect the combined company's business, financial
condition and operating results.

                            MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

    We are sending you this proxy statement/prospectus in order to provide you
with important information regarding the merger and in connection with the
solicitation of proxies by your company's board of directors for use at the
eXcelon annual meeting or the C-bridge special meeting and at any adjournment or
postponement of the meetings. The eXcelon annual meeting and the C-bridge
special meeting are scheduled to be held at the times and places described
below.

eXCELON ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

MATTERS FOR CONSIDERATION

    The eXcelon annual meeting of stockholders is scheduled to be held on July
  , 2001, at 10:00 a.m., local time, at the offices of Foley, Hoag & Eliot LLP,
One Post Office Square, Sixteenth Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02109, to
consider and vote upon:

    - a proposal to approve the issuance of eXcelon common stock in the merger
      and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

    - a proposal to grant eXcelon's management the discretionary authority to
      adjourn the annual meeting to a date or dates not later than       , 2001,
      to enable eXcelon's board of directors to solicit additional proxies in
      favor of the proposal to approve the issuance of eXcelon common stock to
      be delivered in connection with the merger;

    - a proposal to elect a new board of directors of the combined company
      consisting of Robert M. Agate, Gerald B. Bay, Kevin J. Burns and Robert N.
      Goldman, each of whom is currently a director of eXcelon, and Joseph L.
      Badaracco, Jr., Joseph M. Bellini and Raymond J. Lane, each of whom is
      currently a director of C-bridge, and Jeffrey Horing, who is a C-bridge
      designee but not currently a director of C-bridge, subject to the
      condition that the elections will become effective upon completion of the
      merger, but only if the merger becomes effective under Delaware law on or
      before October 31, 2001;

    - a proposal to approve an amendment to eXcelon's 1996 Employee Stock
      Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares of eXcelon common stock
      that may be issued under the purchase plan to 2,200,000 shares. See
      "Amendment to the eXcelon 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan" for a more
      complete description of this proposal and the stock purchase plan; and

    - a proposal to approve an amendment to eXcelon's 1996 Incentive and
      Nonqualified Stock Option Plan to increase the maximum number of shares of
      eXcelon common stock that may be issued under the option plan to 7,700,000
      shares. See "Amendment to the eXcelon 1996 Incentive and Nonqualified
      Stock Option Plan" for a more complete description of this proposal and
      the stock option plan.

    In the merger agreement, eXcelon and C-bridge agreed that, following the
merger, the board of directors of eXcelon would consist of eight members, four
of whom are currently directors of eXcelon and four of whom are designated by
C-bridge and include three current directors of C-bridge. eXcelon is asking its
stockholders to elect these eight directors, subject to the condition that the
elections will become effective at the time of the merger but only if the merger
becomes effective on or before October 31, 2001. Until completion of the merger,
eXcelon's four existing directors will remain in office. If the merger is
consummated on or before October 31, 2001, then the election of the new board of
directors of the combined company will become effective at that time. If the
merger is not consummated by that date, then the election of the new, combined
board will have no effect, and eXcelon will schedule another stockholder meeting
to elect directors.

    eXcelon stockholders will also consider any other matters that may properly
come before the annual meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the annual
meeting. At the time of mailing of this proxy statement/prospectus, the board of
directors of eXcelon was not aware of any such other matter.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS' RECOMMENDATION

    After careful consideration, eXcelon's board of directors has unanimously
approved the merger agreement and the merger and recommends a vote FOR the
approval of the issuance of eXcelon common stock in the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The eXcelon board also
recommends that eXcelon stockholders vote FOR the adjournment proposal, FOR the
proposal to elect eight directors as a new board of directors of the combined
company, FOR the approval of the amendment to eXcelon's 1996 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan and FOR the approval of the amendment to eXcelon's 1996 Incentive
and Nonqualified Stock Option Plan.

RECORD DATE

    The record date for determining the eXcelon stockholders entitled to vote at
the annual meeting is June   , 2001. Only holders of record of eXcelon common
stock as of the close of business on that date are entitled to receive notice of
the annual meeting and to vote at the annual meeting. As of the close of
business on the record date, there were             shares of eXcelon common
stock outstanding and eligible to vote at the annual meeting. Each share of
eXcelon common stock entitles the holder to one vote on each proposal and on all
other matters properly brought before the annual meeting.

QUORUM; VOTE REQUIRED; TABULATION OF VOTES

    In order to conduct business at eXcelon's annual meeting, a quorum must be
present. A majority of the shares of eXcelon common stock issued and outstanding
and entitled to vote on the record date for the meeting, whether present in
person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business at the annual meeting. eXcelon will treat shares of eXcelon common
stock represented by a properly signed and returned proxy as present at the
meeting for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum at the annual
meeting. In general, eXcelon will count votes withheld from any nominee for
election as a director, abstentions and broker "non-votes" as present or
represented for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum. A broker
"non-vote" occurs when a broker or nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner
does not vote on a proposal because the broker or nominee does not have
discretionary voting power and has not received instructions from the beneficial
owner with respect to that proposal.

    The approval of the issuance of eXcelon common stock in the merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the grant of
authority to adjourn the annual meeting will require the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares properly cast at the annual meeting. Abstentions and
broker non-votes will not count as votes cast on these proposals and,
accordingly, will not affect the outcome of the votes on these proposals.

    The election of each of the eight directors to eXcelon's new, combined board
of directors will require the affirmative vote of a plurality of the shares
properly cast at the annual meeting. Broker non-votes and votes withheld from
any director will not count as votes cast for or against the election of any
director and, accordingly, will not affect the outcome of the vote on any
election.

    The amendments to eXcelon's 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and 1996
Incentive and Nonqualified Stock Option Plan will require the affirmative vote
of a majority of the shares properly cast at the annual meeting. Abstentions and
broker non-votes will not count as votes cast on these proposals and,
accordingly, will not affect the outcome of the votes on these proposals.

    It may be necessary to adjourn or postpone the annual meeting. If a quorum
is not present at the annual meeting, the annual meeting will be adjourned or
postponed to enable the eXcelon board of directors to solicit additional
proxies. If a quorum is present but the number of shares voting in favor of the
issuance of eXcelon common stock in the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement is insufficient to approve the proposal,
then, if the adjournment proposal has received the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares of eXcelon common stock properly cast at the

annual meeting, eXcelon's management will have the discretion to adjourn the
annual meeting to a date or dates not later than             , 2001 to provide
the eXcelon board of directors additional time to solicit proxies in favor of
the merger.

    eXcelon's transfer agent, EquiServe, will tabulate the votes on each
proposal. EquiServe will tabulate the vote on each matter submitted to
stockholders separately.

VOTING OF PROXIES

    GENERAL.  Shares represented by a proxy will be voted at the annual meeting
as specified in the proxy. Materials accompanying this proxy
statement/prospectus provide instructions for voting by telephone or by using
the Internet.

    PROXIES WITHOUT VOTING INSTRUCTIONS.  Proxies that are properly signed and
dated but which do not contain voting instructions on each proposal will be
voted, except as specified in the proxy, FOR approval of the issuance of eXcelon
common stock in the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, FOR the grant to eXcelon's management of discretionary authority to
adjourn the annual meeting, FOR the proposal to elect eight directors as a new
board of directors of the combined company, FOR approval of the amendment to
eXcelon's 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and FOR approval of the amendment to
eXcelon's 1996 Incentive and Nonqualified Stock Option Plan.

    VOTING SHARES HELD THROUGH BROKERS BY PROXY.  If your shares are held by
your broker, your broker will vote your shares for you if you provide
instructions to your broker on how to vote your shares. You should follow the
directions provided by your broker regarding how to instruct your broker to vote
your shares. Your broker may be unable to vote your shares of eXcelon common
stock without specific instructions from you. If you do not instruct your broker
how to vote, your shares may not participate in the votes taken at the annual
meeting.

    VOTING SHARES HELD THROUGH BROKERS IN PERSON.  If your shares are held by
your broker and you wish to vote those shares in person at the annual meeting,
you must obtain from the nominee holding your eXcelon common stock in the
nominee's name a properly executed legal proxy, identifying you as an eXcelon
stockholder, authorizing you to act on behalf of the nominee at the annual
meeting and identifying the number of shares with respect to which the
authorization is granted.

    OTHER MATTERS.  If you sign and return the enclosed proxy card, you grant
authority to the persons named in the proxy to vote in their discretion on any
other matters that may properly come before the annual meeting or any
adjournment or postponement of the annual meeting. eXcelon's management does not
presently know of any other matters to be brought before the annual meeting.
Other matters that may be properly brought before the annual meeting, unless
otherwise provided in eXcelon's certificate of incorporation or by-laws or by
statute, will be approved if a majority of the votes cast are voted in favor of
the matter.

HOW TO REVOKE A PROXY

    Signing the enclosed proxy card will not prevent a record holder from voting
in person at the eXcelon annual meeting or otherwise revoking its proxy. A
record holder may revoke a proxy at any time before the annual meeting in the
following ways:

    - filing with eXcelon, before the vote at the annual meeting, a written
      notice of revocation bearing a later date than the proxy;

    - executing a later dated proxy relating to the same shares and delivering
      it to eXcelon before the vote at the annual meeting; or

    - attending the annual meeting.

    Record holders should send any written notice of revocation or subsequent
proxy to eXcelon Corporation, Attn: Secretary, 25 Mall Road, Burlington,
Massachusetts 01803, or hand deliver the notice of revocation or subsequent
proxy to eXcelon's Secretary before the vote at the eXcelon annual meeting.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES AND EXPENSES

    The solicitation of proxies from eXcelon stockholders is made on behalf of
the board of directors of eXcelon. eXcelon will pay the costs of the
solicitation, except that eXcelon and C-bridge will share the cost of printing
and mailing this proxy statement/prospectus and the form of proxy card. eXcelon
has retained Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc. to assist in the
solicitation of proxies by eXcelon. eXcelon will pay Georgeson a fee of
approximately $10,000, plus reimbursement of specified out-of-pocket expenses,
and will indemnify Georgeson against losses arising out of its proxy
solicitation services on behalf of eXcelon. In addition to solicitation by mail,
Georgeson and eXcelon may request that eXcelon's directors, officers or
employees solicit proxies from stockholders by telephone, in person or by other
means. These persons will not receive additional compensation, although they
will be reimbursed for the reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses they incur in
connection with this solicitation. Georgeson and eXcelon will also make
arrangements with brokerage firms, fiduciaries, and other nominees who are
record holders of eXcelon common stock to forward solicitation materials to the
beneficial owners of those shares. eXcelon will reimburse those brokerage firms,
fiduciaries, and other nominees for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in
connection with this solicitation.

STOCK HELD BY EXCELON DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

    As of June 4, 2001, the directors and executive officers of eXcelon owned
1,356,599 outstanding shares of eXcelon common stock. These shares represented
approximately 4.6% of the shares of eXcelon common stock outstanding on that
date. eXCELON'S DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS HAVE ENTERED INTO IRREVOCABLE
PROXY AND VOTING AGREEMENTS WITH C-BRIDGE, WHICH AUTHORIZE C-BRIDGE TO VOTE
THEIR SHARES IN FAVOR OF APPROVAL OF THE MERGER, THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL AND
ANY ACTIONS RECOMMENDED BY eXCELON'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO
ACCOMPLISH THE MERGER AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS.

APPRAISAL OR DISSENTERS' RIGHTS

    Holders of eXcelon common stock are not entitled to appraisal or dissenters'
rights in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
or any other proposal submitted to the eXcelon stockholders.

C-BRIDGE SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

MATTERS FOR CONSIDERATION

    The C-bridge special meeting of stockholders is scheduled to be held on July
  , 2001, at 10:00 a.m., local time, at C-bridge's executive offices at 125
Summer Street, 19th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02110, to consider and vote
upon:

    - a proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement; and

    - a proposal to grant C-bridge's management the discretionary authority to
      adjourn the special meeting to a date or dates not later than       ,
      2001, if necessary to enable C-bridge's board of directors to solicit
      additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

    C-bridge stockholders will also consider any other matters that may properly
come before the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the
special meeting.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS' RECOMMENDATION

    After careful consideration, C-bridge's board of directors has unanimously
approved the merger and the merger agreement and recommends a vote FOR the
proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. The C-bridge board also
recommends that C-bridge stockholders vote FOR the adjournment proposal.

RECORD DATE

    The record date for determining the C-bridge stockholders entitled to vote
at the special meeting is June   , 2001. Only holders of record of C-bridge
common stock as of the close of business on that date are entitled to receive
notice of the special meeting and to vote at the special meeting. As of the
close of business on the record date, there were             shares of C-bridge
common stock outstanding and eligible to vote at the special meeting. Each share
of C-bridge common stock entitles the holder to one vote on each proposal and on
all other matters properly brought before the special meeting.

QUORUM; VOTE REQUIRED; TABULATION OF VOTES

    In order to conduct business at C-bridge's stockholders' meeting, a quorum
must be present. A majority of the shares of C-bridge common stock issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote, whether present in person or represented by
proxy, will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the special
meeting. C-bridge will treat shares of C-bridge common stock represented by a
properly signed and returned proxy as present at the special meeting for
purposes of determining the existence of a quorum at the meeting. In general,
C-bridge will count abstentions and broker non-votes as present or represented
for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum.

    A majority of the outstanding shares of C-bridge's common stock must be
voted for the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement in order for
the proposal to pass. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect
as votes against this proposal.

    The proposal to grant C-bridge's management the discretionary authority to
adjourn the special meeting will require the affirmative vote of the holders of
a majority of the shares of C-bridge common stock present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote. Abstentions and broker
non-votes will have the same effect as votes against this proposal.

    It may be necessary to adjourn or postpone the special meeting. If a quorum
is not present at the special meeting, the special meeting will be adjourned or
postponed to enable the board of directors to solicit additional proxies. If a
quorum is present but the number of shares voting in favor of the approval and
adoption of the merger agreement is insufficient to approve the proposal under
Delaware law, then, if the adjournment proposal has received the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented
by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote, C-bridge's management will have
the discretion to adjourn the special meeting to a date or dates not later than
            , 2001 to provide the C-bridge board of directors additional time to
solicit proxies in favor of the merger.

    C-bridge's transfer agent, EquiServe, will tabulate the votes on each
proposal.

VOTING OF PROXIES

    GENERAL.  Shares represented by a proxy will be voted at the special meeting
as specified in the proxy. Materials accompanying this proxy
statement/prospectus provide instructions on voting by telephone or Internet.

    PROXIES WITHOUT VOTING INSTRUCTIONS.  Proxies that are properly signed and
dated but which do not contain voting instructions will be voted FOR approval
and adoption of the merger agreement and FOR the grant to C-bridge's management
of discretionary authority to adjourn the special meeting.

    VOTING SHARES HELD THROUGH BROKER BY PROXY.  If your shares are held by your
broker, your broker will vote your shares for you if you provide instructions to
your broker on how to vote your shares. You should follow the directions
provided by your broker regarding how to instruct your broker to vote your
shares. Your broker cannot vote your shares of C-bridge common stock without
specific instructions from you. Because the affirmative vote of a majority of
the outstanding shares of C-bridge common stock is required to approve and adopt
the merger agreement, if you do not instruct your broker how to vote, it will
have the effect of a vote against approval and adoption of the merger agreement.

    VOTING SHARES HELD THROUGH BROKERS IN PERSON.  If your shares are held by
your broker and you wish to vote those shares in person at the special meeting,
you must obtain from the nominee holding your C-bridge common stock a properly
executed legal proxy, identifying you as a C-bridge stockholder, authorizing you
to act on behalf of the nominee at the special meeting and identifying the
number of shares with respect to which the authorization is granted.

    OTHER MATTERS.  If you sign and return the enclosed proxy card, you grant
authority to the persons named in the proxy to vote in their discretion on any
other matters that may properly come before the special meeting or any
adjournment or postponement of the special meeting. C-bridge's management does
not presently know of any other matters to be brought before the special
meeting. Other matters that may be properly brought before the special meeting,
unless otherwise provided in C-bridge's certificate of incorporation or by-laws
or by statute, will be approved if it receives the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares of C-bridge common stock present in person
or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote.

HOW TO REVOKE A PROXY

    Signing the enclosed proxy card will not prevent a record holder from voting
in person at the C-bridge special meeting or otherwise revoking its proxy. A
record holder may revoke a proxy at any time before the special meeting in the
following ways:

    - filing with C-bridge, before the vote at the special meeting, a written
      notice of revocation bearing a later date than the proxy;

    - executing a later dated proxy relating to the same shares and delivering
      it to C-bridge before the vote at the meeting; or

    - attending the meeting and voting in person, although attendance at the
      meeting will not by itself constitute a revocation of the proxy.

    Record holders should send any written notice of revocation or subsequent
proxy to C-bridge's Secretary at 125 Summer Street, 19th Floor, Boston,
Massachusetts 02110, or hand deliver the notice of revocation or subsequent
proxy to C-bridge's Secretary before the vote at the C-bridge special meeting.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES AND EXPENSES

    The solicitation of proxies from C-bridge stockholders is made on behalf of
the board of directors of C-bridge. C-bridge will pay all costs of the
solicitation of its stockholders, except that C-bridge and eXcelon will share
the cost of printing and mailing this proxy statement/prospectus and the form of
proxy card. C-bridge has retained Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc. to
assist in the solicitation of proxies by C-bridge. C-bridge will pay Georgeson a
fee of approximately $10,000, plus reimbursement of specified out-of-pocket
expenses, and will indemnify Georgeson against losses arising out of its proxy
solicitation services on behalf of C-bridge. In addition to solicitation by
mail, Georgeson and C-bridge may request that C-bridge's directors, officers or
employees solicit proxies from stockholders by telephone, in person or by other
means. These persons will not receive additional compensation, although they
will be reimbursed for the reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses they incur in
connection with this solicitation. Georgeson and C-bridge will also make
arrangements with brokerage firms, fiduciaries, and other nominees who are
record holders of C-bridge common stock to

forward solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of those shares.
C-bridge will reimburse those brokerage firms, fiduciaries, and other nominees
for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with this
solicitation.

STOCK HELD BY C-BRIDGE DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

    As of June 4, 2001, the directors and executive officers of C-bridge owned
2,967,886 outstanding shares of C-bridge common stock. These shares represented
approximately 13.8% of the shares of C-bridge common stock outstanding on that
date. THE DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND SEVERAL STOCKHOLDERS OF C-BRIDGE,
WHO HELD, AS OF THAT DATE, SHARES THAT, IN THE AGGREGATE, REPRESENTED
APPROXIMATELY 47.8% OF THE SHARES OF C-BRIDGE COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING ON THAT
DATE, HAVE ENTERED INTO IRREVOCABLE PROXY AND VOTING AGREEMENTS WITH EXCELON,
WHICH AUTHORIZE eXCELON TO VOTE THEIR SHARES IN FAVOR OF APPROVAL OF THE MERGER,
THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL AND ANY ACTIONS RECOMMENDED BY C-BRIDGE'S BOARD OF
DIRECTORS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO ACCOMPLISH THE MERGER AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS.

APPRAISAL OR DISSENTERS' RIGHTS

    Holders of C-bridge common stock are not entitled to appraisal or
dissenters' rights in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement or any other proposal submitted to the C-bridge stockholders.

                            PROPOSAL ONE--THE MERGER

    In this proposal, eXcelon and C-bridge are asking their stockholders to
approve the merger, the merger agreement and the other transactions contemplated
in that agreement.

    Because C-bridge is a Delaware corporation, Delaware law requires that
C-bridge obtain the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of C-bridge common stock in order to complete the merger.

    Because a subsidiary of eXcelon, rather than eXcelon itself, is merging with
C-bridge, Delaware law does not require that eXcelon stockholders approve and
adopt the merger agreement. However, under the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market,
eXcelon must obtain stockholder approval of the issuance of eXcelon common stock
in connection with the merger. Specifically, eXcelon is asking its stockholders
to approve the issuance of shares of eXcelon common stock in exchange for
outstanding shares of C-bridge common stock, upon the exercise of the options to
purchase C-bridge common stock that eXcelon will assume in connection with the
merger, and upon the exercise of rights to purchase C-bridge common stock under
the C-bridge employee stock purchase plan that will be converted into rights to
purchase eXcelon common stock as a result the merger.

    Assuming that no options to purchase C-bridge common stock are exercised
before the closing of the merger, eXcelon expects to issue approximately
26,937,837 shares of its common stock to C-bridge stockholders in the merger and
to reserve approximately 13,285,939 shares of its common stock for issuance upon
exercise of the C-bridge stock options that it will assume in connection with
the merger. These numbers are based on the numbers of shares of C-bridge common
stock and options to purchase C-bridge common stock outstanding on June 4, 2001.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

    Both eXcelon and C-bridge regularly evaluate different strategies to improve
their competitive positions and enhance their respective stockholder values,
including opportunities for acquisitions of other companies or their assets,
possible partnerships or alliances and other significant transactions.

    On July 11, 2000, eXcelon engaged SG Cowen to provide general strategic
advice and to assist eXcelon to pursue strategic alternatives. From July 2000 to
December 2000, SG Cowen explored with eXcelon's management a number of possible
strategic alternatives, including a possible sale of eXcelon's database business
or eXcelon's XML-based business, and eXcelon held preliminary

negotiations with several interested parties with regard to possible
transactions. In December 2000, the eXcelon board concluded that it was in
eXcelon's best interest to continue its current operations rather than pursue
any of the strategic alternatives then available to eXcelon.

    eXcelon and C-bridge have been familiar with each other's businesses for
several years. In February 2001, C-bridge hired Larry Alston, the former Chief
Technology Officer of eXcelon, to serve as C-bridge's Executive Vice President
of Product Management. As a result of this familiarity, and in light of the
decrease in market demand for Internet consulting services beginning in early
2001, C-bridge began internal discussions about the operational, financial and
other benefits that could result from a business combination of eXcelon and
C-bridge. At a regularly scheduled meeting of the C-bridge board of directors on
February 27, 2001, Joseph M. Bellini, C-bridge's Chairman, Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Operating Officer, advised the C-bridge board that he had
identified eXcelon as a potential partner for a business combination. The
C-bridge board authorized Mr. Bellini to initiate discussions with eXcelon with
regards to a possible strategic combination of the two companies.

    As a result of these internal discussions, on or about March 12, 2001,
Mr. Bellini met with representatives of SG Cowen, whom he knew had previously
represented eXcelon, to explore the possibility of a business combination
between eXcelon and C-bridge. After this meeting, C-Bridge decided to retain
Robertson Stephens as its financial advisor in connection with the possible
strategic combination of the two companies.

    On March 15, 2001, as a result of their meeting with Mr. Bellini,
representatives of SG Cowen contacted Robert N. Goldman, eXcelon's Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer, to discuss arranging a meeting between Messrs. Goldman
and Bellini. As a result of C-bridge's expression of interest in pursuing a
business combination with eXcelon, eXcelon and SG Cowen reinitiated their prior
discussions regarding strategic alternatives.

    During the week of March 19, 2001, SG Cowen and Robertson Stephens worked
independently to develop financial models for the combined operations of eXcelon
and C-bridge.

    On March 22, 2001, Mr. Bellini, Mr. Goldman and representatives of SG Cowen
and Robertson Stephens held a dinner meeting at the request of Mr. Bellini.
During this meeting the parties discussed eXcelon's and C-bridge's respective
technologies, business operations and financial condition, as well as the
possible strategic combination of eXcelon and C-bridge.

    On March 23, 2001, Mr. Goldman discussed the possible merger of eXcelon and
C-bridge with representatives of Foley, Hoag & Eliot LLP, eXcelon's legal
counsel.

    On March 26, 2001, Clifford B. Thompson, C-bridge's Vice President and
General Counsel, met with Lacey P. Brandt, eXcelon's Chief Financial Officer,
and representatives of SG Cowen and Robertson Stephens to discuss initial
diligence planning and human resources issues related to the potential merger.
Later that day, Mr. Thompson discussed the possible merger of eXcelon and
C-bridge with representatives of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, C-bridge's legal
counsel.

    On March 27, 2001, Mr. Bellini sent an e-mail to the C-bridge board of
directors outlining the rationale for, and certain possible terms of, a merger
of C-bridge and eXcelon. In addition, Mr. Bellini and Mr. Goldman met to discuss
procedural issues and the initial exchange of information about their respective
companies.

    On March 28, 2001, C-bridge held a telephonic meeting of its board of
directors at which the potential benefits of a combination with eXcelon were
discussed and the board weighed the relative merits of remaining independent
versus pursuing a business combination with eXcelon. The C-bridge board
authorized management to further investigate the merits of a possible
transaction with eXcelon.

    On April 2, 2001, Mr. Goldman discussed the possible merger with
representatives of Foley, Hoag & Eliot LLP, and advised them that Mr. Bellini
had advised the C-bridge board of directors that discussions among eXcelon,
C-bridge and their respective financial advisors were continuing.

agreement relating to the proposed merger, and Robertson Stephens met with

signing of the definitive agreement on May 22, 2001, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP
reviewed legal due diligence materials provided by eXcelon and its financial and
legal advisors. During the same period, Arthur Andersen LLP, C-bridge's
independent public accountants, reviewed financial and tax diligence materials
provided by eXcelon and its financial and legal advisors. Throughout this
period, members of C-bridge's board and management had frequent and extensive
discussions with C-bridge's financial and legal advisors to evaluate the
proposed transaction and to review the status of the negotiations with eXcelon
and the results of the C-bridge business, legal, accounting and financial due
diligence.

    During the week of April 9, 2001, Mr. Goldman had a number of conversations
with representatives of SG Cowen and Foley, Hoag & Eliot LLP concerning the
possible structure and timing of a transaction with C-bridge. During that week,
and continuing through the period leading up to the signing of the definitive
agreement on May 22, 2001, Foley, Hoag & Eliot LLP reviewed legal due diligence
materials provided by C-bridge and its financial and legal advisors. During the
same period, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, eXcelon's independent public
accountants, reviewed financial and tax diligence materials provided by C-bridge

directors, a representative of SG Cowen presented a report on strategic
alternatives available to eXcelon. SG Cowen reported the results of its
exploration of a possible transaction with C-bridge. Mr. Goldman described the

agreement and related agreements. On the morning of May 23, 2001, the parties
issued a joint press release announcing the merger and held a joint conference
call to discuss the merger.

eXCELON'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER; eXCELON'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS' RECOMMENDATION

    In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, eXcelon's board
consulted with eXcelon's management, as well as with eXcelon's financial
advisors, independent accountants and legal advisors, and considered information
from a variety of sources, including:

    - Its knowledge, and that of eXcelon's management, of the business,
      properties and prospects of eXcelon, including the opportunities available
      to eXcelon if the proposed merger did not occur.

    - Its exploration, with the assistance of SG Cowen, of the strategic
      alternatives available to eXcelon and its assessment of the risks and
      potential rewards associated with continuing to operate as an independent
      company as an alternative to the merger.

    - Current financial market conditions and historical market prices,
      volatility and trading information about the eXcelon common stock and
      C-bridge common stock.

    - The exchange ratio negotiated with C-bridge, the implied premium, based on
      recent and historical market prices of eXcelon's common stock, over the
      recent and historical prices of C-bridge's common stock, and how this
      premium compared to price premiums in recent comparable transactions
      involving Internet professional services companies.

    - The opinion of SG Cowen that, based on and subject to the assumptions,
      qualifications and limitations set forth in the opinion, the exchange
      ratio of 1.2517 was fair, from a financial point of view, to eXcelon, and
      the analysis underlying the SG Cowen opinion.

    - Information and presentations by eXcelon's management and legal and
      financial advisors concerning the business, technology, products and
      services, operations, financial condition, organizational structure and
      competitive positions of eXcelon and C-bridge on both a historical and
      prospective basis.

    - The terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including the
      termination fee payable to eXcelon or to C-bridge under specified
      circumstances and the ability of eXcelon to negotiate other unsolicited
      strategic transaction proposals if the eXcelon board of directors believes
      in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that to
      do so would be consistent with the board's fiduciary duties under
      applicable law and would be reasonably likely to lead to a proposal that
      is more favorable financially to the eXcelon stockholders than the merger.

    - The terms and conditions of the irrevocable proxies and voting agreements
      to be entered into by the directors and executive officer of eXcelon.

    - The proposed corporate governance arrangements for the combined company,
      which will have a board of directors composed of four current members of
      eXcelon's board and four C-bridge designees, including three current
      members of C-bridge's board.

    - Its assessment of the likely impact of the merger on eXcelon's customers
      and employees.

    In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, eXcelon's board
identified the following potential benefits of the merger for eXcelon and its
stockholders that, taken as a whole, supported its decision:

    - The opportunity to transform eXcelon's business model from one based
      primarily on the sale of software products to one based on offering
      enterprise customers a complete solution consisting of consulting and
      implementation services utilizing the eXcelon XML product platform, which
      the eXcelon board expects to result in increased revenue, higher average
      sales and more profitable operations for the combined company.

    - The opportunity to improve the sales and distribution capabilities of the
      companies, by combining the C-bridge sales force's experience in selling
      large-scale consulting engagements to senior executives of large
      enterprises with the eXcelon product set and the XML product expertise of
      the eXcelon sales force.

    - The broader geographic coverage of the combined company's operations,
      where eXcelon's relatively greater strength in Europe and Asia-Pacific and
      C-bridge's relatively broader coverage in the United States are expected
      to complement each other.

    - The opportunity for operational synergies and economies of scale and the
      anticipated savings from those synergies and economies of scale.

    - The anticipated impact of the merger on the combined company's financial
      resources, particularly the extent to which C-bridge's substantial cash
      position will enhance the combined company's ability to fund additional
      sales, marketing and product development activities relating to its
      enterprise commerce management products and services.

    - The opportunity to capitalize on each company's strong client and partner
      relationships and established reputation to provide additional solutions
      to each company's existing clients.

    - The fact that the combined company will have a significantly larger market
      capitalization and public float than eXcelon alone, and the possibility
      that the merger will result in greater

      investment research coverage of eXcelon by industry analysts and enhanced
      trading liquidity for eXcelon stockholders.

    - The opportunity for eXcelon to obtain the services of key members of
      C-bridge's management team, including the services of Joseph M. Bellini as
      Chief Executive Officer.

    - Its judgment that the premium to be paid to the stockholders of C-bridge
      was reasonable in light of current industry and financial market
      conditions, the relative contributions expected to be made by the two
      companies to the results of operations of the combined company, recent
      comparable transactions and the historical trading prices and volatility
      of common stock of the two companies.

    - The risks associated with remaining independent in light of increasing
      consolidation and competition in the business-to-business commerce
      software market.

    - The structure of the merger and the terms of the merger agreement,
      including the fact that the fixed exchange ratio provides certainty
      regarding the number of shares of eXcelon common stock that will be issued
      in the merger, and the fact that the merger agreement permits the board of
      either company to terminate the merger agreement upon receipt of a
      superior proposal, or to amend or withdraw its recommendation under
      specified circumstances, and upon payment to the other company of a
      specified termination fee and its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
      connection with the termination.

    - The qualification of the merger as a tax-free reorganization.

    - The fact that all four of eXcelon's current directors will serve on the
      combined company's board of eight directors.

    In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and recommend
approval of the merger to eXcelon's stockholders, eXcelon's board also
considered a number of risks and potentially negative factors, including the
following:

    - The recent reduction in demand for Internet consulting services generally,
      and the sharp declines in the stock prices of companies in that sector.

    - The fact that C-bridge's revenues have declined substantially in 2001
      compared with their levels in 2000, and the risk that the restructuring
      and expense reduction programs that have been undertaken by C-bridge will
      be inadequate to compensate for its reduced levels of revenue, or may
      disrupt the ability of the combined company to carry out its business
      plan.

    - The risk that the combined company will have difficulty integrating
      eXcelon's product platform with C-bridge's service-based solution.

    - The risk that the combined company will not be able to successfully
      integrate the employees and operations of eXcelon and C-bridge.

    - The loss of independence that would result from the expansion of eXcelon's
      board to include an equal number of C-bridge directors.

    - The possible adverse effects of the public announcement of the merger on
      the sales of the two companies and their respective relationships with
      their employees, suppliers and strategic partners.

    - The possibility that eXcelon may not succeed in retaining its own key
      employees or the key employees of C-bridge.

    - The volatility of the price of the combining companies' common stock,
      particularly in light of the fact that the exchange ratio will not be
      adjusted for declines in the price of C-bridge common stock or increases
      in the price of eXcelon common stock.

    - The possibility that, if the merger is not completed, public perceptions
      of eXcelon's competitive position could cause the price of eXcelon common
      stock to decline.

    - The risk that eXcelon will have to pay substantial fees and expenses if
      the merger agreement is terminated under some circumstances.

    - The significant costs that have been and will be incurred in seeking to
      consummate the merger.

    - Other applicable risks described in this proxy statement/prospectus under
      the heading "Risk Factors."

    In addition, eXcelon's board of directors considered the interests that
certain of its officers and directors may have with respect to the merger in
addition to their interests as stockholders of eXcelon. See "The
Merger--Interests of eXcelon's management and certain stockholders in the
merger" on page 58.

    Members of eXcelon's board of directors evaluated these factors in light of
their knowledge of eXcelon's business, the markets for business-to-business
commerce management systems and object data management services and related
industries and their business judgment. In view of the variety of factors and
the amount of information considered, eXcelon's board of directors did not find
it practicable to, and did not, quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative
weights to the specific factors it considered in reaching its decision. The
determination was made after consideration of all of the factors taken as a
whole. In addition, individual members of eXcelon's board may have given
different weights to different factors.

    eXCELON'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE MERGER AGREEMENT,
THE ISSUANCE OF eXCELON COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER AND THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT. eXCELON'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS BELIEVES THAT
THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER ARE ADVISABLE, FAIR TO AND IN THE BEST
INTERESTS OF eXCELON AND ITS STOCKHOLDERS AND RECOMMENDS THAT ITS STOCKHOLDERS
VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE ISSUANCE OF eXCELON COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER AND
THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

    If the merger is not completed, eXcelon intends to continue as an
independent public company and will continue to pursue other strategic
transactions or alternatives to realize value for its stockholders.

OPINION OF eXCELON'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

    Under the terms of an engagement letter dated July 11, 2000, as amended by a
letter agreement dated as of May 7, 2001, eXcelon retained SG Cowen Securities
Corporation as its exclusive financial advisor to provide financial advisory
services and render an opinion in connection with a transaction involving all
of, or a material interest in, eXcelon. In connection with SG Cowen's
engagement, eXcelon requested that SG Cowen evaluate the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the consideration to be paid by eXcelon in the
proposed merger of eXcelon and C-bridge.

    At the meeting of eXcelon's board of directors on May 22, 2001, SG Cowen
delivered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that as of
May 22, 2001, based upon and subject to the various assumptions set forth in the
opinion, the consideration to be paid by eXcelon in the proposed merger of
eXcelon and C-bridge was fair, from a financial point of view, to eXcelon. The
consideration to be paid by eXcelon in the proposed merger was determined
through arm's-length negotiations between eXcelon and C-bridge and was approved
by eXcelon's board of directors. SG Cowen did not

recommend the specific consideration to be paid in the proposed merger or
recommend that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate
consideration to be paid.

    THE FULL TEXT OF THE WRITTEN OPINION OF SG COWEN, DATED MAY 22, 2001, IS
ATTACHED AS ANNEX C AND IS INCORPORATED INTO THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS BY
REFERENCE. HOLDERS OF eXCELON COMMON STOCK ARE URGED TO READ THE OPINION IN ITS
ENTIRETY. THE SUMMARY OF THE WRITTEN OPINION OF SG COWEN SET FORTH BELOW IS
QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL TEXT OF SG COWEN'S OPINION.
SG COWEN'S OPINION WAS PREPARED FOR AND ADDRESSED TO eXCELON'S BOARD OF
DIRECTORS AND IS DIRECTED ONLY TO THE FAIRNESS, FROM A FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW,
TO eXCELON OF THE CONSIDERATION TO BE PAID BY eXCELON IN THE PROPOSED MERGER OF
eXCELON AND C-BRIDGE. SG COWEN'S OPINION DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN OPINION AS TO
THE MERITS OR ANY OTHER ASPECT OF THE PROPOSED MERGER OF eXCELON AND C-BRIDGE OR
A RECOMMENDATION TO ANY STOCKHOLDER AS TO HOW TO VOTE WITH RESPECT TO THE
PROPOSED MERGER.

    In arriving at its opinion, SG Cowen reviewed and considered the financial
and other matters it deemed relevant, including, among other things:

    - a draft of the merger agreement dated May 13, 2001;

    - some publicly available information for eXcelon, including its annual
      reports filed on Form 10-K for each of the years ended December 31, 1999
      and 2000, and its quarterly reports filed on Form 10-Q for each of the
      quarters ended March 31, 2000, June 30, 2000, September 30, 2000 and
      March 31, 2001, and other relevant financial and operating data furnished
      to SG Cowen by eXcelon management;

    - some publicly available information for C-bridge, including its annual
      reports filed on Form 10-K for each of the years ended December 31, 1999
      and 2000, and its quarterly reports filed on Form 10-Q for each of the
      quarters ended March 31, 2000, June 30, 2000, September 30, 2000 and
      March 31, 2001, and other relevant financial and operating data furnished
      to SG Cowen by C-bridge management;

    - some internal financial analyses, financial forecasts, reports and other
      information concerning eXcelon and C-bridge, prepared by the management of
      eXcelon and C-bridge, respectively;

    - First Call earnings estimates and financial projections in Wall Street
      analyst reports for each of eXcelon and C-bridge;

    - discussions SG Cowen had with members of the managements of each of
      eXcelon and C-bridge concerning the historical and current business
      operations, financial conditions and prospects of eXcelon and C-bridge and
      other matters SG Cowen deemed relevant;

    - some operating results, the reported price and trading histories of the
      common stock of eXcelon and C-bridge as compared to operating results, and
      the reported price and trading histories of some other publicly traded
      companies SG Cowen deemed relevant;

    - some financial terms of the merger agreement as compared to the financial
      terms of some other selected business combinations SG Cowen deemed
      relevant; and

    - other information, financial studies, analyses and investigations and
      other factors that SG Cowen deemed relevant for the purposes of its
      opinion.

    In conducting its review and rendering its opinion, SG Cowen, with eXcelon's
consent, assumed and relied upon, without independent investigation, the
accuracy and completeness of all financial and other information provided to it
by eXcelon and C-bridge, respectively, or which is publicly available. SG Cowen
did not undertake any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or
reasonableness of, or independently verify, this information. In addition, SG
Cowen did not conduct any physical inspection of the properties or facilities of
eXcelon or C-bridge. SG Cowen further relied upon the assurance of management of
eXcelon that they were unaware of any facts that would make the information
provided

to SG Cowen incomplete or misleading in any respect. SG Cowen, with eXcelon's
consent, assumed that the financial forecasts were reasonably prepared by the
respective managements of eXcelon and C-bridge on bases reflecting the best
currently available estimates and good faith judgments of each company's
management as to the future performance of eXcelon and C-bridge, and that these
projections, and the First Call estimates and Wall Street projections utilized
in SG Cowen's analysis, provide a reasonable basis for its opinion.

    SG Cowen did not make or obtain any independent evaluations, valuations or
appraisals of the assets or liabilities of eXcelon or C-bridge, nor was SG Cowen
furnished with these materials. In addition, SG Cowen did not consider the
effects of any legal matters relating to eXcelon or C-bridge. SG Cowen's opinion
was necessarily based upon economic and market conditions and other
circumstances as they existed and could be evaluated by SG Cowen on the date of
its opinion. It should be understood that although subsequent developments may
affect its opinion, SG Cowen does not have any obligation to update, revise or
reaffirm its opinion, and SG Cowen expressly disclaims any responsibility to do
so.

    In rendering its opinion, SG Cowen assumed, in all respects material to its
analysis, that the representations and warranties of each party contained in the
merger agreement are true and correct, that each party will perform all of the
covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the merger
agreement and that all conditions to the consummation of the proposed merger of
eXcelon and C-bridge will be satisfied and none will be waived. SG Cowen assumed
that the final form of the merger agreement would be substantially similar to
the last draft received by SG Cowen before rendering its opinion. SG Cowen also
assumed that all governmental, regulatory and other consents and approvals
contemplated by the merger agreement would be obtained and that, in the course
of obtaining any of those consents, no restrictions will be imposed or waivers
made that would have an adverse effect on the contemplated benefits of the
proposed merger between eXcelon and C-bridge. SG Cowen also assumed that the
proposed merger between eXcelon and C-bridge would be treated as a tax-free
reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

    SG Cowen's opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder
as to how the stockholder should vote with respect to the proposed merger of
eXcelon and C-bridge or to take any other action in connection with the proposed
merger of eXcelon and C-bridge or otherwise. SG Cowen has not been requested to
opine as to, and SG Cowen's opinion does not in any manner address, eXcelon's
underlying business decision to effect the proposed merger between eXcelon and
C-bridge. Furthermore, SG Cowen expresses no view as to what the value of the
eXcelon common stock actually would be when issued in the proposed merger or the
price or trading range for shares of eXcelon common stock following the
consummation of the proposed merger.

    SG Cowen performed various procedures, including each of the financial
analyses described below, and reviewed with the management of eXcelon the
assumptions on which these analyses were based, including the historical and
projected financial results of eXcelon and C-bridge, and other factors. No
limitations were imposed by eXcelon's board of directors with respect to the
investigations made or procedures followed by SG Cowen in rendering its opinion.
The following is a summary of the principal financial analyses performed by SG
Cowen in connection with the preparation of its opinion. SOME OF THE SUMMARIES
OF FINANCIAL ANALYSES INCLUDE INFORMATION PRESENTED IN TABULAR FORMAT. IN ORDER
TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES, THE TABLES MUST BE READ TOGETHER
WITH THE TEXT OF EACH SUMMARY. THE TABLES ALONE DO NOT CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE
DESCRIPTION OF THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES. CONSIDERING THE DATA SET FORTH IN THE
TABLES WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE FULL NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE FINANCIAL
ANALYSES, INCLUDING THE METHODOLOGIES AND ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE ANALYSES,
COULD CREATE A MISLEADING OR INCOMPLETE VIEW OF THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES.

    RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION ANALYSIS.  SG Cowen analyzed the respective
contributions for the last twelve months and last quarter of reported revenue
and gross profit, and cash and equivalents as of March 31,

2001 and December 31, 2000, of eXcelon and C-bridge to the combined company
based upon historical financial results of eXcelon and C-bridge.

                                                                 PERCENTAGE OF COMBINED COMPANY

    ANALYSIS OF CERTAIN PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES--C-BRIDGE.  To provide
contextual data and comparative market information, SG Cowen compared selected
historical operating and financial data and ratios for C-bridge to the
corresponding financial data and ratios of some other companies, referred to in
this summary as the C-bridge selected companies, whose securities are publicly
traded and which SG Cowen believes are comparable to C-bridge from an operating
standpoint. The companies were:

    - Braun Consulting, Inc.

    - Cysive, Inc.

    - Lante Corporation

    - Scient Corp.

    - Tanning Technology Corporation

    - Viant Corporation

    The data and ratios included the market capitalization of common stock plus
total debt, preferred stock and minority interest less cash and equivalents, or
the enterprise value, of the C-bridge selected companies as multiples of the
last twelve months of reported revenue, annualized revenue for the last reported
quarter and estimated calendar year 2001 revenues.

    The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the multiples
implied by the ratio of enterprise value to revenues for the C-bridge selected
companies and the same ratios for C-bridge implied by the consideration to be
paid in the proposed merger of eXcelon and C-bridge. The

information in the table is based on the closing stock prices of the C-bridge
selected companies on May 18, 2001.

    Although information about the C-bridge selected companies was used for
comparison purposes, none of those companies is directly comparable to C-bridge.
Accordingly, an analysis of the results of this comparison is not purely
mathematical, but instead involves complex considerations and judgments
concerning differences in historical and projected financial and operating
characteristics of the C-bridge selected companies and other factors that could
affect the public trading value of the C-bridge selected companies or C-bridge.

    ANALYSIS OF CERTAIN PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES--EXCELON.  To provide
contextual data and comparative market information, SG Cowen compared selected
historical operating and financial data and ratios for eXcelon to the
corresponding financial data and ratios of some other companies, referred to in
this summary as the eXcelon selected companies, whose securities are publicly
traded and which SG Cowen believes are comparable to eXcelon from an operating
standpoint. The companies were:

     - Informix Corporation

     - Novell, Inc.

     - Progress Software Corporation

     - Sybase, Inc.

     - Versant Corporation

    BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS SOFTWARE COMPANIES

     - Mercator Software, Inc.

     - NEON Systems, Inc.

    ANALYSIS OF CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS--C-BRIDGE.  SG Cowen reviewed the financial
terms, to the extent publicly available, of the following ten transactions,
referred to in this summary as the C-bridge selected transactions, involving the
acquisition of companies in the Internet consulting services industry, which
were announced or completed since January 28, 2000 (listed as acquiror/target):

    - Dimension Data Holdings/Proxicom, Inc.

    - International Business Machines Corporation/Mainspring, Inc.

    - Novell, Inc./Cambridge Technology Partners, Inc.

    - CGI Group, Inc./IMRGlobal Corp.

    - Schlumberger Ltd./Convergent Group Corp.

    - Commerce One, Inc./AppNet

    - PSINet/Metamor Worldwide

    SG Cowen reviewed the enterprise value paid in the C-bridge selected
transactions as a multiple of the last twelve months of reported revenues,
annualized revenue for the last reported quarter and estimated revenue for the
next twelve months.

    The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the multiples
implied by the ratio of enterprise value to revenues for the C-bridge selected
transactions and the same ratios for C-bridge implied by the consideration to be
paid in the proposed merger of eXcelon and C-bridge.

    Although information about the C-bridge selected transactions was used for
comparison purposes, none of those transactions is directly comparable to the
proposed merger of eXcelon and C-bridge, and none of the companies in those
transactions is directly comparable to C-bridge. Accordingly, an analysis of the
results of this comparison is not purely mathematical, but instead involves
complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in historical and
projected financial and operating characteristics of the companies involved and
other factors that could affect the acquisition value of these companies or
C-bridge.

    ANALYSIS OF CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS--EXCELON.  SG Cowen reviewed the financial
terms, to the extent publicly available, of the following three transactions,
referred to in this summary as the eXcelon selected transactions, involving the
acquisition of companies in the database and business-to-business software
industry, which were announced or completed since May 31, 2000 (listed as
acquiror/target):

    - International Business Machines Corporation/Informix's database business

    - Sybase Inc./New Era of Networks, Inc.

    - Invensys plc/Baan

    SG Cowen reviewed the enterprise value paid in the eXcelon selected
transactions as a multiple of the last twelve months of reported revenues,
annualized revenue for the last reported quarter and estimated revenue for the

of this comparison is not purely mathematical, but instead involves complex

    HISTORICAL EXCHANGE RATIOS.  SG Cowen analyzed the ratios of the closing
prices of C-bridge common stock divided by the closing price of eXcelon common
stock over various periods ended May 18, 2001. The following table presents the
average exchange ratios for those periods.

                                                                HISTORICAL

    DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS.  SG Cowen did not analyze the value of the
proposed merger based on the discounted cash flow of eXcelon and C-bridge
because of the limited number of years for which projected financial information
for eXcelon and C-bridge was provided to SG Cowen by eXcelon and C-bridge,
respectively.

    The summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete description of
all the analyses performed by SG Cowen in connection with the proposed merger
and the preparation of its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion
involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods
of financial analyses and the application of these methods to the particular
circumstances and, as a result, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to
partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, SG Cowen
made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis
and factor that it considered. Accordingly, despite the separate factors
summarized above, SG Cowen believes, and has advised eXcelon's board of
directors, that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting
portions of its analyses and the factors considered by it, without considering
all analyses and factors, could create an incomplete view of the process
underlying its opinion. In performing its analyses, SG Cowen made numerous
assumptions with respect to industry performance, business and economic
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of eXcelon.
The analyses performed by SG Cowen are not necessarily indicative of actual
values or future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
the values or results suggested by these analyses. In addition, analyses
relating to the value of businesses do not purport to be appraisals or to
reflect the prices at which businesses or securities may actually be sold.
Accordingly, these analyses and estimates are subject to uncertainty, because
they are based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties
or their respective advisors. None of eXcelon, SG Cowen or any other person
assumes responsibility for any losses incurred if future results are materially
different from those projected. The analyses supplied by SG Cowen and its
opinion were among several factors taken into consideration by eXcelon's board
of directors in making its decision to enter into the merger agreement and
should not be considered as determinative of that decision.

    SG Cowen was retained by eXcelon's board of directors because SG Cowen is a
nationally recognized investment banking firm and because, as part of its
investment banking business, SG Cowen is continually engaged in the valuation of
businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions,
negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted
securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes.
SG Cowen is providing financial services to eXcelon for which it will receive
customary fees. In addition, in the ordinary course of its business, SG Cowen
and its affiliates trade the equity securities of eXcelon and C-bridge for their
own account and for the accounts of their customers, and, accordingly, may at
any time hold a long or short position

in those securities. SG Cowen and its affiliates in the ordinary course of
business have from time to time provided, and in the future may continue to
provide, commercial and investment banking services to eXcelon and C-bridge,
including serving as a financial advisor on potential acquisitions and as an
underwriter on equity offerings, and have received and may in the future receive
fees for the rendering of those services.

    Under the terms of the SG Cowen engagement letter, eXcelon paid SG Cowen a
retainer fee of $100,000 and has agreed to pay a fee of $500,000 to SG Cowen for
rendering its opinion. In addition, if the proposed merger of eXcelon and
C-bridge is completed, SG Cowen will be entitled to receive a transaction fee of
$1.75 million for its financial advisory services. The retainer fee and the fee
payable for SG Cowen's opinion will be credited against any transaction fee that
may be paid. Additionally, eXcelon has agreed to reimburse SG Cowen for its
pre-approved travel and all other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including
attorneys' fees, and has agreed to indemnify SG Cowen against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws arising out
of or in connection with SG Cowen's engagement. If the merger is not consummated
and C-bridge pays eXcelon the termination fee and reimburses eXcelon's expenses
incurred in connection with the merger, the SG Cowen engagement letter requires
eXcelon to pay SG Cowen 25% of the aggregate amount of the termination fee and
expenses reimbursement received by eXcelon. The terms of the fee arrangement
with SG Cowen, which are customary in transactions of this nature, were
negotiated at arm's length between eXcelon and SG Cowen. At the time SG Cowen
rendered its opinion, eXcelon's board of directors was aware of the fee
arrangement, including the fact that a significant portion of the fee payable to
SG Cowen is contingent upon the completion of the proposed merger of eXcelon and
C-bridge.

OTHER RELATIONSHIPS

    SG Cowen served as a co-managing underwriter of C-bridge's initial public
offering in December 1999, for which it received customary underwriting fees. SG
Cowen has not been compensated for any other investment banking or other
services for eXcelon or C-bridge in the past two years.

INTERESTS OF eXCELON'S MANAGEMENT AND CERTAIN STOCKHOLDERS IN THE MERGER

    In considering the recommendation of eXcelon's board of directors with
respect to the proposed merger, eXcelon stockholders should note that some of
eXcelon's stockholders, directors and officers have interests in the merger that
are different from, or in addition to, their interests solely as eXcelon
stockholders. These interests may create potential conflicts of interest. The
boards of directors of eXcelon and C-bridge were aware of these interests and
took these interests into account in approving the proposed merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

    VOTING AGREEMENTS.  eXcelon's directors and executive officers have entered
into irrevocable proxy and voting agreements with C-bridge, in which they
authorized C-bridge to vote their shares in favor of the issuance of eXcelon
common stock in connection with the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, the adjournment proposal and any actions
recommended by eXcelon's board of directors that are required to accomplish the
merger and related transactions.

    CONTINUING DIRECTORS.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, Robert M.
Agate, Gerald B. Bay, Kevin J. Burns and Robert N. Goldman will remain directors
of eXcelon. However, the merger agreement also provides for two changes in the
current classification of the eXcelon board. Mr. Agate, currently a Class II
director whose term will expire at the annual meeting, will become a Class I
director with a term expiring at the annual meeting of eXcelon stockholders in
2003. Mr. Goldman, currently a Class III director whose term will expire at the
annual meeting of eXcelon stockholders in

2002, will become a Class II director with a term expiring at the annual meeting
of eXcelon stockholders in 2004. Messrs. Bay and Burns will retain their current
director classifications.

    CONTINUING OFFICERS.  Following the merger, the following officers of
eXcelon will be elected to serve in the offices opposite their names:

NAME                                     OFFICE
- ----                                     ------

Robert N. Goldman......................  Chairman of the Board
Satish Maripuri........................  Chief Operating Officer
Lacey P. Brandt........................  Chief Financial Officer

    EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS.  eXcelon has entered into employment agreements with
Robert N. Goldman, Satish Maripuri and Lacey P. Brandt. These employment
agreements will become effective upon the consummation of the merger and will
replace the existing employment or severance agreements with these officers. For
more information about these agreements, see "Related Agreements--Employment
agreements."

    ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION TO ROBERT N. GOLDMAN.  eXcelon has agreed that, upon
consummation of the merger, it will pay Robert N. Goldman a bonus of $500,000.
eXcelon has also agreed that, upon consummation of the merger, it will forgive
the principal and interest owed by Mr. Goldman to eXcelon under a promissory
note originally executed by Mr. Goldman in favor of eXcelon in 1996 in
connection with the exercise of stock options by Mr. Goldman. The note has a
principal amount of $572,700 and bears simple interest at 7.0% per annum. As of
June 4, 2001, Mr. Goldman has not repaid any principal or interest on the note,
and the total amount of debt forgiven will be approximately $780,000. In
connection with the forgiveness of this indebtedness, eXcelon has also agreed to
release its security interest in shares of eXcelon common stock pledged by
Mr. Goldman to secure the note. For more information about this loan, see
"Management of eXcelon--Loan to executive officer." eXcelon has also agreed to
pay Mr. Goldman's tax liability incurred under Section 280G of the Internal
Revenue Code as a result of the bonus payment and forgiveness of indebtedness
described above, and to pay any additional federal and state income tax
liabilities incurred by Mr. Goldman as a result of that payment. eXcelon
estimates that the aggregate amount it will pay with respect to these tax
liabilities will be approximately $600,000. Under section 162(m) of the Internal
Revenue Code, eXcelon expects that, for purposes of calculating its federal
income tax obligations for 2001, it will not be able to deduct more than
$1.0 million of the compensation paid or deemed paid to Mr. Goldman in 2001.

    INDEMNIFICATION; INSURANCE.  After the merger, eXcelon will continue to
indemnify and advance expenses to its directors, officers, employees and other
indemnitees to the same extent as before the merger. eXcelon also intends to
continue in place its existing officers' and directors' liability insurance
policy.

C-BRIDGE'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER; C-BRIDGE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS' RECOMMENDATION

    In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, C-bridge's board
of directors consulted with C-bridge's management, as well as C-bridge's
financial advisors, independent accountants and legal counsel. Among the factors
C-bridge's board considered in its deliberations were the following:

    - The familiarity of C-bridge's board and management with the business,
      properties and prospects of C-bridge, including the opportunities
      available to C-bridge if the proposed merger did not occur.

    - The exchange ratio negotiated with eXcelon and the implied premium over
      recent and historical market prices of C-bridge common stock, as well as
      how this premium compared to price

      premiums in several recent comparable transactions involving Internet
      professional services companies.

    - The opinion of Robertson Stephens, Inc. that, based on and subject to
      matters stated in the opinion, as of May 22, 2001, the exchange ratio was
      fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of C-bridge common
      stock, other than eXcelon or any of its affiliates. A copy of Robertson
      Stephens' written opinion is attached as an appendix to this proxy
      statement/ prospectus.

    - Information and presentations by C-bridge management and legal and
      financial advisors concerning the business, technology, products,
      operations, financial condition, organizational structure and competitive
      position of C-bridge and eXcelon, on both a historical and prospective
      basis.

    - Current financial market conditions and historical market prices,
      volatility and trading information about C-bridge common stock and eXcelon
      common stock.

    - Corporate governance arrangements for the combined company, which will
      have a board of directors composed of four C-bridge designees, including
      three current members of C-bridge's board, and four current members of
      eXcelon's board.

    - The impact of the merger on C-bridge's customers and employees.

    - The terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including the
      termination fee payable to C-bridge or to eXcelon under specified
      circumstances and the ability of C-bridge to negotiate other unsolicited
      strategic transaction proposals if the C-bridge board of directors
      believes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
      that to do so would be consistent with the board's fiduciary duties under
      applicable law and would be reasonably likely to lead to a proposal that
      is more favorable financially to the C-bridge stockholders than the
      merger.

    - The terms and conditions of voting agreements of C-bridge stockholders
      which require them to vote their shares of C-bridge common stock in favor
      of the merger agreement.

    In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, and to recommend
that the C-bridge stockholders vote to adopt the merger proposal, C-bridge's
board of directors identified the following potential benefits of the merger for
C-bridge and its stockholders, that, taken as a whole, supported its decisions:

    - C-bridge stockholders will have the opportunity to participate in the
      potential for growth of the combined company after the merger.

    - The combined company will have a significantly larger market
      capitalization and public float than C-bridge alone; as a result, C-bridge
      stockholders who exchange their C-bridge common stock for eXcelon common
      stock in the merger may obtain a more liquid investment.

    - The merger will be tax-free to C-bridge U.S. stockholders (except to the
      extent they receive cash for any fractional shares).

    - Generally, companies that sell products rather than services have higher
      price/earnings ratios. Because it will offer its customers products in the
      form of standardized, pre-packaged solutions and solution components, the
      combined company is expected to have a higher price/earnings ratio than
      C-bridge would have on a stand-alone basis as a provider of consulting
      services.

    - As a result of the strategic fit between the C-bridge and eXcelon
      operations, the merger will create a company that can combine eXcelon's
      XML technology and C-bridge's strategic business consulting, diagnostic
      services and vertical industry expertise in order to produce the next
      generation of Internet business solutions, called "enterprise commerce
      management solutions."

    - The combined company will have the opportunity to become a leading
      provider of enterprise commerce management solutions because eXcelon's
      XML-based technology accelerates the labor-intensive process of
      integrating legacy systems with an Internet solution, which will increase
      the speed and efficiency with which the combined company can release new
      products and deliver solutions to clients.

    - By enabling C-bridge to develop standardized solutions and solution
      components based on eXcelon's XML technology, the merger will give the
      combined company the ability to respond to the shift in market demand away
      from pure consulting services billed on an hourly basis to standardized,
      pre-packaged solutions.

    - The integrated products and services offerings of the combined company
      will create and enhance cross-selling opportunities to the existing
      customer bases of each of C-bridge and eXcelon, resulting in new
      opportunities to generate revenue.

    - The market for C-bridge's products and professional services in the United
      States and internationally is highly competitive. The integration of the
      two companies' sales forces and marketing resources will strengthen the
      combined company's market presence and its ability to effectively sell its
      products.

    - The combined company will be able to benefit from potential economies of
      scale and cost savings.

    C-bridge's board of directors also considered opportunities that might exist
to pursue other potential business combinations, but did not solicit or receive
any written offers other than from eXcelon.

    In its deliberations concerning the merger, C-bridge's board of directors
also identified and considered a number of risks and potentially negative
factors, including the following:

    - The risk that the per share value of the consideration to be received in
      the merger could decline significantly from the value prior to the
      announcement of the merger because the exchange ratio will not be adjusted
      for changes in the market price of C-bridge common stock or eXcelon common
      stock.

    - The possibility that the merger might not be consummated and the potential
      adverse effects of the failure to consummate the merger on:

       - C-bridge's operating results.

       - The trading price of C-bridge common stock.

       - C-bridge's ability to attract and retain key management and other
         personnel.

    - The decreased likelihood of a third party acquisition proposal because of
      the termination fee and, to a lesser extent, the voting agreements
      described above.

    - The possibility that the integration of C-bridge and eXcelon will be an
      expensive, complex and time consuming process that may disrupt the
      business of either or both companies if not completed in a timely and
      efficient manner.

    - The risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized.

    - Other applicable risks described in this proxy statement/prospectus under
      the heading "Risk Factors."

    After due consideration, C-bridge's board of directors concluded that the
potential benefits to C-bridge and its stockholders of the merger outweighed the
risks associated with the merger.

    This discussion is not exhaustive of all the factors considered by
C-bridge's board of directors. In view of the wide variety of factors considered
in connection with the board's evaluation of the merger and the complexity of
these matters, C-bridge's board of directors did not quantify or otherwise
assign relative weights to the factors described above. Rather, C-bridge's board
made its determination based on the totality of the information it considered.
The members of the board were aware that, as described below under "The
Merger--Interests of C-bridge's management and certain stockholders in the
merger," certain directors and officers of C-bridge have interests in the merger
in addition to, or different from, their interests as stockholders in C-bridge,
and the board considered this in deciding to recommend the transaction.

    C-bridge and eXcelon cannot assure you that any of the expected results,
synergies, opportunities or other benefits described in this section will be
achieved as a result of the merger.

    C-BRIDGE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE MERGER AGREEMENT,
THE MERGER AND THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT.
C-BRIDGE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS BELIEVES THAT THE TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT
ARE FAIR TO AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF C-BRIDGE AND ITS STOCKHOLDERS AND
RECOMMENDS THAT C-BRIDGE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE MERGER PROPOSAL.

    If the merger is not completed, C-bridge intends to continue as an
independent public company and may pursue other strategic transactions or
alternatives to enhance stockholder value.

OPINION OF C-BRIDGE'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

    C-bridge retained Robertson Stephens to act as its exclusive financial
advisor in connection with the merger. In connection with Robertson Stephens'
engagement, C-bridge requested that Robertson Stephens evaluate the fairness,
from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio provided for in the merger
to holders of C-bridge common stock, other than eXcelon or any of its affiliates
or any dissenting stockholders.

    On May 22, 2001, the C-bridge board of directors met to review the proposed
merger. During this meeting, Robertson Stephens reviewed with C-bridge's board
certain financial analyses, as described below. Also at the meeting on May 22,
2001, Robertson Stephens rendered to C-bridge's board its oral opinion,
subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of May 22, 2001, based upon and
subject to the various considerations set forth in the Robertson Stephens
opinion, the exchange ratio in the merger was fair, from a financial point of
view, to holders of C-bridge common stock, other than eXcelon or any of its
affiliates or any dissenting stockholders. The exchange ratio was determined
through negotiations between the managements of C-bridge and eXcelon. Although
Robertson Stephens assisted C-bridge in the negotiations leading to an agreement
on the principal structural terms of the merger, it was not asked to and it did
not recommend to C-bridge that any specific exchange ratio constituted the
appropriate exchange ratio for the merger.

    The full text of the Robertson Stephens opinion, which sets forth, among
other things, assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Robertson Stephens in
rendering its opinion is attached as Annex B and is incorporated in this proxy
statement/prospectus by reference. We urge C-bridge stockholders to read the
Robertson Stephens opinion in its entirety. The Robertson Stephens opinion was
prepared for the benefit and use of C-bridge's board in connection with its
evaluation of the merger and does not constitute a recommendation to
stockholders of C-bridge as to how they should vote, or take any other action,
with respect to the merger.

    The Robertson Stephens opinion does not address:

    - the relative merits of the merger and the other business strategies that
      C-bridge's board has considered or may be considering; or

    - the underlying business decision of C-bridge's board to proceed with the
      merger.

    The summary of the Robertson Stephens opinion set forth in this proxy
statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text
of the Robertson Stephens opinion.

    In connection with the preparation of the Robertson Stephens opinion,
Robertson Stephens, among other things:

    - reviewed selected publicly available financial statements and other
      business and financial information of C-bridge and eXcelon, respectively;

    - reviewed selected internal financial statements and other financial and
      operating data, including financial forecasts and other forward-looking
      information, concerning C-bridge prepared by the management of C-bridge;

    - reviewed selected internal financial statements and other financial and
      operating data, including financial forecasts and other forward-looking
      information, concerning eXcelon prepared by the management of eXcelon;

    - reviewed with C-bridge and eXcelon selected publicly available estimates
      of research analysts relating to C-bridge;

    - reviewed with C-bridge and eXcelon selected publicly available estimates
      of research analysts relating to eXcelon;

    - held discussions with the respective managements of C-bridge and eXcelon
      concerning the businesses, past and current operations, financial
      condition and future prospects of both C-bridge and eXcelon, independently
      and combined, including discussions with the managements of C-bridge and
      eXcelon concerning their views regarding the strategic rationale for the
      merger;

    - reviewed the financial terms and conditions set forth in the draft of the
      merger agreement dated May 22, 2001;

    - reviewed the stock price and trading history of C-bridge common stock and
      eXcelon common stock;

    - compared the financial performance of C-bridge and the prices and trading
      activity of C-bridge common stock with that of other publicly traded
      companies it deemed comparable with C-bridge;

    - compared the financial performance of eXcelon and the prices and trading
      activity of eXcelon common stock with that of other publicly traded
      companies it deemed comparable with eXcelon;

    - compared the financial terms of the merger with the financial terms, to
      the extent publicly available, of other transactions that it deemed
      relevant;

    - prepared an analysis of the relative contributions of C-bridge and eXcelon
      to the combined company;

    - participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of
      C-bridge and eXcelon and their financial and legal advisors; and

    - made other studies and inquiries, and reviewed other data, as it deemed
      relevant.

    In its review and analysis, and in arriving at its opinion, Robertson
Stephens assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial and other information provided to it (including information furnished
to it orally or otherwise discussed with it by the managements of C-bridge and
eXcelon) or publicly available and neither attempted to verify, nor assumed
responsibility for verifying, any of this information. Robertson Stephens relied
upon the assurances of C-bridge's and

eXcelon's management that they were not aware of any facts that would make this
information inaccurate or misleading. Robertson Stephens did not obtain or make,
or assume any responsibility for obtaining or making, any independent evaluation
or appraisal of the properties, assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise)
of C-bridge or eXcelon, nor was Robertson Stephens furnished with any such
evaluation or appraisal.

    With respect to the financial forecasts and projections (and the assumptions
and bases therefor) for each of C-bridge and eXcelon that Robertson Stephens
reviewed, Robertson Stephens assumed that the forecasts and projections:

    - had been reasonably prepared in good faith on the basis of reasonable
      assumptions;

    - reflected the best available estimates and judgments as to the future
      financial condition and performance of C-bridge and eXcelon, respectively;
      and

    - will be realized in the amounts and in the time periods estimated.

    In addition, Robertson Stephens assumed that:

    - the merger will be consummated upon the terms set forth in the merger
      agreement without material alteration, including, among other things, that
      the merger will be accounted for as a "purchase method" business
      combination in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
      principles;

    - the merger will be treated as a tax-free reorganization pursuant to the
      Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; and

    - the historical financial statements of each of C-bridge and eXcelon
      reviewed by it had been prepared and fairly presented in accordance with
      U.S. GAAP consistently applied.

    Although developments following the date of the Robertson Stephens opinion
may affect the opinion, Robertson Stephens assumed no obligation to update,
revise or reaffirm its opinion. The Robertson Stephens opinion is necessarily
based upon market, economic and other conditions as in effect on, and
information made available to Robertson Stephens as of, the date of the
Robertson Stephens opinion. C-bridge stockholders should understand that
subsequent developments may affect the conclusion expressed in the Robertson
Stephens opinion and that Robertson Stephens disclaims any undertaking or
obligation to advise any person of any change in any matter affecting the
opinion which may come or be brought to its attention after the date of the
opinion. The Robertson Stephens opinion is limited to the fairness, from a
financial point of view and as of the date thereof, of the exchange ratio to
holders of shares of C-bridge common stock (other than eXcelon or any of its
affiliates or any dissenting stockholders). Robertson Stephens does not express
any opinion as to:

    - the value of any employee agreement or other arrangement entered into in
      connection with the merger;

    - any tax or other consequences that might result from the merger; or

    - what the value of eXcelon common stock will be when issued to C-bridge's
      stockholders in the merger or the price at which the shares of eXcelon
      common stock that are issued in the merger may be traded in the future.

    The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by
Robertson Stephens in connection with rendering the Robertson Stephens opinion.
The summary of the financial analyses is not a complete description of all of
the analyses performed by Robertson Stephens. Some of the information in this
section is presented in a tabular form. For purposes of the financial analyses
prepared in advance of and reviewed with C-bridge's board at the May 22, 2001
meeting, Robertson Stephens assumed that the exchange ratio would be 1.260. The
exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement of 1.2517 was agreed to by
C-bridge after the close of trading on May 22, 2001 based on the closing prices
of C-bridge common stock and eXcelon common stock on May 18, 2001. C-bridge
stockholders should be aware that the exchange ratio set forth in the merger
agreement of 1.2517 differs slightly from the assumed exchange ratio of 1.260
that was used in the following analyses. IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE
FINANCIAL ANALYSES PERFORMED BY ROBERTSON STEPHENS, THESE TABLES MUST BE READ
TOGETHER WITH THE TEXT OF EACH SUMMARY. THE ROBERTSON STEPHENS OPINION IS BASED
UPON THE TOTALITY OF THE VARIOUS ANALYSES PERFORMED BY ROBERTSON STEPHENS AND NO
PARTICULAR PORTION OF THE ANALYSES HAS ANY MERIT STANDING ALONE.

    RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION ANALYSIS.  Based upon C-bridge management's estimates
for C-bridge and financial analysts' estimates for eXcelon, Robertson Stephens
analyzed the respective contributions of the revenues and cash balance as of
March 31, 2001 of C-bridge and eXcelon to the estimated pro forma revenues and
cash balance as of March 31, 2001 of the combined company. The following table
summarizes the results of this analysis:

                                                             C-BRIDGE   EXCELON

    EXCHANGE RATIO ANALYSIS.  Robertson Stephens compared the average of the
daily ratios of the closing price of C-bridge common stock to the closing price
of eXcelon common stock over various periods ending May 18, 2001. The following
table sets forth the average of the daily ratios of the closing prices of
C-bridge common stock compared to eXcelon common stock for the various periods
ending May 18, 2001:

    COMPARABLE COMPANIES ANALYSIS--C-BRIDGE.  Using publicly available
information, Robertson Stephens analyzed, among other things, the trading
multiples of C-bridge and selected publicly traded companies in the Internet
professional services industry, including:

    - Agency.com;

    - Braun Consulting;

    - Cysive;

    - Lante;

    - Razorfish; and

    - Viant

Multiples compared by Robertson Stephens included enterprise value (market
equity value plus book value of total debt less cash and equivalents) to
calendar year 2000 revenues, last quarter revenues (on an annualized basis) and
estimates of calendar year 2001 revenues. All multiples were based on closing
stock prices as of May 18, 2001.

    Using the ranges of multiples set forth in the table below that Robertson
Stephens derived from the multiples for comparable companies, the following
C-bridge equity values, price per share, exchange ratios, and the resulting
ownership of C-bridge stockholders in the combined company were implied based
upon C-bridge's calendar year 2000 revenues, last quarter revenues (on an
annualized basis) and estimates of calendar year 2001 revenues:

                                                                 MULTIPLE RANGE       IMPLIED EXCHANGE RATIO

    COMPARABLE COMPANIES ANALYSIS--EXCELON.  Using publicly available
information, Robertson Stephens analyzed, among other things, the trading
multiples of eXcelon and selected publicly traded companies in the application
integration and business to business infrastructure industries, including:

APPLICATION INTEGRATION                BUSINESS TO BUSINESS INFRASTRUCTURE
- - SeeBeyond                            - Documentum

- - Vitria Technology                    - Mercator Software
- - webMethods

    Multiples compared by Robertson Stephens included enterprise value to
calendar year 2000 revenues, last quarter revenues (on an annualized basis) and
estimates of calendar year 2001 revenues. All multiples were based on closing
stock prices as of May 18, 2001.

    Using the ranges of multiples set forth in the table below that Robertson
Stephens derived from the multiples for comparable companies, the following
eXcelon equity values, price per share, exchange ratios and the resulting
ownership of eXcelon stockholders in the combined company were implied based
upon eXcelon's calendar year 2000 revenues, last quarter revenues (on an
annualized basis) and estimates of calendar year 2001 revenues:

                                                                MULTIPLE RANGE      IMPLIED EXCHANGE RATIO

Calendar year 2001 estimated revenues.......................         0.5x - 2.2x            1.391x - 0.404x

    PREMIUMS PAID ANALYSIS.  Using publicly available information, Robertson
Stephens analyzed the consideration offered and the premiums paid or proposed to
be paid in merger of equals transactions between $50 million and $1.0 billion in
value for the period from January 1, 1997 to May 18, 2001 in which stockholders
of the targets received approximately 40% to 60% of the combined entities
resulting from the transactions while the acquirors obtained the remaining
percentage.

    In analyzing these precedent transactions, Robertson Stephens calculated the
premium paid by the acquirors for shares of the targets and considered the
percentage of shares acquired by stockholders of the targets and acquirors in
the combined entities resulting from the transactions. The following table
summarizes the results of that analysis:

                                                               ONE DAY PRIOR    ONE MONTH PRIOR
                                                              TO ANNOUNCEMENT   TO ANNOUNCEMENT
                                                              ---------------   ---------------

Average Premium Paid........................................           -0.3%         3.7%

    No company, business or transaction compared in the comparable companies
analysis or the premiums paid analysis is identical to C-bridge or eXcelon or
the proposed merger. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the foregoing is
not entirely mathematical; rather it involves complex considerations and
judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and
other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading and other values
of the comparable companies, precedent transactions or the business segment,
company or transactions to which they are being compared.

    OTHER FACTORS AND COMPARATIVE ANALYSES.  In rendering its opinion, Robertson
Stephens considered other factors and conducted other comparative analyses,
including, among other things, a review of:

    - the history of trading prices and volume for C-bridge common stock for the
      period from May 18, 2000 to May 18, 2001;

    - the history of trading prices and volume for eXcelon common stock for the
      period from May 18, 2000 to May 18, 2001;

    - the stock price performance of C-bridge common stock compared to the
      performance of an index comprised of C-bridge comparable companies and to
      the Nasdaq Composite Index over the period from November 17, 2000 to
      May 18, 2001;

    - the stock price performance of eXcelon common stock compared to the
      performance of an index comprised of eXcelon comparable companies and to
      the Nasdaq Composite Index over the period from November 17, 2000 to
      May 18, 2001;

    - the third and fourth quarter 2001 estimates of the cash flow from
      operations for each of C-bridge, eXcelon and on a pro forma basis the
      combined company; and

    - selected published analysts' reports on C-bridge and eXcelon.

    While the foregoing summary describes selected analyses and factors that
Robertson Stephens deemed material in its presentation to C-bridge's board, it
is not a comprehensive description of all analyses and factors considered by
Robertson Stephens. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process
that involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant
methods of financial analysis and the application of these methods to the
particular circumstances and, as a result, a fairness opinion is not readily
susceptible to summary description. Robertson Stephens believes that its
analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its
analyses and of the factors considered by it, without considering all analyses
and factors, would create an incomplete view of the evaluation process
underlying the Robertson Stephens opinion. Several analytical methodologies were
employed and no one method of analysis should be regarded as critical to the
overall conclusion reached by Robertson Stephens. Each analytical technique has
inherent strengths and weaknesses, and the nature of the available information
may further affect the value of particular techniques. The conclusions reached
by Robertson Stephens are based on all analyses and factors taken as a whole and
also on application of Robertson Stephens' own experience and judgment. Such
conclusions may involve significant elements of subjective judgment and
qualitative analysis. Robertson Stephens gives no opinion as to the value or
merit standing alone of any one or more parts of the analysis that it

performed. In performing its analyses, Robertson Stephens considered general
economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are
beyond the control of C-bridge and eXcelon. The analyses performed by Robertson
Stephens are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such
analyses. Accordingly, analyses relating to the value of a business do not
purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which the business actually
may be purchased. No opinion is being expressed as to the prices at which shares
of C-bridge common stock or eXcelon common stock may be traded at any future
time.

    The engagement letter between Robertson Stephens and C-bridge provides that
Robertson Stephens is entitled to receive a fee for its services, a substantial
portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the merger. C-bridge has
also agreed to reimburse Robertson Stephens for its out-of-pocket expenses,
including legal fees, and to indemnify and hold harmless Robertson Stephens and
its affiliates and any director, employee or agent of Robertson Stephens or any
of its affiliates, or any person controlling Robertson Stephens or its
affiliates, for certain losses, claims, damages, expenses and liabilities
relating to or arising out of services provided by Robertson Stephens as
financial advisor to C-bridge. If the merger is not consummated and eXcelon pays
C-bridge the termination fee, the Robertson Stephens engagement letter requires
C-bridge to pay Robertson Stephens the lesser of 50% of the termination fee or
50% of the fees that would have been paid to Robertson Stephens if the merger
had been consummated. The terms of the fee arrangement with Robertson Stephens,
which C-bridge and Robertson Stephens believe are customary in transactions of
this nature, were negotiated at arm's length between C-bridge and Robertson
Stephens, and C-bridge's board was aware of these fee arrangements, including
the fact that a significant portion of the fees payable to Robertson Stephens is
contingent upon completion of the merger. In the past, Robertson Stephens has
provided certain investment banking services to C-bridge for which it has been
paid fees, including acting as the lead underwriter in the initial public
offering of C-bridge common stock in December of 1999. Robertson Stephens
maintains a market in the shares of C-bridge common stock. In the ordinary
course of its business, Robertson Stephens may trade in C-bridge's securities
and eXcelon's securities for its own account and the accounts of its customers
and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in C-bridge's
securities or eXcelon's securities.

    Robertson Stephens was retained based on Robertson Stephens' experience as a
financial advisor in connection with mergers and acquisitions and in securities
valuations generally, as well as Robertson Stephens' investment banking
relationship and familiarity with C-bridge.

    Robertson Stephens is an internationally recognized investment banking firm.
As part of its investment banking business, Robertson Stephens is frequently
engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of
securities, private placements and other purposes.

INTERESTS OF C-BRIDGE'S MANAGEMENT AND CERTAIN STOCKHOLDERS IN THE MERGER

    In considering the recommendation of C-bridge's board of directors with
respect to the proposed merger, C-bridge stockholders should note that some of
C-bridge's stockholders, directors and officers have interests in the merger
that are different from, or in addition to, their interests solely as C-bridge
stockholders. These interests may create potential conflicts of interest. The
boards of directors of eXcelon and C-bridge were aware of these interests and
took these interests into account in approving the proposed merger and the
transactions contemplated by the merger documents.

    VOTING AGREEMENTS.  The directors, executive officers and several
stockholders of C-bridge have entered into irrevocable proxy and voting
agreements with eXcelon, which authorize eXcelon to vote their shares in favor
of approval of the merger, the adjournment proposal and any actions

recommended by C-bridge's board of directors that are required to accomplish the
merger and related transactions.

    ELECTION OF DIRECTORS.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, eXcelon
will cause Joseph L. Badaracco, Jr., Joseph M. Bellini, Jeffrey Horing and
Raymond J. Lane to be elected to eXcelon's board of directors.

    C-BRIDGE STOCK OPTIONS.  The options owned by each of C-bridge's directors
and officers will be assumed in the merger and become exercisable, in accordance
with their terms, for shares of eXcelon common stock.

    ELECTION OF OFFICERS.  eXcelon has agreed to elect the following officers of
C-bridge to the offices opposite their names:

NAME                                   OFFICE
- ----                                   ------

Joseph M. Bellini....................  Chief Executive Officer
Mark A. Cosway.......................  President
Richard C. Putz......................  Chief Marketing Officer
Clifford B. Thompson.................  Secretary and General Counsel

    EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT.  eXcelon has entered into an employment agreement with
Joseph M. Bellini, the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating
Officer of C-bridge. The employment agreement will become effective upon the
consummation of the merger and will replace Mr. Bellini's existing employment
agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, eXcelon will employ Mr. Bellini as
its Chief Executive Officer and, upon the consummation of the merger, will grant
Mr. Bellini options to purchase 1,000,000 shares of eXcelon common stock with an
exercise price equal to the fair market value of the eXcelon common stock on the
date the merger is consummated. The options will have a term of ten years and
will vest in eight equal semi-annual installments, commencing six months after
the date of grant. For more information about this agreement and these options,
see "Related Agreements--Employment agreements."

    REGISTRATION RIGHTS.  eXcelon has entered into an investor rights agreement
with InSight Capital Partners III, L.P., InSight Capital Partners (Cayman) III,
L.P. and InSight Capital Partners III Co-Investors, L.P. granting these entities
certain registration rights with respect to the eXcelon common stock they will
acquire in the merger. For more information about this agreement see "Related
Agreements--Investor rights agreement."

    INDEMNIFICATION; INSURANCE.  eXcelon will indemnify all persons who were
officers, directors, employees or other indemnitees of C-bridge before the
merger to the same extent those persons were indemnified under C-bridge's
certificate of incorporation or by-laws in effect on the date of the merger
agreement.

    eXcelon will, to the full extent permitted by Delaware law, indemnify and
advance expenses to all persons who were officers or directors of C-bridge
immediately before the merger for all actions, claims, damages, costs, expenses,
liabilities or judgments or settlements arising out of the fact that the person
is or was a director or officer of C-bridge.

    For a period of six years after the completion of the merger, eXcelon will
use reasonable efforts to maintain in effect officers' and directors' liability
insurance for each individual covered under C-bridge's policy on the date of the
merger agreement on terms comparable to the insurance provided to eXcelon's
offers and directors. However, if eXcelon's annual premium payments for the
insurance policy exceeds 200% of the annual premium paid by C-bridge as of the
date of the merger agreement, eXcelon will not be obligated to continue the
policy and may substitute a policy with the greatest coverage available at a
cost not exceeding that amount.

OWNERSHIP OF EXCELON COMMON STOCK FOLLOWING THE MERGER

    As a result of the merger, holders of C-bridge common stock will become
eXcelon stockholders. Assuming that no options to purchase C-bridge common stock
are exercised before the closing of the merger, eXcelon will issue approximately
26,980,039 shares of eXcelon common stock to C-bridge stockholders in the
merger. Following the merger, existing eXcelon stockholders will own
approximately 52.4%, and former C-bridge stockholders will own approximately
47.6%, of the combined company. Our calculation of the percentage ownership of
eXcelon common stock following the merger is based on each company's outstanding
common stock as of June 4, 2001. eXcelon will reserve an additional 13,285,939
shares of eXcelon common stock which may be issued upon the exercise of options
to purchase shares of C-bridge common stock, which will be assumed by eXcelon
and converted to options to purchase shares of eXcelon common stock.

MANAGEMENT OF EXCELON FOLLOWING THE MERGER

    BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  If the eXcelon stockholders approve the proposals
presented at the eXcelon annual meeting, after the merger, eXcelon's board of
directors will consist of eight directors, four of whom are current directors of

Horing has been nominated by the C-bridge board of directors to serve on the new
board of directors of the combined company. If any of these individuals becomes
unavailable before the completion of the merger to serve on the eXcelon board,
the boards of eXcelon and C-bridge, respectively, will select another person to
serve in that individual's place. The eXcelon board will determine the members
of eXcelon's audit and compensation committees following the merger.

    EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.  At the time of the merger, the board of directors of
eXcelon will elect the following officers of eXcelon:

may be made with respect to the management and operations of eXcelon, including
the selection of additional executive officers, if any, and other senior
management.

    eXcelon's corporate headquarters will remain in Burlington, Massachusetts.

RESTRICTIONS ON RESALES OF EXCELON COMMON STOCK BY AFFILIATES

    eXcelon has registered under the Securities Act the shares of eXcelon common
stock to be issued to holders of C-bridge common stock in connection with the
merger. These shares will be freely transferable under the Securities Act,
except for shares of eXcelon common stock issued to any person who is an
affiliate of either eXcelon or C-bridge. A person may be deemed to be an
affiliate of eXcelon or C-bridge if the person controls, is controlled by, or is
under common control with eXcelon or C-bridge, respectively. Affiliates include
the directors and executive officers and some of the principal stockholders of
eXcelon and C-bridge. Affiliates may not sell shares of eXcelon common stock
acquired in the merger except under:

    - an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the
      resale of those shares;

    - the exemption provided by Rule 145(d) under the Securities Act; or

    - any other applicable exemption under the Securities Act.

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF C-BRIDGE COMMON STOCK AFTER THE MERGER

    If we complete the merger, the C-bridge common stock will be delisted from
the Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the Exchange Act.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

    eXcelon intends to account for the merger as a purchase transaction under
generally accepted accounting principles. After the merger, eXcelon will include
the results of operations of C-bridge in eXcelon's consolidated financial
statements. eXcelon will allocate the purchase price, which is equal to the
value of the aggregate merger consideration and related transaction costs at the
date of the closing, based on the fair values of the C-bridge assets acquired
and the C-bridge liabilities assumed. The amount of the purchase price in excess
of the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of
C-bridge acquired will be recorded as goodwill and other intangible assets and
will be amortized by charges to operations under generally accepted accounting
principles. These allocations will be made based upon valuations and other
studies that have not yet been finalized.

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

    eXcelon and C-bridge have agreed to take all reasonable actions to comply
promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on them in connection
with the merger and related transactions. The parties may need to obtain
consents, approvals, orders or authorizations from governmental agencies, and
may need to make filings, declarations or registrations with governmental
agencies.

    Neither eXcelon nor C-bridge is aware of any material governmental or
regulatory approval required for completion of the merger, other than the
effectiveness of the registration statement of which this proxy
statement/prospectus is a part, and compliance with applicable corporate laws of
Delaware.

    If any additional actions are required in connection with the merger or
related transactions, we intend to take those actions as promptly as possible,
but we may be unable to obtain all necessary consents, approvals, orders or
authorizations.

    Federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities or private parties could
seek to challenge the merger on antitrust or similar grounds. If a challenge is
made, we may not prevail. Under the merger agreement, neither party is obligated
to complete the merger if any temporary restraining order, preliminary or
permanent injunction or other order issued by any court of competent
jurisdiction or other legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition preventing
completion of the merger is in effect.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

    The following is a brief summary of the material provisions of the merger
agreement. You are urged to read the full text of the merger agreement, which is
attached as Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus.

GENERAL

    The merger agreement provides for the acquisition of C-bridge by eXcelon
through the merger of Comet Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of
eXcelon, into C-bridge. C-bridge will be the surviving corporation in the
merger. When the merger is completed, each outstanding share of C-bridge common
stock will be converted automatically into 1.2517 shares of eXcelon common
stock. No fractional shares of eXcelon common stock will be issued. In lieu of a
fractional share, eXcelon will pay in cash, rounded to the nearest whole cent,
an amount equal to the fraction multiplied by the average closing price of one
share of eXcelon common stock on the Nasdaq National Market for the ten trading
days before the closing of the merger.

CONVERSION OF C-BRIDGE COMMON STOCK

    At the time of the merger, the following will occur:

    - each share of C-bridge common stock owned by C-bridge as treasury stock
      and each share of C-bridge common stock owned by eXcelon or any wholly
      owned subsidiary of eXcelon or C-bridge will be canceled; and

    - each share of C-bridge common stock issued and outstanding when the merger
      is closed which has not been canceled will be converted into the right to
      receive 1.2517 shares of eXcelon common stock and a cash payment in lieu
      of fractional shares, if any.

TREATMENT OF C-BRIDGE STOCK OPTIONS

    eXcelon will assume each option to purchase C-bridge common stock that is
outstanding and unexercised when the merger becomes effective. eXcelon will
assume each option plan under which any assumed option was granted, and each
such assumed option will continue to be governed by the option plan under which
it was granted. Each option will entitle the holder to purchase a number of
shares of eXcelon common stock equal to the number of shares of C-bridge common
stock subject to the option multiplied by the exchange ratio of 1.2517, rounded
down to the nearest whole share. The exercise price of each option will equal
the exercise price per share of C-bridge common stock at which the option was
exercisable immediately before the closing of the merger divided by the exchange
ratio of 1.2517, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. For example, if a person
holds an unexercised option to purchase 100 shares of C-bridge common stock for
$1.00 per share, as of the closing of the merger eXcelon will assume that
option, and it will become an option to purchase 125 shares of eXcelon common
stock for $0.80 per share. The other terms of the option, such as its expiration
date, will be unchanged. After the closing of the merger, eXcelon will issue to
each holder of assumed C-bridge options a document confirming its assumption of
the option. However, eXcelon will not issue any confirmation, nor will eXcelon
issue any shares of eXcelon common stock upon exercise of an assumed option,
until the shares of eXcelon common stock issuable upon exercise of the assumed
options are:

    - registered with the SEC on Form S-8, which eXcelon has agreed to file with
      the SEC within ten business days after the closing of the merger;

    - listed as additional shares for inclusion on the Nasdaq National Market;
      and

    - authorized for sale by any appropriate state securities regulators, if
      necessary.

TREATMENT OF RIGHTS UNDER C-BRIDGE EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

    At the closing of the merger, all rights to purchase shares of C-bridge
common stock under C-bridge's 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan will be
converted into rights to purchase shares of eXcelon common stock in accordance
with the terms of the stock purchase plan.

EXCHANGE OF C-BRIDGE CERTIFICATES

    Promptly after the closing of the merger, eXcelon will cause the exchange
agent, EquiServe, to send to each C-bridge stockholder a letter of transmittal
and instructions for use in exchanging C-bridge stock certificates for
certificates representing shares of eXcelon common stock and, if applicable, for
a check for the fractional share amount to which the stockholder is entitled.

    Each C-bridge stockholder must surrender to the exchange agent all of his or
her C-bridge stock certificates along with a properly executed and completed
letter of transmittal before he or she can receive certificates representing
shares of eXcelon common stock and a cash payment for fractional shares, if any.
Until surrendered, outstanding C-bridge stock certificates will be treated for
all corporate purposes, other than payment of dividends, as evidence of
ownership of shares of eXcelon common stock into which the shares of C-bridge
common stock have been automatically converted. If after May 22, 2001, the date
of the merger agreement, eXcelon declares or makes any dividends or other
distributions on its common stock with a record date after the date of the
closing of the merger, then any holder of record of C-bridge common stock will
not be paid these dividends or other distributions until he or she surrenders
his or her C-bridge stock certificate along with a properly executed and
completed letter of transmittal. When the stockholder surrenders his or her
C-bridge stock certificates, eXcelon will pay the dividends or other
distributions, without interest, to the record holder. No transfer of shares of
C-bridge common stock will be made on the stock transfer books of C-bridge after
the closing of the merger.

    C-bridge stockholders should not surrender their C-bridge stock certificates
for exchange until they receive the letter of transmittal and instructions from
the exchange agent. However, C-bridge stockholders are urged to notify EquiServe
immediately if their C-bridge stock certificates are lost, stolen, destroyed or
not properly registered, in order to begin the process of obtaining replacement
C-bridge stock certificates. EquiServe can be reached at 150 Royall Street,
Canton, Massachusetts 02021, (781) 575-4575.

    Neither eXcelon, Comet Acquisition Corp., C-bridge, nor the exchange agent
will be liable to any C-bridge stockholder or eXcelon stockholder for any
undistributed shares of eXcelon common stock or cash amounts that are delivered
to a public official under applicable abandoned property or similar laws.

NO SOLICITATION OF COMPETING ACQUISITION PROPOSALS

    In general, each of C-bridge and eXcelon has agreed that until the closing
of the merger it will not, directly or indirectly, solicit or encourage the
submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers by any third party, or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any third party, or disclose
or make available any information concerning itself to any third party, or
otherwise assist, facilitate or encourage, or enter into any agreement or
understanding with, any third party, in connection with any acquisition proposal
by such third party. Each of C-bridge and eXcelon has also agreed that it will
not, directly or indirectly, make or authorize any statement, recommendation or
solicitation in support of any acquisition proposal by any third party. C-bridge
and eXcelon have each agreed to immediately cease any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties with respect to
any of the foregoing.

    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if either C-bridge or eXcelon receives in
writing a BONA FIDE, unsolicited acquisition proposal or indication of interest
in making an acquisition proposal, and its board of directors determines, in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that to do so would
be consistent with the board's fiduciary duties under applicable law and would
be reasonably likely to lead to an acquisition proposal that, in the board's
good faith determination after consultation with its independent financial
advisors, would be more favorable to its stockholders from a financial point of
view, is reasonably capable of being financed and is likely to be consummated,
such party may participate in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish
information to, the third party from which it received the acquisition proposal
or indication of interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if C-bridge or eXcelon
receives a BONA FIDE, unsolicited acquisition proposal as to which financing is
not committed and such party's board of directors determines in good faith that
such acquisition proposal would, but for the question of the financial
capability of the proposed acquirer, constitute a superior proposal, then such
party may conduct such limited inquiries of the proposed acquirer as are
necessary for the sole purpose of ascertaining whether the proposed transaction
is reasonably capable of being consummated so as to constitute a superior
proposal.

    Any party receiving an acquisition proposal or inquiry must immediately
notify the other party of the proposal or inquiry, communicate to the other
party the terms and conditions of the acquisition proposal or inquiry and the
identity of the third party who made the acquisition proposal or inquiry. Before
disclosing any information to any third party with respect to any superior
proposal, the party receiving the proposal must notify the other party of the
information proposed to be disclosed, and the receiving party may disclose the
information to the third party only under appropriate confidentiality
arrangements.

    Either party's board of directors may approve a superior proposal or
recommend it to its stockholders if the board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the action is consistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law, and in that case, the board may amend or
withdraw its recommendation of the merger. However, neither party's board of
directors may take any of the foregoing actions until the fifth business day
after it has notified the other party that the board is prepared to recommend a
superior proposal to its stockholders, specifying the terms and conditions of
the superior proposal and identifying the person making the superior proposal.
During this five business day period, the other party may make a counterproposal
to the superior proposal, and the party receiving the superior proposal is
obligated, subject to the fiduciary duties of its board of

directors, to negotiate with the other party with respect to the counterproposal
for a reasonable period of time.

    The obligations of C-bridge and eXcelon to complete the merger depend upon
the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including the following:

    - Joseph M. Bellini must have entered into an employment agreement with
      eXcelon, and such employment agreement must be in full force and effect.

EXPENSES AND TERMINATION FEE

    Generally, all fees and expenses incurred by either party will be paid by
the party incurring the expenses, whether the merger is consummated or not,
except that eXcelon and C-bridge will share equally all fees and expenses (other
than attorneys', accountants' and financial advisors' fees) incurred in
connection with the printing and filing of this proxy statement/prospectus and
the registration statement in which it is included.

    If the merger agreement is terminated by either party because either party's
board of directors accepts or approves a superior proposal or recommends a

TERMINATION

    The merger agreement may be terminated, and the merger may be abandoned, at
any time before C-bridge and eXcelon complete the merger:

    - by C-bridge's and eXcelon's mutual written consent;

    - by either party if the other party has breached any representation,
      warranty, covenant or agreement in the merger agreement and the breach has
      not been cured within five business days after written notice by the
      non-breaching party. The merger agreement may not be terminated due to
      another party's breach if the terminating party is in material breach of
      the terms of the merger agreement. Also, no cure period is required for a
      breach which by its nature cannot be cured;

    - by either party if the other party's board of directors amends, withholds

      state court in effect preventing consummation of the merger;

    - by either party if there is any final action taken, or any statute, rule,
      regulation or order enacted by any governmental entity which would make
      consummation of the merger illegal, prohibit eXcelon's ownership or
      operation of all or a material portion of C-bridge's business or compel

      eXcelon to dispose of or hold separate all or a material portion of
      eXcelon's or C-bridge's business or assets as a result of the merger;

    - by either party if C-bridge's stockholders do not approve and adopt the
      merger and the merger agreement, provided that C-bridge may not terminate
      the merger agreement in these circumstances if it is in material breach of
      the merger agreement;

    - by either party if eXcelon's stockholders do not approve the merger and
      the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, provided that
      eXcelon may not terminate the merger agreement in these circumstances if
      it is in material breach of the merger agreement;

    - by either party if the merger is not consummated by October 31, 2001. The
      right to terminate the merger agreement in this circumstance is not
      available to any party whose willful failure to fulfill any material
      obligation under the merger agreement has been the cause of, or resulted
      in, the failure of the merger to be completed on or before that date; and

    - by either party if eXcelon's or C-bridge's board of directors accepts or
      approves a superior proposal, or recommends a superior proposal to its
      stockholders.

AMENDMENT

    The parties may amend the merger agreement at any time in writing.

WAIVER AND EXTENSION

    Either party may waive any obligation of the other party under the merger
agreement or give the other party additional time to comply with the obligation.
Any waiver or extension must be in writing and must be signed by the party
giving the waiver or extension.

CLOSING AND EFFECTIVE TIME

    Unless eXcelon and C-bridge agree to another date, the closing date for the
merger will occur on or before the second business day after all of the
conditions to the merger have been satisfied or waived, but not later than
October 31, 2001. Upon the closing of the merger, the parties will file a
certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of Delaware. The merger will
become effective at the time this filing is made.

receiving party to vote the shares covered by the proxy in accordance with the
voting agreement without the consent or cooperation of the person who gave the
proxy. Neither the voting agreements nor the proxies granted under them entitle
the receiving party to vote on the other proposals described in this proxy
statement/prospectus.

    Except in the case of the voting agreements entered into by Hamilton Trust
Company, Field Nominees Ltd. and Internet Business Capital Company Ltd., each
voting agreement generally provides that the stockholder will not transfer,
sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of any shares over which the stockholder has
voting power or in which the stockholder has any interest, and will not exercise
any options to purchase shares. Each agreement also generally provides that the
stockholder will cease

existing discussions or negotiations with respect to any acquisition of C-bridge
or eXcelon, as the case may be, by any third party, and will not initiate,
solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate any acquisition proposals or
inquiries by any third party. Each stockholder also agreed to notify the other
party of any proposals or inquiries received by the stockholder or of which the
stockholder has knowledge relating to a potential acquisition by a third party.

    The voting agreements terminate upon the earlier of the closing of the
merger or termination of the merger agreement or, in the case of Internet
Business Capital Company, Ltd., on September 20, 2001.

    As of June 4, 2001, the directors and executive officers of eXcelon who
signed voting agreements beneficially owned an aggregate of 1,356,599
outstanding shares of eXcelon common stock, which represented approximately 4.6%
of the shares of eXcelon common stock outstanding on that date.

    As of June 4, 2001, the directors, officers and stockholders of C-bridge who
signed voting agreements beneficially owned an aggregate of 10,299,666
outstanding shares of C-bridge common stock, which represented approximately
47.8% of the shares of C-bridge common stock outstanding on that date.

INVESTOR RIGHTS AGREEMENT

    On October 7, 1999, C-bridge entered into an investor rights agreement with
InSight Capital Partners, III, L.P., InSight Capital Partners (Cayman)
III, L.P. and InSight Capital Partners III Co-Investors, L.P., which we refer to
as the "InSight Capital entities." Under the investor rights agreement, the
Insight Capital entities were entitled to require C-bridge to register with the
SEC for resale in a public offering the shares of capital stock of C-bridge held
by them, and were also entitled to participate as selling stockholders in
registered public offerings initiated by C-bridge. To induce the InSight Capital
entities to execute the voting agreement, eXcelon entered into a new investor
rights agreement with the InSight Capital entities, in which eXcelon granted to
the InSight Capital entities registration rights with respect to the eXcelon
common stock to be acquired by them in the merger that are substantially
equivalent to those granted by C-bridge in the original investor rights
agreement. The original investor rights agreement will be terminated at the
effective time of the merger.

    Ramanan Raghavendran, a director of C-bridge, is Special Partner, Asia, for
InSight Capital Partners and formerly was affiliated with the InSight Capital
entities. Jeffrey Horing, a nominee for election as a director of the combined
company, is a general partner of InSight Capital Partners. The InSight Capital
entities, as of June 4, 2001, held an aggregate of 2,050,000 shares of C-bridge
common stock, which will represent, after the merger, approximately 2,566,000
shares of eXcelon common stock. All of these shares will be eligible for
registration pursuant to eXcelon's new investor rights agreement with the
InSight Capital entities.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

    Robert N. Goldman, Joseph M. Bellini, Satish Maripuri and Lacey P. Brandt
have each signed employment agreements with eXcelon that will become effective
upon the closing of the merger. In addition, each of these individuals has
signed or will sign a non-competition, non-solicitation, non-disclosure and
developments agreement with eXcelon.

    The following is a summary of these employment agreements.

    ROBERT N. GOLDMAN.  Robert N. Goldman, eXcelon's Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, signed a new employment agreement that, upon the closing of
the merger, will replace his existing employment agreement with eXcelon.
Following the merger, eXcelon will employ Mr. Goldman as its Chairman of the
Board. The employment agreement has a term of two years, commencing on the
closing of the merger.

    Under the new agreement, eXcelon will pay Mr. Goldman an annual salary of
$250,000, as well as a cash bonus of $500,000 payable upon the closing of the
merger. Mr. Goldman is also entitled to receive the benefits that eXcelon
generally provides from time to time to its senior executives.

    The agreement provides that, upon a change of control of eXcelon, all of
Mr. Goldman's options to purchase eXcelon common stock will immediately vest and
become fully exercisable. If within 12 months after a change of control either
eXcelon terminates Mr. Goldman's employment without cause or Mr. Goldman
terminates his employment within 90 days after a constructive termination, then
Mr. Goldman may exercise his options at any time in the one-year period
following his termination. eXcelon and Mr. Goldman agreed that a constructive
termination means any of the following: the relocation of Mr. Goldman's
principal workplace to a location more than 50 miles from his current location;
the assignment to him of duties and responsibilities inappropriate for eXcelon's
Chairman of the Board; a failure to appoint him to eXcelon's board of directors;
or a reduction in his compensation or benefits.

    The agreement provides that Mr. Goldman's employment will terminate or may
be terminated as follows:

    - upon Mr. Goldman's death;

    - by eXcelon, if Mr. Goldman suffers a disability, which is a mental or
      physical condition that prevents him from substantially performing his
      duties as Chairman of the Board for a period of three consecutive months
      or more;

    - voluntarily by Mr. Goldman, at any time upon written notice to eXcelon;

    - voluntarily by Mr. Goldman, within 90 days after a constructive
      termination;

    - by eXcelon for cause; and

    - by eXcelon without cause.

    eXcelon and Mr. Goldman agreed that cause includes the following: his
conviction of a felony offense; his commission of fraud or embezzlement with
respect to funds of eXcelon; negligence in the performance of his duties which
results in a material detriment to eXcelon; his failure to comply with lawful
instructions by the board or his material failure to comply with reasonable
policies, directives, standards and regulations adopted by eXcelon, but only if
he does not cure the failure within 30 days after written notice; his breach of
eXcelon's non-competition, non-solicitation, non-disclosure and developments
agreement; and his commission of any intentional act that would reasonably be
expected to have, and that does have, a material adverse effect on the goodwill
or reputation of eXcelon or on its relationships with its customers or
employees.

    The agreement includes provisions regarding the payment of severance and
benefits upon termination of employment. If Mr. Goldman voluntarily terminates
his employment or if eXcelon terminates his employment for cause, he will not be
entitled to any severance payment. If eXcelon terminates Mr. Goldman's
employment without cause, or if Mr. Goldman voluntarily terminates his
employment after a constructive termination, he will receive severance that
includes payment of his salary and benefits until the end of the original
employment term of two years. If eXcelon terminates his employment for
disability, Mr. Goldman will be entitled to the benefits that are payable under
eXcelon's disability insurance policies and disability plans.

    The agreement also provides that eXcelon will indemnify Mr. Goldman, to the
fullest extent permitted by law and eXcelon's charter and bylaws, against all
liabilities and costs resulting from any claim which relates to his serving in
the capacity of a director, officer or employee of eXcelon.

    JOSEPH M. BELLINI.  Joseph M. Bellini, C-bridge's Chairman, Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Operating Officer, signed an employment agreement that, upon
the closing of the merger, will replace his existing employment agreement with
C-bridge. Following the merger, eXcelon will employ Mr. Bellini as its Chief
Executive Officer. The employment agreement has an initial term of two years,
commencing with the closing of the merger. The agreement will automatically
renew for additional one-year periods unless eXcelon notifies Mr. Bellini at
least 90 days before the end of the then-current term that it does not wish to
extend the agreement.

    Under the agreement, eXcelon will pay Mr. Bellini an annual salary of
$300,000. At the end of each year of employment, eXcelon will adjust his salary
to reflect changes in the cost of living index. Mr. Bellini may receive an
annual performance bonus of up to $300,000, depending on achievement of goals to
be determined between him and eXcelon. The board or the compensation committee
will review his compensation annually and may increase his salary or bonus at
its discretion. Mr. Bellini is also entitled to receive the benefits that
eXcelon generally provides from time to time to its senior executives, as well
as four weeks of paid vacation each year.

    The agreement provides that at the closing of the merger Mr. Bellini will
receive options to purchase 1,000,000 shares of eXcelon common stock at an
exercise price equal to the fair market value of the eXcelon common stock on the
date of grant. The option will have a term of ten years and will vest in eight
equal semi-annual installments, beginning six months after the date of the
grant. The options will vest in full upon Mr. Bellini's death, disability or
termination by eXcelon without cause, and will remain exercisable until the
later of their original expiration date or one year after termination of
Mr. Bellini's employment. Under the agreement, these options, as well as any
other options to purchase eXcelon common stock held by Mr. Bellini immediately
following the closing of the merger, will vest immediately if eXcelon is sold or
if there is a change of control of eXcelon.

    The agreement provides that Mr. Bellini's employment will terminate or may
be terminated as follows:

    - upon Mr. Bellini's death;

    - by eXcelon, if Mr. Bellini suffers a disability, which is a mental or
      physical condition that prevents him from substantially performing his
      duties as Chief Executive Officer for a period of three consecutive months
      or more;

    - voluntarily by Mr. Bellini, at any time upon 90-days' written notice to
      eXcelon;

    - voluntarily by Mr. Bellini, within 180 days after a constructive
      termination;

    - by eXcelon for cause; and

    - by eXcelon without cause.

    eXcelon and Mr. Bellini agreed that cause means his conviction of a felony
offense and that a constructive termination means any of the following: the
relocation of Mr. Bellini's principal workplace to a location more than 20 miles
from his current location; the assignment to him of duties and responsibilities
inconsistent with his position or inappropriate for eXcelon's Chief Executive
Officer; a failure to appoint him to eXcelon's board of directors or a
requirement that he report to anyone other than the board of directors; a
reduction in his compensation or benefits; or delivery of a notice by eXcelon
that it does not wish to extend the agreement.

    The agreement includes provisions regarding payment of severance and
benefits upon termination of employment. If Mr. Bellini voluntarily terminates
his employment or if eXcelon terminates his employment for cause, he will not
entitled to any severance payment. If eXcelon terminates Mr. Bellini's
employment without cause or as a result of his death or disability, or if
Mr. Bellini voluntarily terminates his employment within 180 days after a
constructive termination, he will receive

severance that includes payment of his salary and benefits for a period of
12 months, plus 100% of the amount of the maximum performance bonus in effect
for the year in which the termination occurs.

    The agreement also provides that eXcelon will indemnify Mr. Bellini, to the
fullest extent permitted by law and eXcelon's charter and bylaws, against all
liabilities and costs resulting from any claim which relates to his serving in
the capacity of a director, officer or employee of eXcelon.

    SATISH MARIPURI AND LACEY P. BRANDT.  Each of Satish Maripuri and Lacey P.
Brandt signed an employment agreement that, upon the closing of the merger, will
replace his or her existing severance agreement with eXcelon. Following the
merger, eXcelon will employ Mr. Maripuri as its Chief Operating Officer and the
Chairman of the Leadership Council, and eXcelon will employ Ms. Brandt as its
Chief Financial Officer. The employment agreements with Mr. Maripuri and
Ms. Brandt are otherwise identical. Each employment agreement has a term of one
year, commencing with the closing of the merger. The agreement will
automatically renew for additional one-year periods unless eXcelon notifies the
employee at least 90 days before the end of the then-current term that it does
not wish to extend the agreement.

    The termination provisions of the employment agreements with Mr. Maripuri
and Ms. Brandt are substantially similar to those of the new employment
agreement with Mr. Goldman, except that:

    - The severance payment is equal to the employee's monthly salary multiplied
      by 12, plus the maximum performance bonus which the employee could have
      earned for the year in which the employee's employment was terminated;

    - The employee must give eXcelon 90-days' written notice to voluntarily
      terminate employment; and

    - A constructive termination means any of the following: the relocation of
      the employee's principal workplace to a location more than 50 miles from
      the employee's current location; any material diminution in the employee's
      authority or responsibilities or the assignment to the employee of duties
      and responsibilities inappropriate for the employee's position; any change
      in the employee's reporting relationship such that the employee reports to
      any officer other than eXcelon's Chief Executive Officer; or a reduction
      in the employee's compensation or benefits.

                    MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

    The following is a summary of the material United States federal income tax
consequences generally applicable to you, as a stockholder of C-bridge, if you
are a "United States person" as defined for United States federal income tax
purposes and you hold your shares of C-bridge common stock as a capital asset.

    For United States federal income tax purposes, a "United States person" is:

    - a United States citizen or resident alien as determined under the Internal
      Revenue Code, or the tax code;

    - a corporation or partnership, as defined by the tax code, that is
      organized under the laws of the United States or any state;

    - an estate, the income of which is subject to United States federal income
      taxation regardless of its source; and

    - a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary
      supervision over its administration and at least one United States person
      is authorized to control all of its major decisions.

    This summary is based on the tax code, existing and proposed Treasury
Regulations and judicial and administrative determinations, as each is in effect
as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. All of the foregoing are
subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect, and all are
subject to differing interpretation. No advance ruling has been sought or
obtained from the IRS regarding the United States federal income tax
consequences of the merger. The statements in this proxy statement/prospectus
and the opinions of counsel that are described herein are not binding on the IRS
or a court. As a result, neither C-bridge, eXcelon, nor Comet Acquisition Corp.
can assure you that the tax considerations or opinions described here will not
be challenged by the IRS or sustained by a court if so challenged.

    This summary does not address aspects of United States taxation other than
United States federal income taxation. Furthermore, it does not address all
aspects of United States federal income taxation that may apply to you if you
are subject to annual rules under the tax code, including, without limitation,
rules that apply to persons who acquired shares of C-bridge common stock as a
result of the exercise of employee stock options, tax-exempt organizations,
financial institutions, broker-dealers, insurance companies, persons having a
"functional currency" other than the United States dollar, persons who hold
their shares of C-bridge common stock as part of a straddle, wash sale, hedging
or conversion transaction, and some United States expatriates. In addition, this
summary and the opinions described here do not addressed the state, local or
foreign tax consequences of the merger.

    Each C-bridge stockholder is urged to consult and rely on his or her tax
advisors with respect to the United States federal, state and local, and foreign
tax consequences of the merger based upon the stockholder's particular
circumstances.

THE MERGER AS REORGANIZATION

    It is a condition of the obligations of each of eXcelon, Comet Acquisition
Corp. and C-bridge to effect the merger that eXcelon and C-bridge shall each
have received substantially identical written opinions from their counsel,
Foley, Hoag & Eliot LLP and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, respectively, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to them, to the effect that the merger
will constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code. eXcelon, Comet Acquisition Corp. and C-bridge have agreed
to make reasonable representations as requested by counsel for the purpose of
rendering these opinions.

    As a consequence of reorganization treatment, the following United States
federal income consequences will result:

    - you, as a C-bridge stockholder, will recognize no gain or loss upon the
      conversion of your shares of common stock into shares of eXcelon common
      stock, except with respect to cash received in lieu of a fractional share
      of eXcelon common stock;

    - cash payments that you, as a C-bridge stockholder, receive in lieu of a
      fractional share of eXcelon common stock will be treated as if you had
      received the fractional share of eXcelon common stock in the merger and
      then eXcelon had repurchased the fractional share. Consequently, you will
      generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between your
      basis in the fractional share and the amount of cash that you receive;

    - your aggregate tax basis in the shares of eXcelon common stock that you
      receive in the merger in exchange for your shares of C-bridge common stock
      will be the same as your aggregate tax basis in your shares of C-bridge
      common stock;

    - your holding period for the shares of eXcelon common stock that you
      receive in the merger in exchange for your shares of C-bridge common stock
      will include your holding period for your shares of C-bridge common stock;
      and

    - none of eXcelon, Comet Acquisition Corp., C-bridge, or any stockholder of
      eXcelon, will recognize any gain or loss as a result of the merger.

                COMPARISON OF THE RIGHTS OF EXCELON STOCKHOLDERS
                           AND C-BRIDGE STOCKHOLDERS

    Upon completion of the merger, stockholders of C-bridge will become
stockholders of eXcelon. As eXcelon stockholders, the rights of former C-bridge
stockholders will be governed by eXcelon's amended and restated by-laws and
amended and restated certificate of incorporation. The rights of eXcelon
stockholders differ in some material respects from the rights of C-bridge's
stockholders under C-bridge's amended and restated by-laws and second amended
and restated certificate of incorporation. Each of C-bridge and eXcelon is
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware; as a result, the rights of
C-bridge stockholders who become eXcelon stockholders will continue to be
governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law.

    The following is a summary comparison of the material differences between
the rights of the C-bridge stockholders and the eXcelon stockholders. This
section does not contain a complete description of the specific rights of the
C-bridge stockholders and the eXcelon stockholders, nor does it contain a
complete description of the differences among the respective rights of C-bridge
stockholders and eXcelon stockholders. In addition, this discussion is not
intended to indicate that other differences in the respective rights of C-bridge
and eXcelon stockholders do not exist. eXcelon's amended and restated by-laws
and amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the specific
provisions of these documents, and not this summary, determine the rights and
obligations of the parties. You should read these documents and the other
documents we refer to carefully for a more complete understanding of the
differences between eXcelon common stock and C-bridge common stock. You may
obtain the information incorporated by reference into this prospectus/proxy
statement without charge by following the instructions in the section entitled
"Where You Can Find More Information" on page 1.

AUTHORIZED CAPITAL STOCK

    The C-bridge charter authorizes the issuance of up to 55,000,000 shares of
all classes of C-bridge capital stock, consisting of 50,000,000 shares of
C-bridge common stock, $0.01 par value per share, and 5,000,000 shares of
C-bridge preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share.

    The eXcelon charter authorizes the issuance of up to 205,000,000 shares of
eXcelon capital stock, consisting of 200,000,000 shares of eXcelon common stock,
$0.001 par value per share and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par
value per share.

VOTING RIGHTS

    Both C-bridge's and eXcelon's respective certificates of incorporation
provide that each share of common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all
matters to be voted on by the stockholders. In addition, both certificates of
incorporation provide that the preferred stock will have such voting rights as
the respective boards of directors may determine by resolution.

NUMBER OF DIRECTORS

    The number of directors on the C-bridge board is established by board
resolution. C-bridge's charter requires that the number of directors be three or
more.

    The number of directors on the eXcelon board is established by board
resolution. eXcelon's by-laws require that the number of directors be not less
than two nor more than nine.

ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

    Election of both the C-bridge and eXcelon boards of directors occurs at the
annual meeting of stockholders. The nominees receiving the highest number of
votes cast for the number of director positions to be filled are elected.
Neither C-bridge's nor eXcelon's certificate of incorporation or by-laws provide
for cumulative voting.

    The eXcelon board of directors, unlike the C-bridge board, is a classified
board. This means that only a designated number of directors is elected each
year. eXcelon's board is divided into three classes of directors, with each
director elected to a three-year term, and only one class of directors stands
for election each year.

REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS

    Both C-bridge's and eXcelon's by-laws provide that directors may only be
removed for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the
shares of capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote for the
election of directors.

VACANCIES

    Vacancies and newly created directorships on the boards of C-bridge and
eXcelon may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors, even if not a
quorum, or by the sole remaining director. A director elected to fill a vacancy
on either the C-bridge or eXcelon board will be elected for the unexpired term
of his predecessor in office. A director chosen to fill a position resulting
from an increase in the number of C-bridge directors will hold office until the
next election of directors. A director chosen to fill a position resulting from
an increase in the number of eXcelon directors will hold office until the next
election of the class for which the director has been chosen.

INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

    C-bridge's charter provides for indemnification of its directors and
officers in accordance with and to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware
General Corporation Law, as it currently exists and as it may be amended. In
addition, the C-bridge charter specifically provides that C-bridge will
indemnify directors and officers for actions taken in good faith and in a manner
they reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of
C-bridge and, with respect to any criminal proceedings, actions that the
director or officer had no reasonable cause to believe were unlawful. If an
action is brought by or on behalf of C-bridge, and the indemnified officer or
director is adjudged to be liable to C-bridge, then no indemnification will be
made, unless the Delaware Court of Chancery determines that the person is fairly
and reasonably entitled to indemnification. The C-bridge charter also authorizes
advancement of expenses incurred in defending any action upon receipt of an
undertaking by the director or officer to repay the amount advanced if it is
ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to indemnification.

    eXcelon's charter provides for indemnification to the fullest extent
permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, the Delaware
General Corporation Law provides that a corporation may indemnify directors and
officers for actions taken in good faith and in a manner they reasonably
believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation and,
with respect to any criminal proceedings, for actions they had no reasonable
cause to believe were unlawful. In addition, the Delaware General Corporation
Law provides that a corporation may advance to a director or officer expenses
incurred in defending any action upon receipt of an undertaking by the director
or officer to repay the amount advanced if it is ultimately determined that he
or she is not entitled to indemnification.

LIMITATION OF DIRECTOR LIABILITY

    The C-bridge and eXcelon charters limit the liability of their respective
directors for monetary damages to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware
General Corporation Law, as it currently exists and as it may be amended.
Generally, the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that a corporation may
include in its certificate of incorporation a provision limiting or eliminating
the liabilities of its directors to the corporation and its stockholders for
monetary damages arising from a breach of fiduciary duty, except for:

    - a breach of the duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders;

    - acts or omissions not made in good faith or which involve intentional
      misconduct or a knowing violation of law;

    - payment of a dividend or the repurchase or redemption of stock in
      violation of the Delaware General Corporation Law; or

    - any transaction from which the director derived any personal benefit.

SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

    Special meetings of C-bridge's stockholders may be called at any time by the
Chairman of the Board of Directors, the President, or the board of directors.

    Special meetings of eXcelon's stockholders may be called by the President,
and shall be called by the President or Secretary at the request in writing of a
majority of the eXcelon board.

ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT

    C-bridge's and eXcelon's by-laws both provide that stockholders may not act
by written consent in lieu of a stockholder meeting.

AMENDMENTS TO CHARTER

    Both the C-bridge and eXcelon charters reserve for each company the right to
amend the charter pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under the
Delaware General Corporation Law, an amendment to the certificate of
incorporation of a corporation requires the approval of the corporation's board
of directors and the approval of holders of a majority of the outstanding stock
entitled to vote upon the proposed amendment. Certain provisions of each
company's charter can only be amended with the affirmative vote of the holders
of 75% of the shares of such company's capital stock issued and outstanding.

    In addition, the C-bridge charter requires the affirmative vote of the
holders of 75% of the shares of C-bridge capital stock issued and outstanding to
repeal, amend or adopt any provision of the charter relating to the number of
directors, election of directors, terms of office, quorum requirements, removal
of directors, vacancies on the board of directors or stockholder nominations of
directors. The eXcelon charter does not contain similar requirements.

AMENDMENTS TO BY-LAWS

    Amendment of C-bridge's or eXcelon's by-laws may be made at a regular or
special meeting of their respective boards or stockholders. Board action to
amend either company's by-laws requires the affirmative vote of a majority of
the board of directors at a meeting at which a quorum is present.

    Stockholder action to amend C-bridge's by-laws requires that notice of the
proposed amendment be given along with notice of the meeting, as well as the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote for the election of directors. The C-bridge
by-laws

also require the affirmative vote of the holders of 75% of the stock issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote for the election of directors to amend several
sections and articles of C-bridge's by-laws related to special meetings of the
stockholders, nomination of directors, notice of business at the annual meeting,
prohibition on action by the written consent of stockholders, the organization
of stockholder meetings, requirements for amending the by-laws, and provisions
relating to the directors of C-bridge.

    Stockholder action to amend eXcelon's by-laws also requires that notice of
the proposed amendment be given along with notice of the meeting. However, the
affirmative vote of 75% of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote
is required for any amendment to the by-laws by stockholder action.

                                 PROPOSAL TWO--
                   ADJOURNMENT OF THE EXCELON ANNUAL MEETING
                        AND THE C-BRIDGE SPECIAL MEETING

    If at the C-bridge special meeting the number of shares of C-bridge common
stock voting in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement is insufficient to
approve the merger under Delaware law, C-bridge's management intends to move to
adjourn the special meeting in order to enable the C-bridge board of directors
to solicit additional proxies in favor of the merger. In that event, C-bridge
will ask its stockholders to vote only upon the adjournment proposal, and not
upon the merger proposal.

    Similarly, if at the eXcelon annual meeting the number of shares of eXcelon
common stock voting in favor of the issuance of the eXcelon common stock in the
merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement is
insufficient to approve the proposal under Delaware law, eXcelon's management
intends to move to adjourn the annual meeting in order to enable the eXcelon
board of directors to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal. In
that event, eXcelon will ask its stockholders to vote only upon the adjournment
proposal, and not upon the other proposals described in this proxy
statement/prospectus.

    In the adjournment proposal, C-bridge and eXcelon are asking their
respective stockholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the
eXcelon board of directors or the C-bridge board of directors to vote in favor
of granting management the discretionary authority to adjourn the eXcelon annual
meeting or the C-bridge special meeting, as the case may be, and any later
adjournments of those meetings, in each case to a date or dates not later than
            , 2001, in order to enable the eXcelon board of directors or the
C-bridge board of directors, or both, as the case may be, to solicit additional
proxies in favor of the merger and the proposal to approve the merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. If the stockholders of
either company approve the adjournment proposal, management could adjourn the
meeting and any adjourned session of the meeting to a date or dates not later
than             , 2001 and use the additional time to solicit additional
proxies in favor of the merger or the proposal to approve the merger and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, as the case may be, including
the solicitation of proxies from stockholders that have previously voted against
the relevant proposal. Among other things, approval of the adjournment proposals
could mean that, even if eXcelon or C-bridge have received proxies representing
a sufficient number of votes against the merger-related proposals to defeat
them, eXcelon's management or C-bridge's management, or both, as the case may
be, could adjourn the eXcelon annual meeting or the C-bridge special meeting, or
both, as the case may be, without a vote on the merger proposals for up to
days and seek during that period to convince the holders of those shares to
change their votes to votes in favor of the proposals.

    Under C-bridge's bylaws, the adjournment proposal will require the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of C-bridge common
stock present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to
vote. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote
against the proposal. Under eXcelon's bylaws, the adjournment proposal will
require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of eXcelon common stock
cast at the meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not count as votes
cast for or against the proposal and, accordingly, will not affect the outcome
of the vote on the proposal.

    The C-bridge board of directors believes that if the number of shares of
C-bridge common stock voting in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement is
insufficient to approve the merger, it is in the best interests of the C-bridge
stockholders to enable the C-bridge board, for a limited period of time, to
continue to seek to obtain a sufficient number of additional votes in favor of
the merger to approve it.

    THE C-BRIDGE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT C-BRIDGE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE
FOR THE PROPOSAL TO GRANT MANAGEMENT THE DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY TO ADJOURN THE
SPECIAL MEETING TO A DATE OR DATES NOT LATER THAN               , 2001.

    The eXcelon board of directors believes that if the number of shares of
eXcelon common stock voting in favor of the issuance of the eXcelon common stock
in the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement is
insufficient to approve the proposal, it is in the best interests of the eXcelon
stockholders to enable the eXcelon board, for a limited period of time, to
continue to seek to obtain a sufficient number of additional votes in favor of
the proposal to approve it.

    THE EXCELON BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT EXCELON STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR
THE PROPOSAL TO GRANT MANAGEMENT THE DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY TO ADJOURN THE
ANNUAL MEETING TO A DATE OR DATES NOT LATER THAN               , 2001.

               EXCELON'S MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

    eXcelon develops, sells and supports two major product lines: its
business-to-business, or B2B, line of eXtensible Markup Language, or XML, based
software products and its Object Design line of object data management software
products. Using eXcelon's B2B products, companies are able to create
self-service applications running on the Internet or an intranet that can be
targeted to customers, suppliers, channel partners and employees, and that
enable companies to transact business more efficiently and effectively, improve
customer service and responsiveness and lower transaction costs. eXcelon's
Object Design products have been used extensively for over 12 years by companies
in the telecommunications and finance industries, and by independent software
vendors, and for over five years in electronic business, or e-business,
applications with demanding requirements for high-performance and scalable data
management solutions. Until 1999, eXcelon derived 100% of its revenues from its
Object Design line of database management software products. However, during
1999 and 2000, revenues from eXcelon's B2B software products line have grown
rapidly. During 2000, and the three months ended March 31, 2001, sales of B2B
products and services accounted for approximately 28% of eXcelon's total
revenues, up from less than 5% in 1999.

    eXcelon's B2B product line was introduced in 1999. Despite a significant
investment in and a rapid expansion of its B2B line of software products over
the past two years, the Object Design product line continues to contribute the
majority of eXcelon's revenues. eXcelon's Object Design product line generated
more than 70% of its revenues in 2000 and more than 90% of its revenues in 1999.

    eXcelon's revenues are derived from sales of licenses of its B2B and Object
Design software products, professional services and maintenance. eXcelon
generally licenses its software products on a perpetual basis. Maintenance is
generally billed annually in advance. eXcelon offers its eXcelon eSolutions and
its implementation and other professional services primarily on a
time-and-materials basis. eXcelon offers training on a fixed fee basis.

    eXcelon recognizes revenue in accordance with the provisions of AICPA
Statement of Position 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition." Revenue from
software license fees is recognized when there is evidence of an arrangement,
the product has been delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collection
of the related receivable is deemed probable by management. Revenue from sales
through distributors is recorded net of distributor commissions. Maintenance
revenue, including maintenance revenue bundled with the initial license fee, is
deferred and recognized ratably over the service period, generally one year.
Consulting and training service revenue is recognized as the services are
performed.

    eXcelon's cost of software revenues primarily includes royalties to third
parties for software used in eXcelon's software.

    eXcelon's cost of services revenues primarily includes salaries and related
expenses of its consulting and technical support personnel, and an allocation of
overhead and recruitment costs.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

    The following table shows eXcelon's consolidated financial data as a
percentage of its total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2000 and
2001.

                                                                 THREE MONTHS ENDED

COMPARISON OF THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2000 AND 2001

    TOTAL REVENUES.  eXcelon's total revenues decreased to $15.1 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2001 from $17.0 million for the same period for
2000. Revenues from eXcelon's B2B product line increased by 22.8%, to
$4.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001 from $3.6 million for the
same period for 2000. This increase was primarily due to eXcelon's increased
focus on selling and marketing of its B2B product line. Revenues from eXcelon's
Object Design product line decreased 20.0%, to $10.8 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2001 from $13.4 million for the same period for 2000.
This decrease was primarily due to eXcelon's investing greater marketing and
sales resources on its B2B product line instead of its Object Design product
line.

    SOFTWARE REVENUES.  Software revenues decreased 12.7% to $8.8 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2001 from $10.1 million for the same period in
2000. Software revenues from eXcelon's B2B product line decreased by 11.5%, to
$2.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001 from $2.6 million for the
same period for 2000. Software revenues from eXcelon's Object Design product
line decreased by 13.3%, to $6.5 million for the three months ended March 31,
2001 from $7.5 million for the same period for 2000. The decreases in software
revenues for both product lines can primarily be attributed to uncertain
economic conditions which resulted in an overall decrease in demand for
eXcelon's products as customers in the United States reduced or postponed
capital spending on information technology.

    SERVICES REVENUES.  Services revenues decreased to $6.3 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2001 from $6.9 million for the same period in 2000.
Services revenues from eXcelon's B2B product line increased by 100%, to
$2.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001 from $1.0 million for the
same period for 2000. This increase is due to higher demand for eXcelon's
consulting services related to new B2B customer deployments and to higher
maintenance revenues,

reflecting growth in eXcelon's installed base of products. Services revenues
from eXcelon's Object Design product line decreased by 26.4%, to $4.3 million
for the three months ended March 31, 2001 from $5.9 million for the same period
for 2000. This decrease results mainly from a decline in eXcelon's consulting
services, due primarily to a slowdown in data management customer deployments in
the United States.

    REVENUES FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.  Revenues from operations of
eXcelon's international subsidiaries increased as a percentage of eXcelon's
total revenues, to 61.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2001 compared with
48.5% for the same period in 2000. This overall shift in revenue to eXcelon's
international subsidiaries is largely attributed to continued growth in the
overseas markets coupled with uncertain United States economic conditions that
have resulted in lower capital investments within the United States.

    COST OF SOFTWARE.  Cost of software decreased 42.3% to $365,000 for the
three months ended March 31, 2001 compared to $633,000 for the same period in
2000 and decreased as a percent of software revenues to 4.2% from 6.3% for the
first three months of 2001 and 2000, respectively. This decrease in costs can be
associated with lower amortization costs on software purchased from third
parties, used primarily to develop eXcelon's B2B product line. In 2000,
approximately $700,000 of purchased technologies was written off as obsolete.

    COST OF SERVICES.  Cost of services decreased 5.2% to $3.6 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2001 from $3.8 million for the same period in 2000
and increased as a percent of services revenues to 56.4% from 54.2% for the
corresponding periods. The decrease in cost of services is attributable to the
reduction in the number of eXcelon's consulting personnel and related expenses
as a result of eXcelon's restructuring in the three months ended March 31, 2001.
The increase in cost of services as a percentage of revenues reflects lower
utilization of eXcelon's remaining consulting personnel, partially offset by
increased maintenance revenue.

    SELLING AND MARKETING.  Selling and marketing expenses increased 9.4% to
$10.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001 from $9.1 million for
the same period in 2000 and increased as a percentage of total revenues to 65.9%
from 53.5% for the same periods. The increase was primarily due to a non-cash
charge for amortization of unearned compensation relating to the acceleration of
vesting of employee stock options in the amount of approximately $705,000, as
well as a continued investment in the sales distribution channels and marketing
programs relating both to eXcelon's B2B product line and, to a lesser extent, to
eXcelon's Object Design product line. eXcelon expects selling and marketing
expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenues over the coming year to the
extent that eXcelon's selling and marketing efforts are successful in generating
increased revenues.

    RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.  Research and development expenses increased 19.6%
to $3.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001 from $3.0 million for
the same period in 2000 and increased as a percent of total revenues to 23.9%
from 17.8% for the same periods. The increase was primarily due to a non-cash
charge for amortization of unearned compensation relating to the acceleration of
vesting of employee stock options in the amount of approximately $422,000.

    GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE.  General and administrative expenses increased
34.3% to $2.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001 from
$1.5 million in 2000 and increased as a percentage of total revenues to 13.7%
from 9.0% for the same periods. This increase is primarily due to increased
headcount-related costs associated with a reorganization of the various support
groups within eXcelon. eXcelon expects general and administrative expense to
decrease in absolute dollars in the second quarter of 2001, and then stay at a
consistent level for the remainder of 2001.

    RESTRUCTURING CHARGE.  In January 2001, eXcelon reorganized its operations
and reduced its workforce by 45 employees, or approximately 10%. As a result,
eXcelon recorded a restructuring

charge in the amount of $745,000 in the three months ended March 31, 2001. All
of the charge relates to severance payments to employees whose employment was
terminated in the restructuring. At March 31, 2001, $156,000 of the severance
had yet to be paid, but is expected to be fully paid by December 31, 2001. As a
result of the restructuring, eXcelon expects a savings of approximately
$1.3 million per quarter of total expenses.

    OTHER INCOME.  Other income decreased 41.1%, to $200,000 for the three
months ended March 31, 2001 from $341,000 for the same period for 2000. The
decrease was largely the result of lower cash balances and investments.

    PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.  No income taxes were provided during the three
months ended March 31, 2001 and 2000 due to the net losses eXcelon incurred in
both periods.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

    At March 31, 2001, eXcelon's principal sources of liquidity included
$12.4 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and
$767,000 of long-term marketable securities. $175,000 of cash and cash
equivalents is restricted and is being held in a certificate of deposit with
Silicon Valley Bank as collateral for a security deposit on leased office space
in eXcelon's Burlington, Massachusetts location.

    Net cash used by eXcelon's operating activities was $3.2 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2001, as compared to $481,000 provided by operating
activities for the same period in 2000. The increase in cash used was primarily
due to a greater net loss of $4.3 million, which was only partially offset by
the non-cash charges for amortization of unearned compensation in the aggregate
amount of $1.1 million.

    eXcelon's investing activities provided $2.5 million of cash for the three
months ended March 31, 2001, as compared with cash provided by investing
activities of $132,000 for the same period in 2000. The increase in cash
provided was primarily attributable to the decrease of purchases of marketable
securities in the amount of $1.1 million in 2000, a $643,000 decrease in capital
expenditures and an increase of $600,000 in proceeds from the sale of marketable
securities.

    eXcelon's financing activities provided net cash of $36,000 for the three
months ended March 31, 2001, as compared to $1.1 million of cash provided by
financing activities in the same period in 2000. The decrease in cash provided
was primarily due to $1.1 million less in cash from stock option exercises
during the three months ended March 31, 2001 compared to the same period in
2000.

    eXcelon believes that its current cash, cash equivalents, marketable
securities and funds generated from operations, if any, will provide adequate
liquidity to meet its capital and operating requirements for the next twelve
months. If the merger is not consummated, eXcelon's failure to generate
sufficient revenues or, in the absence of sufficient revenues, failure to raise
additional capital or reduce certain discretionary spending could have a
material adverse effect on eXcelon's ability to continue as a going concern and
achieve its business objectives.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

    eXcelon faces exposure to market risks, primarily adverse movements in
foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. eXcelon has not
invested in derivative instruments or derivative commodity instruments. eXcelon
believes that the fair value of other financial instruments reflected in its
consolidated balance sheets does not represent a significant market risk due to
the nature of these instruments and their short-term maturities. eXcelon also
does not believe that its future earnings, fair values and/or cash flows are
subject to risk of material near term loss due to changes in market rates or
prices that eXcelon considers to be reasonably possible in the near term.
However, eXcelon's exposure to market risk may change over time as its business
practices evolve, and could in the future

materially adversely effect eXcelon's financial condition and results of
operations. eXcelon's primary exposure to market risk has been related to local
currency revenue and operating expenses in Europe and the Asia/Pacific region.

    FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT.  The carrying amounts reflected in the
consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
and accounts payable approximate fair value at the balance sheet date due to the
short maturities of these instruments.

    eXcelon's exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates
primarily to its investment portfolio. eXcelon has not used derivative financial
instruments in its investment portfolio. Information about eXcelon's investment
portfolio is set forth in Note C of Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Item 8 of eXcelon's Annual Report on Form 10-K and is
incorporated into this proxy statement/prospectus by reference.

    eXcelon maintains investment portfolio holdings of various issuers, types,
and maturities. These securities are classified as available for sale, and
consequently, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized
gains or losses included in stockholders' equity. Through March 31, 2001,
eXcelon has not experienced material losses on its investments. eXcelon places
its investments with high quality issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of
credit exposure to any one issuer. Given the short maturities and investment
grade quality of the portfolio holdings at March 31, 2001, a sharp rise in
interest rates should not have a material adverse impact on the fair value of
eXcelon's investment portfolio.

    FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK.  Fluctuations in exchange rates can adversely affect
eXcelon's results of operations and financial position. The financial statements
of eXcelon's international subsidiaries, all of whose functional currencies are
the local currency, are translated using exchange rates in effect at the end of
the period for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during the
period for results of operations. Foreign currency translation adjustments are
recorded as a separate component of stockholders' equity, and also are included
in reporting comprehensive income. eXcelon also engages in transactions
denominated in foreign currencies. Gains and losses from these transactions,
which as of March 31, 2001 have been immaterial, are reflected in the results of
operations. The impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on eXcelon's results
of operations and financial condition cannot accurately be predicted. eXcelon
does not currently engage in foreign currency hedging activities.

PROPOSAL TO ELECT A NEW BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMBINED COMPANY

    In this proposal, eXcelon is asking its stockholders to elect as directors
of eXcelon Robert M. Agate, Gerald B. Bay, Kevin J. Burns and Robert N. Goldman,
each of whom is currently a director of eXcelon, Joseph L. Badaracco, Jr.,
Joseph M. Bellini, and Raymond J. Lane, each of whom is currently a director of
C-bridge, and Jeffrey Horing, who is a nominee of the C-bridge board of
directors. These elections will be subject to the condition that they will not
become effective unless the merger becomes effective under Delaware law on or
before October 31, 2001.

    THE eXCELON BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT EXCELON STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR
THE PROPOSAL TO ELECT ROBERT M. AGATE, GERALD B. BAY, KEVIN J. BURNS, ROBERT N.
GOLDMAN, JOSEPH L. BADARACCO, JR., JOSEPH M. BELLINI, JEFFREY HORING AND RAYMOND
J. LANE AS DIRECTORS OF EXCELON IN THE CLASSES DESCRIBED ABOVE UPON THE
CONDITIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

    This proposal is subject to the approval by the eXcelon stockholders of the
issuance of eXcelon common stock in the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. If the eXcelon stockholders do not approve
the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the
eXcelon board will not present this proposal for a vote by the eXcelon
stockholders. Furthermore, if this proposal is presented to the eXcelon
stockholders and approved by them, the election of the new board of directors of
the combined company will only become effective if the merger is completed on or
before October 31, 2001.

    To facilitate the transition to the new board, each current director of
eXcelon has tendered a resignation that will become effective at the time of the
merger if and only if the following conditions are met:

    - the C-bridge stockholders approve and adopt the merger agreement;

    - the eXcelon stockholders approve the issuance of eXcelon common stock in
      the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
      agreement;

    - the eXcelon stockholders approve this proposal to elect a new board of
      directors of the combined company; and

    - the merger becomes effective on or before October 31, 2001.

    If the stockholders of either company fail to approve the merger, or if the
merger does not become effective on or before October 31, 2001, the resignations
of eXcelon's current directors will not become effective. In that case, three of
the four current directors of eXcelon, Gerald B. Bay, Kevin J. Burns and Robert
N. Goldman, will continue to serve as directors of eXcelon after the annual
meeting because their terms of office continue after the meeting. The term of
Robert M. Agate, eXcelon's sole current Class II director, will expire at the
eXcelon annual meeting, and eXcelon will schedule another stockholder meeting to
elect a Class II director. Robert M. Agate will nonetheless continue to serve as
a director until his successor has been duly elected and qualified. If the
merger becomes effective after October 31, 2001, the eXcelon board intends to
take appropriate action to increase the number of directors to eight, elect the
four C-bridge designees named above as directors of eXcelon and adjust the
composition of the classes of directors to correspond to the allocation
described above.

    If the eXcelon stockholders approve this proposal and the merger becomes
effective on or before October 31, 2001, then beginning on the date of the
merger Kevin J. Burns and Raymond J. Lane will serve as Class III directors and
their terms will expire at the annual meeting of eXcelon stockholders in 2002,
Robert M. Agate, Joseph L. Badaracco, Jr. and Gerald B. Bay will serve as
Class I directors and their terms will expire at the annual meeting of eXcelon
stockholders in 2003, and Robert N. Goldman, Joseph M. Bellini and Jeffrey
Horing will serve as Class II directors and their terms will expire at the
annual meeting of eXcelon stockholders in 2004. Each director will also serve
until his successor has been duly elected and qualified.

    Each of these individuals has agreed to serve if elected, and eXcelon has no
reason to believe that any of them will be unable to serve. If any of these
individuals is unable or declines to serve as a director at or before the time
of the annual meeting, proxies will be voted for such other nominee as is then
designated by eXcelon's board of directors and C-bridge's board of directors.

INTERIM COMPOSITION OF THE eXCELON BOARD

    As a result of the contingent nature of the foregoing proposal to elect a
new board of directors of the combined company, the proposal will not become
effective unless the merger is completed on or before October 31, 2001. Until
the merger is completed, the current directors of eXcelon will continue to
serve, in their respective current classes, as the members of eXcelon's board of
directors.

CLASSIFIED BOARD

    eXcelon's board of directors is divided into three classes. The members of a
different class of directors are elected each year at the annual meeting of
stockholders for a three-year term of office. Each director holds office until
the date of the third annual meeting following his or her election and until his
or her successor is elected and qualified or until he or she sooner dies,
resigns, is removed, or becomes disqualified.

COMMITTEES AND MEETINGS OF THE BOARD

    During 2000, eXcelon's board of directors met six times and acted by
unanimous written consent eight times. No director attended fewer than 75% of
the total number of meetings held by the board of directors and committees of
the board of directors on which he served.

    eXcelon has a compensation committee and an audit committee but does not
have a nominating committee or other committee performing similar functions. The
current members of the compensation committee are Messrs. Bay and Burns. The
compensation committee held five meetings during 2000 and acted twenty-one times
by unanimous written consent during that year. The current members of the audit
committee are Messrs. Bay, Burns and Agate. The audit committee met five times
during 2000.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

    eXcelon's compensation committee is currently composed of two non-employee
directors, Messrs. Bay and Burns. In 2000, no officer or employee of eXcelon
participated in deliberations of the compensation committee concerning the
compensation of eXcelon's executive officers. No executive officer of eXcelon
served during 2000 on the board of directors or compensation committee of any
company that had an executive officer who served on the board of directors or
compensation committee of eXcelon.

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

    Each non-employee director of eXcelon receives $2,500 for each board meeting
attended and $500 for each committee meeting attended. Each non-employee
director is reimbursed, upon request, for expenses incurred in attending
meetings. Directors who are employees of eXcelon are not paid any separate fees
for serving as directors.

    Under the provisions of eXcelon's 1996 Incentive and Nonqualified Stock
Option Plan, each new non-employee director elected to the eXcelon board of
directors, including three of the four new C-bridge representatives on the board
of directors of the combined company, will automatically receive a grant, upon
his or her initial election, of a fully-vested nonqualified option to purchase
15,000 shares of eXcelon common stock. In addition, immediately following each
annual meeting of stockholders of eXcelon or special meeting in lieu of the
annual meeting, each non-employee director re-elected at or remaining in office
after the meeting will automatically receive a grant of a fully-vested
nonqualified option to purchase 5,000 shares of eXcelon common stock. Each
nonqualified option granted to a non-employee director under this provision of
the stock option plan will expire on the tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
The exercise price of the nonqualified stock option will be equal to the fair
market value of the eXcelon common stock on the date of grant.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

    SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE.  The following table provides information for
2000, 1999 and 1998 concerning compensation paid to or accrued for eXcelon's
Chief Executive Officer and the four other most highly compensated executive
officers who were in office on December 31, 2000 and whose total annual salary
and bonus for 2000 exceeded $100,000.

    OPTION GRANTS IN LAST FISCAL YEAR.  The following table provides information
concerning stock options granted by eXcelon during 2000 to each of its named
executive officers.

    The options described in the following table have been granted under
eXcelon's 1996 Incentive and Nonqualified Stock Option Plan and eXcelon's 1997
Nonqualified Stock Option Plan. Each option vests as follows: 25% of the total
number of shares subject to the option vests one year after the date of grant,
and an additional 6.25% vests at the end of each three-month period thereafter
until the option is fully vested. All options were granted at fair market value
as determined by the compensation committee on the date of grant. In 2000,
eXcelon granted to employees options to purchase an aggregate of 4,383,050
shares of eXcelon common stock. The dollar amounts in the last two columns are
the result of calculations at the 5% and 10% appreciation rates prescribed by
the SEC and are not intended to predict possible future appreciation, if any, in
the price of the eXcelon common stock. Any gain to the optionees will result
only from an increase in the price of the eXcelon common stock after the date of
grant, which will benefit all stockholders proportionately.

Nasdaq National Market, less the applicable exercise price. These values were
not realized at the end of fiscal 2001 and may never be realized. Actual gains,
if any, on exercise will depend on the value of the eXcelon common stock on the

EXISTING EMPLOYMENT AND SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS

    This section summarizes eXcelon's employment and severance agreements with
its officers that were in effect before the proposed merger. In the case of
Robert N. Goldman, Satish Maripuri and Lacey P. Brandt, the agreements
summarized below will be replaced by new employment agreements effective upon
the consummation of the merger. For more information about Mr. Goldman's new
employment agreement, as well as agreements for Mr. Maripuri and Ms. Brandt, see
"Related Agreements--Employment agreements."

    In November 1995, eXcelon executed an employment agreement with Robert N.
Goldman. eXcelon agreed to employ Mr. Goldman as President and Chief Executive
Officer at an annual salary of at least $190,000. Under this agreement, if
Mr. Goldman's employment was terminated by eXcelon for any reason other than
just cause, death or permanent disability, the agreement required eXcelon to

continue to pay Mr. Goldman's salary for a period of twelve months after
termination, offset by any amounts received by Mr. Goldman from subsequent
employment during that period.

    In November 1998, the employment agreement with Mr. Goldman was amended. The
amended agreement provides that if Mr. Goldman's employment is terminated by
eXcelon for any reason other than just cause or following a change in control,
each as defined in the employment agreement, eXcelon will pay his salary and
medical benefits for twelve months and 100% of his target bonus for the year in
which the termination occurs. The amended agreement also provides that in the
event of termination following a change in control, as defined in the agreement,
eXcelon will pay Mr. Goldman twenty-four months' salary and medical benefits and
200% of his target bonus for the year in which the termination occurs, and any
outstanding options held by Mr. Goldman will become fully vested.

    eXcelon has also entered into agreements with Messrs. O'Connor, Otis,
Hinchcliffe and Maripuri and with Ms. Brandt which provide, in the event of
termination following a change in control, for payment of twelve months' salary
and medical benefits and 100% of target bonus for the year in which the
termination occurs, and full vesting of any outstanding options held by such
individuals.

    In connection with their employment by eXcelon, these officers executed
eXcelon's standard non-competition, non-disclosure and developments agreement.
These agreements contain covenants prohibiting the improper disclosure of
confidential information at any time, as well as provisions assigning to eXcelon
all inventions made or conceived by the officer during his employment with
eXcelon. Each officer agreed with eXcelon that, with some exceptions, until one
year after the termination of his employment with eXcelon, he would not
participate in any capacity in any business activities competitive with those of
eXcelon. Each officer further agreed not to participate in any capacity in
soliciting the business of any customers or the services of any employees of
eXcelon during that one-year period.

    eXcelon has entered into severance agreements with Messrs. O'Connor, Otis
and Hinchcliffe. Mr. O'Connor resigned as Senior Vice President, Business
Development and as an executive officer of eXcelon effective January 22, 2001.
Under the terms of the agreement entered into in connection with his resignation
from eXcelon, Mr. O'Connor received $115,269 of severance payable in
installments over a period of seven and one-half months. Mr. Otis resigned as
Senior Vice President, Operations and as an executive officer of eXcelon
effective March 30, 2001. Under the terms of the agreement entered into in
connection with his resignation from eXcelon, Mr. Otis received $236,250 of
severance compensation, of which $90,000 was paid on March 30, 2001 and $146,250
is payable in twenty-four equal monthly installments, beginning April 1, 2001.
Mr. Hinchcliffe resigned as Vice President, Worldwide Sales and as an executive
officer of eXcelon effective April 17, 2001. Under the terms of the agreement
entered into in connection with his resignation from eXcelon, Mr. Hinchcliffe
received $233,333 of severance compensation payable in equal monthly
installments over a period of twelve months.

LOAN TO EXECUTIVE OFFICER

    In 1996, eXcelon loaned Robert N. Goldman, the Chairman of the Board and the
Chief Executive Officer of eXcelon, $572,700 in connection with the exercise of
stock options granted to him under eXcelon's 1995 Nonqualified Stock Option Plan
to purchase 2,300,000 shares of eXcelon common stock. The loan to Mr. Goldman
was at a simple interest rate of 7.0% per annum and was made in accordance with
the terms of a full recourse promissory note due upon the earlier of April 1,
2001 or the date Mr. Goldman's employment with eXcelon terminates for any
reason. The loan was originally secured by a pledge to eXcelon of all the shares
of eXcelon common stock acquired upon exercise of the option. On January 29,
1997, eXcelon released 2,048,950 shares from Mr. Goldman's pledge, leaving
251,050 shares pledged to secure the outstanding amount of principal and
interest of the loan to Mr. Goldman. On March 28, 2001, the eXcelon board of
directors voted to amend Mr. Goldman's

promissory note in order to extend its due date to the earlier of April 1, 2002
or the date Mr. Goldman's employment with eXcelon terminates for any reason.
eXcelon's board of directors has voted to forgive, upon consummation of the
merger, the total outstanding principal and accrued interest owing under the
note, which will be approximately $780,272, and to pay some of the tax
liabilities incurred by Mr. Goldman as a result of the loan forgiveness. See
"The Merger--Interests of eXcelon's management and certain stockholders in the
merger--Additional compensation to Robert N. Goldman."

                     REPORT OF THE EXCELON AUDIT COMMITTEE

    The eXcelon board of directors has appointed an audit committee to monitor
eXcelon's corporate financial reporting and its internal and external audits, to
approve certain expenditures by eXcelon, to approve policies relating to
internal controls, to report the results of its examinations to the board and
make related recommendations, to outline for the board improvements to eXcelon's
internal accounting controls, to nominate independent auditors and otherwise to
provide guidance to the board regarding significant financial matters. The audit
committee also makes recommendations to the board regarding other matters that
the board may assign to the committee. The audit committee is governed by a
written charter adopted by the board of directors. A copy of the charter is
attached to this proxy statement as Annex D.

    The audit committee currently consists of three non-employee directors. Each
member of the audit committee is "independent" and is "financially
sophisticated" within the meaning of the Nasdaq Stock Market's marketplace
rules.

    eXcelon's management is responsible for the financial reporting process,
including the system of internal controls, and for the preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
eXcelon's independent auditors are responsible for auditing those financial
statements. The responsibility of the audit committee is to monitor and review
these processes. However, the members of the audit committee are not
professionally engaged in the practice of accounting or auditing and are not
experts in the fields of accounting or auditing, including with respect to
auditor independence. The audit committee has relied, without independent
verification, on the information provided to it and on the representations made
by eXcelon's management and independent auditors.

    In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the audit committee discussed
with representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, eXcelon's independent
auditors for 2000, the overall scope and plans for their audit of eXcelon's
financial statements for 2000. The audit committee met with them, with and
without eXcelon's management present, to discuss the results of their
examinations and their evaluations of eXcelon's internal controls and the
overall quality of eXcelon's financial reporting.

    The audit committee reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements
for fiscal 2000 with management and the independent auditors.

    The audit committee discussed with the independent auditors the matters
required to be discussed by Statement of Auditing Standards No. 61,
COMMUNICATION WITH AUDIT COMMITTEES, as amended, including a discussion of their
judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of eXcelon's accounting
principles and the other matters required to be discussed with audit committees
under generally accepted auditing standards.

    In addition, the audit committee received from the independent auditors a
letter containing the written disclosures required by Independence Standards
Board Standard No. 1, INDEPENDENCE DISCUSSIONS WITH AUDIT COMMITTEES, and
discussed the disclosures with them, as well as other matters relevant to their
independence from management and eXcelon. In evaluating the independence of
eXcelon's auditors, the audit committee considered whether the services the
auditors provided to

eXcelon beyond their audit and review of eXcelon's financial statements was
compatible with maintaining their independence. The audit committee also
considered the amount of fees they received for audit and non-audit services.

    Based on the audit committee's review and these meetings, discussions and
reports, and subject to the limitations on the audit committee's role and
responsibilities referred to above and in the audit committee charter, the
eXcelon audit committee recommended to the board of directors that eXcelon's
audited financial statements for 2000 be included in eXcelon's annual report on
Form 10-K. The audit committee also recommended to the board of directors that
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP be selected as eXcelon's independent auditors for
2001.

                  REPORT OF THE EXCELON COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

    The compensation committee of eXcelon's board of directors determines the
remuneration and benefits of eXcelon's executive officers and other senior
management, administers eXcelon's stock option plans and employee stock purchase
plan, and acts in an advisory capacity to the board of directors concerning
other compensation issues.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

    COMPENSATION POLICY.  The compensation committee's policy with respect to
compensation of eXcelon's Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers
includes several elements:

    - the payment of competitive base salaries to attract and retain highly
      qualified personnel;

    - the use of incentive compensation in the form of cash bonuses to reward
      the achievement of eXcelon's financial objectives, such as achievement of
      budgeted expense and profitability levels, as well as technical and market
      development goals;

    - in appropriate instances, the payment of sales-based commissions to reward
      contributions to revenue growth;

    - the granting of stock options to maintain competitive levels of total
      compensation, to assist eXcelon in recruiting and retaining personnel, as
      well as to align management's interests with those of stockholders and to
      motivate executives to pursue eXcelon's long-term success; and

    - the use of executive employment agreements containing provisions intended
      to attract and retain highly qualified personnel.

    The committee intends that eXcelon's executive compensation policies be
straightforward, easily communicated to and understood by employees and
stockholders, and structured so that the achievement of company and individual
goals can be readily measured.

    BASE SALARIES.  The compensation committee establishes competitive base
salaries by relying on published industry surveys and targeted peer company
surveys that examine the compensation practices of other companies in the
software industry, as well as other high technology companies in the relevant
geographic area that might compete with eXcelon in hiring or retaining strong
performers. The committee, using the collected data and applying the members'
collective experience in recruiting and managing in a technical environment,
seeks to establish base salaries that take into account not only competitive
factors but also the breadth of experience and recent individual performance of
the executive. The committee's objective is not to determine compensation
levels, in general or for specific positions, by seeking to achieve a specific
percentile rank in comparison to competitors or peers, but rather to fix
compensation levels on a case-by-case basis guided by management's
recommendations and the committee members' experience and judgment. eXcelon's
Chief Executive Officer, Robert N. Goldman, was paid a base salary of $250,000
in 2000 and $210,000 in 1999.

    INCENTIVE COMPENSATION.  In establishing executive bonus levels, the
compensation committee begins by reviewing management's annual strategic and
financial plan, as approved by the board of directors at the beginning of the
year, including eXcelon's financial goals and individual performance goals
proposed by eXcelon's Chief Executive Officer. The committee establishes at that
time the maximum bonus for which executive officers, other than the Chief
Executive Officer, are eligible. The maximum bonus is a percentage of the
officer's annual base salary and generally ranges from 0% to 50%. The committee
then determines the percentage of this amount, if any, to be paid to the
executive officer as a bonus at the end of the year based on the performance of
both eXcelon and the executive. The compensation committee determines the Chief
Executive Officer's bonus based on the attainment of goals jointly developed and
agreed upon between the committee and the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief
Executive Officer's bonus is not fixed as a specific percentage of his base
salary. After the end of

the year, the Chief Executive Officer presents to the committee an analysis of
the performance of the individual executives against eXcelon's overall corporate
financial goals and the personal goals of the executives, together with his
recommendations concerning specific management bonuses. After reviewing these
recommendations, the committee determines whether, and in what amounts, to award
bonuses to the Chief Executive Officer and the other executive officers.

    During 2000, Mr. Goldman received cash bonuses of $175,000; Mr. Otis
received cash bonuses of $63,000; Mr. Hinchcliffe received cash bonuses of
$9,000; Mr. Maripuri received cash bonuses of $14,000; and Mr. O'Connor received
cash bonuses of $56,000.

    STOCK OPTIONS.  The compensation committee believes that stock options are
an important element of eXcelon's executive compensation program, not only to
enable eXcelon to compete effectively in recruiting and retaining employees, but
also in order to align the interests of management with those of eXcelon's
stockholders. In granting options, the committee considers, among other factors,
competitive conditions, the executive's experience, responsibilities and
performance, the sizes of other individual grants and the total number of
options outstanding. Option grants are awarded to all executive officers at the
time they are hired, and additional options may be granted during the term of
employment based upon specific individual or corporate achievements.

    For 2000, Mr. Goldman was granted 300,000 options at an exercise price of
$13.13 per share and 300,000 options at an exercise price of $4.44 per share;
Mr. Maripuri was granted 500,000 options at an exercise price of $4.44 per
share.

POLICY REGARDING SECTION 162(M) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE

    Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits eXcelon's ability to
deduct on its federal income tax return compensation in excess of $1.0 million
paid to its Chief Executive Officer and its four other most highly compensated
officers in any fiscal year, unless the compensation qualifies as
"performance-based compensation." The compensation committee's policy with
respect of Section 162(m) is to make every reasonable effort to cause
compensation to be deductible by eXcelon while simultaneously providing
eXcelon's executive officers with appropriate rewards for their performance. The
base salaries and bonuses of eXcelon's individual executive officers have not
historically exceeded, the $1.0 million limit, and options received by executive
officers under eXcelon's 1996 stock option plan are intended to qualify as
performance-based compensation. Though options granted under eXcelon's 1997
stock option plan do not qualify as performance-based compensation, the
compensation committee, as a matter of policy, does not grant options under that
plan to officers of eXcelon.

PERFORMANCE GRAPH

    The following performance graph compares the performance of eXcelon's
cumulative stockholder return with that of a broad market index, the Nasdaq
Stock Market Index for U.S. Companies, and a published industry index, the J.P.
Morgan H&Q Technology Index, formerly known as the Hambrecht & Quist Technology
Index. The cumulative stockholder returns for shares of eXcelon common stock and
for the market and industry indices are calculated assuming $100 was invested on
July 23, 1996, the date on which the eXcelon common stock commenced trading on
the Nasdaq National Market, and assuming shares of eXcelon common stock were
purchased at the initial public offering price. eXcelon paid no cash dividends
during the periods shown. The performance of the market and industry indices is
shown on a total return, or dividend reinvested, basis.

                            AMENDMENT TO THE EXCELON
                       1996 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

    This proposal may only be voted upon by eXcelon stockholders. C-bridge
stockholders are not entitled to vote on this proposal.

    On June 8, 2001, eXcelon's board voted to amend eXcelon's 1996 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares that may be issued under
the plan from 700,000 shares to 2,200,000 shares and to submit that amendment to
eXcelon's stockholders for their approval.

    THE EXCELON BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT EXCELON STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR
THE PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE AMENDMENT TO THE 1996 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN.

BACKGROUND

    In 1996, eXcelon's board of directors adopted, and its stockholders
approved, the eXcelon 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The plan is intended to
qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" under Section 423 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 and to provide employees of eXcelon with an

opportunity to increase their ownership interest in eXcelon through the purchase
of shares of eXcelon common stock.

    The stock purchase plan, as initially approved by the stockholders of
eXcelon on May 23, 1996, included 300,000 shares of eXcelon common stock. The
board increased the number of shares included in the plan to 500,000 on
February 23, 1999 and 700,000 on February 29, 2000. On each occasion, eXcelon's
stockholders subsequently approved the increase. As of June 4, 2001, there were
only 160,378 shares of eXcelon common stock that remained available for purchase
under the plan.

PROPOSED AMENDMENT OF THE 1996 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

    On June 8, 2001, eXcelon's board voted to amend the plan to increase the
number of shares included in the plan from 700,000 shares to 2,200,000 shares
and to submit that amendment to eXcelon's stockholders for their approval.

    eXcelon believes that the availability of an employee stock purchase plan is
important to the combined Company's ability to recruit and retain qualified
employees. In 1999, eXcelon issued 157,267 shares of common stock under the
plan, and in 2000, it issued 89,208 shares under the plan. As of June 4, 2001,
only 160,378 shares of common stock were available for purchase under the plan.
The eXcelon board believes that this number of shares is insufficient to
accommodate either its current employees or the substantial number of new
employees that are expected to join eXcelon in connection with the proposed
merger with C-bridge. The board of directors believes that, in the current
competitive environment for highly skilled employees, the proposed amendment is
necessary to enable eXcelon to provide appropriate long-term incentives to its
employees and to recruit and retain additional highly skilled employees to
support the growth of eXcelon's business, including the new employees that are
expected to join eXcelon in connection with the proposed merger with C-bridge.

    THE EXCELON BOARD OF DIRECTORS THEREFORE RECOMMENDS THAT EXCELON
STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN.

DESCRIPTION OF THE 1996 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

    The stock purchase plan is administered by the compensation committee of the
board of directors. Under the plan, up to 700,000 shares of eXcelon common stock
may be purchased at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the eXcelon
common stock on the first day or the last day of each six-month offering period.
Employees may elect to have up to 6% of their base pay withheld and applied
toward the purchase of shares in each offering.

    Participation in the stock purchase plan is voluntary. Participation in one
or more offerings under the plan neither limits nor requires participation in
any other offering. Generally, each employee of eXcelon is eligible to
participate in the plan on the first offering commencement date that follows the
completion of six months of continuous service with eXcelon. As of June 4, 2001,
approximately 308 employees of eXcelon and its subsidiaries were eligible to
participate in the plan.

    An employee will not be granted an option under the stock purchase plan if,
immediately after the grant, the employee would own stock, and/or hold
outstanding options to purchase stock, possessing 5% or more of the total
combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of eXcelon or any
subsidiary of eXcelon, as determined under rules established under
Section 424(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, an employee will not
be granted an option under the plan which permits the employee's rights to
purchase stock under all Section 423 employee stock purchase plans of eXcelon
and its subsidiaries to exceed $25,000 of the fair market value of the eXcelon
common stock for each calendar year in which the option is outstanding, as
determined under rules established under Section 423(b)(8) of the Internal
Revenue Code. For purposes of this test, fair market value is determined at the
time the option is granted.

    Any eligible employee may become a participant by completing a payroll
deduction authorization form provided by eXcelon and filing it with eXcelon's
Treasurer 20 days before the applicable offering commencement date, as
determined by the compensation committee. When a participant files the
authorization form, he or she elects to have deductions made from his or her pay
on each payday during any offering in which he or she is a participant, at a
specified percentage of his or her compensation as determined on the applicable
offering commencement date. Each employee's specified percentage must be in
increments of 1% and may not exceed 6%. A participant's payroll deductions begin
on the offering commencement date when the applicable authorization for a
payroll deduction becomes effective and end on the offering termination date of
the offering to which the authorization applies, unless sooner terminated by the
participant. All of a participant's payroll deductions are credited to his or
her account under the stock purchase plan. A participant may not make any
separate cash payment into his or her account. No interest will be paid or
allowed on any money paid into the plan or credited to the account of any
participant.

    Any participant may withdraw from the stock purchase plan at any time during
the applicable offering period. A participant may withdraw the payroll
deductions credited to his or her account under the stock purchase plan for the
offering by giving written notice to the Treasurer of eXcelon. All of the
participant's payroll deductions credited to his or her account will be paid,
without interest, to the participant promptly after receipt of notice of
withdrawal, and no future payroll deductions will be made from his or her pay
during that offering. eXcelon will treat any attempt by a participant to borrow
on the security of accumulated payroll deductions as an election to withdraw
those deductions. A participant's election not to participate in, or withdrawal
from, any offering will not have any effect upon his or her eligibility to
participate in any subsequent offering or in any similar plan adopted by
eXcelon.

    If a participant's employment is terminated for any reason other than death,
the payroll deductions credited to his or her account will be returned to the
participant. If a participant dies, his or her beneficiary may elect either to
withdraw all of the payroll deductions credited to the participant's account
under the plan or to exercise the participant's option under the plan. To make
this election, the beneficiary must give written notice of the election to
eXcelon's Treasurer within 90 days of the death of the participant. If the
beneficiary elects to exercise the participant's option under the plan, the
beneficiary will be able to purchase, on the offering termination date next
following the participant's death, the number of shares of common stock which
the accumulated payroll deductions in the participant's account at the
participant's death will purchase at the applicable option price, and any excess
in the account will be returned to the beneficiary. If eXcelon's Treasurer does
not receive written notice of the election in a timely manner, the beneficiary
will be deemed to have elected to withdraw the payroll deductions credited to
the participant's account.

    On the offering commencement date of each offering, a participant will be
deemed to have been granted an option to purchase a maximum number of shares of
common stock. The maximum number equals two multiplied by:

    - the sum of (1) the percentage of the employee's compensation which he or
      she has elected to have withheld, multiplied by the employee's
      compensation over the offering period, and (2) any amounts in the
      employee's account on the offering commencement date that have been
      carried forward from prior offerings;

    - divided by 85% of the fair market value per share of eXcelon common stock
      on the applicable offering commencement date.

    The option price of the eXcelon common stock purchased with payroll
deductions made during each offering is the lower of 85% of the fair market
value of the eXcelon common stock on the offering commencement date or 85% of
the fair market value of the eXcelon common stock on the offering termination
date. For this purpose, fair market value means the average of the bid and asked

prices as reported by Nasdaq in the Wall Street Journal, or, if Nasdaq has
designated the stock as a Nasdaq National Market security, the last trading
price of the stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market in the Wall Street
Journal, or, if the stock is listed on an exchange, the closing price of the
stock on the exchange. If the common stock is not quoted on Nasdaq, not
designated as a Nasdaq National Market security and not listed on an exchange,
fair market value will be determined by the compensation committee. If the
eXcelon common stock is not traded on the offering commencement date or the
offering termination date, fair market value will be determined on the next
regular trading day for the stock. On June 13, 2001, the last sale price of the
eXcelon common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market was $1.64.

    On the offering termination date, a participant's option under the plan will
be deemed to have been exercised automatically to purchase the number of shares
of eXcelon common stock which the accumulated amounts in his or her account at
that time will purchase at the applicable option price. A participant may elect
otherwise by giving written notice to the Treasurer of eXcelon. If the total
number of shares for which options are exercised on any offering termination
date exceeds the number of shares available under the plan, eXcelon must
allocate the available shares to plan participants in an equitable manner and
must return to each participant any balance of payroll deductions credited to
the participant's account. The participant will have no interest in the stock
covered by his or her option until the option has been exercised.

    If there is any excess in the participant's account after the exercise, the
excess will be returned to the participant, except that any amounts in the
account which would have been used to purchase fractional shares will be
automatically carried forward to the next offering unless the participant elects
to have the excess returned to the participant. The participant may make this
election only by giving written notice to the Treasurer of eXcelon.

FUTURE AMENDMENTS TO THE 1996 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

    eXcelon's board of directors may amend or terminate the 1996 employee stock
purchase plan at any time and from time to time. No amendment may make any
change in any option previously granted under the plan that would adversely
affect the rights of any participant holding options under the plan. Termination
of the plan will not affect options previously granted under the plan.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO EXCELON AND THE PARTICIPANTS

    If an employee acquires shares of eXcelon common stock under the stock
purchase plan and does not dispose of them within two years after the
commencement of the offering in which the shares were acquired, nor within one
year after the date on which the shares were acquired, any gain realized upon
subsequent disposition will be taxable as a long-term capital gain, except that
the portion of the gain equal to the lesser of (a) the excess of the fair market
value of the shares on the date of disposition over the amount paid upon
purchase of the shares, or (b) the excess of the fair market value of the shares
on the offering commencement date over the amount paid upon purchase of the
shares, is taxable as ordinary income. eXcelon has no corresponding deduction.
If the employee disposes of the shares at a price less than the price that he or
she paid for the shares, the employee realizes no ordinary income and has a
long-term capital loss measured by the difference between the purchase price and
the selling price.

    If an employee disposes of shares acquired under the stock purchase plan
within two years after the offering commencement date of the offering in which
the shares were acquired, or within one year after the date on which the shares
were acquired, the difference between the purchase price and the fair market
value of the shares at the time of purchase will be taxable to him or her as
ordinary income in the year of disposition. In that event, eXcelon may deduct
from its gross income an amount equal to the amount treated as ordinary income
to each such employee. Any excess of the selling price over the

fair market value at the time the employee purchased the shares will be taxable
as long-term or short-term capital gain, depending upon the period for which the
shares were held. If any shares are disposed of within either the two-year
period or the one-year period at a price less than the fair market value at the
time of purchase, the employee will realize ordinary income equal to the
difference between the purchase price and the fair market value of the shares at
the time of purchase, and the employee will recognize a capital loss equal to
the difference between the fair market value of the shares at the time of
purchase and the selling price.

    If a participating employee dies while he or she owns shares acquired under
the stock purchase plan, ordinary income may be reportable on his or her final
income tax return.

    The 1996 stock purchase plan is not subject to the provisions of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, nor is the plan qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

    Although the foregoing summarizes the essential features of the stock
purchase plan, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of
the stock purchase plan, which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as
Annex E.

REGISTRATION OF SHARES INCLUDED IN THE 1996 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

    eXcelon has filed registration statements on Form S-8 to register the
700,000 shares of eXcelon common stock included in the stock purchase plan. If
the stockholders approve the proposed amendment to the plan, eXcelon intends to
file a registration statement on Form S-8 to register the additional 1,500,000
shares so approved. The board of directors has not determined what action it
will take if the stockholders do not approve the proposal.

SHARES PURCHASED TO DATE

    The following table provides information concerning shares issued under the
plan from its inception through June 4, 2001 to:

    - each named executive officer;

    - all current executive officers, as a group;

    - all current directors who are not executive officers, as a group;

    - each nominee for election as a director; and

    - all employees who are not executive officers, as a group.

    No person has received or is currently expected to receive five percent or
more of the total number of options available for grant under the plan, and
eXcelon is not aware that any associate of any executive officer, director or
director-nominee has received shares under the plan. The persons and groups
listed in the following table may receive additional shares under the plan.

                         AMENDMENT TO THE EXCELON 1996
                           INCENTIVE AND NONQUALIFIED
                               STOCK OPTION PLAN

    This proposal may only be voted upon by eXcelon stockholders. C-bridge
stockholders are not entitled to vote on this proposal.

    On June 8, 2001, eXcelon's board voted to amend eXcelon's 1996 Incentive and
Nonqualified Stock Option Plan to increase the number of shares included in the
plan from 4,700,000 shares to 7,700,000 shares and to submit that amendment to
eXcelon's stockholders for their approval.

    THE eXCELON BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT eXCELON STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR
THE PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE AMENDMENT TO THE 1996 INCENTIVE AND NONQUALIFIED
STOCK OPTION PLAN.

BACKGROUND

    In 1996, eXcelon's board of directors adopted, and its stockholders
approved, the eXcelon 1996 Incentive and Nonqualified Stock Option Plan. The
plan authorizes the grant of both incentive options and nonqualified options.
Incentive options are options to purchase eXcelon common stock intended to
qualify as "incentive stock options" under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue
Code. Nonqualified options are any options that do not meet the qualifications
of that section. The purpose of the plan is to provide a performance incentive
for officers and employees of eXcelon or its subsidiaries and for certain other
individuals providing services to or acting as directors of eXcelon or its
subsidiaries by enabling them to increase their ownership interest in eXcelon.

    The stock option plan, as initially approved by the stockholders of eXcelon
on May 23, 1996, included 1,200,000 shares of eXcelon common stock. The plan
provided that the number of shares included in the plan would be automatically
increased by 300,000 shares on each of the first five anniversaries of the date
of the initial stockholder approval, with the result that, as of May 23, 2001,
the plan included 2,700,000 shares.

    eXcelon's board increased the number of shares included in the stock option
plan by 1,000,000 shares on April 2, 1998 and by another 1,000,000 shares on
February 29, 2000. On each occasion,

eXcelon's stockholders subsequently approved the increase. As a result of these
amendments, as of June 4, 2001, the plan included 4,700,000 shares. As of
June 4, 2001, eXcelon had issued 201,150 shares of common stock under the plan
and had reserved 4,086,620 shares for issuance upon the exercise of options
outstanding under the plan. On that date, there were only 412,248 shares of
eXcelon common stock that remained available for the grant of options under the
plan. As of June 4, 2001, option prices and expiration dates for outstanding
options granted under the plan ranged from $1.96 to $13.13 per share and from
June 24, 2006 to May 14, 2011, respectively.

    In addition to the eXcelon 1996 Incentive and Nonqualified Stock Option
Plan, eXcelon's board of directors adopted the eXcelon 1997 Nonqualified Stock
Option Plan on April 22, 1997. The 1997 plan only authorizes the grant of
nonqualified options and includes 7,500,000 shares of eXcelon common stock. The
1997 plan was not submitted to eXcelon's stockholders for approval. Since the
adoption of the 1997 plan, the policy of eXcelon's compensation committee has
been to use the 1996 plan primarily to grant incentive and nonqualified stock
options to officers of eXcelon and to use the 1997 plan primarily to grant
options to employees who are not officers of eXcelon. The 1996 plan also
provides for automatic formula grants of nonqualified options to eXcelon's
outside directors.

PROPOSED AMENDMENT OF THE 1996 INCENTIVE AND NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTION PLAN

    On June 8, 2001, eXcelon's board voted to amend the 1996 plan to increase
the number of shares included in the plan by 3,000,000 shares to 7,700,000 and
to submit that amendment to eXcelon's stockholders for their approval. The
eXcelon board believes this increase is necessary not only to accommodate future
option grants to its existing employees, but also to provide for future option
grants to the substantial number of new employees that are expected to join
eXcelon in connection with the proposed merger with C-bridge.

    As stated above, long-term, equity-based compensation in the form of stock
options is a key element of eXcelon's executive compensation policy. In
addition, eXcelon believes that the availability of incentive options is
important to eXcelon's ability to recruit and retain qualified executives. As of
June 4, 2001, only 412,248 shares of eXcelon common stock are available for the
grant of options to officers and directors of eXcelon under the 1996 plan. The
provisions of the 1996 plan providing for automatic annual increases in the
number of shares included in the plan expired on May 23, 2001. In the current
competitive environment for senior executives, the eXcelon board believes that
the proposed amendment of the 1996 plan is necessary to enable eXcelon to
provide appropriate long-term incentives to members of its senior management and
to recruit and retain additional executives to support the growth of eXcelon's
business.

    In addition, the eXcelon board believes that, in many cases, the stock
options currently held by its employees are not providing adequate incentive to
those employees to pursue the best interests of eXcelon and its stockholders. As
of June 4, 2001, a substantial number of eXcelon's outstanding stock options
were "underwater," meaning that the fair market value of the eXcelon common
stock was below the exercise prices of those options.

    The following chart provides information regarding the number of eXcelon
stock options outstanding on June 4, 2001 and their exercise prices.

                       OUTSTANDING eXCELON STOCK OPTIONS

      RANGE OF                     NUMBER OF
   EXERCISE PRICE             OUTSTANDING OPTIONS
- ---------------------         -------------------

       $0.01 - $ 1.71                 416,507
        1.96 -   6.13               7,041,824
        6.19 -  22.63               3,506,717
                                   ----------
                                   10,965,048

    In the merger, eXcelon will assume all outstanding options to purchase
C-bridge common stock. Based on the number of C-bridge stock options outstanding
on June 4, 2001 and the exchange ratio of 1.2517 shares of eXcelon common stock
for each share of C-bridge common stock, eXcelon expects that it will assume
options to purchase 13,285,939 shares of eXcelon common stock. A substantial
number of these options are currently underwater and will likely be underwater
when they are assumed by eXcelon in the merger, based on the exercise prices
that these options will have following their assumption by eXcelon in the
merger.

    The following chart provides information regarding the number of C-bridge
stock options outstanding on June 4, 2001 and their exercise prices, in each
case adjusted to reflect the conversion of those options into options to
purchase eXcelon common stock.

                       OUTSTANDING C-BRIDGE STOCK OPTIONS

      RANGE OF                     NUMBER OF
   EXERCISE PRICE             OUTSTANDING OPTIONS
- ---------------------         -------------------

       $0.01 - $ 1.71               3,770,885
        1.83 -   6.74               6,415,536
        8.49 -  45.54               3,099,518
                                   ----------
                                   13,285,939

    On June 4, 2001, the closing price of the eXcelon common stock on the Nasdaq
National Market was $1.71. Accordingly, as of that date, outstanding eXcelon and
C-bridge options to purchase 20,063,595 shares of eXcelon common stock were
underwater, and outstanding eXcelon and C-bridge options to purchase only
4,187,392 shares of eXcelon common stock were in the money. As a result, the
eXcelon board believes that, in order to provide appropriate incentive
compensation to its current employees and other service providers, as well as
the new employees expected to join eXcelon as a result of the merger with
C-bridge, it will be necessary for the board and eXcelon's compensation
committee to have additional options available for grant to those employees and
service providers.

    THE eXCELON BOARD OF DIRECTORS THEREFORE RECOMMENDS THAT eXCELON
STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE 1996 STOCK OPTION PLAN.

DESCRIPTION OF THE 1996 INCENTIVE AND NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTION PLAN

    The 1996 stock option plan is currently administered by the compensation
committee of the board of directors. The plan may be administered by any
committee of the board of directors consisting of two or more outside directors.
Under the plan, an outside director is any director who:

    - is not an employee of eXcelon or of any affiliate of eXcelon;

    - is not a former employee of eXcelon or any affiliate of eXcelon who is
      receiving compensation for prior services during the taxable year of
      eXcelon or the affiliate, other than benefits under a tax-qualified
      retirement plan;

    - has not been an officer of eXcelon or any affiliate of eXcelon; and

    - does not receive remuneration from eXcelon or any affiliate of eXcelon,
      either directly or indirectly, in any capacity other than as a director.

    For this purpose, an affiliate is any company that is a member of an
"affiliated group" that includes eXcelon, as that term is defined in
Section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

    Except for the non-discretionary grant of options to directors who are not
employees, as described above under "Compensation of directors and executive
officers," the compensation committee selects the individuals who will receive
options under the plan and determines the exercise price and other terms of each
option, subject to the provisions of the plan. The compensation committee also
has the power to make changes to outstanding options under the plan, including
the power to reduce the exercise price, accelerate the vesting schedule and
extend the expiration date of any option.

    Under the plan, incentive options may be granted only to employees of
eXcelon or its subsidiaries, including officers and directors who are also
employees. Under the plan, nonqualified options may be granted to employees, as
well as officers and directors of eXcelon or a subsidiary, whether or not they
are employees of eXcelon or a subsidiary, and to consultants and other
individuals who provide services to eXcelon or a subsidiary. As of June 4, 2001,
approximately 344 employees and 3 directors were eligible to participate in the
plan. As described above, the current policy of the compensation committee is to
use the 1996 plan primarily to grant incentive and nonqualified stock options to
officers of eXcelon.

    The maximum term of options granted under the 1996 plan is ten years from
the date of grant, or five years from the date of grant in the case of incentive
options granted to employees or officers holding 10% or more of the total
combined voting power of all classes of stock of eXcelon or any subsidiary or
parent. For incentive options, the exercise price may not be less than the fair
market value of the eX
