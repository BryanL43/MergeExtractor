                    MERGER PROPOSAL--YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT

     The boards of directors of Pfizer Inc. and Pharmacia Corporation have
approved a merger designed to create the world's largest pharmaceutical company.
We believe the combined company will be able to create substantially more
shareholder value than could be achieved by either company individually.

     If the merger is completed, Pharmacia shareholders will receive 1.4 shares
of Pfizer common stock for each share of Pharmacia common stock, plus cash in
lieu of fractional shares. Each share of Pharmacia convertible perpetual
preferred stock will be exchanged for a newly created class of Pfizer
convertible perpetual preferred stock with substantially identical rights.
Pfizer shareholders will continue to own their existing Pfizer shares. We
estimate that Pfizer may issue up to 1.804 billion shares of Pfizer common stock
to Pharmacia shareholders. Upon completion of the merger, Pfizer's shareholders
will own approximately 77% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis, and
Pharmacia shareholders will own approximately 23% of the combined company on a
fully diluted basis. The shares of the combined company will be traded on the
New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "PFE."

      We are asking the PFIZER shareholders to approve the issuance of shares
 of Pfizer common stock in the merger and an amendment to the Pfizer
 certificate of incorporation. Pfizer's special meeting will be held:

                                     [DATE]

                                     [TIME]

                                    [PLACE]

      Pfizer's board of directors unanimously recommends that Pfizer
 shareholders vote FOR the issuance of shares of Pfizer common stock in the
 merger and the amendment to the Pfizer certificate of incorporation.

      We are asking the PHARMACIA shareholders to adopt the merger agreement.
 Pharmacia's special meeting will be held:

                                     [DATE]

                                     [TIME]

                                    [PLACE]

      Pharmacia's board of directors unanimously recommends that Pharmacia
 shareholders vote FOR the adoption of the merger agreement.

     We cannot complete the merger unless the shareholders of Pharmacia adopt
the merger agreement and the shareholders of Pfizer approve the issuance of
shares of Pfizer common stock in the merger and the amendment to the Pfizer
certificate of incorporation. YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT.

     We believe this merger will create a strong combined company that will
deliver important benefits to its shareholders and customers.

                                   THE MERGER

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q: WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?

A: After you carefully read this document, mail your signed proxy card in the
   enclosed return envelope, or submit your proxy by telephone or on the
   Internet, as soon as possible, so that your shares may be represented at your
   meeting. In order to assure that your vote is recorded, please vote your
   proxy as instructed on your proxy card even if you currently plan to attend
   your meeting in person.

Q: WHY IS MY VOTE IMPORTANT?

A: If you do not return your proxy card or submit your proxy by telephone or
   through the Internet or vote in person at your special meeting, it will be
   more difficult for Pfizer and Pharmacia to obtain the necessary quorum to
   hold their special meetings. In addition, if you are a Pfizer shareholder,
   your failure to vote will have the effect of reducing the number of
   affirmative votes required to approve the issuance of shares of Pfizer common
   stock in the merger and will have the same effect as a vote against the
   amendment to the Pfizer certificate of incorporation. If you are a Pharmacia
   shareholder, your failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote against
   the adoption of the merger agreement.

Q: IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY MY BROKER, WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY
   SHARES FOR ME?

A: No. If you do not provide your broker with instructions on how to vote your
   "street name" shares, your broker will not be permitted to vote them on
   either the adoption of the merger agreement by Pharmacia shareholders or
   approval of the issuance of shares of Pfizer common stock in the merger and
   amendment to the Pfizer certificate of incorporation by Pfizer shareholders.

   You should therefore be sure to provide your broker with instructions on how
   to vote your shares. Please check the voting form used by your broker to see
   if it offers telephone or Internet submission of proxies.

Q: WHAT IF I FAIL TO INSTRUCT MY BROKER?

A: If you fail to instruct your broker to vote your shares and the broker
   submits an unvoted proxy, the resulting broker "non-vote" will be counted
   toward a quorum at the respective special meeting, but it will otherwise have
   the consequences set forth above under "WHY IS MY VOTE IMPORTANT?"

Q: CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I HAVE MAILED MY PROXY CARD?

A: Yes. You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at your
   company's special meeting. You can do this in one of three ways:

   - timely delivery of a valid, later-dated proxy or a later-dated proxy by
     telephone or Internet;

   - written notice to your company's Secretary before the meeting that you have
     revoked your proxy; or

   - voting by ballot at either the Pfizer special meeting or the Pharmacia
     special meeting.

   If you have instructed a broker to vote your shares, you must follow
   directions from your broker to change those instructions.

Q: WHEN AND WHERE ARE THE SPECIAL MEETINGS?

A: The Pfizer special meeting will take place on [DATE] at [PLACE] at [TIME].
   The Pharmacia special meeting will take place on [DATE] at [PLACE] at [TIME].

Q: SHOULD I SEND IN MY STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW?

A: No. After the merger is completed, Pfizer will send Pharmacia shareholders
   written instructions for exchanging their stock certificates. Pfizer
   shareholders will keep their existing stock certificates.

                                       I-1

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

Q: WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE COMPLETED?

A: We are working to complete the merger by the end of 2002. However, it is
   possible that factors outside of our control could require us to complete the
   merger at a later time or not complete it at all. We hope to complete the
   merger as soon as reasonably practicable.

Q: WILL PFIZER SHAREHOLDERS RECEIVE ANY SHARES AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER?

A: No. Pfizer shareholders will continue to hold the Pfizer shares they
   currently own.

Q: WHO DO I CALL IF I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MEETINGS OR THE MERGER?

A: Pfizer shareholders may call [               ].

   Pharmacia shareholders may call [               ].

     This summary highlights selected information from this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and may not contain all of the information that is

THE COMPANIES (SEE PAGE      )

develops, manufactures and markets leading prescription medicines for humans and
animals as well as many of the world's best known consumer products. Pfizer

2000. The company's Norvasc(R), Zoloft(R), Zithromax(R), Viagra(R), Diflucan(R),
Neurontin(R), Lipitor(R), as well as Celebrex(R), which Pfizer co-promotes and
co-markets with Pharmacia, each had worldwide third-party sales exceeding $1
billion in 2001. Pfizer employs approximately 90,000 people worldwide. Pfizer
spent $4.8 billion on research and development in 2001.

Pharmacia Corporation
100 Route 206 North
Peapack, New Jersey 07977
(908) 901-8000
Internet address: www.pharmacia.com

     Pharmacia is a global pharmaceutical company whose core business is the
development, manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products, including general
therapeutics, ophthalmology and hospital products, such as oncology and
diversified therapeutics. Pharmacia also operates several businesses that
include, among others, consumer health care, animal health care, diagnostics and
contract manufacturing and bulk pharmaceutical chemicals. Pharmacia's leading

and $12.7 billion for 2000. Pharmacia employs approximately 43,000 people
worldwide. Pharmacia spent $2.3 billion on research and development in 2001.

WHAT PHARMACIA SHAREHOLDERS WILL RECEIVE IN THE MERGER (SEE PAGE      )

     Pharmacia shareholders will receive 1.4 shares of Pfizer common stock for
each share of Pharmacia common stock they hold. Pfizer will not issue fractional
shares in the merger. As a result, the total number of shares of Pfizer common
stock that each Pharmacia shareholder will receive in the merger will be rounded
down to the nearest whole number, and each Pharmacia shareholder will receive a
cash payment for the remaining fraction of a share of Pfizer common stock that
he or she would otherwise receive, if any, based on the market value of Pfizer
common stock at the close of business at the date the merger became effective.

     Example:  If you currently own 151 shares of Pharmacia common stock, you
will be entitled to receive 211 shares of Pfizer common stock and a check for
the market value of 0.4 shares of Pfizer common stock at the close of business
on the date the merger becomes effective.

     The holder of Pharmacia Series C convertible perpetual preferred stock
(which will be received by the holder in exchange for its

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

Pharmacia Series B convertible perpetual preferred stock prior to the completion
of the merger) will receive one share of Pfizer Series A convertible perpetual
preferred stock for each share of Pharmacia Series C convertible perpetual
preferred stock, having substantially similar terms.

RECOMMENDATIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS (SEE PAGE      )

TO PFIZER SHAREHOLDERS:

     Pfizer's board of directors believes the merger is advisable, fair to you
and in your best interests and recommends that you vote FOR the proposal to
issue shares of Pfizer common stock in the merger.

     Pfizer's board of directors also recommends that you vote FOR the proposal
to amend the Pfizer certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized
share capital.

TO PHARMACIA SHAREHOLDERS:

     Pharmacia's board of directors believes the merger is advisable, fair to
you and in your best interests and recommends that you vote FOR the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement.

REASONS FOR THE MERGER (SEE PAGE      )

     The boards of directors of Pfizer and Pharmacia believe that this merger
will create the world's largest pharmaceutical company, with the scientific
depth, global marketing strength and financial resources to take greater
advantage of new opportunities and to bring innovative new products to market
faster.

     The boards of both companies believe that by combining our companies, we
will be able to benefit from:

     - Enhanced revenue potential resulting from, among other things:

       -- access to late stage pipeline drugs;

       -- enhanced capability to bring new products to market; and

       -- increased scale.
     - Significant cost savings from, among other things, increased purchasing
       power as a combined company;

     - Combination of operational factors, such as growth opportunities and risk
       reductions with respect to research and development; and

     - Leadership in major therapeutic categories.

SHAREHOLDER VOTES REQUIRED (SEE PAGE      )

FOR PFIZER SHAREHOLDERS:

     Approval of the proposal to issue shares of Pfizer common stock in the
merger requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast by
the holders of Pfizer common stock as long as a quorum, which is a majority of
the shares outstanding, is present in person or by proxy. Approval of the
proposal to amend the Pfizer certificate of incorporation requires the
affirmative vote of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Pfizer
common stock. The amendment to the Pfizer certificate of incorporation is
necessary to provide Pfizer with sufficient shares of common stock to pay the
merger consideration to Pharmacia shareholders. Approval of the proposal to
issue shares of Pfizer common stock in the merger and the proposal to amend the
Pfizer certificate of incorporation are conditions to the completion of the
merger. Therefore, if shareholders wish to have the merger completed, they must
approve both proposals.

     On the record date, directors and executive officers of Pfizer and their
affiliates beneficially owned or had the right to vote [          ] shares of
Pfizer common stock, representing less than [          ]% of the shares of
Pfizer common stock outstanding on the record date. To Pfizer's knowledge,
directors and executive officers of Pfizer and their affiliates intend to vote
their common stock in favor of the proposal to issue shares of Pfizer common
stock in the merger and the proposal to amend the Pfizer certificate of
incorporation.

                                       I-4

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

FOR PHARMACIA SHAREHOLDERS:

     Adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of at least
a majority of the votes represented by the outstanding shares of Pharmacia
common stock and Pharmacia Series B convertible perpetual preferred stock,
voting together as a single class. On the record date, directors and executive
officers of Pharmacia and their affiliates beneficially owned or had the right
to vote [          ] shares of Pharmacia common stock, or approximately
[          ]% of the outstanding shares of Pharmacia common stock outstanding
and entitled to vote at the special meeting. To Pharmacia's knowledge, directors
and executive officers of Pharmacia and their affiliates intend to vote their
common stock in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement.

THE MERGER (SEE PAGE      )

     Under the terms of the proposed merger, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Pfizer, formed for the purpose of the merger, will merge with and into
Pharmacia. As a result, Pharmacia will survive the merger and will become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer upon completion of the merger.

     The merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/
prospectus. We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully and fully as
it is the legal document that governs the merger.

TREATMENT OF PHARMACIA STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK, AND OTHER EQUITY-BASED
AWARDS (SEE PAGE      )

     Each outstanding Pharmacia stock option will become fully vested and
exercisable either upon adoption of the merger agreement by Pharmacia
shareholders or upon completion of the merger, depending on the terms of the
stock option plan, grant, employment agreement or other arrangement under which
such option was granted. In the merger, each then-outstanding option to purchase
Pharmacia common stock will be converted into an option to purchase Pfizer
common stock. The number of shares of Pfizer common stock underlying the new
Pfizer option will equal the number of shares of Pharmacia common stock for
which the corresponding Pharmacia option was exercisable, multiplied by 1.4. The
per share exercise price of each new Pfizer option will equal the exercise price
of the corresponding Pharmacia option divided by 1.4.

     All shares of Pharmacia restricted common stock will vest either upon
adoption of the merger agreement by Pharmacia shareholders or upon completion of
the merger, depending on the terms of the stock option plan, grant, employment
agreement or other arrangement under which such restricted stock was granted,
and will be treated in the merger like other shares of Pharmacia common stock.

     All awards under Pharmacia benefit plans that provide for cash payments
based on the value of Pharmacia common stock shall become fully vested either
upon adoption of the merger agreement by Pharmacia shareholders or upon
completion of the merger, depending on the terms of the plans under which such
payments are to be made.

OWNERSHIP OF PFIZER AFTER THE MERGER

     Pfizer may issue up to 1.804 billion shares of Pfizer common stock to
Pharmacia shareholders in the merger. Immediately following completion of the
merger, it is expected that there will be approximately 7.986 billion shares of
common stock outstanding. The shares of Pfizer common stock to be issued to
Pharmacia shareholders in the merger will represent approximately 23% of the
outstanding Pfizer common stock after the merger on a fully diluted basis. This
information is based on the number of Pfizer and Pharmacia shares and options
outstanding on June 30, 2002.

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

CONDITIONS TO THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   )

     The completion of the merger depends upon the satisfaction or waiver of a
number of conditions, including the following:

     - adoption of the merger agreement by the Pharmacia shareholders and
       approval of the issuance of shares of Pfizer common stock in the merger
       and amendment to the Pfizer certificate of incorporation by the Pfizer
       shareholders;

     - expiration or termination of the waiting period under the
       Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and
       approval of the merger by the European Commission;

     - absence of any law or court order in the United States or European Union
       prohibiting the merger;

     - receipt of opinions of counsel to Pfizer and Pharmacia that the merger
       will qualify as a tax-free reorganization;

     - material accuracy, as of the closing, of the representations and
       warranties made by the parties and material compliance by the parties
       with their respective obligations under the merger agreement; and

     - neither party having suffered any change that would reasonably be
       expected to have a material adverse effect on that party.

TERMINATION OF MERGER AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE   )

     Right to Terminate.  The merger agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the effective time in any of the following ways:

     - by our mutual written consent;

     - by either one of us:

       -- if the merger has not been completed by April 15, 2003 or, if the
          conditions to closing relating to antitrust or other governmental
          approvals of the merger have not been satisfied, but all other
          conditions to closing are satisfied or are capable of being satisfied,
          this date is automatically extended to July 15, 2003; except that a
          party may not terminate the merger agreement if the cause of the
          merger not being completed is that party's failure to fulfill its
          obligations under the merger agreement;

       -- if a governmental authority or a court in the United States or
          European Union permanently prohibits the completion of the merger or a
          governmental authority in the United States or European Union fails to
          grant any necessary approval of the merger, except that a party may
          not terminate the merger agreement if the cause of the prohibition or
          failure to obtain approval is a result of that party's failure to
          fulfill its obligations under the provision of the merger agreement
          which, among other requirements, requires each party to use its
          reasonable best efforts to obtain government approvals for the
          completions of the merger and requires each party to divest certain
          assets in response to requirements imposed by antitrust authorities;

       -- if the other party has breached in any material respect any of its
          representations or warranties, or has failed to perform in any
          material respect any of its covenants or obligations under the merger
          agreement and such breach:

          (1) would result in the failure of certain closing conditions to the
              merger being satisfied; and

          (2) is incapable of being cured or remains uncured at April 15, 2003.

       -- if either Pfizer's shareholders fail to approve the issuance of shares
          of Pfizer common stock in the merger

or the amendment to the Pfizer certificate of incorporation, or Pharmacia's
shareholders fail to adopt the merger agreement.

     - by Pfizer:

       -- if Pharmacia's board of directors either changes its recommendation in
          a manner adverse to Pfizer, or fails to call the Pharmacia special
          meeting to vote on the merger by January 13, 2003 (which deadline will
          be extended if this registration statement has not become effective by
          November 14, 2002).

     - by Pharmacia:

       -- if Pfizer's board of directors either changes its recommendation in a
          manner adverse to Pharmacia, or fails to call the Pfizer special
          meeting to vote on the proposal to issue shares of Pfizer common stock
          in the merger or the proposal to amend the Pfizer certificate of
          incorporation by January 13, 2003 (which deadline will be extended if
          this registration statement has not become effective by November 14,
          2002); or

       -- if Pharmacia's board of directors authorizes Pharmacia to enter into a
          written agreement concerning a transaction that Pharmacia's board of
          directors has determined in accordance with the merger agreement is a
          superior proposal, except that Pharmacia cannot terminate the merger
          agreement for this reason unless it has complied with certain
          procedural obligations to Pfizer and pays Pfizer the termination fee
          described below at or prior to such termination.

     Termination Fees Payable by Pharmacia. Pharmacia has agreed to pay Pfizer a
termination fee of $1.6 billion (within one business day after the earlier of
the date Pharmacia enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or
consummates, a business combination), if the merger agreement is terminated
under one of the following circumstances:

     - the merger agreement is (1) terminated by Pfizer because the board of
       directors of Pharmacia withdraws or changes its recommendation in a
       manner adverse to Pfizer or for any reason Pharmacia fails to call or
       hold its shareholders' meeting by January 13, 2003 or until this
       registration statement becomes effective if such date is extended (but
       only if, on or before the date the agreement is terminated, there was an
       offer or proposal for, or announcement with respect to, a "business
       combination" involving Pharmacia) and (2) within twelve months of the
       termination, Pharmacia enters into a definitive agreement or completes a
       transaction with respect to a business combination with a third party;

     - the merger agreement is (1) terminated by Pfizer or Pharmacia because
       Pharmacia's shareholders failed to adopt the merger agreement (but only
       if, prior to the date of the Pharmacia special meeting, there was made
       public to a significant number of Pharmacia's shareholders an offer or
       proposal for, or any public announcement with respect to, a business
       combination involving Pharmacia) and (2) within twelve months of the
       termination, Pharmacia enters into a definitive agreement or completes a
       transaction with respect to a business combination with a third party; or

     - the merger agreement is (1) terminated by Pfizer or Pharmacia because the
       necessary regulatory approvals have not been obtained and the merger has
       not been completed by April 15, 2003 (or July 15, 2003 if the termination
       date is extended), and at the time of termination Pharmacia has not yet
       obtained its shareholder approval and prior to April 15, 2003 (or July
       15, 2003 if the termination date is extended), there has

                                       I-7

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

       been an offer or proposal for, or announcement with respect to, a
       business combination involving Pharmacia and (2) within twelve months of
       the termination, Pharmacia enters into a definitive agreement or
       completes a transaction with respect to a business combination with a
       third party.

     Pharmacia also has agreed to pay Pfizer a termination fee of $1.6 billion
(at or prior to such termination), if Pharmacia terminates the merger agreement
because Pharmacia's board of directors has authorized Pharmacia to enter into a
written agreement for a superior proposal and Pfizer has not, within five
business days of notice from Pharmacia, made an offer that the board of
directors of Pharmacia determines is at least as favorable as the superior
proposal Pharmacia has received from a third party.

REGULATORY APPROVALS (SEE PAGE   )

     Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended,
the merger cannot be completed until we have made required notifications, we
have given certain information and materials to the Federal Trade Commission and
the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice and specified
waiting period requirements have expired. Pfizer and Pharmacia intend to file
the required notification and report forms with the Antitrust Division and the
Federal Trade Commission shortly.

     Pfizer and Pharmacia each conduct business in member states of the European
Union, and the merger therefore also requires the review of the European
Commission. Pfizer and Pharmacia intend to seek approval of the European
Commission for the merger shortly.

     Pfizer and Pharmacia are not permitted to complete the merger unless the
regulatory conditions to completion of the merger described above are satisfied.
In addition, the companies have agreed that, if necessary to secure regulatory
approval of the merger, Pfizer will hold assets separate or conduct any portion
of its business in a specified manner for up to 6 months and Pfizer and
Pharmacia will divest or hold separate assets so long as such divestitures do
not have a material adverse effect on Pharmacia (including, for this purpose, on
its prospects).

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE      )

     A Pharmacia shareholder's receipt of Pfizer common stock in the merger
generally will be tax-free for United States federal income tax purposes, except
for taxes which may result from any receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Pfizer common stock.

     THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY NOT
APPLY TO SOME HOLDERS OF PHARMACIA STOCK, INCLUDING SOME TYPES OF HOLDERS
SPECIFICALLY REFERRED TO ON PAGE I-[  ]. THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO PHARMACIA
SHAREHOLDERS WILL DEPEND UPON THEIR OWN PERSONAL SITUATION. ACCORDINGLY, WE
STRONGLY URGE PHARMACIA SHAREHOLDERS TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS FOR A FULL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM.

LISTING OF PFIZER COMMON STOCK

     The shares of Pfizer common stock to be issued in the merger will be listed

INTERESTS OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   )

     When Pharmacia shareholders consider their board of directors'
recommendation that they vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement,

On June 19, 2000, Pfizer merged with Warner-Lambert Company ("Warner-Lambert")
in a transaction accounted for as a pooling-of-interests. All financial
information reflects the combined results of Pfizer and Warner-Lambert as if the
merger had been in effect for all periods presented.

All financial information reflects the divestitures of Pfizer's Medical
Technology and Food Science businesses as discontinued operations.

Per share data reflects the 3-for-1 stock split which occurred in June 1999.

2001 and 2000 data was restated to reflect reclassifications between Revenues
and Selling, informational and administrative expenses of $277 million in 2001
and $255 million in 2000 as a result of the January 1, 2002, adoption of
Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00-25, Vendor Income Statement
Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendor's Products.
Pfizer has not restated periods prior to 2000 for EITF Issue No. 00-25.

(1) In 2001, Pfizer brought the accounting methodology pertaining to accruals
    for estimated liabilities related to Medicaid discounts and contract rebates
    of Warner-Lambert into conformity with Pfizer's historical method. This
    adjustment increased revenues in 2001 by $175 million.

(2) Includes merger-related costs incurred in connection with Pfizer's merger
    with Warner-Lambert:
     Six months ended June 30, 2002 -- Integration costs of $181 million and
                                       restructuring charges of $94 million.
     Six months ended July 1, 2001 -- Integration costs of $264 million and
                                      restructuring charges of $212 million.

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

     2001 -- Integration costs of $467 million and restructuring charges of $372
             million.
     2000 -- Transaction costs directly related to the merger with
             Warner-Lambert of $226 million; costs related to Warner-Lambert's
             termination of the Warner-Lambert/Wyeth (formerly known as American
             Home Products) merger of $1,838 million; integration costs of $246
             million and restructuring charges of $947 million.
     1999 -- Transaction costs directly related to the merger with Agouron
             Pharmaceuticals, Inc. of $33 million.

(3) Includes the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the
    six months ended June 30, 2002 for the January 1, 2002 adoption of Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 142, Pfizer recorded the
    following non-cash pre-tax charges of $565 million ($410 million after-tax)
    in the first six months of 2002:
     -- $536 million for the impairment provisions related to goodwill in

SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     The merger will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting,
which means the assets and liabilities of Pharmacia will be recorded, as of
completion of the merger, at their respective fair values and added to those of
Pfizer. For a more detailed description of purchase accounting, see "The
Proposed Merger -- Accounting Treatment" on page   .

     We have presented below selected unaudited pro forma combined financial
information that reflects the purchase method of accounting and is intended to
provide you with a better picture of what our businesses might have looked like
had they actually been combined. The combined financial information may have
been different had the companies actually been combined. The selected unaudited
pro forma combined financial information does not reflect the effect of asset
dispositions, if any, or cost savings that may result from the merger. You
should not rely on the selected unaudited pro forma combined financial
information as being indicative of the historical results that would have
occurred had the companies been combined or the future results that may be
achieved after the merger. The following selected unaudited pro forma combined

COMPARATIVE PER SHARE INFORMATION

     The following table sets forth selected historical per share information of
Pfizer and Pharmacia and unaudited pro forma combined per share information
after giving effect to the merger between Pfizer and Pharmacia, under the
purchase method of accounting, assuming that 1.4 shares of Pfizer common stock
had been issued in exchange for each outstanding share of Pharmacia common
stock. You should read this information in conjunction with the selected
historical financial information, included elsewhere in this document, and the
historical financial statements of Pfizer and Pharmacia and related notes that
are incorporated in this document by reference. The unaudited Pfizer pro forma
combined per share information is derived from, and should be read in
conjunction with, the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial
Statements and related notes included in Chapter Two of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. The historical per share information is derived from
unaudited financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2002
and audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2001.
The unaudited pro forma Pharmacia per share equivalents are calculated by
multiplying the unaudited Pfizer pro forma combined per share amounts by the
exchange ratio of 1.4.

     The unaudited pro forma combined per share information does not purport to
represent what the actual results of operations of Pfizer and Pharmacia would
have been had the companies been combined or to project Pfizer's and Pharmacia's
results of operations that may be achieved after the merger.

RECENT CLOSING PRICES

     The following table sets forth the closing prices per share of Pfizer
common stock and Pharmacia common stock as reported on the NYSE Composite
Transaction Tape on July 12, 2002, the last full trading day prior to the
announcement of the merger agreement, and [          ], the most recent
practicable date prior to the mailing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus
to Pfizer's and Pharmacia's shareholders. This table also sets forth the imputed
value of Pharmacia common stock on July 12, 2002 and the equivalent price per
share of Pharmacia common stock on those dates. The equivalent price per share
is equal to the closing price of a share of Pfizer common stock on that date
multiplied by 1.4, the applicable exchange ratio in the merger. These prices
will fluctuate prior to the special meetings and the merger, and shareholders
are urged to obtain current market quotations prior to making any decision with
respect to the merger.

                                                                                 PHARMACIA

 * Includes value of Monsanto Company shares held by Pharmacia.

** This value has been calculated by subtracting from the closing price of
   Pharmacia common stock on July 12, 2002, the amount of $3.01, which is the
   value of Pharmacia's interest in Monsanto Company common stock calculated on
   a per share of Pharmacia's common stock basis. Pharmacia distributed its
   Monsanto Company shares to holders of Pharmacia Common Stock on August 13,
   2002.

     Although dividends are subject to future approval and declaration by
Pfizer's and Pharmacia's respective boards of directors, Pfizer and Pharmacia
each currently plan to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends on their
common stock until closing of the merger, although Pfizer and Pharmacia have
agreed to coordinate their dividend policy prior to the merger so that Pharmacia
shareholders do not receive two dividends, or fail to receive a dividend in any
calendar quarter. The dividend policy following the merger will be determined by
the combined company's board of directors following the merger.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     PFIZER AND PHARMACIA SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING
FACTORS, IN ADDITION TO THOSE FACTORS DISCUSSED IN THE DOCUMENTS THAT WE HAVE
FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND WHICH WE HAVE INCORPORATED
INTO THIS DOCUMENT AND THE OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS JOINT PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS, BEFORE VOTING AT THEIR RESPECTIVE SPECIAL MEETINGS.

THE VALUE OF PFIZER SHARES RECEIVED WILL FLUCTUATE

     The number of shares of Pfizer common stock issued in the merger for each
share of Pharmacia common stock is fixed. The market prices of Pfizer common
stock and Pharmacia common stock when the merger is completed may vary from
their market prices at the date of this document and at the date of the special
meetings of Pfizer and Pharmacia. For example, during the 12 month period ending
on [  ], the most recent practical date prior to the mailing of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, Pfizer common stock traded in a range from a low of $[  ]
to a high of $[  ] and ended that period at $[  ], and Pharmacia common stock
traded in a range from a low of $[  ] to a high of $[  ] and ended that period
at $[  ]. See "Comparative Per Share Market Price and Dividend Information" on
page   for more detailed share price information.

     These variations may be the result of various factors including:

     - changes in the business, operations or prospects of Pfizer or Pharmacia;

     - governmental and/or litigation developments and/or regulatory
       considerations;

     - market assessments as to whether and when the merger will be consummated;

     - governmental action affecting the pharmaceutical industry generally;

     - loss of patent protection and competition from generic drugs; and

     - general market and economic conditions.

     The merger may not be completed until a significant period of time has
passed after the Pfizer and Pharmacia special meetings. At the time of their
respective special meetings, Pfizer and Pharmacia shareholders will not know the
exact value of the Pfizer common stock that will be issued in connection with
the merger.

     Shareholders of Pfizer and Pharmacia are urged to obtain current market
quotations for Pfizer and Pharmacia common stock.

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE OUR OPERATIONS AND REALIZE THE FULL
COST SAVINGS WE ANTICIPATE

     The merger involves the integration of two companies that have previously
operated independently. The difficulties of combining the companies' operations
include:

     - the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations,
       systems and facilities; and

     - integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds.

     The process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or
loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of the combined company's
businesses and the loss of key personnel. The diversion of management's
attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the
merger and the integration of the two companies' operations could have an
adverse effect on the business, results of operations, financial condition or
prospects of the combined company after the merger.

     Among the factors considered by the Pfizer and the Pharmacia boards of
directors in connection with their respective approvals of the merger agreement
were the opportunities for operating efficiencies that could result from the
merger. We cannot give any assurance that these savings will be realized within
the time periods contemplated or even if they will be realized at all.

                                       I-20

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

WE WILL INCUR SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTION, MERGER-RELATED AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS IN
CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER

     Pfizer and Pharmacia expect to incur costs associated with combining the
operations of the two companies, transaction fees and other costs related to the
merger. The total estimate includes approximately $100 million for transaction
costs and between $3.5 and $4.0 billion of restructuring and integration costs.
The estimated $100 million of transaction costs are expected to be recorded as a
component of the purchase price. Approximately $1 billion of the restructuring
costs are expected to be included as a liability in the purchase price
allocation. These amounts are preliminary estimates and subject to change.
Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the
businesses of Pfizer and Pharmacia. Although Pfizer and Pharmacia expect that
the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other
efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, may offset
incremental transaction, merger-related and restructuring costs over time, we
cannot give any assurance that this net benefit will be achieved in the near
term, or at all.

OBTAINING REQUIRED APPROVALS AND SATISFYING CLOSING CONDITIONS MAY DELAY OR
PREVENT COMPLETION OF THE MERGER

     Completion of the merger is conditioned upon the receipt of all material
governmental authorizations, consents, orders and approvals, including the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods, and any extension
of the waiting periods, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
of 1976, as amended, and approval by the European Commission. Pfizer and
Pharmacia intend to pursue all required approvals in accordance with the merger
agreement. The requirement for these approvals could delay the completion of the
merger for a significant period of time after Pfizer and Pharmacia shareholders
have approved the proposals relating to the merger at their respective special
meetings. See "The Merger Agreement -- Conditions" on page   for a discussion of
the conditions to the completion of the merger and "The Proposed
Merger -- Regulatory Matters Relating to the Merger" on page   for a description
of the regulatory approvals necessary in connection with the merger. No
assurance can be given, however, that these approvals will be obtained or that
the required conditions to closing will be satisfied, and, if all such approvals
are obtained and the conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as to
the terms, conditions and timing of the approvals or that they will satisfy the
terms of the merger agreement.

PFIZER AND PHARMACIA ARE THE SUBJECT OF VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     Pfizer and Pharmacia are involved in various patent, product liability,
consumer, environmental and tax claims and litigations and additional matters
that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. These include
challenges to the coverage and/or validity of patents on products or processes
and allegations of injuries caused by drugs or medical devices. In addition,
Pfizer and Pharmacia are subject to national, state and local environmental laws
and regulations. Pfizer and Pharmacia are also involved in or are the subject of
governmental or regulatory agency inquiries or investigations from time to time.

                              THE PROPOSED MERGER

GENERAL

     Pfizer's board of directors is using this joint proxy statement/prospectus
to solicit proxies from the holders of Pfizer common stock for use at the Pfizer
special meeting. Pharmacia's board of directors is also using this document to
solicit proxies from the holders of Pharmacia common stock and Pharmacia Series
B convertible perpetual preferred stock for use at the Pharmacia special
meeting.

PFIZER PROPOSALS

     At the Pfizer special meeting, holders of Pfizer common stock are being
asked to vote on:

     - the issuance of shares of Pfizer common stock in the merger; and

     - an amendment to the Pfizer certificate of incorporation which would
       increase the authorized share capital.

     THE MERGER WILL NOT BE COMPLETED UNLESS PFIZER'S SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE BOTH
(1) THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF PFIZER COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER; AND (2) THE
AMENDMENT TO THE PFIZER CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, WHICH IS NECESSARY SO THAT
PFIZER WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT AUTHORIZED SHARES TO ISSUE SHARES OF PFIZER COMMON
STOCK TO SHAREHOLDERS OF PHARMACIA.

PHARMACIA PROPOSAL

     At the Pharmacia special meeting, holders of Pharmacia common stock and
Pharmacia Series B convertible perpetual preferred stock will be asked to vote
upon the adoption of the merger agreement.

     THE MERGER WILL NOT BE COMPLETED UNLESS PHARMACIA'S SHAREHOLDERS ADOPT THE
MERGER AGREEMENT.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     The management of Pfizer has periodically explored and assessed strategic
options for Pfizer as part of its ongoing effort to strengthen its business and
improve its product mix. During the past three years, management of Pfizer has
periodically considered the possibility of a business combination or other
strategic transaction with Pharmacia and its predecessor companies.

     An informal discussion on the subject was pursued by Dr. McKinnell,
currently Chairman of Pfizer, with Mr. Hassan, Chairman of Pharmacia, on January
16, 2001. At that time, Mr. Hassan indicated that it was Pharmacia's desire and
strategy to grow on its own. Mr. Hassan subsequently updated the Pharmacia board
of directors on this discussion at its regularly scheduled meeting on February
21, 2001. In June 2001, at a regularly scheduled meeting of Pharmacia's board of
directors, Pharmacia's board and management discussed the company's strategic
direction and alternatives, and the board affirmed the general strategic
direction being pursued by Pharmacia as an independent company as the best
growth strategy.

     Accordingly, no material discussions between Pharmacia and Pfizer regarding
a possible business transaction occurred until April 2002.

     On April 9, 2002, Dr. McKinnell met with other members of Pfizer
management, representatives of its investment banker, Lazard Freres & Co. LLC,
and representatives of its legal advisor, Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, to
discuss the possibility of making informal inquiries of Pharmacia's management
about a possible business combination or other strategic transaction between
Pfizer and Pharmacia. At this meeting, it was decided that Dr. McKinnell would
approach Mr. Hassan, at the launch of Bextra(R), a new product being co-promoted
and co-marketed by Pfizer and Pharmacia, to gauge Pharmacia's interest in a
possible business combination or other strategic transaction.

     At the Bextra(R) launch, which took place between April 9 and April 11,
2002, Dr. McKinnell met briefly with Mr. Hassan and

                                       I-24

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

suggested that it might be productive for the two of them to get together and
discuss the state of the pharmaceutical industry, including the possibility of a
strategic transaction between Pfizer and Pharmacia in order to better position
the two companies in a volatile economic climate. Mr. Hassan indicated that he
believed that the board of directors of Pharmacia was not interested in
exploring any transaction at the time, but he planned to meet with Dr. McKinnell
to discuss the changing climate in the pharmaceutical industry.

     On April 22, 2002, Mr. Hassan followed up with a telephone call to Dr.
McKinnell to arrange a meeting to further discuss industry issues. Dr. McKinnell
and Mr. Hassan agreed to meet in early May.

     On April 25, 2002, at a regularly scheduled meeting of Pfizer's board of
directors, Dr. McKinnell briefed the Pfizer board of directors on his recent
informal discussions with Mr. Hassan as well as the strategic considerations for
a possible business combination between Pfizer and Pharmacia. Pfizer's
investment banker and legal advisors also discussed the respective financial and
legal considerations that would likely affect any strategic transaction between
the companies, including the impact of Pharmacia's proposed spin-off of its
interest in one of its subsidiaries, Monsanto Company.

     On April 30, 2002, Mr. Hassan updated the Pharmacia board of directors at
its regularly scheduled meeting on the approach from Pfizer. Mr. Hassan
recommended and the board supported continuation of the company's existing
strategy to grow on its own. The board did, however, authorize Mr. Hassan to
meet with Dr. McKinnell to seek a better understanding of Pfizer's intentions.

     On May 9, 2002, Dr. McKinnell and Mr. Hassan met in New York. These
discussions, however, did not progress beyond Dr. McKinnell's preliminary
indications of interest in an acquisition of Pharmacia. Mr. Hassan stated that
he believed that Pharmacia's board of directors was not interested in being
acquired by anyone. No additional meetings were scheduled or planned at the
time.

     On May 13, 2002, Mr. Hassan had a telephone conference with the Pharmacia
board of directors to update the board on his meeting with Dr. McKinnell. The
board agreed to meet in person to discuss the preliminary indication of interest
in more detail. On May 13, 2002, Pharmacia retained Goldman, Sachs & Co. as its
investment banker.

     On June 4, 2002, Dr. McKinnell met with representatives of Lazard and
Cadwalader as well as other members of Pfizer management to discuss making a
proposal to acquire Pharmacia. It was concluded that Dr. McKinnell should
attempt to arrange a meeting with Mr. Hassan and at such meeting present a
specific proposal for a possible business combination between Pfizer and
Pharmacia. In early June, 2002, Dr. McKinnell called Mr. Hassan to request a
meeting.

     On June 7, 2002, at a special meeting of Pharmacia's board, Mr. Hassan
described Dr. McKinnell's interest in discussing a potential transaction between
the parties. The board reviewed Pharmacia's performance, prospects and strategic
alternatives with members of senior management and representatives of the
company's financial advisor, Goldman Sachs, and representatives of Pharmacia's
legal advisor, Sullivan & Cromwell. The board authorized Mr. Hassan to meet with
Dr. McKinnell to listen to his proposal.

     On June 11, 2002, Dr. McKinnell met with Mr. Hassan and presented an offer
to merge Pfizer and Pharmacia. Dr. McKinnell proposed a transaction in which
Pharmacia's shareholders would receive 1.3 shares of Pfizer common stock in
exchange for each share of Pharmacia common stock, taking into account the
spin-off of Pharmacia's interest in Monsanto Company. Mr. Hassan indicated that
he believed the offer was unacceptable but that he would present it to
Pharmacia's board of directors for consideration.

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

     On June 14, 2002, Pfizer engaged Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. to act as its
financial advisor along with Lazard.

     On June 18, 2002, Pharmacia's board held a regularly scheduled meeting at
which the proposed transaction with Pfizer was discussed. Mr. Hassan reviewed
his discussions to date with Dr. McKinnell, including the proposal made by Dr.
McKinnell. The board reviewed Pharmacia's performance, prospects and strategic
alternatives with members of senior management and representatives of Goldman
Sachs and Sullivan & Cromwell. Members of senior management discussed with the
board various forecasts for both companies and potential synergies that might
result from a combination of the two companies. The company's legal advisors
reviewed with the board their fiduciary duties under the circumstances. The
board determined that the proposal from Pfizer was inadequate, but authorized
Mr. Hassan and members of senior management to continue discussions with Pfizer.

     On June 24, 2002, Mr. Hassan telephoned Dr. McKinnell and informed him that
the Pharmacia board of directors had met and, while still supporting the
company's current strategic direction as an independent company and believing
the proposed exchange ratio of 1.3 to be inadequate, had authorized him to
remain open to further discussions regarding a possible business combination
between Pfizer and Pharmacia. Mr. Hassan emphasized that the Pharmacia board
believed the exchange ratio offered by Pfizer did not accurately reflect
Pharmacia's intrinsic value and could not be the basis for any such transaction.

     On June 27, 2002, Pfizer and Pharmacia entered into a customary
confidentiality agreement to allow the exchange of information between the two
companies and their respective legal and financial advisors. On June 27 and 28,
2002, David Shedlarz, the chief financial officer of Pfizer, and Christopher
Coughlin, the chief financial officer of Pharmacia, met several times to discuss
the parameters and details for due diligence. At about the same time, Dr.
McKinnell, in discussions with Mr. Hassan, suggested an exchange ratio of 1.4
shares of Pfizer common stock for each share of Pharmacia common stock, taking
into account the spin-off of Pharmacia's interest in Monsanto Company, which
exchange ratio was dependent upon, among other things, Pharmacia providing
satisfactory information, including information relating to operational
efficiencies of the combined company, to justify such an exchange ratio, and
agreement on the terms of mutually satisfactory definitive agreements and
approval by the Pfizer board of directors.

     At a regularly scheduled meeting of the board of directors on June 27,
2002, Dr. McKinnell briefed the Pfizer board of directors regarding his
discussions with Mr. Hassan. The members of the board of directors concurred
that it would be advisable to continue to proceed with negotiations of a
possible business combination with Pharmacia and emphasized the importance of
the due diligence review to be undertaken by Pfizer.

     On June 28, 2002, at a special telephonic meeting of the board of
directors, Mr. Hassan updated the Pharmacia board on his discussions with Dr.
McKinnell. The board authorized Mr. Hassan to continue discussions with Dr.
McKinnell regarding the transaction.

     On June 30 and July 1, 2002, Dr. McKinnell and Mr. Hassan spoke several
times by telephone regarding the possible business combination. On June 30,
2002, Dr. McKinnell also conferred with members of Pfizer's senior management
and representatives of Pfizer's financial and legal advisors. After these
discussions, Dr. McKinnell and Mr. Hassan continued to discuss an exchange ratio
of 1.4, taking into account the spin-off of Pharmacia's interest in Monsanto
Company, subject to completion of each party's due diligence review, negotiation
of mutually satisfactory definitive agreements and final approval by each
company's board of directors.

     On July 1, 2002, members of Pfizer's management, including Dr. McKinnell
and Mr. Shedlarz, met with Pfizer's internal and outside legal advisors and its
financial advisors to discuss the timing and procedures to

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

complete a due diligence review of Pharmacia and Pfizer and to negotiate
definitive agreements for the possible business combination.

     On July 2, 2002, Mr. Hassan reviewed with the members of the Pharmacia
board of directors in a telephonic meeting the new proposal from Pfizer, noting
that such proposal was subject to completion of satisfactory due diligence by
both parties, mutual agreement on definitive agreements and approval of the
Pfizer board of directors. The members of the board discussed the proposal and
authorized Mr. Hassan to continue discussions with Pfizer with a view to
reaching agreement on the terms of a definitive agreement consistent with the
proposal discussed at the meeting.

     From July 2 until July 13, 2002, the respective legal and financial
advisors of Pfizer and Pharmacia conducted extensive due diligence
investigations of the other company. Members of Pfizer's senior management, its
internal and external legal team as well as its financial advisors and external
auditors, conducted a due diligence review from an operational, financial,
accounting, tax and legal perspective. Pfizer's due diligence review included
interviews of Pharmacia's senior management and review of documents. During the
same time, members of Pharmacia's senior management, its internal and external
legal team as well as its financial advisors and external auditors, conducted a
due diligence review from an operational, financial, accounting, tax and legal
perspective. Pharmacia's due diligence review included interviews of Pfizer's
senior management and review of documents.

     On July 3, 2002, a draft of the merger agreement was circulated to
Pharmacia and its legal representatives.

     During the period from July 3, 2002 to the morning of July 13, 2002, Pfizer
and Pharmacia, working together with their respective legal and financial
advisors, negotiated the terms of the definitive agreements for a possible
business combination and certain changes to their co-promotion and co-marketing
agreements regarding Celebrex(R) and other COX-2 "second generation" drugs.

     On July 12, 2002, Pfizer and its outside counsel negotiated with Mr. Hassan
and his personal legal counsel the terms of his employment agreement with
Pfizer. The terms of this employment agreement were finalized the following
morning.

     On the morning of July 13, 2002, Pharmacia's board held a special meeting
to discuss in detail the proposed business combination with Pfizer. Members of
senior management and representatives of the company's advisors reviewed the
activities and discussions of the past weeks, and presented a summary of the
proposed transaction terms as reflected in the draft definitive agreements, the
strategic rationale that supported it, and the economic and operational benefits
that it could create. The board reviewed Pharmacia's performance and prospects
and strategic alternatives. Senior management presented the forecasts and
economic benefits upon which the exchange ratio was predicated, and summarized
the process and the results of Pharmacia's senior management's due diligence
investigation of Pfizer. Representatives of Sullivan & Cromwell reviewed in more
detail the terms of the proposed transaction, including the terms of the merger
agreement and the amendment to the COX-2 co-promotion and co-marketing
agreements and described the board's fiduciary duties under the circumstances.
Goldman Sachs provided the Pharmacia board of directors a detailed analysis of
the financial terms of the proposed combination and an oral opinion, which was
subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated July 13, 2002,
that, as of that date and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in
the opinion, the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from
a financial point of view, to the holders of Pharmacia common stock. Without Mr.
Hassan present, members of senior management reviewed with the board the terms
of Mr. Hassan's proposed employment arrangement with Pfizer following completion
of the merger. The board then met without senior management or Mr. Hassan
present to discuss

                                       I-27

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

any matters that an independent board member wished to raise. During that
session, the board concluded that the terms of Mr. Hassan's employment agreement
were reasonable and did not create a conflict of interest. At the conclusion of
this meeting, after consideration of the factors described under "-- Factors
Considered by, and Recommendation of, the Board of Directors of Pharmacia" on
page   , the Pharmacia board of directors determined by a unanimous vote of the
directors present at the meeting that the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of
Pharmacia and its shareholders, and approved the merger agreement, the amendment
to the Pharmacia shareholder rights plan and the amendment to the COX-2
co-promotion and co-marketing agreements and authorized the signing thereof.

     On the afternoon of July 13, 2002, the board of directors of Pfizer held a
special meeting to review the final terms of the proposed merger agreement, the
amendment to the COX-2 co-promotion and co-marketing agreements and Mr. Hassan's
employment agreement. Also present at the meeting were members of Pfizer's
senior management, Pfizer's legal advisors, Cadwalader, and Pfizer's financial
advisors, Lazard and Bear Stearns. After an update on the progress of the
negotiations by Dr. McKinnell, Pfizer's senior management presented its
assessment of the proposed transaction and the results of its legal and
financial due diligence review. Representatives of Cadwalader reviewed the
proposed merger agreement in detail with the members of the board of directors
and discussed the fiduciary duties of the board of directors in considering a
possible business combination. Lazard and Bear Stearns then each delivered their
respective oral opinions (which were each subsequently confirmed in writing),
that, as of that date, the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement was
fair to Pfizer from a financial point of view. See "-- Opinions of Financial
Advisors -- Opinions of Pfizer's Financial Advisors" on page   for further
information regarding these opinions. Thereafter, the members of board of
directors of Pfizer, after consideration of the factors described under
"-- Factors Considered by, and Recommendation of, the Board of Directors of
Pfizer" on page   , voted unanimously to approve the merger agreement, the
amendment to the Pfizer certificate of incorporation, the amendment to the COX-2
co-promotion and co-marketing agreements with Pharmacia and the employment
agreement with Mr. Hassan.

     Before the opening of trading on July 15, 2002, Pharmacia and Pfizer issued
a joint press release announcing the execution of the merger agreement.

OUR REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     While each of Pfizer and Pharmacia has growth potential and prospects for
its immediate and long-term future as a stand-alone entity, we both believe that
a combination of the two companies will create a leading global pharmaceutical
company with greater diversity, breadth and financial resources that will have
the opportunity to enhance shareholder value in ways that are unlikely to be
achieved by Pfizer or Pharmacia alone. Specifically, the combined company would
be uniquely positioned to benefit from the following:

     - Enhanced revenue potential resulting from, among other things:

       -- access to late stage pipeline drugs;

       -- enhanced capability to bring new products to market; and

       -- increased scale.

     - Significant cost savings from among other things, increased purchasing
       power as a combined company.

     - Combination of operational factors, such as growth opportunities and risk
       reductions with respect to research and development.

     - Leadership in major therapeutic categories.

     Enhanced Revenue Potential.  The merger will combine two large and
fast-growing firms in the pharmaceutical industry, which will create the
opportunity for solid growth potential,

                                       I-28

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

improved financial returns and accelerated earnings growth. The combined company
would be a larger enterprise with a broader and more diversified product line
than either Pfizer or Pharmacia on a stand-alone basis, with estimated potential
combined revenues of $52.8 billion in 2003.

     As competition intensifies in the industries in which Pfizer and Pharmacia
participate, we believe that the combined company will benefit from an enhanced
potential for revenue growth in the following areas and for the following
reasons:

     - Pharmaceuticals.  The combined company expects to have nearly $43.7
       billion in prescription pharmaceutical sales in 2003.

       Together the two companies had eight products that they own with sales of
       more than $1 billion in 2001: Lipitor(R), Viagra(R), Norvasc(R),
       Zoloft(R), Zithromax(R), Diflucan(R), Neurontin(R)and Celebrex(R) (which
       is co-promoted and co-marketed by Pfizer and Pharmacia). In addition, the
       combined company will promote 15 products which had sales in excess of
       $500 million each in 2001, including Zyrtec(R), Xalatan(R),
       Detrol(R)/Detrol LA(R), Camptosar(R) and Accupril(R), and ten of those
       products had an aggregate annual growth of 24% or more in 2001.

       We believe that the combined company's enhanced market presence and sales
       penetration in key products, coupled with its increased research and
       development capabilities may lead to the development of new
       pharmaceutical products. Its enhanced capabilities to successfully bring
       such products to market may lead to enhanced potential for revenue
       growth. Most of the major products of both Pfizer and Pharmacia will
       continue to have patent protection well into this decade and beyond. We
       believe that these factors provide the opportunity to support the
       combined growth of products in both Pfizer's and Pharmacia's pipelines of
       new products, as well as organic and geographic growth of present
       products.

     - New Products and Broad and Diversified Product Line.  The combination of
       Pfizer's pipeline of new products with Pharmacia's pipeline of new
       products is expected to provide the combined company with the potential
       for enhanced revenue growth. In June 2002, the FDA approved the
       injectable form of Geodon(R), making it the first atypical antipsychotic
       medicine for schizophrenia approved in the United States for
       intramuscular use. In May 2002, the FDA approved Vfend(R) for life
       threatening fungal infections. In April 2002, Bextra(R) was launched in
       the United States for the relief of pain and inflammation of
       osteoarthritis, adult rheumatoid arthritis and primary dysmenorrhea.
       Also, in April 2002, Spiriva(R)(co-promoted with Boehringer-Ingelheim)
       was approved by regulatory authorities in Europe as a treatment for
       chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The product was launched in six
       countries, including Germany in June 2002. On February 5, 2002, the FDA
       accepted a new drug application for eplerenone for the treatment of
       hypertension.

       - Increased Scale.  Scale has importance in many areas, including:

          - financial strength;

          - research and development of new products;

          - an increased presence in major international markets;

          - an increased ability to attract licensing partners;

          - improved marketing and sales support; and

          - distribution capabilities, as well as enhancement of existing
            competencies.

                                       I-29

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

     We believe the increased scale of the combined company, and the benefits in
the areas mentioned above, could result in greater efficiency and an enhanced
potential for revenue growth.

     While we expect that we will be able to realize enhanced revenues, no
assurance can be given that we will actually be able to do so.

     Significant Cost Savings.  The combined company is expected to increase its
profitability through cost savings and operating efficiencies resulting from the
elimination of duplicative facilities and functions which would exist in the
combined company in the United States, through multiple organizations and
systems in over thirty foreign countries, and through the benefits of leveraging
our combined annual external purchases. Pfizer estimates that savings from
reductions in cost of goods sold will be realized by optimization of global
manufacturing, involving over 100 manufacturing sites of the two companies
around the world. The combined company may also be able to leverage its
marketing and sales infrastructure to support existing and new products. Savings
from sales, general and administrative expenses are expected to be realized by
the combination of two worldwide headquarters and multiple staff support
functions in over thirty countries. In addition to the competitive advantage
gained by the size of the research and development budget, the combination of
the research and development programs will permit the combined company to
utilize the best science, research, development capabilities and procedures of
each company. Pfizer's human pharmaceutical research and development
expenditures have been growing by a compound annual growth rate of 14% over the
last 3 years. Based on our review of and assumptions about the operations and
infrastructure of the two companies, we expect that the combined company will
realize annual cost savings of approximately $2.5 billion by 2005. We expect to
achieve such cost savings as follows:

     - $1.4 billion by 2003;

     - $2.2 billion by 2004; and

     - $2.5 billion by 2005.

     The estimated cost savings reflect the realization of cost reduction
opportunities and efficiencies through the ability to consolidate separate
stand-alone operations into a single entity. While we expect that we will be
able to realize these cost savings, no assurance can be given that we will
actually be able to do so.

     The management of both companies believes that the financial performance of
the combined company will be enhanced by the potential cost savings expected
from the merger.

     The following table sets forth the anticipated adjusted earnings of Pfizer,
Pharmacia's forecast, as adjusted by Pfizer with the concurrence of Pharmacia,
and the anticipated adjusted earnings of the combined company. It is being set
forth below because, in connection with its review of the merger, Pfizer's
management developed the information to evaluate the potential benefits of the
merger based on Pharmacia's forecast (as adjusted by Pfizer with the concurrence
of Pharmacia). Adjusted earnings is equal to forecasted GAAP net income or loss,
excluding discontinued operations, extraordinary items, plus the cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle, plus certain significant items, plus
charges related to purchase price allocations on assets (including write-off of
in-process research and development, amortization of identifiable intangibles
and charges related to write-up of assets to fair market value) plus
merger-related costs (including integration expenses and restructuring charges).

FACTORS CONSIDERED BY, AND RECOMMENDATION OF, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF PFIZER

     At its meeting on July 13, 2002, Pfizer's board of directors unanimously:

     - determined that the merger agreement and the merger are advisable and
       fair to, and in the best interests of, Pfizer and its shareholders;

     - directed that the proposal to issue Pfizer shares in the merger and the
       proposal to amend the Pfizer certificate of incorporation be submitted
       for consideration to the Pfizer shareholders;

     - recommended that the Pfizer shareholders vote FOR the proposal to issue
       shares of Pfizer common stock in the merger; and

     - recommended that the Pfizer shareholders vote FOR the proposal to amend
       the Pfizer certificate of incorporation to increase its share capital.

     In the course of reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement,
Pfizer's board of directors consulted with Pfizer's management, as well as its
legal counsel and its financial advisors, and considered the following material
factors:

     (1)  information concerning the financial performance and condition,
          results of operations, asset quality, prospects and businesses of each
          of Pfizer and Pharmacia as separate entities and on a combined basis,
          including:

          - the revenues of the companies, their complementary businesses and
            the potential for cost savings and revenue enhancement;

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

          - the recent and historical stock price performance of Pfizer common
            stock and Pharmacia common stock; and

          - the percentage of the combined company Pfizer's shareholders would
            own following the merger.

     (2)  the importance of market position, significant scale and scope and
          financial resources to a company's ability to compete effectively in
          the changing environment in the global pharmaceutical market, and the
          fact that the strategic combination of Pfizer's and Pharmacia's
          businesses would create the world's largest pharmaceutical company;

     (3)  the strategic nature of the transaction, which combines Pfizer's and
          Pharmacia's complementary businesses, and creates a broader company
          with enhanced global reach and greater resources, enhanced future
          operating flexibility and increased opportunity for growth;

     (4)  the potential benefits to be derived from a combination of the two
          companies as described under "-- Our Reasons for the Merger" on page
            , including potential cost savings and efficiencies that could
          result from the merger;

     (5)  the current industry, economic and market conditions and trends,
          including the likelihood of continuing consolidation and increasing
          competition in the pharmaceutical industry;

     (6)  the nature and timing of new products of both companies in their
          respective pipelines, the complementary nature of both companies
          pipelines and the effect of combining such pipelines on the growth and
          results of operations of the combined company;

     (7)  the nature and effectiveness of existing products to be sold by the
          combined company and the fact that the customer base to be served will
          be broader and more diverse;

     (8)  the opportunity for the shareholders of Pfizer to participate in a
          larger company with a broader and more diverse product line and, as
          shareholders of the combined company, benefit from future growth of
          the combined company;

     (9)  the exchange ratio will enable Pfizer shareholders to own
          approximately 77% of the outstanding stock of the combined company;

     (10) the opinion of Lazard, which is described below, under "Opinions of
          Financial Advisors -- Opinions of Pfizer's Financial Advisors" on page
            , to the effect that, as of the date of its opinion and subject to
          the matters set out in its written opinion, the exchange ratio in the
          merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to Pfizer;

     (11) the opinion of Bear Stearns, which is described below, under "Opinions
          of Financial Advisors -- Opinions of Pfizer's Financial Advisors" on
          page   , to the effect that, as of the date of its opinion and subject
          to the matters set out in its written opinion, the exchange ratio in
          the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to Pfizer;

     (12) the structure of the transaction as a tax-free reorganization for
          United States federal income tax purposes;

     (13) the ability to consummate the merger, including the conditions to the
          merger requiring receipt of necessary regulatory approvals in
          accordance with the terms of the merger agreement;

                                       I-35

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

     (14) the highly successful ongoing relationship between Pfizer and
          Pharmacia in co-marketing, co-promoting and licensing Celebrex(R) and
          the successful launch of Bextra(R) and the benefit to Pfizer of
          control of Celebrex(R) and the COX-2 "second generation" drug
          franchise, including the challenges inherent in expanding the
          franchise;

     (15) the potential liabilities arising out of the agricultural and chemical
          business of the former Monsanto Company as to which Pharmacia is
          indemnified by Monsanto Company and Solutia and the ability of the
          existing indemnity provisions to shield the combined company from
          liability;

     (16) potential liability arising out of other legal proceedings involving
          Pharmacia;

     (17) the challenges of combining the businesses of two major corporations,
          including Pfizer's experience successfully integrating the business of
          Warner-Lambert Company, and the risks of diverting management
          resources for an extended period of time; and

     (18) the board of directors' continuing belief in the shareholder value
          opportunity represented by the strategic path the board had previously
          chosen and the unique implementation opportunity presented by the
          definitive transaction terms with Pharmacia.

     In view of the variety of factors and the amount of information considered,
Pfizer's board of directors did not find it practicable to and did not quantify,
rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors it considered
in reaching its decision. The determination was made after consideration of all
of the factors both negative and positive, taken as a whole. In addition,
individual members of Pfizer's board of directors may have given different
weights to different factors.

     Pfizer's board of directors considered all these factors in reaching the
conclusions and recommendations described above. It should be noted that this
explanation of the Pfizer board's reasoning and certain information presented in
this section is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, such information
should be read in light of the factors discussed under the heading
"Forward-Looking Statements" on page   .

     THE PFIZER BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE MERGER
AGREEMENT, THE MERGER AND THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY AND
BELIEVES THAT THE TERMS OF THE MERGER ARE FAIR TO, AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF,
PFIZER AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS. THE PFIZER BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR
THE PROPOSAL TO ISSUE SHARES OF PFIZER COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER AND FOR THE
PROPOSAL TO AMEND THE PFIZER CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION.

FACTORS CONSIDERED BY, AND RECOMMENDATION OF, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF
PHARMACIA

     At a special meeting held on July 13, 2002, after due consideration and
consultation with financial and other advisors, the Pharmacia board of
directors:

     - determined by a unanimous vote of the directors present at the meeting
       that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are
       advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Pharmacia and its
       shareholders;

     - approved the merger agreement;

     - directed that the merger agreement be submitted for consideration by the
       Pharmacia shareholders; and

     - recommended that the Pharmacia shareholders vote FOR adoption of the
       merger agreement.

     In the course of reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, the
Pharmacia board of directors consulted with Pharmacia's

                                       I-36

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

management, as well as its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, and
considered the following material factors:

     (1)  the relationship of the exchange ratio of 1.4 shares of Pfizer common
          stock for each share of Pharmacia common stock to recent and
          historical market prices of Pharmacia common stock, as well as its
          relationship to the recent and historical ratio of the Pharmacia
          market price to the Pfizer market price. In this respect, the board
          noted the exchange ratio of 1.4 represents an implied premium of:

          - 52.4% over the implied exchange ratio of 0.92 based on the closing
            price of Pharmacia common stock and Pfizer common stock on July 12,
            2002;

          - 40.0% over the implied exchange ratio of 1.00 based on the average
            closing price of Pharmacia common stock and Pfizer common stock for
            the 3-month period ending on July 12, 2002; and

          - 48.3% over the implied exchange ratio of 0.94 based on the average
            closing price of Pharmacia common stock and Pfizer common stock for
            the 6-month period ending on July 12, 2002.

           The Pharmacia board also considered the premiums paid in other
           comparable pharmaceutical industry acquisitions. The "implied"
           exchange ratio represents ratios or premiums of the actual closing
           price of Pharmacia common stock and Pfizer common stock on the
           relevant date or for the relevant period, as applicable, minus the
           value of Pharmacia's interest in Monsanto Company common stock
           calculated on a per share of Pharmacia's common stock basis;

     (2)  information concerning the recent results of operations, prospects and
          businesses of Pharmacia and the recent stock price performance of
          Pharmacia shares, Pfizer shares, and the shares of other
          pharmaceutical companies;

     (3)  trends and competitive developments in the pharmaceutical industry and
          the range of strategic alternatives available to Pharmacia, including
          Pharmacia continuing its existing strategy of continuing to develop
          and market pharmaceutical products as an independent company, or
          exploring potential "mergers of equals" with similar sized
          pharmaceutical companies;

     (4)  the business, operations, earnings and prospects of Pfizer, the
          complementary businesses of Pharmacia and Pfizer, the potential
          prospects and businesses of the combined company following the merger
          and the opportunity for Pharmacia shareholders to participate in the
          combined company's long-term growth. The board also considered that
          there could be no assurance that such growth would occur;

     (5)  that Pharmacia shareholders would own approximately 23% of the
          combined company following the merger;

     (6)  the combined company is expected to have combined annual revenues of
          approximately $48 billion, including $39 billion in prescription sales
          in 2002;

     (7)  the importance of size and scope, which would allow the combined
          company to compete more effectively in the increasingly competitive
          pharmaceutical industry and the fact that the combined company would
          be financially stronger than Pharmacia would be as an independent
          entity;

                                       I-37

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

     (8)  the current environment of the pharmaceutical industry, including the
          increasing cost to fund the high-risk and long-term research required
          to develop successful pharmaceutical products;

     (9)  the opportunity to maximize the potential of both companies' current
          products and pipelines, such as the near-term launch of several key
          Pharmacia products in Japan;

     (10) the highly successful ongoing relationship between Pfizer and
          Pharmacia in co-marketing, co-promoting and licensing Celebrex(R) and
          the successful launch of Bextra(R);

     (11) that the dividends payable in respect of 1.4 shares of Pfizer common
          stock were expected to be approximately 35% higher in 2003 and
          approximately 40% higher in 2004 than the currently-anticipated
          dividend on a share of Pharmacia common stock;

     (12) the corporate governance aspects of the merger, including that at the
          closing of the merger, Mr. Hassan, the current Chairman and Chief
          Executive Officer of Pharmacia, will be named the Vice-Chairman of
          Pfizer and become a member of Pfizer's board of directors;

     (13) the intended treatment of the merger as a "reorganization" within the
          meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code;

     (14) the likelihood, determined after consultation with its legal counsel,
          that the regulatory approvals and clearances necessary to complete the
          merger would be obtained and that Pfizer had agreed in the merger
          agreement to take such action, including selling or holding separate
          assets of Pfizer or Pharmacia, as necessary to complete the merger,
          unless such actions would have a material adverse effect on Pharmacia,
          including, for this purpose only, Pharmacia's prospects;

     (15) the terms of the merger agreement and the employee related agreements
          and plans, including:

          - that the merger agreement permits Pharmacia to provide information
            and enter into negotiations with a third party if Pharmacia receives
            an unsolicited proposal from a third party and the board concludes
            that there is a reasonable likelihood that such acquisition proposal
            could result in a proposal that is more favorable to Pharmacia's
            shareholder from a financial point of view than the proposed merger;

          - that it could change its recommendation to the Pharmacia
            shareholders in the event that Pfizer suffers a material adverse
            effect or if the board determines that an unsolicited acquisition
            proposal is more favorable to Pharmacia's shareholders from a
            financial point of view; and

          - that it could terminate the merger agreement to accept a proposal
            that is more favorable to Pharmacia's shareholders from a financial
            point of view if it pays Pfizer a termination fee of $1.6 billion
            and, if the more favorable transaction is completed within one year
            of termination, transfers the tie-breaking vote for decisions under
            the COX-2 co-promotion and co-marketing agreements to Pfizer. This
            amendment is described in more detail under the heading "Summary of
            the Merger Agreement" on page      .

     (16) the opinion of Goldman Sachs that, based on and subject to the factors
          and assumptions set forth in the opinion, as of the date of such
          opinion and subject to the opinion,

                                       I-38

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

          the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a
          financial point of view, to the holders of Pharmacia common stock,
          which opinion is described in detail under the heading "Opinion of
          Pharmacia's Financial Advisor" on page      .

     The Pharmacia board of directors weighed these advantages and opportunities
against:

     (1)  the challenges inherent in the combination of two business enterprises
          of the size and scope of Pfizer and Pharmacia and the possible
          resulting diversion of management attention for an extended period of
          time;

     (2)  the risk that the merger would not be completed;

     (3)  the risk that anticipated benefits, long-term as well as short-term,
          of the merger for the Pharmacia shareholders might not be realized;

     (4)  the impact of the merger on Pharmacia's employees;

     (5)  the risk that various provisions of the merger agreement and the
          agreement regarding the change to the COX-2 co-promotion and
          co-marketing agreements may have the effect of discouraging other
          persons potentially interested in a combination with Pharmacia from
          pursuing such opportunity;

     (6)  the combined company's potential liability associated with actions
          that have been filed against Pfizer related to Rezulin, a diabetes
          drug, and to asbestos, in connection with limited sales of minor
          products containing asbestos which Pfizer acquired in the 1960s; and

     (7)  the potential impact of the litigation, and the potential loss of
          Pfizer's patent protection, related to Neurontin(R).

     The Pharmacia board also considered that the merger agreement provides for
a fixed exchange ratio and that the value of the consideration to be paid in the
merger to Pharmacia shareholders depends on the value of the Pfizer common stock
at the time of the merger. The Pharmacia board realized that there can be no
assurance about future results, including results expected or considered in the
factors listed above, such as assumptions regarding potential revenue
enhancements and anticipated cost savings. However, the Pharmacia board
concluded that the potential positive factors outweighed the potential risks of
completing the merger.

     The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the
Pharmacia board of directors is not exhaustive, but includes all material
factors considered by the Pharmacia board. In view of the wide variety of
factors considered by the Pharmacia board in connection with its evaluation of
the merger and the complexity of such matters, the Pharmacia board did not
consider it practical to, nor did it attempt to, quantify, rank or otherwise
assign relative weights to the specific factors that it considered in reaching
its decision. The Pharmacia board discussed the factors described above, asked
questions of Pharmacia's management and Pharmacia's legal and financial
advisors, and reached general consensus that the merger was advisable and in the
best interests of Pharmacia and its shareholders. In considering the factors
described above, individual members of the Pharmacia board of directors may have
given different weight to different factors. It should be noted that this
explanation of the Pharmacia board's reasoning and certain information presented
in this section is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, such information
should be read in light of the factors discussed under the heading
"Forward-Looking Statements" on page   .

     THE PHARMACIA BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE MERGER
AGREEMENT, THE MERGER AND THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY AND
BELIEVES THAT THE TERMS OF THE MERGER ARE FAIR TO AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF
PHARMACIA AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS. ACCORD-

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

INGLY, THE PHARMACIA BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT PHARMACIA
SHAREHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     The merger will be accounted for as a purchase by Pfizer under accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Under the
purchase method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of Pharmacia will be
recorded, as of completion of the merger, at their respective fair values and
added to those of Pfizer. Reported financial condition and results of operations
of Pfizer issued after completion of the merger will reflect Pharmacia's
balances and results after completion of the merger, but will not be restated
retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of
operations of Pharmacia. Following the completion of the merger, the earnings of
the combined company will reflect purchase accounting adjustments, including
in-process research and development write-offs and increased amortization and
depreciation expense for acquired assets.

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

     The following general discussion summarizes the material United States
federal income tax consequences of the merger to holders of Pfizer common stock
and Pharmacia common stock.

United States Federal Income Tax Consequences to Pharmacia Shareholders Who
Participate in the Merger.

     This discussion addresses only those Pharmacia shareholders that hold their
Pharmacia common stock as a capital asset and does not address all aspects of
federal income taxation that may be relevant to a holder of Pharmacia common
stock in light of that shareholder's particular circumstances or to a
shareholder subject to special rules, such as:

     - a shareholder that is not a citizen or resident of the United States;

     - a financial institution or insurance company;

     - a mutual fund;

     - a tax-exempt organization;

     - a dealer or broker in securities or foreign currencies;

     - traders in securities that elect to apply a mark-to-market method of
       accounting;

     - a shareholder that holds its Pharmacia common stock as part of a hedge,
       appreciated financial position, straddle or conversion transaction; or

     - a shareholder that acquired its Pharmacia common stock pursuant to the
       exercise of options or otherwise as compensation.

     The following discussion is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service. It
is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, applicable Treasury
regulations, administrative interpretations and court decisions, each as in
effect as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and all of which
are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. The tax consequences
under United States state and local and foreign laws and United States federal
laws other than United States federal income tax laws are not addressed.

     Holders of Pharmacia common stock are strongly urged to consult their tax
advisors as to the specific tax consequences to them of the merger, including
the applicability and effect of United States federal, state and local and
foreign income and other tax laws in light of their particular circumstances.

     Pfizer and Pharmacia have structured the merger so that it is anticipated
that the merger will qualify as a reorganization for United

                                       I-40

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

States federal income tax purposes. On the date this registration statement
becomes effective, Pfizer will receive a written opinion from Cadwalader,
Wickersham & Taft, and Pharmacia will receive a written opinion from Sullivan &
Cromwell, both to the effect that for United States federal income tax purposes,
the merger will constitute a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code. It is a condition to the completion of the merger
that Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft and Sullivan & Cromwell confirm their
respective opinions as of the closing date of the merger. Neither Pfizer nor
Pharmacia intends to waive this condition. These opinions will each rely, on
assumptions, including assumptions regarding the absence of changes in existing
facts and law and the completion of the merger in the manner contemplated by the
merger agreement, and representations and covenants made by Pfizer, Pharmacia
and others, including those contained in certificates of officers of Pfizer and
Pharmacia. If any of those representations, covenants or assumptions is
inaccurate, counsel may not be able to render the required opinions and the tax
consequences of the merger could differ from those discussed here. Opinions of
counsel neither bind the IRS nor preclude the IRS from adopting a contrary
position. No ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS on the tax
consequences of the merger.

     For United States federal income tax purposes:

     - A holder of Pharmacia common stock will not recognize any gain or loss
       upon the exchange of that shareholder's shares of Pharmacia common stock
       for shares of Pfizer common stock in the merger, except that gain or loss
       will be recognized on the receipt of cash in lieu of a fractional share
       of Pfizer common stock;

     - To the extent that a holder of Pharmacia common stock receives cash in
       lieu of a fractional share of Pfizer common stock, the holder will be
       required to recognize gain or loss, measured by the difference between
       the amount of cash received and the portion of the tax basis of that
       holder's shares of Pharmacia common stock allocable to that fractional
       share of Pfizer common stock. This gain or loss will be capital gain or
       loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the holding period for
       the share of Pharmacia common stock exchanged for the fractional share of
       Pfizer common stock is more than one year at the completion of the
       merger;

     - A holder of Pharmacia common stock will have a tax basis in the Pfizer
       common stock received in the merger equal to (1) the tax basis of the
       Pharmacia common stock surrendered by that holder in the merger, less (2)
       any tax basis of the Pharmacia common stock surrendered that is allocable
       to a fractional share of Pfizer common stock for which cash is received;
       and

     - The holding period for shares of Pfizer common stock received in exchange
       for shares of Pharmacia common stock in the merger will include the
       holding period for the shares of Pharmacia common stock surrendered in
       the merger.

     United States Federal Income Tax Consequences to Pfizer
Shareholders.  There will be no United States federal income tax consequences to
a holder of Pfizer common stock as a result of the merger.

     This discussion is intended to provide only a general summary of the
material United States federal income tax consequences of the merger, and is not
a complete analysis or description of all potential United States federal income
tax consequences of the merger. This discussion does not address tax
consequences that may vary with, or are contingent on, individual circumstances.
In addition, it does not address any non-income tax or any foreign, state or
local tax consequences of the merger. ACCORDINGLY, PFIZER AND PHARMACIA STRONGLY
URGE EACH HOLDER OF PHARMACIA COMMON STOCK TO CONSULT HIS OR HER TAX ADVISOR TO
DETERMINE THE PARTICULAR UNITED STATES FEDERAL, STATE OR

                                       I-41

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

LOCAL OR FOREIGN INCOME OR OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THAT SHAREHOLDER OF THE
MERGER.

REGULATORY MATTERS RELATING TO THE MERGER

     United States Antitrust.  Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and its associated rules, the merger may
not be completed until notifications have been given and certain information and
materials have been furnished to and reviewed by the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and the
required waiting period has expired or terminated. Pfizer and Pharmacia intend
to file the required notification and report forms under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, with the Federal Trade
Commission and the Department of Justice shortly. There can be no assurance that
a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if a
challenge is made, that it would not be successful. In addition, state antitrust
authorities and private parties in certain circumstances may bring legal action
under the antitrust laws seeking to enjoin the merger or seeking conditions to
the completion of the merger.

     European Union.  Both Pfizer and Pharmacia conduct business in member
states of the European Union. Council Regulation No. 4064/89 and accompanying
regulations require notification to and approval by the European Commission of
specific mergers or acquisitions involving parties with worldwide sales and
individual European Union sales exceeding specified thresholds before these
mergers and acquisitions can be implemented. Pfizer and Pharmacia intend to seek
approval of the European Commission for the merger shortly.

     Expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and gaining approval under
Council Regulation No. 4064/89 are conditions to completing the merger.

     Other Jurisdictions.  Pfizer and Pharmacia each conduct operations in a
number of jurisdictions where other regulatory approvals are required or
advisable in connection with the completion of the merger. We recognize that
some of these approvals, which are not required to be obtained under the merger
agreement, may not be obtained prior to the completion of the merger and may
impact the combined company's ability to conduct business in those
jurisdictions. However, neither party is required to complete the merger if the
companies have failed to obtain any governmental approval and such failure would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the combined company
following the merger.

     In addition, the companies have agreed that, if necessary to secure
regulatory approval of the merger, Pfizer will hold assets separate or conduct
any portion of its business in a specified manner for up to 6 months and Pfizer
and Pharmacia will divest or hold separate assets so long as such divestitures
do not have a material adverse effect on Pharmacia (including, for this purpose,
on its prospects).

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Holders of Pfizer common stock and Pharmacia common stock do not have
appraisal rights under Delaware law in connection with the merger.

     The holder of Pharmacia Series B convertible perpetual preferred stock will
have appraisal rights under Delaware law in connection with the merger. If such
holder has not voted its shares of Pharmacia Series B convertible perpetual
preferred stock in favor of adoption of the merger agreement, it has the right
to demand appraisal of, and to be paid the fair market value for such shares of
Pharmacia Series B convertible perpetual preferred stock. The value of the
Pharmacia Series B convertible perpetual preferred stock for this purpose will
exclude any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of
the merger. In order for the holder of Pharmacia Series B convertible perpetual
preferred stock to exercise its right to an appraisal, if any, such holder must
deliver to Pharmacia a written demand for an appraisal of the shares of
Pharmacia Series B convertible perpetual preferred stock prior to the time the
vote is

                                       I-42

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

taken on the adoption of merger agreement at the Pharmacia meeting as provided
by Delaware law. Annex F to this document sets forth the pertinent provisions of
Delaware law addressing appraisal rights. Simply voting against adoption of the
merger agreement will not be considered a demand for appraisal rights. If the
holder of Pharmacia Series B convertible perpetual preferred stock fails to
deliver such a written demand to the corporate secretary of Pharmacia
Corporation at 100 Route 206 North, Peapack, New Jersey 07977, prior to the time
the vote is taken on the adoption of the merger agreement at the Pharmacia
special meeting, it will lose the right to an appraisal. In addition, if such
holder votes its shares of Pharmacia Series B convertible perpetual preferred
stock for adoption of the merger agreement, it will lose the right to an
appraisal with respect to such shares. Failure to vote against adoption of the
merger agreement will not constitute a waiver of such holder's appraisal rights.
The preceding discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to
appraisal rights under the Delaware General Corporation Law and is qualified in
its entirety by the provisions of Delaware law attached as Annex F to this
document.

FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS CONSEQUENCES; STOCK TRANSFER RESTRICTION AGREEMENTS

     This registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus
is a part does not cover any resales of the Pfizer common stock to be received
by the shareholders of Pharmacia upon completion of the merger, and no person is
authorized to make any use of this joint proxy statement/prospectus in
connection with any such resale.

     All shares of Pfizer common stock received by Pharmacia shareholders in the
merger will be freely transferable, except that shares of Pfizer common stock
received by persons who are deemed to be "affiliates" of Pharmacia under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, at the time of the Pharmacia special meeting
may be resold by them only in transactions permitted by Rule 145 under the 1933
Act or as otherwise permitted under the 1933 Act. Persons who may be deemed to
be affiliates of Pharmacia for such purposes generally include individuals or
entities that control, are controlled by or are under common control with,
Pharmacia, as the case may be, and include directors and certain executive
officers of Pharmacia. The merger agreement requires that Pharmacia use
reasonable best efforts to cause each affiliate to execute a written agreement
to the effect that such persons will not offer, sell or otherwise dispose of any
of the shares of Pfizer common stock issued to them in the merger in violation
of the 1933 Act or the related SEC rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

REPURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK

     Pfizer has previously announced a common stock repurchase program under
which it and its affiliates are authorized to acquire, from time to time as
price and conditions warrant, up to $16 billion of its common stock in the open
market or in privately negotiated transactions.

     Regulation M under the federal securities laws prohibits Pfizer from
bidding for or repurchasing its common stock during the period commencing with
the mailing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus through the date of
Pharmacia's special meeting.

     Subject to applicable law, Pfizer may, from time to time as price and
conditions warrant, repurchase shares of Pfizer common stock and Pharmacia may,
from time to time as price and conditions warrant, repurchase shares of
Pharmacia common stock.

STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING; DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF PHARMACIA COMMON
STOCK

     It is a condition to the merger that the shares of Pfizer common stock
issuable in the merger be approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange,
subject to official notice of issuance. If the merger is completed, Pharmacia
common stock will cease to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the
Swedish stock exchange and its shares will be deregistered under the Exchange
Act.

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

     On July 15, 2002, a suit was filed in the Chancery Court in Delaware on
behalf of a purported class of Pharmacia's shareholders against Pharmacia,
Pharmacia's directors and Pfizer, alleging that the price to be paid for
Pharmacia's shares is inadequate as a result of Pharmacia's directors' breach of
their fiduciary duties to the shareholders of Pharmacia and that Pfizer is
alleged to have aided and abetted the alleged breach. The complaint, which
Pfizer and Pharmacia believe to be without merit, seeks damages and to enjoin
the merger.

     On the same date, a second suit was filed in the Chancery Court in Delaware
against Pharmacia and Pharmacia's directors, alleging that the price to be paid
for Pharmacia's shares is inadequate as a result of Pharmacia's directors'
breach of their fiduciary duties to the shareholders of Pharmacia. The
complaint, which Pharmacia believes to be without merit, seeks damages and to
enjoin the merger.

                         OPINIONS OF FINANCIAL ADVISORS

OPINIONS OF PFIZER'S FINANCIAL ADVISORS

     Lazard Freres & Co. LLC and Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., Pfizer's financial
advisors, have rendered separate opinions to the Pfizer board of directors as to
the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Pfizer of the exchange ratio in
the merger. The full text of the written opinion of Lazard, dated July 13, 2002,
is attached to this document as Annex B, and the full text of the written
opinion of Bear Stearns, dated July 13, 2002, is attached to this document as
Annex C. We encourage you to read each of the opinions carefully and in their
entirety to understand the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken by each of Lazard and Bear
Stearns in providing their respective opinions. THE OPINIONS OF LAZARD AND BEAR
STEARNS ARE DIRECTED TO THE PFIZER BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND DO NOT CONSTITUTE
RECOMMENDATIONS TO ANY SHAREHOLDER AS TO HOW THAT SHAREHOLDER SHOULD VOTE ON, OR
TAKE ANY OTHER ACTION WITH RESPECT TO, THE MERGER.

OPINION OF LAZARD

     At a meeting of Pfizer's board of directors held on July 13, 2002, at which
the Pfizer board of directors considered the merger and approved the merger
agreement and the merger, Lazard rendered its oral opinion (which was
subsequently confirmed in a written opinion, dated July 13, 2002) that, as of
such date and based upon and subject to the matters reviewed with Pfizer's board
of directors, the exchange ratio in the merger was fair to Pfizer from a
financial point of view.

     The full text of the Lazard opinion is attached hereto as Annex B. The
description of the Lazard opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the full text of the Lazard opinion set forth in Annex B.
Pfizer's shareholders are urged to read the Lazard opinion in its entirety for a
description of the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and
qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by Lazard in connection
therewith. The Lazard opinion is necessarily based upon the economic, monetary,
market and other conditions as they were in effect on, and the information made
available to Lazard as of, the date of the Lazard opinion. Lazard assumes no
responsibility for updating or revising its opinion based on circumstances or
events occurring after the date of the Lazard opinion. The Lazard opinion is for
the benefit and use of Pfizer's board of directors and addresses only the
fairness from a financial point of view of the exchange ratio in the merger to
Pfizer. It does not address the merits of the underlying decision by Pfizer to
engage in the merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder
of Pfizer as to how such shareholder should vote on, or take any other action
with respect to, the merger.

     In the course of performing its review and analyses for rendering its
opinion, Lazard:

     - reviewed the financial terms and conditions of the merger agreement and
       the certificate of designations for Series A convertible perpetual
       preferred stock of Pfizer Inc.;

     - analyzed certain historical publicly available business and financial
       information relating to Pfizer and Pharmacia;

     - reviewed various financial forecasts and other data provided to Lazard by
       Pfizer and Pharmacia relating to their respective businesses;

     - reviewed the synergistic savings and benefits and the timing of their
       occurrence as projected by Pfizer to be realized by the combined entity
       in connection with the merger;

     - held discussions with members of the senior managements of Pfizer and of
       Pharmacia with respect to the business and prospects of Pfizer and
       Pharmacia, respectively, the strategic objectives of

                                       I-47

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

       each and the possible benefits that might be realized following the
       merger as projected by Pfizer;

     - reviewed public information with respect to certain other companies in
       lines of businesses believed by Lazard to be generally comparable to
       those of Pfizer and Pharmacia;

     - reviewed the financial terms of certain significant business combinations
       involving companies in lines of businesses believed by Lazard to be
       generally comparable to those of Pfizer and Pharmacia;

     - reviewed the historical trading prices and trading volumes of Pfizer's,
       Pharmacia's and Monsanto Company's common stock;

     - reviewed the pro forma financial results, financial condition and
       capitalization of Pfizer giving effect to the merger provided to Lazard
       by the management of Pfizer; and

     - conducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations as
       Lazard deemed appropriate.

     Lazard relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other
information that it reviewed and used in its analysis, including the financial
and other information provided by Pfizer and Pharmacia and reviewed by Lazard
for purposes of the Lazard opinion. Lazard did not assume any responsibility for
any independent verification of such information or any independent valuation or
appraisal of any of the assets and liabilities of Pfizer or Pharmacia, or
concerning the solvency of or issues relating to solvency concerning either of
Pfizer or Pharmacia. With respect to financial forecasts, including the
synergistic savings and benefits projected by Pfizer to be realized following
the merger, and the timing thereof, Lazard assumed that they were reasonably
prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and
judgments of the managements of Pfizer and of Pharmacia as to the future
financial performance of Pfizer and Pharmacia, respectively, and of Pfizer with
respect to the combined entity. Lazard assumed no responsibility for and
expressed no view as to such forecasts or the assumptions on which they were
based.

     In rendering its opinion, Lazard assumed that the merger will be
consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions described in the merger
agreement without any waiver or modification of any material terms or conditions
by Pfizer, that obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals for the merger will
not have an adverse effect on Pfizer or Pharmacia and that the synergistic
savings and benefits of the merger projected by the management of Pfizer will be
substantially realized both in scope and timing. In addition, Lazard assumed
that:

     (i) the merger will be accounted for as a tax-free "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code;

     (ii) number of outstanding shares of common stock of Pharmacia on a fully
diluted basis will not be materially different than as represented in the merger
agreement; and

     (iii) other representations and warranties of Pharmacia and Pfizer
contained in the merger agreement are true and complete.

     Further, in rendering its opinion, Lazard did not express any opinion as to
the price at which the common stock of Pfizer or Pharmacia may trade subsequent
to the announcement of the merger or as to the price at which the common stock
of Pfizer may trade subsequent to the completion of the merger. Lazard also did
not express any opinion as to any aspect of Pharmacia's proposed disposition of
its interest in Monsanto Company.

     Lazard has in the past provided investment banking services to Pfizer for
which Lazard has received customary fees. In the ordinary course of Lazard's
business, Lazard and its affiliates may actively trade shares of Pfizer's,
Pharmacia's and Monsanto Company's common stock and other securities of Pfizer,
Pharmacia and Monsanto Company for their own accounts

and for the accounts of their customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a
long or short position in these securities.

OPINION OF BEAR STEARNS

     At a meeting of Pfizer's board of directors held on July 13, 2002, at which
the Pfizer board of directors considered the merger and approved the merger
agreement and the merger, Bear Stearns rendered its oral opinion (which was
subsequently confirmed in a written opinion, dated July 13, 2002) that, as of
such date and based upon and subject to the matters reviewed with Pfizer's board
of directors, the exchange ratio in the merger was fair to Pfizer from a
financial point of view.

     The full text of the Bear Stearns opinion is attached hereto as Annex C.
The description of the Bear Stearns opinion set forth herein is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of the Bear Stearns opinion set forth in
Annex C. Pfizer's shareholders are urged to read the Bear Stearns opinion in its
entirety for a description of the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters
considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by Bear
Stearns in connection therewith. The Bear Stearns opinion is subject to the
assumptions and conditions contained therein and is necessarily based on
economic, market and other conditions and the information made available to Bear
Stearns, as of the date of the Bear Stearns opinion. Bear Stearns assumes no
responsibility for updating or revising its opinion based on circumstances or
events occurring after the date of the Bear Stearns opinion. The Bear Stearns
opinion is intended for the benefit and use of the board of directors of Pfizer
and does not constitute a recommendation to the board of directors of Pfizer or
any holders of Pfizer common stock as to how to vote in connection with the
merger. The Bear Stearns opinion does not address Pfizer's underlying decision
to pursue the merger, the relative merits of the merger as compared to any
alternative business strategies that might have existed for Pfizer or the
effects of any other transaction in which Pfizer might have engaged.

     In the course of performing its review and analyses for rendering its
opinion, Bear Stearns:

     - reviewed the merger agreement and the Certificate of Designations for
       Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock of Pfizer Inc.;

     - reviewed each of Pfizer's and Pharmacia's Annual Reports to Shareholders
       and Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 1999
       through 2001, their respective Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the
       period ended March 31, 2002 and their Current Reports on Form 8-K for the
       three years ended the date of the Bear Stearns opinion;

     - reviewed certain operating and financial information provided to Bear
       Stearns by the senior managements of Pfizer and of Pharmacia relating to
       Pfizer's and Pharmacia's respective businesses and prospects, including
       financial projections for Pfizer for the years ending December 31, 2002
       through 2004 prepared by the management of Pfizer and for Pharmacia for
       the years ending December 31, 2002 through 2004 prepared by the
       management of Pharmacia (assuming the completion of Pharmacia's
       disposition of its interest in Monsanto Company) and certain other
       forward-looking information;

     - reviewed certain estimates of cost savings and other combination benefits
       expected to result from the merger prepared and provided to Bear Stearns
       by the management of Pfizer;

     - met with certain members of the senior managements of Pfizer and of
       Pharmacia and Pharmacia's advisors to discuss (1) the current business
       landscape and competitive dynamics related to the markets in which Pfizer
       and Pharmacia operate; (2) each company's business, operations,
       historical and projected financial results, future prospects and
       financial

       condition; (3) each company's views of the strategic, business,
       operational and financial rationale for, and expected strategic benefits
       and other implications of, the merger; (4) the financial projections for
       Pfizer and for Pharmacia and the estimates of cost savings and other
       combination benefits expected to result from the merger described above;
       and (5) certain other assumptions and judgments underlying certain
       estimates which Bear Stearns deemed relevant to its analysis;

     - reviewed the historical prices, valuation parameters and trading volumes
       of the common stock of Pfizer, the common stock of Pharmacia and the
       common stock of Monsanto Company;

     - reviewed publicly available financial data, stock market performance data
       and valuation parameters of companies which Bear Stearns deemed generally
       comparable to Pfizer and Pharmacia or otherwise relevant to Bear Stearns'
       analysis;

     - reviewed the terms, to the extent publicly available, of recent mergers
       and acquisitions of companies which Bear Stearns deemed generally
       comparable to the merger or otherwise relevant to Bear Stearns' analysis;

     - performed discounted cash flow analyses based on the financial
       projections for Pfizer and for Pharmacia and the estimates of cost
       savings and other combination benefits expected to result from the merger
       described above;

     - reviewed the pro forma financial results, financial condition and
       capitalization of Pfizer giving effect to the merger provided to Bear
       Stearns by the management of Pfizer; and

     - conducted such other studies, analyses, inquiries and investigations as
       Bear Stearns deemed appropriate.

     Bear Stearns relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, the
accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information, including,
without limitation, the financial projections for Pfizer and for Pharmacia and
the estimates of cost savings and other combination benefits expected to result
from the merger described above, provided to Bear Stearns by Pfizer or
Pharmacia, as the case may be. With respect to these financial projections and
estimates of cost savings and other combination benefits expected to result from
the merger, Bear Stearns relied on representations that these projections and
estimates have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of the senior managements of Pfizer and of
Pharmacia as to the expected future performance of Pfizer and Pharmacia,
respectively. Bear Stearns did not assume any responsibility for the independent
verification of any information, projections or estimates of cost savings and
other combination benefits expected to result from the merger provided to it,
and Bear Stearns further relied upon the assurances of the senior managements of
Pfizer and of Pharmacia that they were unaware of any facts that would make the
information, projections or estimates of cost savings and other combination
benefits expected to result from the merger provided to it incomplete or
misleading.

     In arriving at its opinion, Bear Stearns did not perform or obtain any
independent appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of
Pfizer or Pharmacia, nor was Bear Stearns furnished with any such appraisals.
Bear Stearns assumed that the merger will qualify as a tax-free "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and further
assumed that the merger will be consummated in a timely manner and in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the merger agreement without any limitations,
restrictions, conditions, waivers, amendments or modifications, regulatory or
otherwise, that collectively would have a material effect on Pfizer or
Pharmacia.

     Bear Stearns did not express any opinion as to the price or range of prices
at which the common stock of Pfizer or the common stock of Pharmacia may trade
subsequent to the

                                       I-50

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

announcement of the merger or as to the price or range of prices at which the
common stock of Pfizer may trade subsequent to the completion of the merger.
Bear Stearns also did not express any opinion as to any aspect of Pharmacia's
proposed disposition of its interest in Monsanto Company.

     Bear Stearns has been previously engaged by Pharmacia to provide certain
investment banking and financial advisory services in connection with actual and
prospective merger, acquisition and divestiture transactions as well as certain
capital raising transactions, for which Bear Stearns received customary
compensation. In the ordinary course of business, Bear Stearns and its
affiliates may actively trade the equity and debt securities and/or bank debt of
Pfizer, Pharmacia and/or Monsanto Company for their own accounts and for the
accounts of their customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or
short position in these securities or this bank debt.

SUMMARY OF LAZARD AND BEAR STEARNS FINANCIAL ANALYSES

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by
Lazard and Bear Stearns in connection with the rendering of their respective
fairness opinions to the Pfizer board of directors. Although Lazard and Bear
Stearns each performed their own independent analyses in connection with
rendering their respective fairness opinions, Lazard and Bear Stearns jointly
presented their analyses to the Pfizer board of directors.

     In each of the analyses described below, Lazard and Bear Stearns each
valued Pharmacia by assuming that the proposed disposition by Pharmacia of its
approximately 84% interest in Monsanto Company will occur prior to the
completion of the merger. Specifically, in deriving the implied equity values
per share of Pharmacia common stock set forth below, Lazard and Bear Stearns
excluded the implied value of Monsanto Company attributable to each share of
Pharmacia common stock. The implied per share value of Pharmacia's interest in
Monsanto Company was calculated by dividing the market value of Pharmacia's
approximately 84% interest in Monsanto Company (calculated with reference to the
closing share price of Monsanto Company common stock on July 12, 2002, unless
otherwise indicated below) by the number of shares of Pharmacia common stock
outstanding on May 9, 2002 on a fully diluted basis. In addition, in each of the
analyses described below, Lazard and Bear Stearns based their analyses on the
fully diluted shares outstanding as of May 9, 2002 for Pharmacia, as reported in
Pharmacia's Form 10-Q dated March 31, 2002, and on the fully diluted shares
outstanding for Pfizer, as provided by Pfizer's management.

     SOME OF THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES SUMMARIZED BELOW INCLUDE INFORMATION
PRESENTED IN TABULAR FORMAT. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND FULLY LAZARD'S AND BEAR
STEARNS' FINANCIAL ANALYSES, THE TABLES MUST BE READ TOGETHER WITH THE TEXT OF
THE SUMMARY. THE TABLES ALONE ARE NOT A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THE FINANCIAL
ANALYSES. CONSIDERING THE TABLES ALONE COULD CREATE A MISLEADING OR INCOMPLETE
VIEW OF LAZARD'S AND BEAR STEARNS' FINANCIAL ANALYSES.

     Comparable Public Companies Analysis. Lazard and Bear Stearns each
performed a comparable public companies analysis to assist the Pfizer board of
directors in valuing Pharmacia based on various financial multiples of selected
comparable public companies in the pharmaceutical industry. In performing these
analyses, Lazard and Bear Stearns each reviewed certain financial information
relating to Pharmacia and compared such information to the corresponding
financial information of other pharmaceutical companies which each of Lazard and
Bear Stearns deemed to be comparable to Pharmacia.

     Lazard compared the projected financial performance and the resulting
multiples as of July 12, 2002 of Pharmacia to seven major publicly-traded
pharmaceutical and/or life science companies which Lazard deemed gener-

                                       I-51

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

ally comparable to Pharmacia. The companies included in the Lazard analysis
were:

     - AstraZeneca plc
     - Aventis S.A.
     - Eli Lilly and Company
     - Johnson & Johnson
     - Pfizer Inc.
     - Sanofi Synthelabo SA
     - Wyeth

     Using publicly available information and market data as of July 12, 2002,
and, in the case of Pfizer, information based on Pfizer management estimates and
using Wall Street research projections for revenue, EBITDA and EBIT and
consensus earnings estimates for EPS for the above comparable companies, Lazard
calculated the following median multiples for the above comparable companies:

                                                 2001A    2002E    2003E    2004E
                                                 -----    -----    -----    -----

Enterprise Value as a multiple of:
  Revenues.....................................  4.54x    4.22x    3.78x    3.44x
  EBITDA.......................................  13.5x    11.8x    11.6x    10.1x
  EBIT.........................................  17.2x    14.1x    13.3x    11.7x
Share Price as a multiple of:
  EPS..........................................  24.6x    22.0x    19.2x    16.2x

                            ------------------------

     "EBITDA" is a company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization. "EBIT" is a company's earnings before interest and taxes. "EPS" is
a company's earnings per share. Using the median multiples calculated above and
estimates for the corresponding data for Pharmacia provided by the managements
of Pfizer and of Pharmacia, Lazard derived a range of implied equity values per
share of Pharmacia common stock (adjusted for Pharmacia's proposed disposition
of its interest in Monsanto Company) of approximately $23.58 to $58.75 and a
corresponding range of implied exchange ratios of approximately 0.73x to 1.82x
based on the closing share price of Pfizer common stock as of July 12, 2002.
This compares to the exchange ratio in the merger of 1.4x.

     Bear Stearns compared the projected financial performance and the price to
earnings multiples as of July 12, 2002 of Pfizer and of Pharmacia to 13 major
publicly-traded pharmaceutical and/or life science companies which Bear Stearns
deemed generally comparable to Pfizer and Pharmacia. The companies included in
the Bear Stearns analysis were:

     - Abbott Laboratories
     - AstraZeneca plc
     - Aventis S.A.
     - Bristol-Myers Squibb Company
     - Eli Lilly and Company
     - GlaxoSmithKline plc
     - Johnson & Johnson
     - Merck & Co., Inc.
     - Novartis AG
     - Roche Holdings AG
     - Sanofi-Synthelabo SA
     - Schering-Plough Corporation
     - Wyeth

     In its analysis, Bear Stearns compared the financial performance of the
combined entity (including estimated cost savings expected to result from the
merger based on estimates from Pfizer's management) and the combined entity's
pro forma price to earnings multiples (based on the income weighted average of
the estimated stand-alone price to earnings multiples of Pfizer

                                       I-52

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

and of Pharmacia (adjusted for Pharmacia's proposed disposition of its interest
in Monsanto Company)) to those of the above comparable companies.

     Based on revenue and earnings forecasts for the above comparable companies
from Wall Street research projections and consensus earnings estimates, Bear
Stearns calculated the following growth rates and multiples for the above
comparable companies:

                                                                                    PFIZER/
                                                   HARMONIC                        PHARMACIA

Revenue Growth (2002-2004)..  2.6%   12.5%  8.6%              10.6%       9.1%        9.8%

P/E for the years:
  2002......................  13.5x  24.3x           18.3x     20.4x     19.1x       21.8x
  2003......................  12.9x  23.3x           16.5x     17.5x     16.6x       17.3x
  2004......................  10.1x  20.2x           13.9x     15.2x     14.3x       14.8x

                            ------------------------

     "P/E" is equal to a company's stock price divided by its projected net
income per share for the year indicated. "Harmonic Mean" is calculated using the
reciprocals of the multiples and gives equal weight to equal dollar investments
in the securities whose ratios are being averaged. Bear Stearns utilized the
harmonic mean in averaging ratios in which price was the numerator. Based on its
analysis, Bear Stearns observed that the projected revenue and earnings growth
rates for Pfizer and for Pharmacia were above the average of the projected
growth rates of the above comparable companies, and both Pfizer's and
Pharmacia's market price to earnings multiples were above the average of the
price to earnings multiples of the above comparable companies.

     Bear Stearns also observed that the combined entity would have a projected
revenue growth rate that was above the average of the revenue growth rates of
the above comparable companies and an earnings growth rate that was higher than
those of any of the above comparable companies. In addition, Bear Stearns noted
that the combined entity's price to earnings multiples (based on stock prices as
of July 12, 2002, with Pharmacia's stock price adjusted for its proposed
disposition of its interest in Monsanto Company) were above the harmonic mean of
the price to earnings multiples of the above comparable companies.

     Exchange Ratio Analysis.  Lazard and Bear Stearns each examined the
historical daily trading exchange ratios of Pfizer common stock to Pharmacia
common stock (adjusted for Pharmacia's proposed disposition of its interest in
Monsanto Company) to assist the Pfizer board of directors in valuing Pharmacia
based on the relative historical value of Pfizer's closing share price to
Pharmacia's closing share price (adjusted for Pharmacia's proposed disposition
of its interest in Monsanto Company) for the period beginning October 18, 2000
(the date of Monsanto Company's initial public offering) and ending July 12,
2002 and for the one year, six month, three month and one month periods ended
July 12, 2002. Based on this analysis and using the closing price of Pfizer
common stock and of Pharmacia common stock (adjusted for Pharmacia's proposed
disposition of its interest in Monsanto Company) on July 12, 2002, Lazard and
Bear Stearns each derived a range of implied equity values per share for
Pharmacia common stock of approximately $24.84 to $41.74 and a corresponding
range of implied exchange ratios of approximately 0.771x to 1.296x with a mean
of 1.001x and a median of 0.9862x. This compares to the exchange ratio in the
merger of 1.4x.

     Selected Precedent Pharmaceutical Transactions Analysis.  Lazard and Bear
Stearns each performed selected precedent transactions

                                       I-53

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

analyses to assist the Pfizer board of directors in valuing Pharmacia based on
transaction values expressed as multiples of various financial measures in
selected pharmaceutical transactions.

     Using publicly available information, Lazard reviewed and analyzed certain
financial and operating data relating to selected transactions in the
pharmaceutical industry excluding transactions that Lazard determined to be
"merger of equals" transactions. These selected transactions were:

     - Pfizer Inc./Warner-Lambert Company
     - Glaxo Wellcome plc/SmithKline Beecham plc
     - Monsanto Company/Pharmacia & Upjohn, Inc.
     - Rhone-Poulenc S.A./Hoechst AG
     - Zeneca Group, plc/Astra AB
     - Sanofi SA/Synthelabo

     Lazard calculated the following multiples for the selected precedent
pharmaceutical transactions used in its analysis:

                                                  LOW     MEAN    MEDIAN    HIGH
                                                  ----    ----    ------    ----

Enterprise Value as a multiple of:
  LTM Revenue...................................  3.09x   4.94x    5.00x    7.07x
  LTM EBIT......................................  18.6x   25.9x    24.5x    35.1x
Share Price as a multiple of:
  2002E EPS.....................................  25.8x   39.3x    37.3x    52.0x

                            ------------------------

     "LTM Revenue" is a company's revenue for the last twelve months. "LTM EBIT"
is a company's earnings before interest and taxes for the last twelve months.
Lazard also reviewed the LTM Revenue, LTM EBIT and LTM EPS multiples in the
Pfizer/Warner-Lambert Company transaction, which were 7.07x, 30.8x and 50.0x,
respectively, and noted that the corresponding multiples in the current
transaction were 4.28x, 23.6x and 29.1x. Using the multiples calculated above
and estimates for the corresponding data for Pharmacia provided by the
managements of Pfizer and of Pharmacia for the twelve month period ending
December 2002 (the anticipated closing of the current transaction), Lazard
derived a range of implied equity values per share for Pharmacia common stock of
approximately $36.04 to $74.69 and a corresponding range of implied exchange
ratios of approximately 1.12x to 2.32x based on the closing share price of
Pfizer common stock as of July 12, 2002. This compares to the exchange ratio in
the merger of 1.4x.

     Using Wall Street research projections and consensus earnings estimates,
Bear Stearns reviewed and analyzed certain financial and operating data relating
to selected transactions in the pharmaceutical industry. Bear Stearns separated
the selected precedent pharmaceutical transactions it used in its analysis into
two categories: "Selected Acquisitions" transactions and "Selected Merger of
Equals" transactions. For the purposes of Bear Stearns' analysis, "Selected
Acquisitions" transactions included transactions in which the target company and
the acquiring company were clearly identifiable, consideration consisted of
stock, cash or a combination of both and a change of control occurred. "Selected
Merger of Equals" transactions included transactions in which the target company
and the acquiring company were not clearly identifiable, consideration consisted
only of stock and pro forma ownership was relatively evenly split between both
the target company's and the acquiring company's shareholders.

     The "Selected Acquisitions" transactions included in the Bear Stearns
analysis were:

     - Bristol-Myers Squibb Company/DuPont Pharmaceuticals Company
     - Johnson & Johnson/ALZA Corporation
     - Abbott Laboratories/Knoll AG (BASF AG)

                                       I-54

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

     - Rhone-Poulenc Roror Inc./Fisons plc
     - Glaxo plc/Wellcome plc
     - Hoechst AG/Marion Merrell Dow Inc.
     - American Home Products Corporation/ American Cyanamid Company
     - Roche Holdings AG/Syntex Corporation

     The "Selected Merger of Equals" transactions included in the Bear Stearns
analysis were:

     - Glaxo Wellcome plc/SmithKline Beecham plc
     - Monsanto Company/Pharmacia & Upjohn, Inc.
     - Rhone-Poulenc S.A./Hoechst AG
     - Sanofi SA/Synthelabo
     - Zeneca Group, plc/Astra AB
     - Sandoz Ltd./Ciba-Geigy Ltd.
     - Pharmacia AB/Upjohn Co.

     Bear Stearns calculated the following multiples for the selected precedent
pharmaceutical transactions used in its analysis:

                                                                HARMONIC

All Transactions (Selected Acquisitions and
  Selected Merger of Equals transactions)
Transaction Value as a multiple of:
  LTM Revenue.................................  1.48x   4.03x     2.98x     13.01x
  LTM EBIT....................................   9.5x   21.6x     18.1x      48.7x

Selected Acquisitions
Transaction Value as a multiple of:
  LTM Revenue.................................  1.48x   4.32x     3.04x     13.01x
  LTM EBIT....................................  12.1x   23.2x     19.3x      48.7x
Purchase Price as a multiple of Projected Net
  Income......................................  18.3x   30.1x     27.1x      50.9x

                            ------------------------

     "Transaction Value" is equal to the sum of the purchase price of common
equity on a fully diluted basis and the value of the net debt, any minority
interests and preferred stock. "Projected Net Income" is a target company's
projected net income for the year ending in which the transaction was announced.
Bear Stearns noted that for the Pfizer/Pharmacia merger, the transaction value
as a multiple of LTM revenue was 4.45x, the transaction value as a multiple of
LTM EBIT was 23.0x and the purchase price as a multiple of projected net income
was 29.4x.

     Based on the multiples calculated above and estimates for the corresponding
data for Pharmacia provided by the managements of Pfizer and of Pharmacia, Bear
Stearns observed that all of the transaction multiples analyzed for the
Pfizer/Pharmacia merger (adjusted for Pharmacia's proposed disposition of its
interest in Monsanto Company) fell within the range of the corresponding
multiples for the "Selected Acquisitions" transactions together with the
"Selected Merger of Equals" transactions and for the "Selected Acquisitions"
transactions alone.

     Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.  Based on cash flow and cost savings
estimates of the managements of Pfizer and of Pharmacia, Lazard and Bear Stearns

discounted cash flow analyses to assist the Pfizer board of directors in valuing
Pharmacia.

     Lazard's discounted cash flow analysis valued Pharmacia based on the
present value of expected future cash flows of Pharmacia. Lazard's discounted
cash flow analysis was based upon a range of terminal year exit multiples of
EBITDA of 14.0x to 17.0x and a range of discount rates of 10% to 12%. In its
discounted cash flow analysis, Lazard analyzed two forecast cases for Pharmacia,
one without cost savings and one with Pfizer's management's projected cost
savings expected to result from the merger (net of the projected cash cost to
realize the cost savings).

     Using this analysis, Lazard derived a range of implied equity values per
share for Pharmacia common stock (adjusted for Pharmacia's proposed disposition
of its interest in Monsanto Company) as follows:

                                                              IMPLIED EQUITY
                                                                  VALUE
                                                                PER SHARE
                                                              --------------

Pharmacia common stock:
  Forecasts without cost savings............................  $32.41-$42.88
  Forecasts with cost savings...............................  $49.02-$64.60

                            ------------------------

     Based on this analysis, Lazard derived a corresponding range of implied
exchange ratios of approximately 1.01x to 1.33x without cost savings and 1.52x
to 2.01x with cost savings based on the closing share price of Pfizer common
stock as of July 12, 2002. This compares to the exchange ratio in the merger of
1.4x.

     In performing its analysis, Bear Stearns calculated discounted cash flow
valuations for Pfizer on a stand-alone basis, for the combined entity (including
estimated cost savings expected to result from the merger based on estimates
from Pfizer's management) and for Pharmacia (including the same estimated cost
savings expected to result from the merger adjusted by the exchange ratio in the
merger of 1.4x). Bear Stearns' discounted cash flow analysis was based upon a
range of perpetual growth rates of unlevered net income of 3% to 6% and a range
of illustrative discount rates of 9% to 11%.

     Based on this analysis, Bear Stearns derived a range of implied equity
values per share for Pfizer common stock and for Pharmacia common stock
(adjusted for Pharmacia's proposed disposition of its interest in Monsanto
Company) as follows:

                                                              IMPLIED EQUITY
                                                                  VALUE
                                                                PER SHARE
                                                              --------------

Pfizer common stock:
  Stand-alone...............................................  $27.62-$64.71
  Combined entity (with estimated cost savings).............  $27.75-$66.11
Pharmacia common stock (with estimated cost savings)........  $38.86-$92.55

                            ------------------------

     The implied equity value per share of Pharmacia common stock was derived by
applying the exchange ratio in the merger of 1.4x to the range of implied equity
values per share of "Pfizer common stock combined entity

(with estimated cost savings)" calculated above.

     Precedent Transaction Premiums Paid Analysis.  Lazard and Bear Stearns each
performed a precedent transaction premiums paid analysis to assist the Pfizer
board of directors in valuing Pharmacia based upon the premiums paid in selected
transactions. In conducting their analyses, Lazard and Bear Stearns analyzed the
premiums paid in the following subsets of precedent transactions:

     - selected precedent pharmaceutical transactions (which were not "merger of
       equals" transactions);

     - selected precedent transactions over $20 billion (which were not "merger
       of equals" transactions and transactions in the financial services
       industry); and

     - selected precedent transactions over $1 billion in the pharmaceutical and
       biotech industries (which were not "merger of equals" transactions).

     The range of implied values that Lazard and Bear Stearns derived were based
on the one day, one week and one month implied premiums for the transactions
indicated. The implied premiums in this analysis were calculated by comparing
the per share transaction price at the announcement of the transaction to the
target company's stock price one day, one week and one month prior to the
announcement of the transaction.

     Selected Precedent Pharmaceutical Transactions Premiums Paid
Analysis.  Lazard and Bear Stearns each calculated a range of premiums paid in
the following selected transactions in the pharmaceutical industry:

     - Amgen Inc./Immunex Corporation
     - Johnson & Johnson/ALZA Corporation
     - Pfizer Inc./Warner-Lambert Company
     - Sanofi SA/Synthelabo
     - Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc./Fisons plc

     - Roche Holdings AG/Syntex Corporation
     - Roche Holdings AG/Genentech, Inc.
     - Rhone-Poulenc S.A./Rorer Group Inc.

     The range of median and mean premiums paid over the target's closing stock
price one day, one week and one month prior to the announcement of the
transaction was 30.6% to 47.6%. Using the closing prices for Pharmacia common
stock as of July 12, 2002, July 5, 2002 and June 14, 2002 (adjusted for
Pharmacia's proposed disposition of its interest in Monsanto Company), Lazard
and Bear Stearns derived a range of implied equity values per share for
Pharmacia common stock of approximately $35.56 to $57.62 and a corresponding
range of implied exchange ratios of approximately 1.10x to 1.79x based on the
closing share price of Pfizer common stock as of July 12, 2002. This compares to
the exchange ratio in the merger of 1.4x.

     Precedent Transactions Over $20 Billion Premiums Paid Analysis.  Lazard and
Bear Stearns each calculated a range of premiums paid in the following precedent
transactions with transaction values over $20 billion:

     - Hewlett-Packard Company/Compaq Computer Corporation
     - Chevron Corporation/Texaco Inc.

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

     - AlliedSignal Inc./Honeywell Inc.
     - AT&T Corp./MediaOne Group, Inc.
     - BP Amoco plc/Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO)
     - Ing C Olivetti & Co SpA/Telecom Italia SpA
     - Vodafone Group PLC/AirTouch Communications, Inc.
     - Lucent Technologies Inc./Ascend Communications, Inc.

     - AT&T Corp./Tele-Communications, Inc. - Class B
     - SBC Communications Inc./Ameritech Corporation
     - Daimler-Benz AG/Chrysler Corporation

     The ranges of median and mean premiums paid over the target's closing stock
price one day, one week and one month prior to the announcement of the
transaction was 20.2% to 39.7%. Using the closing prices for Pharmacia common
stock as of July 12, 2002, July 5, 2002 and June 14, 2002 (adjusted for
Pharmacia's proposed disposition of its interest in Monsanto Company), Lazard
and Bear Stearns derived a range of implied equity values per share for
Pharmacia common stock of approximately $30.14 to $68.29 and a corresponding
range of implied exchange ratios of approximately 0.94x to 2.12x based on the
closing share price of Pfizer common stock as of July 12, 2002. This compares to
the exchange ratio in the merger of 1.4x.

     PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOTECH TRANSACTIONS OVER $1 BILLION PREMIUMS PAID
ANALYSIS. Lazard and Bear Stearns calculated a range of premiums paid in the
following transactions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries with
transaction values over $1 billion:

     - Amgen Inc./Immunex Corporation
     - Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc./COR Therapeutics, Inc.
     - MedImmune, Inc./Aviron
     - Bristol-Myers Squibb Company/ImClone Systems Incorporated (this
       transaction represents an equity investment)
     - Mayne Nickless Limited/FH Faulding & Co. Limited
     - Johnson & Johnson/ALZA Corporation
     - Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc/BioChem Pharma Inc.
     - Genzyme Corporation/Geltex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
     - Elan Corporation, plc/Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
     - King Pharmaceuticals, Inc./Jones Pharma Incorporated
     - Celltech Chiroscience PLC/Medeva PLC
     - Pfizer Inc./Warner-Lambert Company
     - Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc/Roberts Pharmaceutical Corporation
     - Johnson & Johnson/Centocor, Inc.
     - Warner-Lambert Company/Agouron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

     The ranges of median and mean premiums paid over the target's closing stock
price one day, one week and one month prior to the announcement of the
transaction or proposed transaction was 19.9% to 44.8%. Using the closing prices
for Pharmacia common stock as of July 12, 2002, July 5, 2002 and June 14, 2002
(adjusted for Pharmacia's proposed disposition of its interest in Monsanto
Company), Lazard and Bear Stearns derived a range of implied equity values per
share for Pharmacia common stock of approximately $33.99 to $56.41 and a
corresponding range of implied exchange ratios of approximately 1.06x to 1.75x
based on the closing share price of Pfizer common stock as of July 12, 2002.
This compares to the exchange ratio in the merger of 1.4x.

     Illustrative Valuation of Cost Savings versus Value of Premium
Analysis.  Lazard and Bear Stearns each performed an illustrative valuation of
the projected cost savings expected to result from the merger. This analysis was
based on the hypothetical capitalized value of estimated incremental net income
assuming a

                                       I-58

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

range of price to earnings multiples of 12.5x to 20.0x, pre-tax estimated cost
savings of $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion based on estimates from Pfizer's
management (excluding one-time costs to achieve such cost savings) and tax
effected at a 32% tax rate.

     The following table shows the calculated hypothetical capitalized values of
the projected cost savings resulting from this analysis (all dollar values are
in billions):

PROJECTED COST SAVINGS:                          12.5X    15.0X    17.5X    20.0X
- -----------------------                          -----    -----    -----    -----

$2.0...........................................  $17.0    $20.4    $23.8    $27.2
 2.5...........................................   21.3     25.5     29.8     34.0

                            ------------------------

     Both Lazard and Bear Stearns compared the illustrative valuation of the
projected cost savings expected to result from the merger to the value of the
premium implied by the exchange ratio in the merger, assuming stock prices for
Pfizer common stock and for Pharmacia common stock (adjusted for Pharmacia's
proposed disposition of its interest in Monsanto Company) as of July 12, 2002
and the average prices of Pfizer common stock and of Pharmacia common stock
(adjusted for Pharmacia's proposed disposition of its interest in Monsanto
Company) for the prior 30 days. Both Lazard and Bear Stearns observed that the
calculated hypothetical capitalized values of the projected cost savings
expected to result from the merger were generally higher than the value of the
implied premiums in the merger of $20.1 billion and $19.3 billion based on the
stock prices of Pfizer common stock and of Pharmacia common stock (adjusted for
Pharmacia's proposed disposition of its interest in Monsanto Company) as of July
12, 2002 and the average prices for the 30 days prior to July 12, 2002,
respectively.

     Contribution Analysis.  Lazard and Bear Stearns each performed a
contribution analysis to assist the Pfizer board of directors in valuing
Pharmacia based on the relative contribution of each company to the combined pro
forma entity, based on the projections of the managements of Pfizer and of
Pharmacia and public information. Lazard and Bear Stearns calculated the
relative contribution by both Pfizer and Pharmacia to the combined entity with
respect to equity value at market (based on the closing share price of the
Pfizer common stock and of the Pharmacia common stock (adjusted for Pharmacia's
proposed disposition of its interest in Monsanto Company) as of July 12, 2002)
and at the 1.4x exchange ratio in the merger, and projected financial data
including revenues, EBIT and net income with and without projected cost savings.
In this analysis, Lazard and Bear Stearns each adjusted the Pfizer and Pharmacia
projections to exclude alliance revenue paid to Pfizer by Pharmacia and based
cost savings on estimates provided by Pfizer's management.

     For the calculation of Pharmacia's percentage contribution based on "2004E
Net Income (with cost savings)" and "2004E Net Income (peak)," both Lazard and
Bear Stearns included the impact of $2.2 billion ($1.5 billion after tax) and
$2.5 billion ($1.7 billion after tax) in cost savings, respectively, as
estimated by Pfizer's management.

     Pro Forma Merger Analysis.  Lazard and Bear Stearns each performed a pro
forma merger analysis to assist the Pfizer board of directors in analyzing the
financial impact of the merger on Pfizer. Lazard and Bear Stearns each reviewed
and analyzed certain pro forma financial impacts of the merger on holders of
Pfizer common stock based on the following:

     - the exchange ratio in the merger of 1.4x;

     - the financial projections provided to each of Lazard and Bear Stearns by
       the managements of Pfizer and of Pharmacia, respectively;

     - an assumption for analytical purposes, based on estimates from Pfizer's
       management, that the combination of Pfizer and Pharmacia would realize
       projected pre-tax cost savings of $1.4 billion and $2.2 billion in 2003
       and 2004, respectively (tax-effected at a 32% tax rate);

     - an assumption for analytical purposes that the earnings impact would be
       presented on the basis of adjusted earnings (as described below); and

     - an assumption for analytical purposes, based on public statements made by
       Pfizer's management, that Pfizer would expand its previously announced
       share repurchase program from $10 billion to $16 billion via open market
       purchases as well as accelerate the buyback period with the anticipation
       of completing the program in 2003.

     The following table shows the projected per share accretion/(dilution) to
Pfizer's pro forma adjusted earnings, including the projected cost savings for
the calendar years presented. For the purpose of this analysis, adjusted
earnings is equal to GAAP net income, plus the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle, plus certain significant items, plus charges related to
purchase price allocations on assets (including write-off of in-process research
and development, amortization of identifiable intangibles and charges related to
write-up of assets to fair market value) and plus merger-related costs
(including integration expenses and restructuring charges).

MISCELLANEOUS

     In connection with rendering the Lazard opinion and the Bear Stearns
opinion, Lazard and Bear Stearns each respectively performed a variety of
financial analyses. The preparation of a fairness opinion involves various
determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial
analysis and the application of these methods to the particular circumstances
and, therefore, such an opinion is not readily susceptible to a partial analysis
or summary description. Accordingly, notwithstanding the separate analyses
summarized above, each of Lazard and Bear Stearns believes that its analyses
must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the analyses and
factors considered by them, without considering all such analyses and factors,
or attempting to ascribe relative weights to some or all such analyses and
factors, could create an incomplete view of the evaluation process underlying
the Lazard opinion and the Bear Stearns opinion.

     In performing their respective analyses, each of Lazard and Bear Stearns
made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business
and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control
of Pfizer. The analyses performed by Lazard and Bear Stearns are not necessarily
indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly
more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses. Neither Lazard nor Bear
Stearns assigned any specific weight to any of the analyses described above and
did not draw any specific conclusions from or with regard to any one method of
analysis. With respect to the analysis of comparable companies and the analysis
of selected precedent transactions summarized above, no public company utilized
as a comparison is identical to Pfizer or Pharmacia, and no transaction is
identical to the merger. Accordingly, an analysis of publicly traded comparable
companies and comparable business combinations is not mathematical; rather, it
involves complex considerations and judgments concerning the differences in
financial and operating characteristics of the companies and other factors that
could affect the public trading values or announced merger transaction values,
as the case may be, of Pfizer or Pharmacia and the companies to which they were
compared. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices
at which any securities may trade at the present time or at any time in the
future. In addition, the Lazard opinion and the Bear Stearns opinion were just
two of many factors taken into consideration by Pfizer's board of directors.
Consequently, Lazard's and Bear Stearns' analysis should not be viewed as
determinative of the decision of Pfizer's board of directors or Pfizer's
management with respect to the fairness of the exchange ratio as set forth in
the merger agreement.

     Lazard and Bear Stearns are internationally recognized investment banking
firms and are each continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated
underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities,
private placements, leveraged buyouts and valuations for estate, corporate and
other purposes.

     Lazard was selected to act as investment banker to the Pfizer board of
directors because of its expertise and its reputation in investment banking and
mergers and acquisitions and its familiarity with the pharmaceutical industry
and Pfizer. Pfizer and Lazard have entered into a letter agreement, dated as of
July 8, 2002, relating to the services to be provided by Lazard in connection
with the merger and the transactions related to it, under which Pfizer has
agreed to pay Lazard customary compensation, a substantial portion of which is
payable only upon completion of the merger. Pfizer also agreed to reimburse
Lazard for certain out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the
engagement. In addition, Pfizer agreed to indemnify Lazard against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities law, relating to
or arising out of its engagement.

     Bear Stearns was selected to act as financial advisor to the Pfizer board
of directors because of its expertise and its reputation in

                                       I-61

investment banking and mergers and acquisitions and its familiarity with the
pharmaceutical industry and Pfizer. Pfizer and Bear Stearns have entered into a
letter agreement, dated as of July 13, 2002, relating to the services to be
provided by Bear Stearns in connection with the merger and the transactions
related to it, under which Pfizer has agreed to pay Bear Stearns customary
compensation, a substantial portion of which is payable only upon completion of
the merger. Pfizer agreed to reimburse Bear Stearns for certain out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with the engagement. In addition, Pfizer agreed
to indemnify Bear Stearns against certain liabilities, including liabilities
under the federal securities law, relating to or arising out of its engagement.

OPINION OF PHARMACIA'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     Goldman Sachs delivered its opinion to the Pharmacia board of directors
that, as of July 13, 2002 and based upon and subject to the factors and
assumptions set forth therein, the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger
agreement was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of Pharmacia
common stock.

     The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated July 13, 2002,
which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered
and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is
attached as Annex D. Holders of Pharmacia common stock should read the opinion
in its entirety. Goldman Sachs provided its opinion for the information and
assistance of the Pharmacia board of directors in connection with its
consideration of the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement. The
Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of Pharmacia
common stock should vote with respect to such transaction.

     In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its
related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:

     - the merger agreement;

     - Annual Reports to Shareholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of
       Pharmacia and Pfizer for each of the five years ended December 31, 2001;

     - certain interim reports to shareholders and Quarterly Reports on Form
       10-Q of Pharmacia and Pfizer;

     - certain other communications from Pharmacia and Pfizer to their
       respective shareholders; and

     - certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for Pharmacia and
       Pfizer prepared by their respective managements, including certain cost
       savings and operating synergies expected to result from the transaction
       contemplated by the merger agreement (the "Synergies").

     Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management
of Pharmacia and Pfizer regarding their assessments of the strategic rationale
for, and the potential benefits of, the transaction contemplated by the merger
agreement and the past and current business operations, financial condition and
future prospects of their respective companies. In addition, Goldman Sachs
reviewed the reported price and trading activity for Pharmacia common stock and
Pfizer common stock, compared certain financial and stock market information for
Pharmacia and Pfizer with similar information for certain other companies the
securities of which are publicly traded, reviewed the financial terms of certain
recent business combinations in the pharmaceutical industry specifically and in
other industries generally and performed such other studies and analyses as it
considered appropriate.

     Goldman Sachs relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial, accounting and other information discussed with or reviewed by it and
assumed such accuracy and completeness for purposes of rendering the opinion
described above. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed, with the consent of the
Pharmacia board of directors, that the internal financial forecasts prepared by
the respective managements of Pharmacia and Pfizer, including the Synergies,
were reasonably

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and
judgments of Pharmacia and Pfizer. In addition, Goldman Sachs did not make an
independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities of Pharmacia
or Pfizer or any of their respective subsidiaries. No evaluation or appraisal of
the assets or liabilities of Pharmacia or Pfizer or any of their respective
subsidiaries was furnished to Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs also assumed that all
material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for
the completion of the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement will be
obtained without any adverse effect on Pharmacia or Pfizer or on the expected
benefits of the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement. In addition,
Goldman Sachs assumed that the proposed spin-off of Pharmacia's 84% interest in
Monsanto Company to holders of Pharmacia common stock will be completed prior to
the completion of the merger contemplated by the merger agreement.

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by
Goldman Sachs in connection with rendering the opinion described above. The
following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the
financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs. The order of analyses described
does not represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by
Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include
information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with
the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of
Goldman Sachs' financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following
quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is
based on market data as it existed on or before July 13, 2002 and is not
necessarily indicative of current market conditions. In addition, the
quantitative information presented below with respect to Pharmacia or Pharmacia
common stock have been adjusted to exclude Pharmacia's 84% interest in Monsanto
Company, which will be distributed to holders of Pharmacia common stock prior to
the completion of the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement.

     Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis. Goldman Sachs calculated the implied
exchange ratios of Pharmacia common stock to Pfizer common stock based on the
average closing share prices of Pharmacia common stock and Pfizer common stock
for the three-month, six-month and twelve-month periods ended July 12, 2002 and
on the closing share prices of Pfizer common stock and Pharmacia common stock on
July 12, 2002, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the execution
of the merger agreement. This analysis indicated that the implied exchange ratio
for each of these periods was 1.00, 0.94 and 0.92, respectively, and on July 12,
2002 was 0.92, while the exchange ratio in the merger agreement was 1.4.

     Implied Premium Analysis.  Goldman Sachs compared the merger consideration
to be received by holders of Pharmacia common stock based on the exchange ratio
of 1.40 and the closing share price of Pfizer common stock of $32.20 on July 12,
2002, to the closing share price of Pharmacia common stock of $32.59 on July 12,
2002 and to the average closing share prices for Pharmacia common stock and
Pfizer common stock for the three-month and six-month periods ended July 12,
2002. This analysis indicated that the consideration per share of Pharmacia
common stock to be received by Pharmacia common shareholders pursuant to the
merger agreement represented a premium of 52.4%, 40.0% and 48.3%, respectively.

     Contribution Analysis.  Goldman Sachs analyzed the relative income
statement contribution of Pharmacia and Pfizer to the combined company following
completion of the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement, before
taking into account any of the possible benefits that may be realized following
the transaction but adjusting Pharmacia's sales for the Celebrex(R) payment it
makes to Pfizer, for the year 2002, based on financial data and on the
assumptions provided to Goldman Sachs by Pharmacia and Pfizer managements.

                            ------------------------

     The contribution of Pharmacia to the combined company, based on the market
capitalizations of Pharmacia and Pfizer using the market prices of Pharmacia and
Pfizer common stock on July 12, 2002, was 15.9%.

     Goldman Sachs compared all of the above results with the expected
percentage ownership of Pharmacia common shareholders in the combined company of
22.4% based on fully diluted shares of each company outstanding as of March 30,
2002.

     Selected Companies Analysis.  Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared certain
financial information, ratios and public market multiples for Pharmacia and
Pfizer to corresponding financial information, ratios and public market
multiples for the following publicly traded U.S. corporations in the
pharmaceutical industry:

     - Johnson & Johnson
     - Merck & Co., Inc.
     - Eli Lilly and Company
     - Abbott Laboratories
     - Wyeth
     - Bristol-Myers Squibb Company
     - Schering-Plough Corporation

     Although none of the selected companies is directly comparable to Pharmacia
or Pfizer, the companies included were chosen because they are publicly traded
U.S. companies with operations that for purposes of analysis may be considered
similar to certain operations of Pharmacia and Pfizer.

     Goldman Sachs also calculated and compared various financial multiples and
ratios based on information it obtained from the latest available SEC filings
and Institutional Broker Estimate Service, or IBES, and First Call estimates.
The multiples and ratios for each of the selected companies and Pharmacia and
Pfizer were calculated using the closing share prices on July 12, 2002. Goldman
Sachs calculated and compared the following multiples:

     - enterprise value, which is the market value of common equity plus the
       book value of debt less cash, as a multiple of sales for the latest
       twelve months, or LTM; and

     - enterprise value as a multiple of latest twelve months earnings before
       interest and taxes, or EBIT.

     The results of these analyses are summarized as follows:

estimated price/earnings ratios for calendar years 2002 and 2003 to the
estimated price/earnings ratios for Pharmacia and Pfizer for the same periods.

     Selected Transactions Analysis.  Goldman Sachs analyzed certain information
relating to the following selected transactions in the pharmaceutical industry
since 1989:

     - acquisition of Warner-Lambert Company by Pfizer in 2000

     - acquisition of Wellcome PLC by Glaxo PLC in 1995

     - acquisition of Squibb Corporation by Bristol-Myers Company in 1989

     For each of the selected transactions, Goldman Sachs calculated and
compared the aggregate consideration as a multiple of latest twelve months EBIT
and equity consideration as a multiple of latest twelve months net income.

     The following table presents the results of this analysis:

                                                        SELECTED

                            ------------------------

     For each of the selected transactions, Goldman Sachs also calculated and
compared the premiums represented by the per share consideration in relation to
the closing share prices of the acquired company's common stock one day prior to
announcement (with the exception of Warner-Lambert Company and Pfizer which was
one day prior to the offer made for Warner-Lambert Company by American Home
Products Corporation), four weeks prior to announcement, and to the 52-week high
closing share price of the acquired company's common stock prior to
announcement.

                            ------------------------

     Pro Forma Merger Analysis.  Goldman Sachs prepared pro forma analyses of
the financial impact of the merger using earnings estimates for Pharmacia and
Pfizer prepared by their respective managements. For each of the years 2003 and
2004, Goldman Sachs compared the estimated earnings per share of Pharmacia
common stock on a standalone basis and the estimated earnings per share of
Pfizer common stock on a standalone basis, to the estimated earnings per share
of the common stock of the pro forma combined company on a cash earnings per
share basis, which excludes the amortization of intangible assets. Goldman Sachs
performed this analysis based on the exchange ratio of 1.40 and the operating
synergies projected by the management of Pfizer to result from the merger. Based
on such analyses, the proposed transaction would be (1) accretive to Pharmacia
common shareholders on a cash earnings per share basis in the years 2003 and
2004, (2) neither accretive nor dilutive to Pfizer common shareholders on a cash
earnings per share basis in the year 2003 and (3) accretive to Pfizer's common
shareholders on a cash earnings per share basis in the year 2004.

     In addition, based on the current 2002 dividend pay-out ratios for
Pharmacia common stock and Pfizer common stock of 35%, or $0.54 per share, and
33%, or $0.52 per share, respectively, Pharmacia common shareholders would
receive an additional $0.22 in dividends on a pro forma per share basis based on
estimated earnings per share in the year 2003 and an additional $0.30 per share
based on estimated earnings per share in the year 2004.

     Illustrative Future Value.  Using the same earnings estimates described
above for the years 2003 and 2004 and the median of certain Wall Street analyst
estimates for the years 2005 and 2006, Goldman Sachs also calculated
illustrative future values of the merger consideration payable to holders of
Pharmacia common stock (including anticipated synergies and other pro forma
adjustments) for 2003, 2004 and 2005, using one-year forward price/earnings
multiples ranging from 16.0x to 22.0x. Goldman Sachs also used these earnings
estimates to calculate illustrative future values of Pharmacia common stock on a
stand-alone basis for 2003, 2004 and 2005, using the same price/earnings
multiples, and then compared the illustrative future values calculated with
respect to the merger consideration to be paid with the illustrative future
values calculated with respect to the Pharmacia common stock on a stand-alone
basis. In each case, the illustrative future values calculated with respect to
the merger consideration payable to Pharmacia common shareholders were greater
than the corresponding illustrative future values calculated with respect to the
Pharmacia common stock on a stand-alone basis.

     The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not
necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting
portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering
the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes
underlying Goldman Sachs' opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination,
Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not
attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it.
Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its
experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its
analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison
is directly

comparable to Pharmacia or Pfizer or the contemplated transaction.

     Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses solely for purposes of Goldman Sachs'
providing its opinion to the Pharmacia board of directors as to the fairness
from a financial point of view of the transaction contemplated by the merger
agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect
the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses
based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual
future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested
by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty,
being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or
their respective advisors, none of Pharmacia, Pfizer, Goldman Sachs or any other
person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from
those forecast.

     As described above, Goldman Sachs' opinion to the Pharmacia board of
directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Pharmacia
board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger agreement.
The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the
analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman
Sachs attached as Annex D.

     Goldman Sachs, as part of its investment banking business, is continually
engaged in performing financial analyses with respect to businesses and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated
underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and
unlisted securities and private placements as well as for estate, corporate and
other purposes. Goldman Sachs is familiar with Pharmacia, having provided
certain investment banking services to Pharmacia from time to time, including:

     - having acted as its financial advisor in connection with the sale of its
       45% stake in Amersham Biosciences to Amersham plc in March 2002 for $1
       billion;

     - having acted as lead manager of the initial public offering of 35,000,000
       shares of common stock of its then wholly owned subsidiary, Monsanto
       Company, in October 2000; and

     - having acted as its financial advisor in connection with, and having
       participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the merger
       agreement with Pfizer.

     In addition, Goldman Sachs advised Pharmacia on the spin-off of its 84%
interest in Monsanto Company to holders of Pharmacia common stock. Goldman Sachs
may provide investment banking services to Pfizer and its subsidiaries in the
future.

     The Pharmacia board of directors selected Goldman Sachs as its financial
advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that
has substantial experience in transactions similar to the transaction
contemplated by the merger agreement.

     Goldman Sachs provides a full range of financial, advisory and securities
services and, in the course of its normal trading activities, may from time to
time effect transactions and hold positions in the debt or equity securities,
including derivative securities, of Pharmacia or Pfizer for its own account and
for the account of customers.

     Pursuant to letter agreements dated May 13, 2002 and July 2, 2002,
Pharmacia engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection
with the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement. Pursuant to the terms
of these engagement letters, Pharmacia has agreed to pay Goldman Sachs a
customary transaction fee, which is payable upon completion of the transaction.
In addition, Pharmacia has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for its reasonable
expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman
Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain
liabilities under the federal securities laws.

                   INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER

     Pharmacia's directors and executive officers have interests in the merger
as individuals in addition to, and that may be different from, their interests
as shareholders. Each of the Pfizer board of directors and the Pharmacia board
of directors was aware of these interests of Pharmacia directors and executive
officers and considered them in its decision to approve the merger agreement.

NEW EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT WITH FRED HASSAN

     Pfizer has entered into an employment agreement, dated July 13, 2002, with
Mr. Fred Hassan, the current chief executive officer of Pharmacia, that, upon
completion of the merger, will replace and supersede certain provisions of his
existing employment agreement, dated November 15, 1999 with Pharmacia. Pfizer
has acknowledged that Mr. Hassan may resign for "good reason" (as that term is
defined in the existing employment agreement) at completion of the merger and
receive compensation and benefits under the terms of the existing employment
agreement. Accordingly, Pfizer will pay the compensation and benefits due to Mr.
Hassan under the existing employment agreement as follows:

     - three years of base salary and annual target incentive compensation
       calculated using the highest annual base salary and the highest annual
       target incentive compensation received during the 3 years prior to
       termination (estimated to equal approximately $9,922,500), which amount
       will be payable at the end of the active employment term under the new
       employment agreement as described below;

     - additional years service credit (assuming employment continued through
       November 30, 2004) towards retirement benefits, which shall be calculated
       assuming Mr. Hassan had received such additional years of salary and
       incentive compensation equal to the highest annual base salary and
       highest annual target incentive compensation received within three years
       prior to the date of termination;

     - exercisability of options (all of which will become vested) for their
       maximum term under the applicable plan;

     - lapse of restrictions on any restricted shares granted to Mr. Hassan
       under the existing employment agreement;

     - pro-rated annual incentive compensation based on portion of year worked
       prior to termination;

     - three years continued welfare benefits for Mr. Hassan and his dependents,
       to the extent they are not offset by benefits from another source; and

     - payment for outplacement services up to $100,000.

     The term of Mr. Hassan's new employment agreement begins on the completion
of the merger and the term of his active employment with Pfizer terminates on
the earlier of (1) the first anniversary of the completion of the merger or (2)
a termination of employment for any reason or Mr. Hassan's resignation, unless
the term of agreement is extended by Pfizer at its discretion until the second
anniversary of the completion of the merger. Pursuant to Mr. Hassan's employment
agreement, Mr. Hassan will serve as Vice Chairman of Pfizer and as a member of
Pfizer's board of directors. After the expiration of the active employment term,
Mr. Hassan will serve as a consultant until the earlier of (1) five years after
the commencement of his employment as a consultant, or (2) any termination
contemplated by the agreement or Mr. Hassan's resignation.

     Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, during the term of his active
employment, Mr. Hassan will receive (1) an annual base salary of $1,500,000, and
(2) an annual incen-

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

tive bonus target in an amount of 125% of his base salary. In addition, Mr.
Hassan will be entitled to receive an equity award in the first year of 900,000
options to purchase shares of Pfizer common stock, which options vest according
to Pfizer's stock option plan but which will become fully vested upon the end of
the active employment term and remain exercisable for the duration of their
10-year term. During his employment as a consultant, Mr. Hassan will receive an
annual consulting fee of $850,000 ($1,500,000 for the first year if Pfizer does
not continue the active employment term beyond the first anniversary of the
completion of the merger).

     During the term of his active employment, Mr. Hassan will also be entitled
to participate in benefit plans and other benefits arrangements of Pharmacia, as
assumed by Pfizer, including, but not limited to, medical (including retiree
medical), dental, accidental death and disability benefit plans. He will be
credited with all his years of service with Pharmacia and with Pharmacia &
Upjohn for purposes of determining his level of benefits. During the active
employment term and the consulting term, Mr. Hassan will be eligible to
participate in executive perquisite programs on the same basis as comparable
executives.

     In the event that during the term of his active employment Mr. Hassan's
employment is terminated by Pfizer without cause (as defined in the agreement)
or by Mr. Hassan for good reason (as such term is defined below), Mr. Hassan
will be entitled to receive a lump-sum payment of (1) his base salary for the
remainder of the originally scheduled active employment term and (2) five years
of his consulting fee (one year of which shall be at $1,500,000 if the active
employment term does not continue beyond the first anniversary of the completion
of the merger).

     In the event that Mr. Hassan's employment is terminated without cause or
for good reason during the term of his employment as a consultant, he will be
entitled to a lump-sum payment of the balance of the consulting fees for the
remainder of the originally scheduled consulting term.

     Under the agreement, the term "good reason" means:

     - reduction of the annual base salary or of the target amount of the annual
       incentive bonus;

     - reduction of the annual consulting fee;

     - change in reporting so that Mr. Hassan no longer reports to Pfizer's
       chief executive officer;

     - assignment of duties which are materially inconsistent with Mr. Hassan's
       duties or materially impair Mr. Hassan's ability to function as a Vice
       Chairman (applicable only during the active employment term);

     - failure to nominate Mr. Hassan for election (or reelection) to the board
       of directors (applicable only during the active employment term);

     - relocation of Mr. Hassan's regular place of business outside of New
       Jersey; or

     - failure of any successor to assume the agreement.

     If any amounts payable to Mr. Hassan under the employment agreement would
be determined to constitute a parachute payment (as defined under Section
280G(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code), Pfizer will provide for a full
gross-up.

OTHER EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

     Pharmacia maintains employment agreements with the following executive
officers: Goran Ando, Hakan Astrom, Richard T. Collier, Timothy Cost,
Christopher J. Coughlin, Carrie Cox, Stephen MacMillan, Philip Needleman, and
Timothy Rothwell (together with Mr. Hassan, the "executive officers").

     Under the agreements, these executive officers (excluding Mr. Hassan) are
entitled to receive severance benefits upon termination of employment if the
termination is without "cause", as defined in the agreements, or is by the
executive for "good reason". For purposes

                                       I-69

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

of the agreements, the term "good reason" means:

     - a reduction in base salary or target amount of any cash incentive bonus
       or any other benefit under any long-term incentive award;

     - the failure to retain the executive in his or her position and title;

     - during the two-year period after a change in control (as defined in the
       agreements), assignment by Pharmacia of any duties materially
       inconsistent with, or any other unremedied action taken by Pharmacia
       which results in a diminution to, the executive's title, position,
       status, reporting relationships, authority, duties or responsibilities as
       they existed immediately prior to such two-year period;

     - failures by any successor (or subsidiary or affiliate thereof) to assume
       Pharmacia's obligations under the agreement;

     - a termination which is not in accordance with the terms of the employment
       agreement;

     - during the two-year period following a change in control, a failure by
       Pharmacia to keep in effect any employee benefit plan applicable to the
       executive prior to a change in control, unless comparable benefits are
       provided; or

     - during the two-year period following a change in control, relocation of
       the executive out of state or more than 50 miles within the state where
       the executive's office was located prior to the change in control or an
       increase in required business travel (as compared to pre-change in
       control standards).

     For purposes of the agreements, completion of the merger will constitute a
change in control.

     Upon termination without cause or for good reason, severance benefits
include, in addition to accrued amounts:

     (A) a lump sum severance payment equal to three years of base salary and
annual target incentive compensation (calculated using the executive's highest
annual base salary and highest annual target incentive compensation within three
years prior to the executive's date of termination) is payable within 10 days
after termination during the two-year period following a change in control;

     (B) three additional years of service credit towards retirement benefits
which shall be calculated as if the executive had received three additional
years of salary and incentive compensation equal to the highest annual base
salary and highest annual incentive compensation received within the three years
prior to such executive's date of termination;

     (C) exercisability of all stock options granted prior to the executive's
termination for their maximum period under the terms of the grant;

     (D) pro-rated target annual incentive compensation based on the portion of
the year worked prior to termination (payable within 10 days after termination
during the two-year period following a change in control);

     (E) three years of continued welfare benefits for the executive and
dependents, to the extent they are not offset by benefits from another source;

     (F) payment for outplacement services up to $25,000; and

     (G) three years of financial planning assistance.

     All of the above clauses are applicable to Goran Ando, Hakan Astrom,
Richard T. Collier, Timothy Cost, Christopher J. Coughlin, Carrie Cox, Stephen
MacMillan, and Timothy Rothwell. In the case of Philip Needleman, clauses B
through G are applicable, but clause (A) does not apply to Mr. Needleman who
instead receives a fixed lump-sum payment of $4,764,006.

     In addition, if the executive officer (excluding Mr. Hassan) is terminated
(for any reason other than for death or disability) within two years following a
change in control, the non-compete clause in the employment agreement ceases to
apply.

                                       I-70

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

     The aggregate cash severance payable to the executive officers (excluding
Mr. Hassan) under the employment agreements for a termination without cause or
for good reason would be approximately $[       ].

     Currently, each executive officer participates in the Key Executive Pension
Plan. Upon shareholder adoption of the merger agreement, Timothy Cost will
become eligible to participate in the Key Executive Pension Plan as if he had
become eligible beginning with such executive's employment with the company.
Under the terms of the Key Executive Pension Plan, participants fully vest in
their supplemental benefits upon shareholder adoption of the merger agreement.
If (1) the participant's employment is terminated for good reason (as defined in
the individual employment agreement), (2) the termination qualifies as a
termination due to a change in control (as defined in the Separation Benefit
Plan or the Change in Control Severance Benefit Plan) or (3) the participant is
involuntarily terminated other than for cause, in each case, prior to early
retirement at age 60 and within 36 months after shareholder adoption of the
merger agreement, the participant's benefit, which will be paid out in
accordance with the terms of the plan, will be calculated as if he retired at
age 60 assuming that compensation would have increased by 5% per year for each
year between shareholder adoption and the participant's actual attainment of age
60, and in accordance with any applicable employment agreement. The benefit
payable is discounted based on the 30-year Treasury Bond rate in effect at the
time of payment and is offset by certain other Pharmacia and other prior
employer plans.

     The aggregate value of the additional supplemental retirement benefit under
the Key Executive Pension Plan pursuant to a termination of the executive
officers under clauses (1), (2) or (3) above would be approximately $[       ].

EXECUTIVE BENEFIT PLANS

     Pharmacia maintains various executive benefit plans which provide for the
acceleration or increase of benefits upon either shareholder adoption of the
merger agreement or upon completion of the merger, depending on the terms of the
plan.

OPERATIONS COMMITTEE INCENTIVE PLAN

     The executive officers participate in the Operations Committee Incentive
Plan and will vest in their pro-rated awards (being the greater of the target
annual incentive award or the incentive award reflecting year-end projected
performance based on the year-to-date performance) upon completion of the
merger. If an executive officer is terminated other than for cause after
completion of the merger and prior to December 15, 2002, the executive receives
his vested pro-rated annual award within 10 days of such termination.

     The aggregate amount of vested awards under the Operations Committee
Incentive Plan payable to the executive officers upon termination following a
change in control would be approximately $[       ].

CASH LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN AND LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT INCENTIVE
PLAN

     Pursuant to the terms of the Cash Long-Term Incentive Plan and the
Long-Term Performance Share Unit Incentive Plan, pro-rated awards (being the
greater of the participant's target award or the award payable based on the
period-to-date performance calculated as of the date of the change in control)
vest upon the completion of the merger. The award increases to 200% of the
participant's target award (1) if the participant is still employed with the
company two years after a change in control; (2) if such participant is
involuntarily terminated without cause (as defined in the plans) or voluntarily
terminated for good reason (as such term is defined in the executive employment
agreements described above) within two years of the completion of the merger or
(3) if the termination qualifies as a termination due to a change in control (as
defined in the Separation Benefit Plan or the Change in Control Severance
Benefit Plan) only if such amount is greater than the award

                                       I-71

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

previously calculated pursuant to the parenthetical in the previous sentence.

     The amount of vested awards under the Cash Long-Term Incentive Plan payable
to the executive officers upon termination following a change in control would
be approximately $[          ] and the number of performance shares then vested
under the Long-Term Performance Share Unit Incentive Plan and payable to the
executive officers would be approximately [          ].

EXCESS PARACHUTE TAX INDEMNITY PLAN

     Under the Excess Parachute Tax Indemnity Plan, a change in control is
described as any event that is a "change" as defined in Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i)
of the Internal Revenue Code. The completion of the merger will constitute a
"change" as defined under that section. Upon such a change in control, the plan
provides for an excise tax gross-up to all current and former employees other
than current and former employees and directors of Monsanto Company who do not
also serve on Pharmacia's board of directors.

FOUNDERS PERFORMANCE CONTINGENT SHARES PROGRAM

     Upon the completion of the merger during the performance period (as defined
in the program), target awards provided under the Founders Performance
Contingent Shares Program vest at the greater of the target award or the
percentage of the target award payable based on the period-to-date performance
calculated as of the date of the change in control. The award increases to 125%
of the participant's target award if the participant is employed by the company
or an affiliate two years after the change in control, or is involuntarily
terminated other than for cause within two years after change in control and, if
such amount is greater than the calculation above. The concept of "involuntary
termination" includes a termination for good reason (as defined in the executive
employment agreements described above). The estimated number of share units
payable to Fred Hassan, Goran Ando, Christopher J. Coughlin, Carrie Cox, Philip
Needleman, and Timothy Rothwell under the Founders Performance Contingent Shares
Program upon termination for good reason following a change in control would be
approximately [          ].

Hassan" on page  , respectively.

TREATMENT OF PHARMACIA STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK

     In the merger, each outstanding Pharmacia stock option for Pharmacia common
stock will be converted into an option to purchase Pfizer common stock. Each
outstanding Pharmacia stock option will become vested and fully exercisable
either upon adoption of the merger agreement by Pharmacia shareholders or upon
completion of the merger, depending on the terms of the applicable stock option
plan, grant, employment agreement or other arrangement under which such option
was issued. The number of shares of Pfizer common stock underlying the new
Pfizer option will equal the number of shares of Pharmacia common stock to which
the corresponding Pharmacia option was subject, multiplied by 1.4. The per share
exercise price of each new Pfizer option will be equal to the exercise price of
the corresponding Pharmacia option divided by 1.4. All other terms of the
Pharmacia stock option will remain unchanged after the conversion. The dollar
amount of in-the-money options held by Pharmacia's executive officers and
directors that will become vested upon such adoption or completion, as the case
may be, is approximately $[          ], based on a closing sale price of
Pharmacia common stock on the NYSE on [          ].

     All shares of restricted Pharmacia common stock will vest either upon
adoption of the merger agreement by Pharmacia shareholders or upon completion of
the merger, depending on the terms of the applicable plan, grant, employment
agreement or other arrangement under which such restricted stock was granted,
and will be treated in the merger like other shares of Pharmacia common stock.
Approximately 383,000 shares of restricted Pharmacia common stock held by
executive officers and directors will have their restrictions lapse upon
shareholder adoption of the merger agreement and completion of the merger.

INDEMNIFICATION; DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INSURANCE

     Pfizer is obligated, for six years after the merger, to maintain in effect
Pharmacia's current directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring prior to the completion
of the merger, including for acts and omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of the merger and the merger agreement.

     Pfizer is obligated, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to indemnify
and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, each person who is or
has been an officer, director or employee of Pharmacia or any of its
subsidiaries with respect to acts or omissions by them in their capacities as
officers, directors or employees of Pharmacia or any of its subsidiaries,
including for acts and omissions occurring in connection with the approval of
the merger and the merger agreement. Pfizer will also cause the surviving
corporation in the merger to maintain in its certificate of incorporation or by-
laws the current provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors,
indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of expenses
for a period of six years.

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The following is a summary of the material terms of the merger agreement.
This summary does not purport to describe all the terms of the merger agreement
and is qualified by reference to the complete merger agreement which is attached
as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and incorporated by
reference. All shareholders of Pfizer and Pharmacia are urged to read the merger
agreement carefully and in its entirety.

GENERAL

     Under the merger agreement, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer will merge
with and into Pharmacia, with Pharmacia continuing as the surviving corporation.
As a result of the merger, Pharmacia will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Pfizer.

CLOSING MATTERS

     Closing.  Unless the parties agree otherwise, the closing of the merger
will take place on the first business day after all closing conditions have been
satisfied or waived, unless the merger agreement has been terminated or another
time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties. See "-- Conditions" below
for a more complete description of the conditions that must be satisfied or
waived prior to closing.

     Completion of the Merger.  As soon as practicable after the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions to the merger, Pfizer and Pharmacia will file a
certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and make all
other required filings or recordings. The merger will become effective when the
certificate of merger is filed or at such later time as Pfizer and Pharmacia
agree and specify in the certificate of merger.

CONSIDERATION TO BE RECEIVED IN THE MERGER; TREATMENT OF STOCK OPTIONS

     The merger agreement provides that, at the completion of the merger:

     - each share of Pharmacia common stock issued and outstanding immediately
       prior to the completion of the merger, together with the associated
       rights issued under the Pharmacia shareholder rights plan, but excluding
       shares of Pharmacia common stock owned by Pfizer, Pharmacia or any of
       their respective subsidiaries, will be converted into 1.4 shares of
       Pfizer common stock and associated rights issued under the Pfizer
       shareholders rights plan;

     - each outstanding share of Pharmacia Series C convertible perpetual
       preferred stock (which will be received by the holder in exchange for its
       Pharmacia Series B convertible perpetual preferred stock prior to
       completion of the merger), other than shares as to which appraisal rights
       have been exercised, will, at the completion of the merger, be converted
       into one share of Pfizer Series A convertible perpetual preferred stock
       having, to the extent possible, terms identical to those of the Pharmacia
       Series C convertible perpetual preferred stock; and

     - each outstanding and unexercised option or right to purchase shares of
       Pharmacia common stock granted under the Pharmacia stock plans will be
       assumed by Pfizer and converted into an option or a right to purchase, as
       applicable, shares of Pfizer common stock. The number of shares of Pfizer
       common stock underlying the new Pfizer option will equal the number of
       shares of Pharmacia common stock for which the corresponding Pharmacia
       option was exercisable, multiplied by 1.4 (rounded to the nearest whole
       share). The per share exercise price of each new Pfizer option will

                                       I-74

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

       equal the exercise price of the corresponding Pharmacia option divided by
       1.4.

     As soon as practicable after the completion of the merger, but no later
than five business days, Pfizer will deliver notices to the holders of Pharmacia
stock options. Those notices will set forth each holder's rights under the
Pharmacia stock plans, including that, in connection with the merger and
pursuant to the terms of the Pharmacia stock plans, the agreements evidencing
the grants of the Pharmacia stock options will continue in effect on the same
terms and conditions, taking into account provisions providing for full vesting
of those options and the adjustments to the number of shares underlying, and the
exercise price of, the options. To the extent permitted by law, Pfizer will
comply with the terms of the Pharmacia stock plans and will take reasonable
steps to ensure that the stock options which qualified as incentive stock
options prior to the completion of the merger continue to qualify as incentive
stock options of the combined company after the merger.

     For a further discussion of the treatment of Pharmacia stock options and
other employee benefit plans under the merger agreement, see
"-- Covenants -- Employee Matters" on page      and "Interests of Certain
Persons in the Merger" beginning on page      .

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES IN THE MERGER

     Before the closing of the merger, Pfizer will appoint an exchange agent
(which must be reasonably acceptable to Pharmacia) to handle the exchange of
Pharmacia stock certificates for certificates representing shares of Pfizer
common stock and the payment of cash for fractional shares. Promptly after the
closing of the merger, the exchange agent will send a letter of transmittal,
which is to be used to exchange Pharmacia stock certificates for certificates
representing shares of Pfizer common stock, to each former Pharmacia shareholder
who holds one or more stock certificates. The letter of transmittal will contain
instructions explaining the procedure for surrendering Pharmacia stock
certificates. YOU SHOULD NOT RETURN CERTIFICATES WITH THE ENCLOSED PROXY CARD.

     Pharmacia shareholders who surrender their stock certificates, together
with a properly completed letter of transmittal, will receive shares of Pfizer
common stock into which the shares of Pharmacia common stock were converted in
the merger or shares of Pfizer Series A convertible perpetual preferred stock
into which the shares of Pharmacia Series C convertible perpetual preferred
stock were converted in the merger.

     After the merger, each certificate that previously represented shares of
Pharmacia common stock and Pharmacia Series C convertible perpetual preferred
stock will only represent the right to receive the shares of Pfizer common stock
or Pfizer Series A convertible perpetual preferred stock into which those shares
of Pharmacia common stock or Pharmacia Series C convertible perpetual preferred
stock have been converted, respectively.

     Pfizer will not pay dividends with a record date that is 180 days or more
after the completion of the merger to any holder of any Pharmacia stock
certificates until the holder surrenders the Pharmacia stock certificates.
However, once those certificates are surrendered, Pfizer will pay to the holder,
without interest, any dividends that have been declared after the effective date
of the merger on the shares into which those Pharmacia shares have been
converted.

     However, for a period of one year following the completion of the merger,
holders of unsurrendered Pharmacia stock certificates will be entitled to vote
at any meeting of Pfizer shareholders the number of whole shares of Pfizer
common stock and Pfizer Series A convertible perpetual preferred stock
represented by such Pharmacia stock certificates.

     After the completion of the merger, Pharmacia will not register any
transfers of the shares of Pharmacia common stock.

     Pfizer shareholders will not exchange their stock certificates.

                                       I-75

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

FRACTIONAL SHARES

     No fractional shares of Pfizer common stock will be issued in the merger.
Instead, the exchange agent will pay each of those shareholders who would have
otherwise been entitled to a fractional share of Pfizer common stock an amount
in cash determined by multiplying the fractional share interest by the closing
price for a share of Pfizer common stock on the NYSE Composite Transaction Tape
on the date of the completion of the merger or, if such date is not a business
day, on the business day immediately following the date on which the merger
occurs.

LISTING OF PFIZER STOCK

     Pfizer has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of
Pfizer common stock to be issued in the merger and the shares of Pfizer common
stock to be reserved for issuance upon exercise of the Pharmacia stock options
to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance,
prior to the completion of the merger. Pfizer's symbol "PFE" will be used for
such shares, assuming the listing application is approved. Approval for listing
on the NYSE of the shares of Pfizer common stock issuable to the Pharmacia
shareholders in the merger, subject only to official notice of issuance, is a
condition to the obligations of Pfizer and Pharmacia to complete the merger.

COVENANTS

     We have each undertaken certain covenants in the merger agreement
concerning the conduct of our respective businesses between the date the merger
agreement was signed and the completion of the merger. The following summarizes
the more significant of these covenants:

     No Solicitation.  Pharmacia has agreed that Pharmacia, and any of its
subsidiaries, officers or directors, will not, and will use reasonable best
efforts to ensure that their respective employees, agents or representatives do
not:

     - initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate, including by way of
       furnishing information, any inquiries or the making of any proposal or
       offer with respect to a third party "acquisition proposal" of the type
       described below;

     - have any discussion with or provide any confidential information or data
       to any person relating to an acquisition proposal;

     - engage in negotiations concerning an acquisition proposal;

     - knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an
       acquisition proposal; or

     - subject to Pharmacia's right to terminate the merger agreement under
       certain circumstances described in "-- Termination of Merger Agreement"
       if Pharmacia receives a superior proposal of the type described below,
       accept an acquisition proposal.

     However, Pharmacia is permitted to take and disclose to its shareholders
its position with respect to any acquisition proposal as may be required under
the federal securities laws.

     In addition, Pharmacia is permitted to engage in discussions and
negotiations with, and provide information to, any person in response to an
unsolicited acquisition proposal, if:

     - its meeting of shareholders to vote on the adoption of the merger
       agreement has not occurred;

     - its board of directors concludes in good faith that there is a reasonable
       likelihood that the acquisition proposal could result in a "superior
       proposal" of the type described below;

     - prior to providing any information or data to any person in connection
       with an acquisition proposal, the proposing party first signs a
       confidentiality agreement

                                       I-76

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

       with terms, at least as stringent as the confidentiality provisions
       contained in the merger agreement; and

     - Pharmacia notifies and keeps Pfizer informed of the status and terms of
       the acquisition proposal and any discussions or negotiations relating to
       the acquisition proposal.

     An "acquisition proposal" for Pharmacia is any proposal or offer with
respect to:

     - a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business
       combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
       transaction involving Pharmacia;

     - any purchase or sale of the consolidated assets of Pharmacia and its
       subsidiaries, taken as a whole, having an aggregate value equal to 15% or
       more of the market capitalization of Pharmacia; or

     - any purchase or sale of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, 15% or
       more of the equity securities of Pharmacia.

     A "superior proposal" for Pharmacia, is a bona fide written proposal made
by a third party which is for:

     - a sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition of at least 40% of
       the assets of Pharmacia and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a
       single transaction or a series of related transactions; or

     - the acquisition, directly or indirectly, by such third party of
       beneficial ownership of 30% or more of the common stock of Pharmacia
       whether by merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
       tender or exchange offer or otherwise;

which in either case is on terms which the board of directors of Pharmacia in
good faith concludes after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
counsel, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects
of the proposal and the third party making the proposal:

     - would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable to
       its shareholders (in their capacities as shareholders), from a financial
       point of view, than the transactions contemplated by the merger
       agreement; and

     - is reasonably capable of being completed.

     Board of Directors' Covenant to Recommend.  Pharmacia has agreed that its
board of directors will recommend adoption of the merger agreement to the
Pharmacia shareholders. Similarly, Pfizer has agreed that its board of directors
will recommend the issuance of shares of Pfizer common stock in the merger and
the amendment to the Pfizer certificate of incorporation to its shareholders.

     However, Pharmacia's board is permitted to withdraw or to modify or to
qualify in a manner adverse to Pfizer this recommendation, before the Pharmacia
special meeting if either:

     - it determines in good faith that a material adverse effect has occurred
       with respect to Pfizer; or

     - it has received an unsolicited bona fide acquisition proposal from a
       third party that its board concludes in good faith is a superior proposal
       of the type described above.

     Similarly, Pfizer's board is permitted to withdraw or to modify or to
qualify in a manner adverse to Pharmacia its recommendation, before its meeting
if it determines in good faith that a material adverse effect has occurred with
respect to Pharmacia.

     Even if the board of either company withdraws, modifies or qualifies its
recommendation of the merger, that company is still required to present the
merger and related proposals at the special meeting of its shareholders for
consideration, unless the merger agreement is otherwise terminated. See
"Termination of Merger Agreement" on page   for a

discussion of each party's ability to terminate the merger agreement.

     Operations of Pfizer and Pharmacia Pending Closing.  We have each
undertaken a separate covenant that places restrictions on ourselves and our
respective subsidiaries until either the completion of the merger or the
termination of the merger agreement. In general, we and our respective
subsidiaries are each required to conduct our respective businesses in the
usual, regular and ordinary course in all material respects substantially in the
same manner as conducted prior to the date of the merger agreement and to use
our reasonable efforts to preserve intact our present lines of business and
relationships with third parties. Each of us has agreed to restrictions that,
except as required by law or expressly contemplated by the merger agreement,
prohibit us and our respective subsidiaries from:

     - declaring or paying dividends in excess of specified limits (except for,
       in the case of Pharmacia (1) any stock dividend or distribution with
       respect to the spin-off of Monsanto Company; (2) dividends or
       distributions from Monsanto Company to Pharmacia; or (3) dividends or
       distribution by wholly owned subsidiaries of Pharmacia);

     - amending our respective certificates of incorporation, by-laws or other
       governing documents;

     - making acquisitions of, or investments in, other entities beyond
       specified amounts; or

     - changing our respective accounting methods or fiscal year.

     In addition, Pharmacia has agreed to additional restrictions that prohibit
it from:

     - entering into any new lines of business or incurring or committing to any
       capital expenditures or obligations or liabilities in connection with
       such capital expenditures beyond specified amounts;

     - entering into any pharmaceutical licensing agreements unless under
       specified limits;

     - with certain exceptions, entering into certain agreements involving
       Pharmacia's pharmaceutical and consumer healthcare businesses, for the
       sale of products or inventories or for the furnishing of services by
       Pharmacia which exceed specified amounts or would involve commitments of
       more than one year, unless the agreements can be terminated by giving
       less than 60 days' notice and without incurring an obligation to pay any
       material premium or penalty or suffering any other material detriment;

     - making changes in its share capital, including, among other things, stock
       splits, combinations, or reclassifications, except for any transaction by
       a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pharmacia which remains a wholly-owned
       subsidiary after the completion of the transaction;

     - repurchasing or redeeming its capital stock, except in the ordinary
       course of business in connection with Pharmacia's benefit plans, for the
       redemption or exchange of rights in accordance with the Pharmacia rights
       agreement, and the exchange of the Pharmacia Series B convertible
       perpetual preferred stock for the Pharmacia Series C convertible
       perpetual preferred stock;

     - issuing, delivering or selling any shares of its capital stock or other
       equity interests, other than, among other exceptions, in connection with
       Pharmacia's benefit plans or in connection with the exercise of options
       or other stock awards or stock option agreements and other than issuances
       by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pharmacia of capital stock to the
       subsidiary's parent or another wholly owned subsidiary of Pharmacia;

     - disposing of assets beyond specified amounts, other than, among other
       exceptions, inventory in the ordinary course of

                                       I-78

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

       business and except for the sale or disposition of assets or stock of
       Monsanto Company or the spin-off of Monsanto Company from Pharmacia, as
       described in Pharmacia's filings with the SEC;

     - incurring debt, other than, among other exceptions, in the ordinary
       course consistent with past practice or pursuant to the credit
       facilities, indentures and other arrangements in existence on July 13,
       2002, but not beyond specified amounts;

     - making loans, advances, capital contributions or investments in any other
       entity except for certain specified amounts in the ordinary course and
       consistent with past practice, pursuant to a legal obligation not
       existing on July 13, 2002, or loans, advances, capital contributions or
       investments by Pharmacia to subsidiaries of Pharmacia or from
       subsidiaries of Pharmacia to Pharmacia;

     - increasing the compensation of directors, executive officers or employees
       or increasing employee benefits other than in the ordinary course and
       consistent with past practice or as required by an existing agreement;

     - making any material tax election, settling or compromising any material
       tax liability or changing its fiscal year;

     - entering into any agreement or arrangement that would limit or restrict
       Pharmacia from competing in any line of business or geographic area if
       that resulting restriction would have a material adverse effect on the
       combined company and its subsidiaries after the merger;

     - amending, modifying, altering or terminating any of the separation
       agreements between Pharmacia and Monsanto Company and the protocol
       agreement, dated as of July 1, 2002, among Pharmacia, Monsanto Company
       and Solutia other than for technical or ministerial amendments necessary
       or appropriate to effect the Monsanto Company spin-off; and

     - settling or compromising any material suit, action or claim.

     Collection of Indebtedness from Monsanto Company.  Pharmacia has agreed to
use its reasonable best efforts to collect all outstanding indebtedness from
Monsanto Company and its subsidiaries and the release of all guarantees of
obligations of Monsanto Company to other parties (other than existing agreements
between the parties), although uncollected indebtedness may be extended to a
date no later than one year after the distribution of its interest in Monsanto
Company to the holders of Pharmacia common stock.

     Reasonable Best Efforts Covenant.  We have agreed to cooperate with each
other and to use our reasonable best efforts to take all actions and do all
things advisable or necessary under the merger agreement and applicable laws to
complete the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.

     Reasonable best efforts include (but are not limited to) taking actions
necessary to obtain regulatory approval, contesting and resisting an action or
proceeding that would otherwise restrict the merger or having vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order that
would otherwise restrict the merger, including:

     (1) Pfizer holding separate any portion of its assets or conducting its
business in a specified manner in one or more countries for a period of up to
six months after the completion of the merger;

     (2) Pfizer selling, holding separate or disposing of assets, in response to
the requirements imposed by antitrust authorities; and

     (3) Pharmacia, at the direction of Pfizer, taking actions, including
selling, holding separate or disposing of assets, in response to the
requirements imposed by antitrust authorities.

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

     However, neither party will be required for any reason to sell, hold
separate or otherwise dispose of assets in accordance with (2) or (3) above, if
such actions, in the aggregate, (assuming in the case of actions taken by Pfizer
pursuant to clause (2) that such actions were or have been taken by Pharmacia or
its subsidiaries with respect to assets of Pharmacia of similar value or
prospective value) would result in a material adverse effect on Pharmacia taking
into account both quantitative and qualitative factors, including the prospects
of Pharmacia and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.

     Employee Matters.  In the merger agreement, we have agreed that, following
the merger, Pfizer will:

     - for two years following the completion of the merger, provide
       compensation and employee benefits to continuing and former Pharmacia
       employees at a level that is substantially comparable in the aggregate to
       the compensation and benefits provided to such individuals by Pharmacia
       prior to the effective time and after such period provide compensation
       and employee benefits at a level comparable to similarly situated
       employees of Pfizer;

     - comply with the terms and conditions of any collective bargaining
       agreements covering any Pharmacia employees;

     - for two years following the completion of the merger continue the
       severance and post retirement medical and dental benefits provided by
       Pharmacia immediately prior to the completion of the merger as provided
       in the Pharmacia Separation Benefit Plans, as amended through July 9,
       2002;

     - for two years following the completion of the merger, continue, for all
       continuing Pharmacia employees, post retirement medical, dental and life
       insurance benefits for eligible former employees at Pharmacia as in
       effect prior to the completion of the merger;

     - after two years after the completion of the merger, Pfizer will provide
       to continuing Pharmacia employees severance benefits that are no less
       favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of Pfizer
       and, if Pfizer alters or modifies any retiree welfare benefits provided
       to any continuing employee or former Pharmacia employee, such alteration
       or modification will result in the employee receiving retiree welfare
       benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those
       provided to similarly situated employees and former employees of Pfizer;

     - with certain exceptions, waive any pre-existing condition exclusions and
       waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
       applicable to continuing and former Pharmacia employees under any Pfizer
       or Pharmacia benefit plan;

     - provide continuing and former Pharmacia employees with credit for any
       co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the completion of the merger
       (to the same extent such credit was given under the analogous Pharmacia
       benefit plan prior to completion of the merger) in satisfying any
       applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any Pfizer
       benefit plan;

     - with certain exceptions, grant to continuing and former Pharmacia
       employees after the merger full credit for service, eligibility, vesting,
       benefit accrual and determination of their level of benefits for their
       Pharmacia service under the Pfizer benefit plans in which they
       participate after the merger, to the extent Pfizer would recognize such
       service under the applicable benefit plan for its similarly situated
       employees and former employees; and

     - honor, fulfill and discharge all Pharmacia benefit plans and related
       funding arrangements in accordance with their terms, including each
       employment,

                                       I-80

       change in control, severance and termination arrangement.

     Payment of Dividends Pending the Merger. We have agreed to coordinate
declaring dividends and the related record dates and payment dates so that
Pfizer and Pharmacia shareholders do not receive two dividends, or fail to
receive one dividend, for any single calendar quarter.

OTHER COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

     Expenses.  We have each agreed to pay our own costs and expenses incurred
in connection with the merger and the merger agreement. Pfizer and Pharmacia,
however, will each pay 50% of any expenses incurred in connection with the
filing with the SEC of the registration statement of which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus forms a part and the costs associated with the printing and
mailing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

merger, Pfizer shall cause Mr. Hassan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
Pharmacia, to be appointed to the board of directors of Pfizer, and elected
Vice-Chairman of the combined company, in each case, effective as of the
completion of the merger.

     Exchange of Preferred Stock.  Pharmacia has agreed that prior to the
completion of the merger, Pharmacia will exchange all outstanding shares of
Pharmacia Series B convertible perpetual preferred stock, on a one-for-one
basis, for Pharmacia Series C convertible perpetual preferred stock, having
substantially identical terms.

     Other Covenants.  The merger agreement contains certain other covenants,
including covenants relating to cooperation between Pfizer and Pharmacia in the
preparation of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and other governmental

     - the SEC having declared effective the Pfizer registration statement, of
       which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part; and

       representation or warranty speaks as of another date;

       shareholders).

TERMINATION OF MERGER AGREEMENT

     Right to Terminate.  The merger agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the completion of the merger in any of the following ways:

     - by our mutual written consent;

     - by either one of us:

        -- if the merger has not been completed by April 15, 2003 or, if the
           conditions to closing relating to antitrust or other governmental
           approvals of the merger, have not been satisfied, but all other
           conditions to closing are satisfied or are capable of being
           satisfied, this date is automatically extended to July 15, 2003;
           except that a party may not terminate the merger agreement if the
           cause of the merger not being completed is that party's failure to
           fulfill its obligations under the merger agreement;

        -- if a governmental authority or a court in the United States or
           European Union permanently orders or prohibits the completion of the
           merger or a governmental authority in the United States or European

           Union fails to grant any necessary approval of the merger, except
           that a party may not terminate the merger agreement if the cause of
           the prohibition or failure to obtain approval is a result of that
           party's failure to fulfill its obligations under the provision of the
           merger agreement which, among other requirements, requires each party
           to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain government approvals for
           the completions of the merger and requires each party to divest
           certain assets in response to requirements imposed by antitrust
           authorities, which divestiture obligations are discussed in
           "Regulatory Matters Relating to the Merger" on page   ; or

        -- if either Pfizer's shareholders fail to approve the issuance of
           shares of Pfizer common stock in the merger or amendment to the
           Pfizer certificate of incorporation, or Pharmacia's shareholders fail
           to adopt the merger agreement.

     - by Pfizer:

        -- if Pharmacia's board of directors either changes its recommendation
           in a manner adverse to Pfizer, or fails to call the Pharmacia special
           meeting to vote on the merger by January 13, 2003 (which deadline
           will be extended if this registration statement has not become
           effective by November 14, 2002); or

        -- if Pharmacia has breached in any material respect any of its
           representations or warranties, or has failed to perform in any
           material respect any of its covenants or obligations under the merger
           agreement and such breach:

             - would result in the failure of certain closing conditions to the
               merger being satisfied; and

             - is incapable of being cured by or remains uncured at April 15,
               2003 (or July 15, 2003, if the termination date is extended).

     - by Pharmacia:

        -- if Pfizer's board of directors either changes its recommendation in a
           manner adverse to Pharmacia, or fails to call the Pfizer special
           meeting to vote on the proposal to issue shares of Pfizer common
           stock in the merger or the amendment to the Pfizer certificate of
           incorporation by January 13, 2003 (which deadline will be extended if
           this registration statement has not become effective by November 14,
           2002;

        -- if Pfizer has breached in any material respect any of its
           representations or warranties, or has failed to perform in any
           material respect any of its covenants or obligations under the merger
           agreement and such breach:

             - would result in the failure of certain closing conditions to the
               merger being satisfied; and

             - is incapable of being cured by or remains uncured at April 15,
               2003 or July 15, 2003, if applicable; or

        -- if Pharmacia's board of directors authorizes Pharmacia to enter into
           a written agreement concerning a transaction that Pharmacia's board
           of directors has determined in accordance with the merger agreement
           is a superior proposal, except that Pharmacia cannot terminate the
           merger agreement for this reason (1) unless Pharmacia provides Pfizer
           with notice of the existence and terms of the superior proposal,
           including the identity of the person making the superior proposal and
           a statement as to whether Pharmacia

           intends to enter into a definitive agreement for a business
           combination, (2) Pfizer, within five business days of receiving such
           notice from Pharmacia, does not make an offer that the board of
           directors of Pharmacia determines is at least as favorable to the
           Pharmacia shareholders as the superior proposal Pharmacia received
           from the third party and (3) Pharmacia pays Pfizer the fee described
           in "Termination Fees Payable by Pharmacia" below at or prior to such
           termination.

     Termination Fees Payable by Pharmacia. Pharmacia has agreed to pay Pfizer a
termination fee of $1.6 billion (within one business day after the earlier of
the date Pharmacia enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or
consummates, a business combination), if the merger agreement is terminated
under one of the following circumstances:

     - the merger agreement is (1) terminated by Pfizer because the board of
       directors of Pharmacia withdraws or changes its recommendation in a
       manner adverse to Pfizer or for any reason Pharmacia fails to call or
       hold its shareholders' meeting by January 13, 2003 or until this
       registration statement becomes effective if such date is extended (but
       only if, on or before the date the agreement is terminated, there was an
       offer or proposal for, or announcement with respect to, a "business
       combination" involving Pharmacia) and (2) within twelve months of the
       termination, Pharmacia enters into a definitive agreement or completes a
       transaction with respect to a business combination with a third party;

     - the merger agreement is (1) terminated by Pfizer or Pharmacia because
       Pharmacia's shareholders failed to adopt the merger agreement (but only
       if, prior to the date of the Pharmacia special meeting. there was made
       public to a significant number of Pharmacia's shareholders an offer or
       proposal for, or any public announcement with respect to, a business
       combination involving Pharmacia) and (2) within twelve months of the
       termination, Pharmacia enters into a definitive agreement or completes a
       transaction with respect to a business combination with a third party; or

     - the merger agreement is (1) terminated by Pfizer or Pharmacia because the
       necessary regulatory approvals have not been obtained and the merger has
       not been completed by April 15, 2003 (or July 15, 2003 if the termination
       date is extended), and at the time of termination Pharmacia has not yet
       obtained its shareholder approval and prior to April 15, 2003 (or July
       15, 2003 if the termination date is extended), there has been an offer or
       proposal for, or announcement with respect to, a business combination
       involving Pharmacia and (2) within twelve months of the termination,
       Pharmacia enters into a definitive agreement or completes a transaction
       with respect to a business combination with a third party.

     Pharmacia also has agreed to pay Pfizer a termination fee of $1.6 billion
(at or prior to such termination), if Pharmacia terminates the merger agreement
because Pharmacia's board of directors has authorized Pharmacia to enter into a
written agreement for a superior proposal and Pfizer has not, within five
business days of notice from Pharmacia, made an offer that the board of
directors of Pharmacia determines is at least as favorable as the superior
proposal Pharmacia has received from a third party.

     A "business combination" for Pharmacia is:

     (1) a merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business
         combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
         transaction

                                       I-85

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

         involving Pharmacia as a result of which:

          - Pharmacia's shareholders prior to the transaction in the aggregate
            cease to own at least 50% of the voting securities of the ultimate
            parent entity of the entity surviving or resulting from the
            transaction;

          - Any person beneficially owns at least 40% of the voting securities
            of the ultimate parent entity of the entity surviving or resulting
            from the transaction; or

          - The individuals comprising the board of directors of Pharmacia prior
            to the transaction do not constitute a majority of the board of
            directors of the ultimate parent entity of the entity surviving or
            resulting from the transaction;

     (2) a sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition of at least 40%
         of the assets of Pharmacia and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a
         single transaction or series of transactions; or

     (3) the acquisition by a person of beneficial ownership of 40% or more of
         the common stock of Pharmacia (other than as an acquisition in which
         Pharmacia shareholders prior to the acquisition would beneficially own
         greater than 50% of the voting securities of such acquiring person
         after the completion of the transaction).

     Obligations in Event of Termination.  In the event of termination as
provided for above, the merger agreement will become void and of no further
force and effect (except with respect to certain designated sections in the
merger agreement) and there will be no liability on behalf of Pfizer or
Pharmacia, except for liabilities arising from a willful breach of the merger
agreement.

     If, however, the merger agreement is terminated for any reason other than a
termination by (1) Pfizer either because Pharmacia's board of directors changes
its recommendation in a manner adverse to Pfizer or (2) Pharmacia because
Pharmacia's board of directors has authorized Pharmacia to enter into a written
agreement for a superior proposal and Pfizer has not, within five business days
of notice from Pharmacia, made an offer that the board of directors of Pharmacia
determines is at least as favorable as the superior proposal Pharmacia has
received from a third party, then Pfizer agrees that it will not purchase or
offer to purchase Pharmacia's common stock for a period of two years starting on
the date of termination of the merger agreement and ending on the date on which
Pharmacia starts discussions or negotiations with, provides information to or
enters into an agreement with, a third party relating to the sale of all or
substantially all of its and its subsidiaries' consolidated assets.

AMENDMENTS, EXTENSIONS AND WAIVERS

     The merger agreement may be amended by the parties at any time before or
after the shareholder meetings, except that any amendment after a shareholders'
meeting, which requires approval by shareholders, may not be made without such
approval.

AMENDMENT TO CO-PROMOTION AND CO-MARKETING AGREEMENTS

     In connection with the signing of the merger agreement, Pharmacia and
Pfizer entered into an amendment to certain co-promotion and co-marketing
agreements regarding Pharmacia's pain and inflammation drug, Celebrex(R) and
other COX-2 "second generation" drugs, which amendment shall only become
effective if Pharmacia becomes obligated to pay a termination fee to Pfizer
under the terms of the merger agreement (as described above), and Pharmacia, in
addition, consummates the business combination transaction that caused such
termination fee to become due and payable.

     If such amendment becomes effective, Pfizer will be able to appoint three
members to the executive management committee and

                                       I-86

                                                       CHAPTER ONE -- THE MERGER

Pharmacia will be able to appoint two members to the committee, which meets to
resolve issues under the co-promotion agreements as they arise. Pharmacia
currently can appoint three of the five members to the executive management
committee and Pfizer can appoint two members to the committee.

     If such amendment becomes effective, Pfizer will also be able to designate
the chairperson of any or all of the six subcommittees which meet to resolve
issues under the co-promotion and co-marketing agreements.

                              FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Income combine the
historical consolidated statements of income of Pfizer and Pharmacia, giving
effect to the merger as if it had occurred on January 1 of each period
presented. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet combines the
historical consolidated balance sheet of Pfizer and the historical consolidated
balance sheet of Pharmacia, giving effect to the merger as if it had been
consummated on June 30, 2002. We have adjusted the historical consolidated
financial information to give effect to pro forma events that are (1) directly
attributable to the merger, (2) factually supportable, and (3) with respect to
the statements of income, expected to have a continuing impact on the combined
results. You should read this information in conjunction with the:

     - accompanying notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined
       Financial Statements;

     - separate historical unaudited financial statements of Pfizer as of and
       for the six months ended June 30, 2002 included in Pfizer's Quarterly
       Report on Form 10-Q for the six month period ended June 30, 2002, which
       is incorporated by reference into this document;

     - separate historical financial statements of Pfizer as of and for the year
       ended December 31, 2001 included in Pfizer's Annual Report on Form 10-K
       for the year ended December 31, 2001, which is incorporated by reference
       into this document;

     - separate historical unaudited financial statements of Pharmacia as of and
       for the six months ended June 30, 2002 included in Pharmacia's Quarterly
       Report on Form 10-Q for the six month period ended June 30, 2002, which
       is incorporated by reference into this document; and

     - separate historical financial statements of Pharmacia as of and for the
       year ended December 31, 2001 included in Pharmacia's Annual Report on
       Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001, which is incorporated by
       reference into this document.

     We present the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information
for informational purposes only. The pro forma information is not necessarily
indicative of what our financial position or results of operations actually
would have been had we completed the merger at the dates indicated. In addition,
the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not
purport to project the future financial position or operating results of the
combined company.

     We prepared the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
information using the purchase method of accounting with Pfizer treated as the
acquiror. Accordingly, Pfizer's cost to acquire Pharmacia will be allocated to
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair
values as of the date of acquisition. The allocation is dependent upon certain
valuations and other studies that have not progressed to a stage where there is
sufficient information to make a definitive allocation. Accordingly, the
purchase price allocation pro forma adjustments are preliminary and have been
made solely for the purpose of providing unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial information.

                NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED
                              FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     The merger agreement provides that each outstanding share of Pharmacia
common stock will be exchanged for 1.4 shares of Pfizer common stock in a
tax-free transaction. Pfizer will not issue fractional shares in the merger. As
a result, the total number of shares of Pfizer common stock that each Pharmacia
shareholder will receive in the merger will be rounded down to the nearest whole
number, and each Pharmacia shareholder will receive a cash payment for the
remaining fraction of a share of Pfizer common stock that he or she would
otherwise receive, if any, based on the market value of Pfizer common stock at
the close of business at the date the merger became effective. Each share of
Pharmacia Series C convertible perpetual preferred stock will be exchanged for a
newly created class of Pfizer Series A convertible perpetual preferred stock
with rights substantially similar to the rights of the Pharmacia Series C
convertible perpetual preferred stock. The merger is expected to be completed by
the end of 2002. The merger will be accounted for as a purchase by Pfizer under
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Under
the purchase method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of Pharmacia will
be recorded as of the acquisition date, at their respective fair values, and
added to those of Pfizer. The reported financial condition and results of
operations of Pfizer after completion of the merger will reflect these values,
but will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial
position or results of operations of Pharmacia. The merger is subject to
customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, as well as
approval by Pfizer and Pharmacia shareholders of certain merger-related
proposals.

     One of the conditions of the merger agreement is that Pharmacia complete
the distribution of its holding of Monsanto Company common stock to holders of
Pharmacia common stock. The pro forma balance sheet as of June 30, 2002 assumes
that the remaining outstanding shares of Monsanto Company held by Pharmacia were
distributed to the Pharmacia shareholders in a tax-free spin-off transaction
prior to June 30, 2002 (the assumed acquisition date for the pro forma balance
sheet).

           ---------------------------------------------------------

     In accordance with the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS No. 142"), the
goodwill and the acquired indefinite-lived intangibles associated with the
merger will not be amortized.

     As required by Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 4,
"Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by
the Purchase Method," ("FIN 4") the purchase price allocated to in-process
research and development will be immediately expensed.

3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT CLASSIFICATIONS

     Upon completion of the merger, Pfizer and Pharmacia will review their
accounting policies and financial statement classifications. As a result of that
review, it may become necessary to make certain reclassifications to the
combined company's financial statements to conform to those accounting policies
and classifications that are determined to be more appropriate.

4. INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS

     Transactions between Pfizer and Pharmacia are primarily limited to the
Celebrex(R) and Bextra(R) marketing agreements. Upon completion of the merger,
transactions that occurred in connection with these arrangements would be
considered intercompany transactions. All significant balances and transactions
related to these arrangements have been eliminated from the Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Financial Statements.

5. PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

     Adjustments included in the column under the heading "Pro Forma
Adjustments" primarily relate to the following:

     (a) To eliminate balances and transactions between Pfizer and Pharmacia
which, upon completion of the merger, would be considered intercompany balances
and transactions. The majority of these transactions occurred under the
Celebrex(R) and Bextra(R) marketing agreements. The entries include:

     - the elimination of certain sales, alliance revenue and certain
       co-promotion expenses;

     - the elimination of the impact of milestone payments;

     - the elimination of receivable and payable balances; and

     - the elimination of profit in inventory.

     (b) To eliminate amortization expense recorded by Pharmacia related to
goodwill

                                       II-7

                                         CHAPTER TWO -- PRO FORMA FINANCIAL DATA

recorded on previous acquisitions and other intangible assets of approximately
$160 million in 2001 and $30 million in the first six months of 2002.

     (c) To record:

     - amortization expense related to the estimated value of acquired
       identifiable intangible assets, which are being amortized over their
       estimated useful lives of 12 years, of approximately $2,250 million in
       2001 and $1,125 million in the first six months of 2002;

     - additional depreciation expense related to the estimated fair value step
       up of the acquired property, plant and equipment, which is being
       depreciated over its estimated useful life of 10 years, of approximately
       $20 million in 2001 and $10 million in the first six months of 2002; and

     - the allocation of the estimated purchase price to reflect the difference
       between the book value and the fair value of net assets acquired. See
       also Note 2 of the Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined
       Financial Statements.

     (d) To adjust income taxes for pro forma adjustments.

     (e) To reflect Pharmacia's distribution of its holding in Monsanto Company
to the holders of Pharmacia common stock. See also Note 1 of the Notes to
Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements.

     (f) To adjust common stock, additional paid-in-capital, ESOP related
accounts, accumulated other comprehensive expense and treasury stock to reflect
the issuance of Pfizer shares to effect the acquisition of Pharmacia under the
purchase accounting method. (The preferred stock of Pharmacia will be exchanged
for a newly created class of Pfizer preferred stock with substantially identical
rights). Retained earnings has also been adjusted to reflect the write-off of
in-process research and development, as required by FIN 4, of approximately $13
billion at June 30, 2002. See also Note 2 of the Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Financial Statements.

     The pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not present a
combined dividend per share amount. Pfizer's current quarterly dividend is $.13
($.52 per share annualized) and is subject to future lawful approval and
declaration by Pfizer's board of directors. Pharmacia's current quarterly
dividend is $.135 ($.54 per share annualized) and is subject to future lawful
approval and declaration by Pharmacia's board of directors. The dividend policy
of the combined company will be determined by its board of directors following
the merger.

     Certain restructuring and integration charges may be recorded subsequent to
the merger that, under purchase accounting, will not be treated as part of the
Pharmacia purchase price. These costs, estimated to range between $2.5 and $3.0
billion, have not been reflected in these unaudited pro forma condensed income
statements because they are not expected to have a continuing impact on the
combined results.

     The pro forma combined basic and diluted earnings per share for the
respective periods presented are based on the combined basic and diluted
weighted average shares of Pfizer and Pharmacia. The historical basic and
diluted weighted average shares of Pharmacia were converted at the exchange
ratio of 1.4 shares of Pfizer common stock for each Pharmacia common stock
equivalent.

     The pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not reflect the
expected realization of annual cost savings of $2.5 billion by 2005. These
savings are expected to result from, among other things, the reduction of
overhead expenses, changes in corporate infrastructure, the elimination of
duplicative facilities and the leveraging of the combined annual external
purchases. Although management expects that cost savings will result from the
merger, there can be no assurance that these cost savings will be achieved.

6. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

     The statements contained in this section may be deemed to be
forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
Act. Forward-looking statements

                                         CHAPTER TWO -- PRO FORMA FINANCIAL DATA

are typically identified by the words "believe," "expect," "anticipate,"

These forecasts for Pfizer were prepared by the management of Pfizer in July
2002, and for Pharmacia, by the management of Pharmacia in June 2002. These
forecasts were not prepared with a view to public disclosure or compliance with
published guidelines established by the SEC or the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants regarding forecasts. None of Pfizer, Pharmacia or
their respective affiliates or Pfizer's or Pharmacia's independent auditors
assume any responsibility for the accuracy of this information. The forecasts
were not prepared with the approval of the Pfizer or Pharmacia boards of
directors. The forecasts are subjective in many respects and thus susceptible to
interpretation and periodic revision based on actual experience and recent
developments. While presented with numeric specificity, the forecasts reflect
numerous assumptions made by the managements of Pfizer and Pharmacia with
respect to industry performance and competition, general business, economic,
market and financial conditions and other matters, all of which are difficult to
predict, many of which are beyond the control of Pfizer and Pharmacia. For these
reasons, the inclusion of the forecasts in this document should not be regarded
as an indication that Pfizer, Pharmacia, any recipient of the forecasts or their
respective affiliates or representatives, considered or consider the forecasts
to be a reliable prediction of future events, and the forecasts should not be
relied upon as such. Actual results may be higher or lower than those estimated.
Pfizer and Pharmacia do not generally publish their respective business plans
and strategies or make external disclosures of their respective anticipated
financial position or results of operations. Accordingly, Pfizer and Pharmacia
do not intend to, and specifically decline any obligation to, update or
otherwise revise the prospective financial information to reflect circumstances
existing since their preparation or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated
events, even if any or all the underlying assumptions are shown to be in error.
Also, Pfizer and Pharmacia do not intend to, and specifically decline any
obligation to, update or revise the prospective financial information to reflect
changes in general economic or industry conditions.

     Neither Pfizer's auditors nor Pharmacia's auditors, nor any other
independent accountants, have compiled, examined or performed any procedures
with respect to these forecasts, nor have they expressed any opinion or any
other form of assurance on this information or its achievability, and assume no
responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, this prospective
financial information. The independent public accountants' reports incorporated
by reference in this document relate to the respective historical financial
statements of Pfizer and Pharmacia. These reports do not extend to these
unaudited financial forecasts and should not be read to do so.

                                            stock in the merger requires the affirmative vote of at
                                            least a majority of the votes cast by the holders of
                                            Pfizer common stock, provided that the total votes cast
                                            represent a majority of the outstanding shares of Pfizer
                                            stock entitled to vote. Abstentions and broker non-votes
                                            are not counted as votes "for" or "against" the proposal
                                            and are not counted in determining the number of votes
                                            cast on the proposal.
                                         2. Approval of the amendment to the Pfizer certificate of
                                            incorporation to increase the authorized share capital
                                            requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of
                                            the votes represented by all of the outstanding shares of
                                            Pfizer common stock. Abstentions and broker non-votes
                                            have the same effect as a vote against the proposal.
Pharmacia:                               1. Adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative
                                         vote of at least a majority of the outstanding votes
                                            represented by the shares of Pharmacia common stock and
                                            Pharmacia Series B convertible perpetual preferred stock,
                                            voting as a single class. Abstentions and broker
                                            non-votes have the same effect as a vote against the
                                            proposal.

- -------------------------

* Under New York Stock Exchange rules, if your broker holds your shares in its
  name, your broker may not vote your shares on, in the case of Pfizer, the
  proposal concerning the issuance of shares of Pfizer common stock in the
  merger or the amendment to the Pfizer certificate of incorporation, or, in the
  case of Pharmacia, the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, absent
  instructions from you. Without your voting instructions on those items, a
  broker non-vote will occur.

PROXIES FOR PFIZER PLAN PARTICIPANTS

     You will receive only one proxy card for all the shares you hold:

     - In your own name;

     - In the Pfizer Inc. Shareholder Investment Program; and

     if you are a Pfizer employee,

     - In the Pfizer Savings Plan; and

     - In the Warner-Lambert Savings and Stock Plans for the United States or
       Puerto Rico (the "Warner-Lambert Plans").

     If you are a United States Pfizer employee who has received stock options
under the previous or current Pfizer Stock and Incentive Plan, you are entitled
to give voting instructions on a portion of the shares underlying your options
to the trustee of the Pfizer Inc. Employee Benefit Trust. Your proxy card will
serve as a voting instruction to the trustee of the Trust.

     If you do not vote your shares or specify voting instructions on your proxy
card, the administrators of the Pfizer Savings Plan or the Warner-Lambert Plans
or the trustee of the Trust will vote your shares in the same proportion as the
shares for which voting instructions have been received. TO ALLOW SUFFICIENT
TIME FOR VOTING BY THE TRUSTEE OF THE TRUST AND THE ADMINISTRATORS OF THE PLANS,
YOUR VOTING INSTRUCTIONS MUST BE RECEIVED BY [          ].

     If you hold Pfizer shares through any other Pfizer plans, you will receive
voting instructions from that plan's administrator.

                      CHAPTER THREE -- INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETINGS AND VOTING

HOUSEHOLDING INFORMATION

     Pfizer has adopted the procedure approved by the SEC called "householding."
Under this procedure, shareholders of record who have the same address and last
name and do not participate in electronic delivery of proxy materials will
receive only one copy of this joint prospectus/proxy statement unless one or
more of these shareholders notifies Pfizer that they wish to continue receiving
individual copies. This procedure will reduce the printing costs and postage
fees of Pfizer and Pharmacia in connection with this joint prospectus/proxy
statement and of Pfizer and the combined company for future Annual Reports and
Proxy Statements.

     Shareholders who participate in householding will continue to receive
separate proxy cards. Also, householding will not in any way affect dividend
check mailings.

     If you and other Pfizer shareholders of record with whom you share an
address currently receive multiple copies of Annual Reports and/or Proxy
Statements, or if you hold stock in more than one account and in either case,
you wish to receive only a single copy of future Annual Reports or Proxy
Statements for your household, please contact Pfizer's transfer agent (in
writing: EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., P.O. Box 43069, Providence, Rhode Island
07303-2500; by telephone: 1-800-733-9393) with the names in which all accounts
are registered.

     If you participate in householding and wish to receive a separate copy of
this joint prospectus/proxy statement, or if you wish to receive separate copies
of future Pfizer Annual Reports and/or Proxy Statements, please contact
EquiServe at the above address or phone number. Pfizer will deliver the
requested documents to you promptly upon your request.

     Beneficial shareholders can request information about householding from
their bank, broker, custodian or recordholder of Pfizer common stock.

PROXIES FOR PHARMACIA PLAN PARTICIPANTS

     If you are a participant in the Pharmacia Common Stock Fund, Pharmacia ESOP
Preferred Stock Fund, or Pharmacia ESOP Common Stock Fund, you will receive only
one proxy card for all the shares of Pharmacia common stock or Pharmacia Series
B convertible perpetual preferred stock:

     - You hold in your own name; or

     - The trustees or custodian of the relevant plan holds on your behalf.

     Neither Pharmacia nor the trustee or custodian can exercise discretion as
to the voting of shares in the plans listed above. However, if you own shares in
any of the plans and do not provide instructions, or if your instructions as to
the voting of your shares are
not received in a timely manner, the trustee or custodian of the relevant plan
will vote your shares in such plan in the same proportion to the shares for
which it has received timely instructions from the other participants in such
plan.

     Because the trustee or custodian for the relevant plan must process voting
instructions from participants before the date of the special meeting, you are
urged to deliver your instructions well in advance of the special meeting so
that the instructions are received no later than [          ].

     If you submit a completed proxy card with instructions on how to vote your
plan shares and then wish to revoke your instructions, you should submit a
notice of revocation to Pharmacia as soon as possible, as described under
"-- Revoking Your Proxy" below.

                                      III-6

                      CHAPTER THREE -- INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETINGS AND VOTING

     If you submit your proxy but do not make specific choices, your proxy will
follow the respective board of director recommendations and vote your shares:

                  PFIZER                                      PHARMACIA
                  ------                                      ---------

- - "FOR" the proposal to issue shares of      - "FOR" adoption of the merger agreement
  Pfizer common stock in the merger

  certificate of incorporation to increase     of directors to adjourn the Pharmacia
  its share capital                            meeting
- - "FOR" any proposal by Pfizer's board of
  directors to adjourn the Pfizer meeting

                      ------------------------------------

     Revoking Your Proxy.  You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is
voted by:

     - timely delivery of a valid, later-dated proxy, including a proxy given by
       telephone or Internet;

     - written notice to your company's Secretary before the meeting that you
       have revoked your proxy; or

     - voting by ballot at either the Pfizer special meeting or Pharmacia
       special meeting.

     Voting in Person.  If you are a shareholder of record and you wish to vote
in person at the Pfizer or Pharmacia special meeting, we will give you a ballot
at the meeting. However, if your shares are held in the name of your bank,
broker, custodian or other recordholder, you must obtain a proxy, executed in
your favor, from the holder of record to be able to vote at the meeting.

     People with Disabilities.  We can provide reasonable assistance (including
audio enhancement) to help you participate in the meeting if you tell us about
your disability and your plan to attend. For the Pfizer special meeting, the
[          ] is accessible to disabled persons and, upon request, Pfizer will
provide wireless headsets for hearing amplification. Sign interpretation will
also be available upon request. Please mail your request to the address set
forth in Pfizer's Notice of Special Meeting if you require either of these
services or other special accommodations at the Pfizer special meeting.

     Proxy Solicitation.  We will each pay our own costs of soliciting proxies.

     In addition to this mailing, proxies may be solicited by directors,
officers or employees of Pfizer and Pharmacia in person or by telephone or
electronic transmission. None of the directors, officers or employees will be
directly compensated for such services. Pfizer has retained [          ] to
assist in the distribution and solicitation of proxies. Pfizer will pay
[          ] a fee of $[     ], plus reasonable expenses, for these services.
Pharmacia has retained [          ] to assist in the distribution and
solicitation of proxies. Pharmacia will pay [          ] a fee of $[     ], plus
reasonable expenses, for these services.

     The extent to which these proxy soliciting efforts will be necessary
depends entirely upon how promptly proxies are submitted. You should submit your
proxy without delay by mail or by telephone or the Internet. We also reimburse
brokers and other nominees for their expenses in sending these materials to you
and getting your voting instructions.

     Do not send in any stock certificates with your proxy cards. The exchange
agent will mail transmittal forms with instructions for the surrender of stock
certificates for Pharmacia common stock and Pharmacia Series C convertible
perpetual preferred stock to former Pharmacia shareholders as soon as
practicable after the completion of the merger.

meeting. If, however, other matters are properly brought before either meeting,

authority on the part of the individuals appointed to vote your shares or act on
those matters according to their best judgment, including to adjourn the
meeting.

     Adjournments may be made for the purpose of, among other things, soliciting
additional proxies. Any adjournment may be made from time to time by approval of
the holders of shares representing a majority of the votes present in person or

other than by an announcement made at the meeting. Neither of us currently
intends to seek an adjournment of our meeting.
