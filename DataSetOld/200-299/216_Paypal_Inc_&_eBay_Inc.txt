Merger Proposed  Your Vote Is Very
Important

To the Stockholders of PayPal, Inc.:

PayPal, Inc. has entered into a merger agreement
with eBay Inc. As a result of the merger contemplated by the
merger agreement, PayPal will become a wholly-owned subsidiary
of eBay. The merger requires the approval of holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of PayPal common stock, and
we have scheduled a special meeting of PayPal stockholders on
October 3, 2002 at 1840 Embarcadero Road, Palo Alto,
California 94303, commencing at 9:00 a.m., local time, to
vote on the merger agreement and the merger.

Upon completion of the merger, each share of
PayPal common stock will be converted into the right to receive
0.39 of a share of eBay common stock. Based on the number of
shares of PayPal common stock outstanding as of the record date,
eBay expects to issue approximately
24.0 million shares of eBay common stock in the
merger, subject to adjustment to reflect the effect of any
reclassification, stock split, stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization or the like on eBay or PayPal common stock.

eBay common stock is traded on the Nasdaq
National Market under the symbol EBAY. On
August 28, 2002, the closing price of eBay common stock on
the Nasdaq National Market was $55.37 per share.

Both PayPal and eBay are excited about this
transaction because: (1) the combined company should be
able to provide a significantly improved customer experience;
(2) it combines the core competencies of both companies in
a natural and complementary way; (3) it should strengthen
both businesses; and (4) it should create value for the
stockholders of both companies.

PayPals board of directors recommends
that you vote FOR the proposal to approve and adopt the merger
agreement and approve the merger. In addition, Peter A.
Thiel, Max R. Levchin, David O. Sacks, Roelof F.
Botha, Elon R. Musk, James E. Templeton, Reid G.
Hoffman, Nokia Ventures, LP and entities affiliated with
Sequoia Capital and Madison Dearborn Partners have each agreed
to vote certain of their shares of PayPal common stock,
representing in the aggregate approximately 27.7% of the
outstanding PayPal common stock, FOR the proposal to approve and
adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger.

Your vote is very important. Regardless of the
number of shares you own or whether or not you plan to attend
the special meeting, it is important that your shares be
represented and voted. Voting instructions are inside.

The accompanying proxy statement/prospectus
provides you with detailed information about the proposed merger
and the special meeting. I urge you to read the entire document
carefully. In particular, you should carefully consider the

Questions and Answers About the
Merger

Q: Why are eBay and PayPal proposing
to merge?

A: 

We are proposing to merge because we believe that
    combining the strengths of our two companies is in the best
    interests of each company, its stockholders and customers.
    PayPal and eBay share the same overarching mission 
    to enable online commerce. With PayPal integrated into eBay, the
    combined company should be able to:

 

provide a significantly improved customer
    experience to eBays users by making their trading
    experience easier, safer and faster;

 

combine the core competencies of both companies
    in a natural and complementary way, particularly the overlapping
    user communities and unique skills in technology;

 

strengthen both businesses and realize benefits
    from cost structure efficiencies and improved fraud management;
    and

 

create value for the stockholders of both
    companies, as this merger represents the best strategic
    alternative for our respective companies and is the strategy
    most likely to deliver increased value to our respective
    stockholders.

Please see page 67 of this proxy statement/
    prospectus for the numerous factors considered by the board of
    directors of PayPal in recommending that PayPal stockholders
    vote FOR the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement
    and approve the merger. Please see page 75 of this proxy
    statement/prospectus for eBays reasons for the merger.

Q: What will I receive in the
merger?

A: 

If the merger agreement is approved and adopted
    by PayPal stockholders and the merger is completed, you will
    receive 0.39 of a share of eBay common stock in exchange for
    each share of PayPal common stock that you own.

You will not receive fractional shares of eBay
    common stock. Instead, you will receive the cash value, without
    interest, of any fractional share of eBay common stock that you
    might otherwise have been entitled to receive.

Q: When do you expect the merger to be
completed?

A: 

eBay and PayPal are working toward completing the
    merger as quickly as possible. The merger is expected to close
    in the first part of the fourth quarter of 2002.

Q: Am I entitled to appraisal
rights?

A: 

No. Under Delaware law, no appraisal rights
    are available to PayPal stockholders in connection with the
    merger.

Q: What are the tax consequences of
the merger to me?

A: 

We expect that the exchange of your shares of
    PayPal common stock for shares of eBay common stock generally
    will not cause you to recognize gain or loss for
    U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, you will
    recognize income or gain with respect to cash received instead
    of fractional shares of eBay common stock. It is a condition to
    the merger that eBay and PayPal receive legal opinions about the
    U.S. federal income tax treatment of the merger with
    respect to our companies and our stockholders. These opinions
    will not bind the Internal Revenue Service, which could take a
    different view. To review the tax consequences to stockholders
    in greater detail, see The Merger  Material
    Federal Income Tax Consequences on page 76.

Q: 

Are there any risks related to the proposed
    transaction or any risks related to owning eBay common
    stock?

A: 

Yes. You should carefully review the risk factors
    beginning on page 25.

    and approved the merger agreement and the merger. Accordingly,

i.e.
, in street name), you must
    provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on
    how to vote your shares. Please check the voting instruction
    card used by your broker or nominee to see if you may use the
    telephone or the Internet to provide instructions on how to vote
    your shares.

    vote at the special meeting. If you hold shares in a stock
    brokerage account or if your shares are held by a bank or

Q:

If my shares are held in street
    name by my broker, will my broker vote my shares for
    me?

A:

Your broker will vote your shares only if you
    provide instructions on how to vote. Therefore, you should be
    sure to provide your broker with instructions on how to vote
    your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be
    voted, which will have the effect of a vote 
against 
the
    approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of
    the merger.

    vote?

A:

We cannot complete the merger without the
    approval of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
    PayPal common stock.

(Page 67)

After careful consideration of the numerous
factors described in the section entitled The
Merger  PayPals Reasons for the Merger;
Recommendation of the PayPal Board beginning on
page 67 of this proxy statement/ prospectus, PayPals
board of directors determined that the merger is advisable, and

recommends that PayPal stockholders vote FOR the proposal to
approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger.

the aggregate approximately 27.7% of the outstanding PayPal

agreement and approve the merger.

Interests of Certain Persons in the
Merger

(Page 80)

When considering the recommendation by
PayPals board of directors to vote FOR the proposal to
approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger,
you should be aware that some directors and executive officers
of PayPal have interests in the merger that may be different
from your interests. Some executive officers of PayPal have
executed employment agreements with eBay, which will become
effective upon completion of the merger. Some directors,
officers and employees of PayPal who hold stock options and/or
shares of restricted stock pursuant to existing plans will
receive certain benefits upon completion of the merger,
including accelerated vesting of those stock options and/or
shares of restricted stock. Some directors and executive
officers of PayPal who are parties to stockholders agreements
with eBay are entitled to early release of certain transfer
restrictions with respect to the PayPal common stock held by
them upon adoption of the merger agreement by PayPals
stockholders. PayPal directors and officers will also receive
indemnification and liability insurance benefits from eBay.
PayPals board of directors was aware of these interests
and considered them in approving the merger agreement and the
merger.

Stock Ownership by Directors and Executive
Officers of PayPal

(Page 79)

As of the record date for the special meeting,
the directors and executive officers of PayPal and their
affiliates, as a group, beneficially owned approximately 36.5%
of the outstanding PayPal common stock. The vote of holders of a

approximately 24.0 million shares of eBay common stock in
the merger based on the number of shares of PayPal common stock
outstanding as of the record date.

Based on the number of shares of eBay common
stock and PayPal common stock outstanding as of August 28,
2002, existing PayPal stockholders will own approximately 8.5%
of the eBay common stock outstanding immediately after the
merger.

Nasdaq Listing

(Page 79)

If we complete the merger, stockholders will be
able to trade the shares of eBay common stock they receive in
the merger on the Nasdaq National Market. If we complete the
merger, PayPal stock will no longer be quoted on the Nasdaq
National Market or any other exchange.

Opinion of PayPals Financial
Advisor

(Page 70)

In deciding to approve the merger, the PayPal
board considered, among other things, the opinion of its
financial advisor, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated,
to the effect that, as of July 7, 2002 and based on and
subject to the considerations in its opinion, the exchange ratio
pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point
of view to holders of PayPal common stock.

The full text of the written opinion of Morgan
Stanley, which sets forth assumptions made, matters considered,
procedures followed and the scope of the review undertaken, is
attached to this proxy statement/ prospectus as Annex D. The
written opinion of Morgan Stanley is not a recommendation as to
how you should vote in regard to the proposal to approve and
adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. 
We
encourage you to read the opinion of Morgan Stanley in its
entirety.

The Merger Agreement

(Page 83)

The merger agreement is attached as Annex A to
this proxy statement/prospectus. 
We encourage you to read the
merger agreement in its entirety.
 It is the most important
legal document governing the merger.

The Merger

(Page 64)

In the merger, Vaquita Acquisition Corp. will be
merged with and into PayPal. PayPal will be the surviving
corporation and will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of eBay.

Exchange Ratio

(Page 64)

If the merger agreement is approved and adopted
and the merger is completed, you will receive 0.39 of a share of
eBay common stock in exchange for each share of PayPal common
stock that you own.

Fractional Shares

(Page 64)

You will not receive fractional shares of eBay
common stock. Instead, you will receive the cash value, without
interest, of any fractional share of eBay common stock that you
might otherwise have been entitled to receive.



Conditions To The Merger

(Page 90)

The merger will be completed only if several
conditions are satisfied or waived. The conditions include:

 

approval and adoption of the merger agreement by
    the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of PayPal
    common stock;

 

all filings, consents, registrations, approvals
    and authorizations required to be made to or obtained from any
    governmental entity prior to the completion of the merger by
    eBay and PayPal in connection with the execution and delivery of
    the merger agreement and the completion of the merger having
    been made or obtained, except that this condition will be deemed
    to have been satisfied unless the failure to make such filings
    or obtain such consents, registrations, approvals, permits and
    authorizations, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or is
    reasonably likely to have, a material adverse effect on eBay or
    PayPal;

 

no court or governmental entity of competent
    jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced
    or entered any statute, law, ordinance, rule, regulation,
    judgment, decree, injunction or other order (whether temporary,
    preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and restrains,
    enjoins or otherwise prohibits consummation of the merger or the
    other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and no
    governmental entity shall have instituted any proceeding seeking
    any such order; and

 

the accuracy of representations and warranties of
    eBay and PayPal contained in the merger agreement without regard
    to any materiality qualification, except that this condition
    will be deemed to have been satisfied even if such
    representation and warranty is not accurate unless the failure
    of such representation and warranty, individually or in the
    aggregate, has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material
    adverse effect on such company.

Termination

(Page 93)

eBay and PayPal can agree to terminate the merger
agreement without completing the merger, and either company can
terminate the merger agreement if any of the following occurs:

 

they do not complete the merger by
    December 31, 2002, except that if either party determines
    that additional time is necessary in order to forestall any
    action to restrain, enjoin or prohibit the merger by any
    federal, state, local or foreign court or governmental entity
    with jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable antitrust
    laws, the termination date may be extended by such party to a
    date not beyond March 31, 2003;

 

PayPals stockholders do not approve the
    merger at the special meeting; or

 

a law, injunction or order is issued that
    permanently restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the merger
    and that is final and non-appealable.

If a party elects to extend the termination date
to March 31, 2003 as described above, then the other party
may deliver a written update of its disclosure letter within
three business days of such election to reflect new facts
occurring after the date of the merger agreement. The update may
be accompanied by a written request that the party electing to
extend the termination date confirm that such new facts will not
be deemed to render any of the non-extending partys
representations and warranties untrue or incorrect as of such
date or deemed to constitute a PayPal material adverse effect or
an eBay material adverse effect, as the case may be, as of such
date. If the party electing to extend the termination date does
not provide such confirmation prior to the fifth business day
after receiving such written update, then the termination date
may not be extended.



In addition, PayPal may terminate the merger
agreement if there has been a breach of a representation or
covenant by eBay that would cause it to fail to satisfy a
closing condition and such breach is not curable or, if curable,
is not cured within 30 days after eBay receives written
notice of the breach from PayPal.

In addition, eBay may terminate the merger
agreement if:

 

PayPals board of directors has changed or
    withdrawn its recommendation; or

 

there has been a breach of a representation or
    covenant by PayPal that would cause it to fail to satisfy a
    closing condition and such breach is not curable or, if curable,
    is not cured within 30 days after PayPal receives written
    notice of the breach from eBay.

Termination Fee and Expense
Reimbursement

(Page 94)

PayPal has to pay a termination fee of
$5 million and expenses to eBay if eBay terminates the
merger agreement after PayPals board of directors has
withdrawn or adversely changed its approval or recommendation of
the merger agreement in the absence of an acquisition proposal.

Under the merger agreement, an acquisition
proposal is any proposal or offer with respect to a merger,
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or similar
transaction involving, or any purchase of all or any material
portion of the assets of, or 20% or more of the equity
securities in, PayPal or any of its subsidiaries.

PayPal has to pay a termination fee of
$45 million and expenses to eBay if, after an acquisition
proposal has been made to PayPal or any person has publicly
announced an intention, whether or not conditional, to make an
acquisition proposal with respect to PayPal or any of its
subsidiaries, the merger agreement has been terminated by either
eBay or PayPal because:

 

the merger has not been completed by
    December 31, 2002, or March 31, 2003, if applicable;

 

PayPals stockholders do not approve the
    merger;

 

PayPals board of directors has withdrawn or
    adversely modified its approval or recommendation; or

 

there has been a breach of any representation,
    warranty, covenant or agreement made by PayPal in the merger
    agreement, or any such representation and warranty becomes
    untrue after the date of the merger agreement, such that certain
    conditions to closing of eBay would not be satisfied and such
    breach or condition is not curable or, if curable, is not cured
    within 30 days after written notice thereof is given by
    eBay to PayPal; and

thereafter PayPal enters into an agreement that
is announced within 12 months and completed within
18 months after termination of the merger agreement and
that agreement would have constituted an acquisition proposal if
it had been negotiated during the term of the merger agreement.

Regulatory Approvals

(Page 78)

The Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
of 1976, as amended, prohibits eBay and PayPal from completing
the merger until eBay and PayPal have furnished certain
information and materials to the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and the
required waiting period has expired or been terminated. On
July 18, 2002, eBay and PayPal each filed the required
notification and report forms. Early termination of the required
waiting period was granted on August 19, 2002.

In addition to the United States, eBay and PayPal
are required to make antitrust filings in Brazil and Germany.
The parties submitted a filing to the Brazilian antitrust
authorities on July 26, 2002 and to the German authorities
on August 1, 2002. The German authorities granted voluntary
termination of the



review period on August 21, 2002. Antitrust
clearance in Brazil is not required before completion of the
merger.

eBay is required to make filings under applicable
money transmitter laws in the States of Arizona, Maryland and
Vermont and the District of Columbia and may be required to make
filings in additional jurisdictions.

Litigation Related to the Merger

(Page 79)

As of the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus, we are aware of five purported class
action lawsuits that have been filed by alleged stockholders of
PayPal. These lawsuits name as defendants PayPal and each member
of its board of directors as well as eBay. The lawsuits allege,
among other things, that eBay controls PayPal, the defendants
have breached fiduciary duties they assertedly owed to
PayPals stockholders in connection with PayPal entering
into the merger agreement and the exchange ratio is unfair and
inadequate. The plaintiffs in each lawsuit seek, among other
things, an injunction against the consummation of the merger and
an award of unspecified compensatory damages. We believe that
each of the lawsuits is without merit and intend to defend
ourselves vigorously.

No Appraisal Rights

(Page 79)

Under Delaware law, no appraisal rights are
available to PayPal stockholders.

Material Federal Income Tax
Consequences

(Page 76)

We expect that the exchange of your shares of
PayPal common stock for shares of eBay common stock generally
will not cause you to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. However, you will recognize income or gain
with respect to cash received instead of fractional shares of
eBay common stock. It is a condition to the merger that eBay and
PayPal receive legal opinions about the U.S. federal income tax
treatment of the merger with respect to our companies and our
stockholders. These opinions will not bind the Internal Revenue
Service, which could take a different view.

Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement
Concerning Forward-Looking Statements

(Pages 25 through 59)

By voting in favor of the proposal to approve and
adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger, you will be
choosing to invest in eBay common stock. An investment in eBay
common stock involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the
other information contained in or incorporated by reference into
this proxy statement/ prospectus, you should carefully consider
the factors discussed under the caption entitled Risk
Factors beginning on page 25 in deciding whether to
vote in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger
agreement and approve the merger.

This proxy statement/prospectus and the documents
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus
contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties, such as statements of eBays, PayPals
and the combined companys plans, objectives, expectations
and intentions. When used in this proxy statement/ prospectus
and the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus, the words may,
might, should, expects,
anticipates, believes,
estimates, intends and plans
and similar expressions are intended to identify certain of
these forward-looking statements. Because these forward-looking
statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those
discussed under the caption entitled Risk Factors,
the actual results of eBay, PayPal and the combined company
could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the
forward-looking statements in this proxy statement/ prospectus
and the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/ prospectus.



Comparison of Rights of PayPal Stockholders
and eBay Stockholders

(Page 159)

PayPals charter and bylaws and Delaware
corporate law govern the rights of PayPal stockholders.
eBays charter and bylaws and Delaware corporate law will
govern your rights as a stockholder of eBay following the
merger. Your rights under eBays charter and bylaws will
differ in some respects from your rights under PayPals
charter and bylaws.



PayPal Selected Financial Data

The following PayPal selected financial data is
provided to aid your analysis of the financial aspects of the
merger. When you read this historical financial data, it is
important that you also read the historical consolidated
financial statements and related notes included in this proxy
statement/prospectus beginning on page F-1, as well as the
section entitled PayPal Managements Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of
PayPal beginning on page 130 of this proxy
statement/prospectus.

The table below presents selected historical
consolidated financial data of PayPal. PayPal has prepared this
information using its consolidated financial statements for
(1) the period from March 8, 1999 (PayPals
inception) to December 31, 1999, (2) each of the two
years in the period ended December 31, 2001, and
(3) the six-month periods ended June 30, 2001 and
June 30, 2002. The consolidated statements for the period
from March 8, 1999 to December 31, 1999, and for each
of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2001,
have been audited. The consolidated financial statements for the
six-month periods ended June 30, 2001 and June 30,
2002 have not been audited. In the opinion of PayPals
management, these unaudited statements have been prepared on
substantially the same basis as the audited consolidated
financial statements and include all adjustments necessary for a
fair statement of the consolidated information for the periods
presented. Operating results of the six months ended
June 30, 2001 and June 30, 2002 are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire
year ending December 31, 2002.

PayPal adopted provisions of EITF 01-09

Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a
    Customer or a Reseller of the Vendors Products

    on January 1, 2002. Prior period amounts have been
    reclassified to conform to the new presentation.

(2) 

Beginning in February 2002, PayPal began to
    deposit all U.S.-based customer funds not transferred to the
    PayPal Money Market Reserve Fund into FDIC-insured bank accounts
    and the revenues from interest on funds held for U.S.-based
    customers will cease in future periods.

(3) 

On January 1, 2002, PayPal adopted the
    provisions of SFAS No. 142 and no longer amortizes
    goodwill. During the period from March 8, 1999
    (PayPals inception) to December 31, 1999, PayPal did
    not recognize any goodwill amortization. During the years ended
    December 31, 2000 and 2001, PayPal goodwill amortization
    totaled $46.7 million and $62.2 million, respectively.
    Had PayPals goodwill amortization not been reflected in
    net loss during these years, the net loss amounts for the years
    ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 would have been
    $122.9 million and $45.6 million, respectively, with
    loss per share for these years of $38.03 and $7.05, respectively.

(4) 

PayPal closed its initial public offering on
    February 21, 2002 and issued 6.2 million shares of
    PayPal common stock. All shares of PayPal preferred stock
    outstanding immediately prior to the offering converted into
    43.4 million shares of PayPal common stock at such time.
    Basic net income (loss) per share and shares used in calculating
    basic net income (loss) per share give effect to the conversion
    as of the closing date of the offering.

(5) 

All share and per share amounts reflect
    PayPals historical stock splits in all periods presented.

On January 1, 2002, eBay adopted the
    provisions of SFAS No. 142 and no longer amortizes
    goodwill. During the years ended December 31, 1997 and
    1998, eBay did not recognize any goodwill amortization. During
    the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, eBay
    goodwill amortization totaled $0.1 million,
    $0.6 million and $32.6 million, respectively. Had
    eBays goodwill amortization not been reflected in net
    income during these years, the net income amounts for the years
    ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 would have been
    $9.7 million, $48.9 million and $123.0 million,
    respectively, with diluted income per share for these years of
    $0.04, $0.17 and $0.44, respectively.

eBay

Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined
Financial Information

Introduction

The following unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial information gives effect to the proposed
merger between eBay and PayPal using the purchase method. The
information is only a summary and should be read together with
eBays and PayPals historical financial statements.
eBays historical consolidated financial statements and
related notes are contained in eBays Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001, which
is incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus. See Where You Can Find More
Information on page 165. PayPals historical
consolidated financial statements and related notes are included
elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus beginning on page
F-1.

Pro forma information is based on an exchange
ratio for the merger of 0.39 of a share of eBay common stock for
each share of PayPal common stock. The actual number of shares
of eBay common stock to be issued in the proposed merger and the
total purchase price cannot be determined until the closing date
of the merger. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial information was prepared based on the number of shares
of PayPal common stock outstanding on June 30, 2002.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined
balance sheet is based on the historical balance sheets of eBay
and PayPal and has been prepared to reflect the acquisition as
if it had been consummated on June 30, 2002. The unaudited
pro forma condensed combined statements of income combine the
results of operations of eBay and PayPal for the year ended
December 31, 2001 and the six months ended June 30,
2002, as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2001.

The pro forma adjustments are based on
preliminary estimates, available information and certain
assumptions and may be revised as additional information becomes
available. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
information is not intended to represent what eBays
financial position or results of operations would actually have
been if the acquisition had occurred on those dates or to
project eBays financial position or results of operations
for any future period. Since eBay and PayPal were not under
common control or management for any period presented, the
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial results may not
be comparable to, or indicative of, future performance.

Reclassifications have been made to the PayPal
historical balance sheet and income statement information
previously reported by PayPal to conform to eBays
presentation.

Upon completion of the merger, eBay intends to
discontinue PayPals current business operations related to
payment processing transactions for merchants involved in online
gambling activities. Approximately 8% of PayPals revenues
were derived from those types of transactions in the six-month
period ended June 30, 2002. The unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial information included in this proxy
statement/ prospectus does not include any adjustments for
eBays intended discontinuation of PayPals current
business operations related to payment processing transactions
for merchants involved in online gambling activities.

We cannot assure you that eBay and PayPal will
not incur charges in excess of those included in the pro forma
preliminary purchase price related to the merger or that
management will be successful in its efforts to integrate the
operations of the companies.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial information included in this proxy
statement/prospectus does not include any adjustments for
liabilities resulting from integration planning. Management of
eBay is assessing the costs associated with integration and
estimates of related costs are not yet known.

Notes to eBay Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Combined Financial Information

Note 1  Pro Forma Adjustments
and Assumptions

The measurement date to determine the final
purchase price of the proposed merger has not occurred. The pro
forma adjustments are based on preliminary estimates which may
change as additional information is obtained.

Reclassifications have been made to the PayPal
historical balance sheet and income statement information
previously reported by PayPal to conform to eBays
presentation. PayPals transaction processing expense is
presented by eBay as a component of cost of revenues. The
provision for transaction losses is presented as a component of
general and administrative expense. Customer service and
operations expense is presented as components of cost of net
revenues and general and administrative expense with the
allocation based on the nature of the costs incurred. Selling,
general and administrative expense is presented as a component
of selling and marketing expense and general and administrative
expense with the allocation based on the nature of the costs
incurred. Stock-based compensation is presented as a component
of cost of revenues, sales and marketing expense, product
development expense, and general and administrative expense with
the allocation based on the job responsibility of the individual
employees associated with the cost. Non-recurring charges are
recorded as a component of general and administrative expense.

(a)

The preliminary purchase price reflects the
    assumed issuance of 23,662,000 shares of eBay common stock to
    PayPal stockholders using an exchange ratio of 0.39, based on
    the shares of PayPal common stock outstanding on June 30,
    2002. The fair value of eBay common stock assumed to be issued
    is based on a per share value of $59.50, which is equal to
    eBays average closing share price for the five trading
    days ended July 5, 2002 as reported on the Nasdaq National
    Market. For the purposes of determining the fair value of the
    options assumed, eBay also used the $59.50 per share average
    closing price for the five days ended July 5, 2002. For
    purposes of the pro forma financial information, the following
    table presents the preliminary purchase price.

Preliminary purchase price (in
thousands):

Estimated fair value of PayPal options to be
    assumed

115,614

Estimated acquisition-related costs

18,000

Aggregate purchase price

$

1,541,485

The actual number of shares of eBay common stock
to be issued and PayPal options to be assumed will be based on
the actual number of shares of PayPal common stock and options
outstanding at the closing date.

The estimated acquisition-related costs consist
primarily of investment banking, legal and accounting fees,
printing costs and other external costs directly related to the
acquisition.

The following represents the preliminary
allocation of the aggregate purchase price to the acquired net
assets of PayPay and based on PayPals net assets as of
June 30, 2002.

Unearned stock-based compensation

Goodwill

1,228,820

Aggregate purchase price

$

1,541,485



Net tangible assets were valued at their
respective carrying amounts as management believes that these
amounts approximate their current fair values. PayPals net
tangible assets total $144.7 million as of June 30,
2002, and exclude goodwill and other intangible assets of
$15.6 million.

Management valued the identifiable intangible
assets acquired using a preliminary valuation performed by an
independent appraiser. Identifiable intangible assets consist of
user base, trade name and developed technology totaling
$148 million, $68 million and $14 million,
respectively. Amortization of acquired intangible assets has
been provided over the following estimated useful lives: user
base  seven years; trade name  seven
years; and existing technology  three years. This
allocation will result in annual amortization of approximately
$21 million for user base, $10 million for trade name
and $5 million for existing technology.

The $30 million of unearned stock-based
compensation represents the unearned portion, as of
June 30, 2002, of the intrinsic value of PayPals
unvested common stock options to be assumed in the proposed
merger. For purposes of purchase price allocation, PayPals
outstanding options that will vest solely as a result of the
proposed merger are deemed to be vested as of June 30,
2002. The unearned stock-based compensation relating to the
unvested options is being amortized on an accelerated basis over
the remaining vesting period of less than one to three years,
consistent with the graded vesting approach described in FASB
Interpretation No. 28.

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase
price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable
intangible assets. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined
statement of operations does not reflect the amortization of
goodwill acquired in the proposed merger consistent with the
guidance in Financial Standards Board (FASB) Statement
No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

If eBay had adopted the provisions of
SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2001, eBay goodwill
amortization of $32.6 million would not have been reflected
in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of
income and the pro forma income and diluted pro forma income per
share would have been $67.3 million and $0.22, respectively.

    equity.

(c)

To eliminate PayPals capitalized goodwill
    and other intangible assets aggregating $15.6 million at
    June 30, 2002 and related amortization of
    $65.7 million and $864,000 for the year ended
    December 31, 2001 and the six-month period ended
    June 30, 2002, respectively.

(d)

To amortize unearned stock-based compensation
    resulting from the intrinsic value of PayPals unvested
    common stock options assumed in the proposed merger.

(e)

To provide for a blended statutory tax rate of
    40% for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 38% for the
    six months ended June 30, 2002, adjusted for non-deductible
    expenses.

(f)

Basic net income per share is calculated by
    dividing the net income for the period by the weighted average
    common shares outstanding for the period, inclusive of the
    assumed 23,662,000 shares for issuance in this proposed
    acquisition. Weighted average common shares outstanding for the
    diluted net income per share calculation includes the assumed
    23,662,000 shares for issuance in this proposed acquisition
    and employee stock options determined using the treasury stock
    method, of 1.9 million for the year ended December 31,
    2001 and 1.9 million for the six months ended June 30,
    2002.



Comparative Historical and Pro Forma Per Share
Data

The following tables set forth certain historical
per share data of eBay and PayPal and combined per share data on
an unaudited pro forma basis after giving effect to the merger
using the purchase method of accounting assuming 0.39 of a share
of eBay common stock is used in exchange for each share of
PayPal common stock. The following data should be read in
conjunction with the separate historical consolidated financial
statements of eBay incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/ prospectus and the historical consolidated financial
statements of PayPal included elsewhere in this proxy
statement/prospectus. The unaudited pro forma combined per share
data do not necessarily indicate the operating results that
would have been achieved had the merger been completed as of the
beginning of the earliest period presented and should not be
taken as representative of future operations. All per share
information has been restated, as applicable, for stock splits,
as discussed in PayPals consolidated financial statements
and notes thereto. No cash dividends have ever been declared or
paid on eBay or PayPal common stock.

Historical book value per share is computed by
    dividing stockholders equity by the number of shares of
    eBay or PayPal common stock outstanding at the end of each
    period. Pro forma book value per share is computed by dividing
    pro forma stockholders equity by the pro forma number of
    shares of eBay common stock outstanding at the end of each
    period.

The above table only shows historical
comparisons. The specific dollar value of the eBay common stock
that you will receive upon completion of the merger will depend
on the market value of eBay common stock at the time of
completion of the merger. Accordingly, these comparisons may not
provide you with meaningful information in determining whether
to approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the
merger. You are urged to obtain current market quotations
because the market price of eBay common stock may increase or
decrease before the completion of the merger. You should also
review carefully the other information contained in or
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus.

As of the record date, there were approximately
650 holders of record of PayPal common stock.

Dividend Data

Neither eBay nor PayPal has ever declared or paid
a cash dividend on its common stock. eBay and PayPal currently
intend to retain any future earnings to fund the growth and
development of their businesses and do not anticipate paying any
cash dividends in the foreseeable future.



Risk Factors

By voting in favor of the proposal to approve
and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger, you will
be choosing to invest in eBay common stock. An investment in
eBay common stock involves a high degree of risk. In addition to
the other information contained in or incorporated by reference
into this proxy statement/ prospectus, you should carefully
consider the following risk factors in deciding whether to vote
in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger
agreement and approve the merger.

Risks Related to the Merger

As a PayPal Stockholder, If the Merger Is
    Completed, You Will Receive 0.39 of a Share of eBay Common Stock
    for Each Share of PayPal Common Stock Despite Changes in the
    Market Value of PayPal Common Stock or eBay Common
    Stock.

Upon completion of the merger, each share of
PayPal common stock will be exchanged for 0.39 of a share of
eBay common stock. There will be no adjustment for changes in
the market price of either PayPal common stock or eBay common
stock. Accordingly, the specific dollar value of the eBay common
stock that you will receive upon completion of the merger will
depend on the market value of eBay common stock at the time of
completion of the merger. The merger may not be completed
immediately following the special meeting of PayPal stockholders
if all regulatory approvals have not yet been obtained and other
conditions have not been satisfied or waived. We cannot assure
you that the value of the eBay common stock that you will
receive in the merger will not decline prior to or after the
merger.

The shares of PayPal common stock purchased in
PayPals initial public offering and secondary offering are
generally not subject to any contractual transfer restrictions
and may be sold at any time prior to completion of the merger.
In addition, a significant number of shares of PayPal common
stock are expected to become available for sale upon the
expiration of various lock-up agreements. The following table
sets forth information about the expiration of these lock-up
agreements.

An additional 11,854,336 shares of PayPal common
stock will not become available for sale until after the merger
is completed or the merger agreement is terminated.

Future sales of substantial amounts of PayPal
common stock in the public market, or the availability of such
shares for sale, including shares issued upon the exercise of
outstanding options, could adversely affect the market price of
PayPal common stock and eBay common stock.

PayPal Executive Officers and Directors
    Have Interests that May Influence, or Even Obligate Them to
    Support and Approve the Merger.

Some of the directors and executive officers of
PayPal will receive continuing indemnification against
liabilities and have PayPal restricted stock, stock options and
employment agreements that provide them



with interests in the merger, such as accelerated
vesting of restricted stock and stock options upon completion of
the merger, that are different from, or are in addition to, your
interests in the merger. As a result, these directors and
officers may be more likely to vote to approve and adopt the
merger agreement and approve the merger than if they did not
have these interests. Some of these officers and directors have
already agreed to vote in favor of the proposal to approve and
adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger and will be
released from certain transfer restrictions on their shares of
PayPal common stock upon the approval and adoption of the merger
agreement and approval of the merger. As of the close of
business on the record date for the special meeting of PayPal
stockholders at which the merger agreement will be presented and
voted upon, PayPal officers and directors beneficially owned
approximately 36.5% of all outstanding shares of PayPal common
stock entitled to vote at the meeting. For a description of some
of these interests, see the sections entitled Interests of
Certain Persons in the Merger, The Merger
Agreement and Other Material Agreements Related to
the Merger beginning on page 80, page 83 and
page 95, respectively, of this proxy statement/prospectus.

We Expect to Incur Significant Costs
    Associated with the Merger.

eBay estimates that it will incur direct
transaction costs of approximately $18 million associated
with the merger, which will be included as part of the total
purchase price. In addition, PayPal estimates that it will incur
direct transaction costs of approximately $5 million which
will be recognized as expenses as incurred. eBay and PayPal
believe the combined entity may incur charges to operations,
which are not currently reasonably estimable, in the quarter in
which the merger is completed or the following quarters, to
reflect costs associated with integrating the two companies.
There can be no assurance that the combined company will not
incur additional material charges in subsequent quarters to
reflect additional costs associated with the merger and the
integration of the two companies.

Future Operating Results of the Combined
    Company Could Be Adversely Affected as a Result of Purchase
    Accounting Treatment and the Impact of Amortization and
    Impairment of Intangible Assets Relating to the
    Merger.

In accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, eBay will account for the merger using the purchase
method of accounting. Under the purchase method of accounting,
eBay will record the fair value of the eBay common stock issued
in connection with the merger, the fair value of the options to
purchase PayPal common stock that become options to purchase
eBay common stock and the amount of direct transaction costs as
the cost of combining with PayPal. eBay will allocate the total
purchase price to the individual assets acquired and liabilities
assumed by eBay, including various identifiable intangible
assets (such as user base, trade names and developed
technology), based on their respective fair values at the date
of the completion of the merger. eBays preliminary
valuation of acquired intangible assets totaled
$230 million and these amounts will be required to be
amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from three
to seven years. eBay expects that it will initially incur
incremental charges for amortization of intangible assets of
approximately $9 million per quarter. The purchase price
will also be allocated to deferred compensation, based on the
portion of the intrinsic value of the unvested PayPal options
and restricted stock assumed by eBay to the extent that service
is required after completion of the merger in order to vest. The
preliminary amount allocated to deferred compensation totals
$30 million and eBay expects that it will initially incur
incremental charges for stock based compensation of
approximately $4 million per quarter. Any excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired will be accounted for as
goodwill. eBay will not be required to amortize goodwill against
income but goodwill will be subject to periodic reviews for
impairment. If eBay is required to recognize an impairment
charge, the charge would negatively impact reported earnings in
the period of the charge.



The Market Price of the Shares of eBay
    Common Stock May Be Affected by Factors Different from Those
    Affecting the Shares of PayPal Common Stock.

Upon completion of the merger, holders of PayPal
common stock will become holders of eBay common stock. An
investment in eBay common stock has different risks than an
investment in PayPal common stock. Although eBay currently has
operating subsidiaries that conduct online payment processing
services, such subsidiaries generate a relatively small portion
of eBays total revenues. Accordingly, eBays
business, and the market price of eBay common stock, is affected
by a variety of factors, only some of which apply to online
payment processing services. Former holders of PayPal common
stock will be subject to additional risks upon exchange of their
shares of PayPal common stock for eBay common stock in the
merger, some of which are described below under
 Risks Related to eBay and PayPal as a Combined
Company After the Merger on page 30. For a discussion
of the businesses of eBay and PayPal, see the documents
incorporated by reference into this document and referred to
under Where You Can Find More Information on
page 165 and see the Information About PayPal
section on page 98.

The Discontinuance of PayPals
    Transactions with Merchants Involved in Online Gambling
    Activities is Expected to Reduce PayPals Revenues and
    Profits and Affect the Comparability of PayPals Historical
    Financial Results to Anticipated Future Financial Results of the
    Combined Company.

Upon completion of the merger, eBay intends to
discontinue PayPals current business operations relating
to payment processing transactions for merchants involved in
online gambling activities. Approximately 8% of
PayPals revenues were derived from those types of
transactions in the six-month period ended June 30, 2002.
Because PayPal will no longer derive revenues from these
transactions after the merger has been completed, a comparison
of PayPals pre-merger financial results to the combined
companys post-merger financial results should take into
account the loss of revenues from these transactions.

On August 20, 2002, PayPal reached an
agreement with the Attorney General of the State of
New York in the states inquiry into payments made
through PayPals service to online gambling merchants. In
an assurance of discontinuance made to the New York
Attorney General, PayPal agreed to cease processing payments
from its New York members to online gambling merchants by
September 1, 2002. PayPal took this action in voluntary
cooperation with the New York Attorney General and did not
admit to a violation of law. The New York Attorney General
has agreed to accept PayPals assurance of discontinuance
in lieu of commencing a statutory proceeding. PayPal also agreed
to pay $200,000 to the State of New York in penalties,
disgorged profits and to cover the New York Attorney
Generals costs of investigation.

PayPal has received federal grand jury subpoenas
issued at the request of the United States Attorney for the
Eastern District of Missouri. These subpoenas seek the
production of documents related to online gambling activities.
PayPal intends to cooperate fully with the United States
Attorneys office in this matter.

Risks Related to PayPal if the Merger Is Not
Completed

If the Merger is Not Completed, the Price
    of PayPal Common Stock and Future Business and Operations Could
    Be Harmed.

If the merger is not completed, PayPal may be
subject to the following material risks, among others:

 

PayPal may not be able to find a party willing to
    pay an equivalent or more attractive exchange ratio than the
    ratio offered by eBay;

 

PayPal may be required to pay eBay a termination
    fee of $5,000,000 or $45,000,000 and reimburse eBays
    expenses, as described on page 94;

 

the price of PayPal common stock may decline to
    the extent that the current market price of PayPal common stock
    reflects an assumption that the merger will be completed;



 

PayPals costs related to the merger, such
    as legal, accounting and some of its financial advisory fees,
    must be paid even if the merger is not completed;

 

PayPal would not realize the benefits it expects
    by being part of a combined company with eBay, as well as the
    potentially enhanced financial position as a result of being
    part of the combined company;

 

the diversion of management attention from
    PayPals day-to-day business and the unavoidable disruption
    to its employees and its relationships with users and partners
    as a result of efforts and uncertainties relating to
    PayPals anticipated merger with eBay may detract from
    PayPals ability to grow revenues and minimize costs,
    which, in turn may lead to a loss of market position that PayPal
    could be unable to regain if the merger does not occur; and

 

PayPal may not be able to continue its present
    level of operations, may need to scale back its business and may
    not be able to take advantage of future opportunities or
    effectively respond to competitive pressures, any of which could
    have a material adverse effect on its business and results of
    operations.

Stockholders May Sell Substantial Amounts
    of PayPal Common Stock on the Public Market, Which Is Likely to
    Depress the Price of PayPal Common Stock.

A significant number of shares of PayPal common
stock may be sold at any time prior to the merger, as discussed
on page 25. Any substantial sales of PayPal common stock on
the public market by current stockholders may cause the market
price of PayPal common stock to decline.

If PayPals current stockholders sell PayPal
common stock in the public market prior to the merger, it is
likely that arbitrageurs will acquire such shares. These
arbitrageurs would likely sell all such shares on the public
market immediately following any announcement, or anticipated
announcement, that the merger with eBay failed, or will likely
fail, to close for regulatory or other reasons, which in turn
would likely cause the market price of PayPal common stock to
decline.

In addition to the other negative effects on
PayPal, all such sales of PayPal common stock might make it more
difficult for PayPal to sell equity or equity-related securities
in the future if the merger with eBay is not completed.

The Delay in Closing the Planned Merger
    Could Have an Adverse Effect on PayPals Revenues in the
    Near-term.

To the extent a prolonged delay in completing the
planned merger creates uncertainty among PayPals users,
such delay could have an adverse effect on PayPals results
of operations, and quarterly revenues could be substantially
below the expectations of market analysts and could cause a
reduction in the stock price of PayPal common stock. In
addition, eBay has announced that it plans to phase out
PayPals processing of payments for online gambling
merchants after the merger is completed as a result of the
uncertain regulatory environment surrounding online gambling. As
a result of this announcement, PayPal may lose significant
revenues in the near-term associated with online gambling
merchants seeking alternatives to PayPals product prior to
the merger or arising out of the uncertainty of how long PayPal
may continue to process payments for online gambling merchants.

If the Merger Is Not Completed, a Number of
    Factors May Continue to Cause PayPals Actual Results,
    Levels of Activity, Performance or Achievements to Differ
    Materially from Any Future Results, Levels of Activity,
    Performance or Achievements.

The risks associated with the combined company if
the merger is completed are described below under
 Risks Related to eBay and PayPal as a Combined
Company After the Merger. If the merger is not completed,
PayPal expects to continue to operate its business substantially
as presently operated. Accordingly, a number of factors may
continue to cause PayPals actual results, levels of
activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from
any future results, levels of activity, performance or



achievements. In addition to the factors
described below under  Risks Related to
PayPals Business Prior to and After the Merger,
these factors include without limitation the following:

 

PayPal might not implement successfully
    strategies to increase adoption of its electronic payment
    methods, which would limit PayPals growth and cause its
    stock price to decline.

 

PayPal depends on online auction transactions for
    a significant percentage of its payment volume. If PayPals
    ability to process payments for online auctions is impaired,
    PayPals financial results and growth prospects would be
    affected significantly and negatively.

 

PayPal faces strong competitors and its industry
    is evolving rapidly. If PayPal does not compete effectively, the
    demand for its product may decline, and its business would
    suffer.

 

PayPal has a limited operating history and may
    not continue to be profitable. If PayPal were unable to maintain
    profitability, its stock price would decline.

 

Changes to credit card association rules or
    practices could negatively affect PayPals service and, if
    it does not comply with the rules, could result in a termination
    of PayPals ability to accept credit cards. If PayPal were
    unable to accept credit cards, its competitive position would be
    seriously damaged.

 

PayPal relies on financial institutions,
    including several current or potential competitors, to process
    its payment transactions. Should any of these institutions
    decide to stop processing PayPals payment transactions,
    its business could suffer.

 

Customer complaints or negative publicity about
    PayPals customer service could affect use of its product
    adversely and, as a result, PayPals business could suffer.

 

PayPal may experience breakdowns in its payment
    processing system that could damage customer relations and
    expose PayPal to liability, which could affect adversely its
    ability to provide reliable service.

 

PayPal relies on its customers for distribution
    of its product, and this method of distribution may not meet its
    goals. If PayPals customers stop using its product,
    PayPals business would suffer.

 

PayPals inability to manage growth could
    affect its business adversely and harm its ability to become
    profitable.

 

PayPals quarterly operating results
    fluctuate and may not predict its future performance accurately.
    Variability in PayPals future performance could cause its
    stock price to fluctuate and decline.

 

PayPal may not protect its proprietary technology
    effectively, which would allow competitors to duplicate its
    products. This would make it more difficult for PayPal to
    compete with them.

 

PayPals product features may infringe
    claims of third-party patents, which could affect PayPals
    business and profitability adversely.

 

PayPal has limited experience competing in
    international markets. PayPals international expansion
    plans will expose it to greater political, intellectual
    property, regulatory, exchange rate fluctuation and other risks,
    which could harm its business.

These factors are not exhaustive. Other sections
of this proxy statement/prospectus may include additional
factors that could adversely impact PayPals business and
financial performance. Moreover, PayPal operates in a very
competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors
emerge from time to time and it is not possible for
PayPals management to predict all risk factors, nor can
PayPal assess the impact of all factors on PayPals
business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of
factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from
those contained in any forward-looking statements.



Risks Related to eBay and PayPal as a Combined

    services;

 

increasing consumer acceptance of the Internet
    and other online services for commerce and, in particular, the
    trading of products such as those listed on our websites; and

 

general economic conditions and those economic
    conditions specific to the Internet and e-commerce industries.

Our limited operating history and the increased
variety of services offered on our websites make it difficult
for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues or
earnings accurately. We believe that period-to-period
comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and
you should not rely upon them as an indication of future
performance. We do not have backlog, and a substantial portion
of our net revenues each quarter come from transactions for
items that are listed and sold during that quarter. Our
operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below
the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that
event, the trading price of eBay common stock would almost
certainly decline.

We May Not Maintain
    Profitability.

We believe that our continued profitability will
depend in large part on our ability to do the following:

 

maintain sufficient transaction volume to attract
    buyers and sellers;

 

manage the costs of our business, including the
    costs associated with maintaining and developing our websites,
    customer support and international and product expansion;

 

increase our brand name awareness; and

 

provide our customers with superior community and
    trading experiences.

We are investing heavily in marketing and
promotion, customer support, further development of our
websites, technology and operating infrastructure development.
The costs of these investments are expected to remain
significant into the future. In addition, many of our
acquisitions require continuing investments in these areas and
we have significant ongoing contractual commitments in some of
these areas. As a result, we may be unable to adjust our
spending rapidly enough to compensate for any unexpected revenue
shortfall, which may harm our profitability. The existence of
several larger and more established companies that are enabling
online sales as well as other companies, some of whom do not
charge for transactions on their sites and others who are
facilitating trading through varied pricing formats (e.g.,
fixed-price, reverse auction, group buying) may limit our
ability to raise user fees in response to declines in
profitability. In addition, we are spending in advance of
anticipated growth, which may also harm our profitability. In
view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our
limited operating history, we believe that period-to-period
comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily
meaningful. You should not rely upon our historical results as
indications of our future performance.

Acquisitions Could Result in Dilution,
    Operating Difficulties and Other Harmful
    Consequences.

eBay has acquired a number of businesses,
including Half.com, Internet Auction, iBazar, HomesDirect.com
and NeoCom and, if the merger is completed, PayPal. eBay expects
to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential
strategic transactions, including business combinations,



acquisitions and dispositions of businesses,
technologies, services, products and other assets, including
interests in eBays existing subsidiaries and joint
ventures. At any given time eBay may be engaged in discussions
or negotiations with respect to one or more of such
transactions. Any of such transactions could be material to
eBays financial condition and results of operations. There
is no assurance that any such discussions or negotiations will
result in the consummation of any transaction.

The process of integrating any acquisition,
including the acquisition of PayPal, may create unforeseen
operating difficulties and expenditures and is itself risky. The
areas where we may face difficulties include:

 

diversion of management time at both companies
    during the period of negotiation through closing and further
    diversion of such time after closing, as well as a shift of
    focus from operating the businesses to issues of integration and
    future products;

 

declining employee morale and retention issues
    resulting from changes in compensation, reporting relationships,
    future prospects or the direction of the business;

 

the need to integrate each companys
    accounting, management information, human resource and other
    administrative systems to permit effective management, and the
    lack of control if such integration is delayed or not
    implemented;

 

the need to implement controls, procedures and
    policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies
    that prior to acquisition had lacked such controls, procedures
    and policies; and

 

in some cases, the need to transition operations
    onto the existing eBay platform.

Prior to the four acquisitions eBay made in the
second quarter of 1999, eBay had almost no experience in
managing this integration process. Many of the acquisitions made
to date have involved either family-run companies or very early
stage companies, which may worsen these integration issues.
Foreign acquisitions involve special risks, including those
related to integration of operations across different cultures,
currency risks and the particular economic and regulatory risks
associated with specific countries. Moreover, the anticipated
benefits of any or all of our acquisitions may not be realized.
Future acquisitions or mergers could result in potentially
dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt,
contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to
goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm
our business. Future acquisitions or mergers may require us to
obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be
available on favorable terms or at all. Even if available, this
financing may be dilutive.

A Successful Integration of PayPal May Be
    Difficult.

While eBay has acquired smaller companies in the
past, the acquisition of PayPal represents by far the largest
acquisition by eBay to date. We expect that the process of
integrating PayPals business into the eBay platform will
be relatively difficult and will require significant attention
from management. This may divert managements attention
from its focus on eBays principal business for an extended
period of time. In addition, following the merger PayPal would
continue to operate as an independent wholly-owned subsidiary of
eBay with its own management. Because PayPal will be relatively
independent, efficient cooperation between eBay and PayPal
following the merger will be crucial for a successful
integration of PayPals business into the eBay platform. In
order to facilitate the integration of PayPal into eBay, we
entered into employment agreements with certain key employees of
PayPal pursuant to which these key employees have agreed to
remain employed with PayPal for specified time periods. However,
there can be no assurance that these key employees will not
terminate their employment with PayPal before the expiration of
their employment agreements or agree to continued employment
with PayPal after the expiration of their employment agreements.
For a more detailed discussion of the specific employment terms
of these employment agreements, see Other Material
Agreements Relating to the Merger  eBay Employment
Agreements beginning on page 96. There can be no
assurance that PayPals business will be integrated into
the eBay platform in a timely and efficient manner or that any
of the anticipated benefits of the merger, including those
described in the section entitled The Merger 
eBays Reasons for the



Merger, will be realized. Failure to do so
could materially harm the business and operating results of the
combined company.

There Are Many Risks Associated with Our
    International Operations.

In 1999, we acquired alando.de.ag, a leading
online German trading platform, and began operations in the
United Kingdom and, through a joint venture, in Australia. In
the first quarter of 2000, we expanded into Japan and formally
launched our localized Canadian operations. In October 2000, we
launched our French site. In January 2001, we launched our
Italian site. In February 2001, we completed our acquisition of
a majority interest in Internet Auction, and in May 2001, we
completed our acquisition of iBazar, a French company with
online trading operations in eight countries, primarily in
Europe. In April 2002, we completed our acquisition of NeoCom in
Taiwan. In addition, we intend to expand PayPals business
in selected international markets which will subject PayPal to
more risk relating to international operations. Expansion into
international markets requires management attention and
resources. We have limited experience in localizing our service
to conform to local cultures, standards and policies. In most
countries, we will have to compete with local companies who
understand the local market better than we do. We may not be
successful in expanding into particular international markets or
in generating revenues from foreign operations. For example, we
recently withdrew from the Japanese market. Even if we are
successful, the costs of operating new sites are expected to
exceed our net revenues for at least 12 months in most
countries. As we continue to expand internationally, we are
subject to risks of doing business internationally, including
the following:

 

regulatory requirements, including regulation of
    auctioneering, banking and money transmitting, that may limit or
    prevent the offering of our services in local jurisdictions, may
    prevent enforceable agreements between sellers and buyers, may
    prohibit certain categories of goods, may require special
    licensure or may limit the transfer of information between our
    foreign subsidiaries and ourselves;

 

legal uncertainty regarding liability for the
    listings of our users, including less Internet-friendly legal
    systems, unique local laws and lack of clear precedent or
    applicable law;

 

difficulties in staffing and managing foreign
    operations;

 

longer payment cycles, different accounting
    practices and problems in collecting accounts receivable;

 

local taxation of our fees or of transactions on
    our websites;

 

higher telecommunications and Internet service
    provider costs;

 

strong local competitors;

 

more stringent consumer and data protection laws;

 

cultural non-acceptance of online trading;

 

seasonal reductions in business activity;

 

potentially adverse tax consequences;

 

expenses associated with localizing our products,
    including offering customers the ability to transact business in
    major currencies in addition to the U.S. dollar;

 

laws and business practices that favor local
    competitors;

 

foreign currency restrictions and exchange rate
    fluctuations;

 

changes in a specific countrys or
    regions political or economic conditions; and

 

differing intellectual property laws.



Some of these factors may cause our international
costs to exceed our domestic costs of doing business. To the
extent we expand our international operations and have
additional portions of our international revenues denominated in
foreign currencies, we also could become subject to increased
difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and risks
relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Disputes Between Our South Korean
    Subsidiary, Internet Auction, and Credit Card Companies May Harm
    Our Operations in South Korea.

The South Korean credit card companies providing
payment services to our majority-owned South Korean subsidiary,
Internet Auction, have experienced higher than anticipated
delinquency rates on transactions carried out on the Internet
Auction platform. Some of these delinquencies are related to
fictitious transactions on Internet Auction and other South
Korean Internet sites to enable users to receive cash advances
on their credit cards that would not otherwise be permitted by
the credit card companies. As of June 30, 2002, these
credit card companies were withholding approximately
1.2 billion Won (about $1.0 million) as
collateral against certain delinquent accounts, and
had threatened to terminate their agreements with Internet
Auction if matters were not resolved to their satisfaction.
Internet Auction is currently in negotiations with the major
credit card companies in South Korea to resolve this situation.
Since the spring of 2001, Internet Auction has been implementing
certain user verification and improved site-monitoring processes
that it believes have substantially reduced this type of credit
card misuse on its system. Due to the demands made by two credit
card companies, Internet Auction entered into new agreements
with these companies that could shift the risk of credit card
misuse, nonpayment or chargeback by the purchaser to Internet
Auction and formalize the ability of the credit card companies
to withhold collateral against future delinquencies.
The termination of its agreements with the credit card companies
would adversely affect Internet Auctions business and
could adversely impact eBays business. Further, any
settlement related to past transactions could adversely affect
Internet Auctions results of operations. Certain
legislation recently enacted by the Korean National Assembly
could make Internet Auction liable for credit card misuses by
its users. If Internet Auction becomes liable for credit card
misuse or payment delinquency by its users, Internet Auction may
have to change its procedures and processes relating to
payments, accept higher losses, or both, which could adversely
affect its business and could thereby adversely affect our
business.

Our Revenues from Third-Party Advertising
    and End-to-End Services Are Subject to Factors Beyond Our
    Control and Are Expected to Decrease.

We are receiving revenues from end-to-end service
providers and direct advertising promotions. These revenues may
be affected by the financial condition of the parties with whom
we have these relationships and by the success of online
promotions generally. Recently, the pricing of online
advertisements has deteriorated. Our direct advertising revenues
are dependent in significant part on the performance of
AOLs sales force, over which we do not have control.
Reduction in these revenues, whether due to the softening of the
demand for online advertising in general or particular problems
facing parties with whom we have commercial relationships, would
adversely affect our results. At this time, we expect such
revenues to decrease on an absolute basis in 2002 relative to
2001.

Problems with Third Parties Who Provide
    Services to Our Users Could Harm Us.

A number of third parties provide services to our
users, which indirectly benefit us. Such services include seller
tools that automate and manage listings, merchant tools that
manage listings and interface with inventory management
software, photo hosting, payment processing and other services.
In many cases we have contractual agreements with these
companies, which may give us a direct financial interest in
their success, while in other cases we have none. In either
circumstance, financial, regulatory or other problems that
prevent these companies from providing services to our users
could reduce the number of listings on our websites or make
completing transactions on our websites more difficult, and
thereby harm our business.



Our Failure to Manage Growth Could Harm
    Us.

We currently are experiencing a period of
expansion in our headcount, facilities and infrastructure, and
we anticipate that further expansion will be required to address
potential growth in our customer base and number of listings as
well as our expansion into new geographic areas, types of goods
and alternative methods of sale. This expansion has placed, and
we expect it will continue to place, a significant strain on our
management, operational and financial resources. The areas that
are put under strain by our growth include the following:

 

The Websites.
 We
    must constantly add new hardware, update software and add new
    engineering personnel to accommodate the increased use of our
    and our subsidiaries websites and the new products and
    features we are regularly introducing. This upgrade process is
    expensive, and the increased complexity of our websites
    increases the cost of additional enhancements. If we are unable
    to increase the capacity of our systems at least as fast as the
    growth in demand for this capacity, our websites may become
    unstable and may cease to operate for periods of time. We have
    commenced a significant multi-year project to enhance our
    current technical architecture. If this project is not
    successful, our business could be harmed. We have experienced
    periodic unscheduled downtime. Continued unscheduled downtime
    would harm our business and also could anger users of our
    websites and reduce future revenues.

 

Customer Support.
 We
    are expanding our customer support operations to accommodate the
    increased number of users and transactions on our websites and
    the increased level of trust and safety activity we provide
    worldwide. If we are unable to provide these operations in a
    cost-effective manner, users of our websites may have negative
    experiences, and current and future revenues could suffer, or
    our operating margins may decrease.

 

Customer Accounts.

    Our revenues are dependent on prompt and accurate billing
    processes. If we are unable to grow our transaction processing
    abilities to accommodate the increasing number of transactions
    that must be billed, our ability to collect revenue will be
    harmed.

We must continue to hire, train and manage new
employees at a rapid rate. If our new hires perform poorly, or
if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing and
integrating these new employees, or if we are not successful in
retaining our existing employees, our business may be harmed. To
manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we
will need to improve our transaction processing, operational and
financial systems, procedures and controls. This is a special
challenge as we acquire new operations with different systems.
Our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures and
controls may not be adequate to support our future operations.
We may be unable to hire, train, retain and manage required
personnel or to identify and take advantage of existing and
potential strategic relationships and market opportunities. The
additional headcount and capital investments we are adding
increases our cost base, which will make it more difficult for
us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by offsetting expense
reductions in the short term.

Our Business May Be Harmed by the Listing
    or Sale by Our Users of Illegal Items.

The law relating to the liability of providers of
online services for the activities of their users on their
service is currently unsettled. We are aware that certain goods,
such as firearms, other weapons, adult material, tobacco
products, alcohol and other goods that may be subject to
regulation by local, state or federal authorities, have been
listed and traded on our service. We may be unable to prevent
the sale of unlawful goods, or the sale of goods in an unlawful
manner, by users of our service, and we may be subject to
allegations of civil or criminal liability for unlawful
activities carried out by users through our service. We have
been subject to several lawsuits based upon such allegations. In
order to reduce our exposure to this liability, we have
prohibited the listing of certain items and increased the number
of personnel reviewing questionable items. In the future, we may
implement other protective measures that could require us to
spend substantial resources and/or to reduce revenues by
discontinuing certain service offerings. Any costs incurred as a
result of liability or asserted liability relating to the sale
of unlawful goods or the unlawful sale of goods, could harm our
business. In addition, we have received significant and



continuing media attention relating to the
listing or sale of unlawful goods on our websites. This negative
publicity could damage our reputation and diminish the value of
our brand name. It also could make users reluctant to continue
to use our services.

We Are Subject to Intellectual Property and
    Other Litigation.

On April 25, 2000, we were served with a
lawsuit, Gentry et al. v. eBay, Inc. et al., filed in
Superior Court in San Diego, California. The lawsuit was filed
on behalf of a purported class of eBay users who purchased
allegedly forged autographed sports memorabilia on eBay. The
lawsuit claims we were negligent in permitting certain named
(and other unnamed) defendants to sell allegedly forged
autographed sports memorabilia on eBay. In addition, the lawsuit
claims we violated California unfair competition law, and a
section of the California Civil Code which prohibits
dealers from selling sports memorabilia without a
Certificate of Authenticity. The lawsuit seeks class
action certification, compensatory damages, a civil penalty of
ten times actual damages, interest, costs and fees and
injunctive relief. On January 26, 2001, the court issued a
ruling dismissing all claims against us in the lawsuit. The
court ruled that our business falls within the safe harbor
provisions of 47 USC 230, which grants Internet
service providers such as eBay immunity from state claims based
on the conduct of third parties. The court also noted that we
were not a dealer under California law and thus not
required to provide certificates of authenticity with autographs
sold over our site by third parties. The plaintiffs appealed
this ruling. A hearing on the plaintiffs appeal of this
ruling was held on April 10, 2002 and the appeals court
upheld the trial courts decision in our favor on
June 26, 2002.

On April 25, 2001, our European
subsidiaries, eBay GmbH and eBay International AG, were sued by
Montres Rolex S.A. and certain Rolex affiliates, or Rolex,
in the regional court of Cologne, Germany. The suit has been
moved to the regional court in Dusseldorf, Germany and is
scheduled to be heard in September 2002. Rolex alleged that our
subsidiaries were infringing Rolexs trademarks as a result
of users selling counterfeit Rolex watches through our German
website. The suit also alleges unfair competition. Rolex is
seeking an order forbidding the sale of Rolex watches on the
website as well as damages. We believe that we have meritorious
defenses and intend to defend ourselves vigorously.

On September 26, 2001, a complaint was filed
by MercExchange LLC against us, our Half.com subsidiary and
ReturnBuy, Inc. in the Eastern District of Virginia
(No. 2:01-CV-736) alleging infringement of three patents
(relating to online auction technology, multiple database
searching and electronic consignment systems) and seeking a
permanent injunction and damages (including treble damages for
willful infringement). We have answered this complaint, denying
the allegations, and, in April 2002, filed four motions for
summary judgment with respect to various aspects of the case. On
July 10, 2002, the court ruled that there are triable
issues of fact with respect to two of our summary judgment
motions and denied them, while postponing consideration of our
remaining two motions. Trial is now scheduled for
November 12, 2002. We believe that we have meritorious
defenses and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. However,
even if successful, our defense against this action will be
costly and could divert our managements time. If the
plaintiff were to prevail on any of its claims, we might be
forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees, modify our
business practices or even be enjoined from practicing a
significant part of our U.S. business. Any such results
could materially harm our business.

On August 16, 2002, Charles E.
Hill & Associates, Inc., or Hill, filed a lawsuit in
the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas
(No. 2:02-CV-186) alleging that we and 17 other
companies, primarily large retailers, infringed three patents
owned by Hill relating to electronic catalog systems and methods
for producing data at a remote location, updating that data and
displaying that data. The suit seeks an injunction against
continuing infringement, unspecified damages, including trebled
damages for willful infringement, and interest, costs, expenses
and fees. We believe that we have meritorious defenses and
intend to defend ourselves vigorously.

In connection with the proposed acquisition of
PayPal, three purported class action complaints have been filed
in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware in and for New
Castle County by alleged stockholders of PayPal. Two additional
purported class action complaints have been filed in the Superior



Court of the State of California, County of Santa
Clara, by alleged PayPal stockholders. These complaints name as
defendants PayPal and each member of its board of directors as
well as eBay. The complaints are purported class actions that
allege, among other things, that eBay controls PayPal, the
defendants have breached fiduciary duties they assertedly owed
to PayPals stockholders in connection with PayPal entering
into the merger agreement and the exchange ratio is unfair and
inadequate. The plaintiffs in each lawsuit seek, among other
things, an injunction against the consummation of the merger and
an award of unspecified compensatory damages. We believe that
each of the lawsuits is without merit and intend to defend
ourselves vigorously.

PayPal has been sued for patent infringement,
including a suit by Tumbleweed Communications Corporation that
is currently ongoing. If all or any portion of PayPals
service were found to infringe a patent, we could be required to
restructure our payment system, stop offering PayPals
payment product altogether, or pay substantial damages or
license fees to third party patent owners.

Other third parties have from time to time
claimed, and others may claim in the future that we have
infringed their past, current or future intellectual property
rights. We have in the past been forced to litigate such claims.
We may become more vulnerable to such claims as the courts
interpret laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and
as we expand into jurisdictions where the underlying laws with
respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries like
ourselves is less favorable. We expect that we will increasingly
be subject to copyright and trademark infringement claims as the
geographical reach of our services expands. We also expect that
we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims as
our services expand. We have been notified of several potential
disputes. These claims, whether meritorious or not, could be
time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause service
upgrade delays, require expensive changes in our methods of
doing business or could require us to enter into costly royalty
or licensing agreements, if available. As a result, these claims
could harm our business.

Our Business May Be Harmed by the Listing
    or Sale by Our Users of Pirated or Counterfeit
    Items.

We have received in the past, and we anticipate
we will receive in the future, communications alleging that
certain items listed or sold through our service by our users
infringe third-party copyrights, trademarks and tradenames or
other intellectual property rights. Although we have sought to
work actively with the content community to eliminate infringing
listings on our websites, some content owners have expressed the
view that our efforts are insufficient. Content owners have been
active in defending their rights against online companies,
including eBay. Allegations of infringement of third-party
intellectual property rights have in the past and may in the
future result in litigation against us. Such litigation is
costly for us, could result in increased costs of doing business
through adverse judgment or settlement, could require us to
change our business practices in expensive ways, or could
otherwise harm our business. Litigation against other online
companies could result in interpretations of the law that could
also require us to change our business practices or otherwise
increase our costs.

Our Business May Be Harmed by Fraudulent
    Activities on Our Websites.

Our future success will depend largely upon
sellers reliably delivering and accurately representing their
listed goods and buyers paying the agreed purchase price. We
have received in the past, and anticipate that we will receive
in the future, communications from users who did not receive the
purchase price or the goods that were to have been exchanged. In
some cases, individuals have been arrested and convicted for
fraudulent activities using our websites. While we can suspend
the accounts of users who fail to fulfill their delivery
obligations to other users, we do not have the ability to
require users to make payments or deliver goods or otherwise
make users whole other than through our limited buyer protection
programs. Other than through these programs, we do not
compensate users who believe they have been defrauded by other
users. We also periodically receive complaints from buyers as to
the quality of the goods purchased. Negative publicity generated
as a result of fraudulent or deceptive conduct by users of our
service could damage our reputation and diminish the value of
our brand name. We expect to continue to receive requests from
users requesting reimbursement or threatening or commencing
legal action against us if no reimbursement is made. Our
liability for these sorts of claims is only beginning to be
clarified and may be



higher in some non-U.S. jurisdictions than
it is in the U.S. This sort of litigation could be costly for
us, divert management attention, result in increased costs of
doing business, lead to adverse judgments or could otherwise
harm our business. In addition, affected users will likely
complain to regulatory agencies who could take action against
us, including imposing fines or seeking injunctions.

Government Inquiries May Lead to Charges or
    Penalties.

On January 29, 1999, we received initial
requests to produce certain records and information to the
federal government relating to an investigation of possible
illegal transactions in connection with our websites. We were
informed that the inquiry includes an examination of our
practices with respect to these transactions. We have continued
to provide further information in connection with this ongoing
inquiry. In order to protect the investigation, the court has
ordered that no further public disclosures be made with respect
to the matter.

On August 20, 2002, PayPal reached an
agreement with the Attorney General of the State of
New York in the states inquiry into payments made
through PayPals service to online gambling merchants. In
an assurance of discontinuance made to the New York
Attorney General, PayPal agreed to cease processing payments
from its New York members to online gambling merchants by
September 1, 2002. PayPal took this action in voluntary
cooperation with the New York Attorney General and did not
admit to a violation of law. The New York Attorney General
has agreed to accept PayPals assurance of discontinuance
in lieu of commencing a statutory proceeding. PayPal also agreed
to pay $200,000 to the State of New York in penalties,
disgorged profits and to cover the New York Attorney
Generals costs of investigation.

PayPal has received federal grand jury subpoenas
issued at the request of the United States Attorney for the
Eastern District of Missouri. These subpoenas seek the
production of documents related to online gambling activities.
PayPal intends to cooperate fully with the United States
Attorneys office in this matter.

Should these or any other investigations lead to
civil or criminal charges against us, we would likely be harmed
by negative publicity, the costs of litigation, the diversion of
management time and other negative effects, even if we
ultimately prevail. Our business would suffer if we were not to
prevail in any actions like these. Even the process of providing
records and information can be expensive, time consuming and
result in the diversion of management attention.

A large number of transactions occur on our
websites. We believe that government regulators have received a
substantial number of consumer complaints about us, which, while
small as a percentage of our total transactions, are large in
aggregate numbers. As a result, we have from time to time been
contacted by various foreign, federal, state and local
regulatory agencies and been told that they have questions with
respect to the adequacy of the steps we take to protect our
users from fraud. We are likely to receive additional inquiries
from regulatory agencies in the future, which may lead to action
against us. We have responded to all inquiries from regulatory
agencies by describing our current and planned antifraud
efforts. If one or more of these agencies is not satisfied with
our response to current or future inquiries, the resultant
investigations and potential fines or other penalties could harm
our business.

We are subject to laws relating to the use and
transfer of personally identifiable information about our users
and their transfers, especially outside of the U.S.
Violation of these laws, which in many cases apply not only to
third-party transfers but also to transfers of information
between ourselves and our subsidiaries, and between ourselves,
our subsidiaries and our commercial partners could subject us to
significant penalties and negative publicity and could adversely
affect us.

Third Parties or Governmental Agencies May
    View Our Behavior as Anti-Competitive.

Third parties, including PayPal, have in the past
and may in the future allege that actions taken by us violate
the antitrust or competition laws of the U.S. or other
countries, or otherwise constitute unfair competition. Such
claims typically are very expensive to defend, involve negative
publicity and diversion of



management time and effort and could result in
significant judgments against us, all of which would adversely
affect us.

We have provided information to the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice in connection with an
inquiry into our conduct with respect to auction
aggregators including our licensing program and a
previously settled lawsuit against Bidders Edge. Although
the Antitrust Division has closed this inquiry, if the
Department of Justice or any other antitrust agency were to open
other investigations of our activities, we would likely be
harmed by negative publicity, the costs of the action, possible
private antitrust lawsuits, the diversion of management time and
effort and penalties we might suffer if we ultimately were not
to prevail.

Some of Our Businesses Are Subject to
    Regulation and Others May Be in the Future.

As our activities and the types of goods listed
on our site expand, state regulatory agencies may claim that we
are subject to licensure in their jurisdiction, either with
respect to our services in general, or in order to sell certain
types of goods (e.g., real estate, boats, automobiles). We are
currently subject to potential regulation under the Office of
Banks and Real Estate, or OBRE, in Illinois concerning the
applicability of the Illinois auction law to our services. In
August 2002, Illinois amended the Illinois auction law to
provide for a special regulatory regime for Internet
auction listing services. We expect to register as an
Internet auction listing service in Illinois following the
adoption of regulations under the amended statute. Although we
do not expect this registration to have a negative impact on our
business, other regulatory and licensure claims could result in
costly litigation or could require us to change our manner of
doing business in ways that increase our costs or reduce our
revenues or force us to prohibit listings of certain items for
some locations. We could also be subject to fines or other
penalties. Any of these outcomes could harm our business.

As we have expanded internationally, we have
become subject to additional regulations, including regulations
on the transmission of personal information. These laws may
require costly changes to our business practices. If we are
found to have violated any of these laws, we could be subject to
fines or penalties, and our business could be harmed.

Kruse is subject to regulation in some
jurisdictions governing the manner in which live auctions are
conducted. It is required to obtain licenses in these
jurisdictions with respect to its business or to permit the sale
of specific categories of items (e.g., automobiles and real
estate). These licenses generally must be renewed regularly and
are subject to revocation for violation of law, violation of the
regulations governing auctions in general or the sale of the
particular item and other events. If Kruse were unable to renew
a license or had a license revoked, its business would be
harmed. In addition, changes to the regulations or the licensure
requirements could increase the complexity and the cost of doing
auctions, thereby harming us.

Until Billpoints operations are phased out,
Billpoint will be subject to many of the risks relating to
PayPal which are described under  Risks Related
to PayPals Business Prior to and After the Merger
beginning on page 50.

Our Business May Be Subject to Sales and
    Other Taxes.

We do not collect sales or other similar taxes on
goods or services sold by users through our service. One or more
states or any foreign country may seek to impose VAT or sales or
use tax collection or record-keeping obligations on companies
such as ours that engage in or facilitate online commerce. Such
taxes could be imposed if, for example, we were ever deemed to
be an auctioneer or the agent of our sellers. Several proposals
have been made at the state and local level that would impose
additional taxes on the sale of goods and services through the
Internet. These proposals, if adopted, could substantially
impair the growth of e-commerce, and could diminish our
opportunity to derive financial benefit from our activities. In
1998, the U.S. federal government enacted legislation
prohibiting states or other local authorities from imposing new
taxes on Internet commerce for a period of three years, which
has been extended through November 1, 2003. This moratorium
does not prohibit states or the Internal Revenue



Service from collecting taxes on our income, if
any, or from collecting taxes that are due under existing tax
rules. New regulations in the European Union relating to the
collection of VAT on digital services might require us to
collect and remit VAT on our own fees beginning in July 2003. We
intend to work with the relevant taxing authorities to clarify
our obligations under these regulations. A successful assertion
by one or more states or any foreign country that we should
collect sales or other taxes on the exchange of merchandise on
our system would harm our business.

We Are Subject to Risks Associated with
    Information Disseminated Through Our Service.

The law relating to the liability of online
services companies for information carried on or disseminated
through their services is currently unsettled. Claims could be
made against online services companies under both U.S. and
foreign law for defamation, libel, invasion of privacy,
negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other
theories based on the nature and content of the materials
disseminated through their services. Several private lawsuits
seeking to impose liability upon us under a number of these
theories have been brought against us. In addition, federal,
state and foreign legislation has been proposed that imposes
liability for or prohibits the transmission over the Internet of
certain types of information. Our service features a Feedback
Forum, which includes information from users regarding other
users. Although all such feedback is generated by users and not
by us, it is possible that a claim of defamation or other injury
could be made against us for content posted in the Feedback
Forum. Claims like these are more likely to arise and have a
higher probability of success in jurisdictions outside
the U.S. If we become liable for information provided by
our users and carried on our service in any jurisdiction in
which we operate, we could be directly harmed and we may be
forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this
liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources
and/or to discontinue certain service offerings, which would
negatively affect our financial results. In addition, the
increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of
these lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our
reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any
costs incurred as a result of this liability or asserted
liability could harm our business.

The Inability to Expand Our Systems May
    Limit Our Growth.

We seek to generate a high volume of traffic and
transactions on our services. The satisfactory performance,
reliability and availability of our websites, processing systems
and network infrastructure are critical to our reputation and
our ability to attract and retain large numbers of users. Our
revenues depend primarily on the number of items listed by
users, the volume of user transactions that are successfully
completed and the final prices paid for the items listed. We
need to expand and upgrade our technology, transaction
processing systems and network infrastructure both to meet
increased traffic on our site and to implement new features and
functions, including those required under our contracts with
third parties. We may be unable to project accurately the rate
or timing of increases, if any, in the use of our services or to
expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate
any increases in a timely fashion.

We use internally developed systems to operate
our service for transaction processing, including billing and
collections processing. We must continually improve these
systems in order to accommodate the level of use of our
websites. In addition, we may add new features and functionality
to our services that would result in the need to develop or
license additional technologies. We capitalize hardware and
software costs associated with this development in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles and include such
amounts in property and equipment. Our inability to add
additional software and hardware or to upgrade our technology,
transaction processing systems or network infrastructure to
accommodate increased traffic or transaction volume could have
adverse consequences. These consequences include unanticipated
system disruptions, slower response times, degradation in levels
of customer support, impaired quality of the users
experiences of our service and delays in reporting accurate
financial information. Our failure to provide new features or
functionality also could result in these consequences. We may be
unable to effectively upgrade and expand our systems in a timely
manner or to integrate smoothly any newly developed or purchased
technologies with our existing systems. These difficulties could
harm or limit our ability to expand our business.



Unauthorized Break-ins or Other Assaults on
    Our Service Could Harm Our Business.

Our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses,
physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, which
could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of data, public
release of confidential data or the inability to complete
customer transactions. In addition, unauthorized persons may
improperly access our data. We have experienced an unauthorized
break-in by a hacker who has stated that he could,
in the future, damage or change our system or take confidential
information. We have also experienced denial of
service type attacks on our system that have made all or
portions of our websites unavailable for periods of time. These
and other types of attacks could harm us. Actions of this sort
may be very expensive to remedy and could damage our reputation
and discourage new and existing users from using our service.

System Failures Could Harm Our
    Business.

Our system has been designed around industry
standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of
outages or catastrophic occurrences. The eBay service provides
24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week availability, subject to a
maintenance period during one night each week. PayPal also
provides 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week availability, subject
to scheduled maintenance interruptions. Substantially all of our
system hardware is hosted at the Exodus facilities in Santa
Clara, California, the Qwest Communications facilities in
Sunnyvale, California, and the Sprint Communications facilities
located near Sacramento, California, each of which provides
redundant communications lines and emergency power backup.
PayPal depends on two third parties, Equinix and Exodus, for
co-location of its data servers and relies upon these third
parties for the physical security of its servers. PayPals
servers currently reside in Equinixs facilities in
San Jose, California and Exodus facilities in Santa
Clara, California. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to
damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power
loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer
viruses, computer denial of service attacks and similar events.
They are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts
of vandalism and to potential disruption if the operators of
these facilities have financial difficulties. In early 2002,
Cable and Wireless plc acquired substantially all of
Exodus data center assets under Exodus
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. We expect that these
data center assets, now owned by Cable and Wireless plc, will
continue to be branded using the Exodus name. We do not maintain
fully redundant systems or alternative providers of hosting
services, and we do not carry business interruption insurance
sufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. Despite
any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural
disaster, a decision to close a facility we are using without
adequate notice for financial reasons or other unanticipated
problems at any of the Exodus, Qwest, Sprint or Equinix
facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our
services. In addition, the failure by Exodus, Qwest, Sprint or
Equinix to provide our required data communications capacity
could result in interruptions in our service. Any damage to or
failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our
service. Interruptions in our service will reduce our revenues
and profits, and our future revenues and profits will be harmed
if our users believe that our system is unreliable.

We have experienced system failures from time to
time. eBays primary website has been interrupted for
periods of up to 22 hours. In addition to placing increased
burdens on our engineering staff, these outages create a flood
of user questions and complaints that need to be addressed by
our customer support personnel. Any unscheduled interruption in
our service results in an immediate loss of revenues that can be
substantial and may cause some users to switch to our
competitors. If we experience frequent or persistent system
failures, our reputation and brand could be permanently harmed.
We have been taking steps to increase the reliability and
redundancy of our system. These steps are expensive, reduce our
margins and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or
duration of unscheduled downtime.

Our infrastructure could prove unable to handle a
larger volume of customer transactions. Any failure to
accommodate transaction growth could impair customer
satisfaction, lead to a loss of customers, impair our ability to
add customers or increase its costs, all of which would harm our
business.

Because our customers may use our products for
critical transactions, any errors, defects or other
infrastructure problems could result in damage to our
customers businesses. These customers could seek



significant compensation from us for their
losses. Even if unsuccessful, this type of claim likely would be
time consuming and costly for us to address.

The Price of eBay Common Stock Has Been and
    May Continue to Be Extremely Volatile.

The trading price of eBay common stock has been
and is likely to be extremely volatile. The price of eBay common
stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a
variety of factors, including the following:

 

actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly
    operating results;

 

unscheduled system downtime;

 

additions or departures of key personnel;

 

announcements of technological innovations or new
    services by us or our competitors;

 

changes in financial estimates by securities
    analysts;

 

conditions or trends in the Internet and online
    commerce industries;

 

changes in the market valuations of other
    Internet companies;

 

developments in regulation;

 

events affecting our proposed acquisition of
    PayPal or PayPals business;

 

announcements by us or our competitors of
    significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures
    or capital commitments;

 

unanticipated economic or political events;

 

sales of eBay common stock or other securities in
    the open market;

 

the adverse effect of arbitrage activities in
    connection with the merger, including the sale of eBay common
    stock by persons who simultaneously purchase PayPal common
    stock; and

 

other events or factors, including those
    described in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere
    in this proxy statement/ prospectus, that may be beyond our
    control.

In addition, the trading prices of Internet
stocks in general, and ours in particular, have experienced
extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent periods. These
fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to
the operating performance of these companies. Notwithstanding a
sharp decline in the prices of Internet stocks in general, the
valuation of our stock remains extraordinarily high based on
conventional valuation standards such as price-to-earnings and
price-to-sales ratios. The trading price of our common stock has
increased enormously from the initial public offering price.
This trading price and valuation may not be sustained. Negative
changes in the publics perception of the prospects of
Internet or e-commerce or technology companies have in the past
and may in the future depress eBays stock price regardless
of our results. Other broad market and industry factors may
decrease the market price of eBay common stock, regardless of
our operating performance. Market fluctuations, as well as
general political and economic conditions, such as recession or
interest rate or currency rate fluctuations, also may decrease
the market price of eBay common stock. In the past, following
declines in the market price of a companys securities,
securities class-action litigation often has been instituted.
Litigation of this type, if instituted, could result in
substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention
and resources.

New and Existing Regulations Could Harm Our
    Business.

We are subject to the same foreign, federal,
state and local laws as other companies conducting business on
the Internet. Today there are relatively few laws specifically
directed towards online services. However, due to the increasing
popularity and use of the Internet and online services, many
laws relating to the Internet are being debated at the state and
federal levels (both in the U.S. and abroad) and it is



possible that laws and regulations will be
adopted with respect to the Internet or online services. These
laws and regulations could cover issues such as user privacy,
freedom of expression, pricing, fraud, content and quality of
products and services, taxation, advertising, intellectual
property rights and information security. Applicability to the
Internet of existing laws governing issues such as property
ownership, copyrights and other intellectual property issues,
taxation, libel, obscenity and personal privacy is uncertain.
The vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent
of the Internet and related technologies and, as a result, do
not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet and
related technologies. Those laws that do reference the Internet,
such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the European
Unions Directives on Distance Selling and Electronic
Commerce, are only beginning to be interpreted by the courts and
their applicability and scope are, therefore, uncertain. In
addition, numerous states and foreign jurisdictions, including
the State of California, where our headquarters are located,
have regulations regarding how auctions may be
conducted and the liability of auctioneers in
conducting such auctions. No final legal determination has been
made with respect to the applicability of the California
regulations to our business to date and little precedent exists
in this area. Several states are considering imposing these
regulations upon us or our users, which could harm our business.
We are currently subject to potential regulation under the
Office of Banks and Real Estate, or OBRE, in Illinois concerning
the applicability of the Illinois auction law to our services.
In August 2002, Illinois amended the Illinois auction law to
provide for a special regulatory regime for Internet
auction listing services. We expect to register as an
Internet auction listing service in Illinois following the
adoption of regulations under the amended statute. Although we
do not expect this registration to have a negative impact on our
business, other regulatory and licensure claims could result in
costly litigation or could require us to change our manner of
doing business in ways that increase our costs or reduce our
revenues, or force us to prohibit listings of certain items for
some locations. In addition, as the nature of the products
listed by our users change, we may become subject to new
regulatory restrictions, such as licensure as an auto dealer or
real estate broker.

Several states have proposed, and Minnesota has
recently passed, legislation that would limit the uses of
personal user information gathered online or require online
services to establish privacy policies. The Federal Trade
Commission also has settled several proceedings regarding the
manner in which personal information is collected from users and
provided to third parties. Specific statutes intended to protect
user privacy have been passed in many
non-U.S. jurisdictions, including virtually every
non-U.S. jurisdiction where we currently have a website.
Compliance with these laws, given the tight integration of our
systems across different countries and the need to move data to
facilitate transactions amongst our users (e.g., to payment
companies, shipping companies, etc.), is both necessary and
difficult. Failure to comply could subject us to lawsuits,
fines, statutory damages, adverse publicity and other losses
that could harm our business. Changes to existing laws or the
passage of new laws intended to address these issues could
directly affect the way we do business or could create
uncertainty on the Internet. This could reduce demand for our
services, increase the cost of doing business as a result of
litigation costs or increased service delivery costs, or
otherwise harm our business. In addition, because our services
are accessible worldwide, and we facilitate sales of goods to
users worldwide, foreign jurisdictions may claim that we are
required to comply with their laws. For example, a French court
has ruled that a U.S. website must comply with French laws
regarding content. As we have expanded our international
activities, we have become obligated to comply with the laws of
the countries in which we operate. Laws regulating Internet
companies outside of the U.S. may be less favorable than those
in the U.S., giving greater rights to consumers, content owners
and users. Compliance may be more costly or may require us to
change our business practices or restrict our service offerings
relative to those in the U.S. Our failure to comply with foreign
laws could subject us to penalties ranging from criminal fines
to bans on our ability to offer our services.

Our Business Has Been
    Seasonal.

Our results of operations historically have been
somewhat seasonal in nature because many of our users reduce
their activities on our websites during the Thanksgiving (in the
U.S.) and Christmas holidays and with the onset of good weather.
We have historically experienced our strongest quarter of online



growth in our first fiscal quarter, although our
shift to more practical items may cause our seasonal
patterns to look more like a typical retailer. Seasonal or
cyclical variations in our business may become more pronounced
over time and may harm our results of operations in the future.

We Are Dependent on the Continued Growth of
    Online Commerce.

The business of selling goods over the Internet,
particularly through online trading, is new and dynamic. Our
future net revenues and profits will be substantially dependent
upon the widespread acceptance of the Internet and online
services as a medium for commerce by consumers. Rapid growth in
the use of and interest in the Internet and online services is a
recent phenomenon. This acceptance and use may not continue.
Even if the Internet is accepted, concerns about fraud, privacy
and other problems may mean that a sufficiently broad base of
consumers will not adopt the Internet as a medium of commerce.
In particular, our websites require users to make publicly
available personal information that some potential users may be
unwilling to provide. These concerns may increase as additional
publicity over privacy issues on eBay or generally over the
Internet increase. Market acceptance for recently introduced
services and products over the Internet is highly uncertain, and
there are few proven services and products. In order to expand
our user base, we must appeal to and acquire consumers who
historically have used traditional means of commerce to purchase
goods. If these consumers prove to be less active than our
earlier users, and we are unable to gain efficiencies in our
operating costs, including our cost of acquiring new customers,
our business could be adversely impacted.

We Are Dependent on Key
    Personnel.

Our future performance will be substantially
dependent on the continued services of our senior management and
other key personnel. Our future performance also will depend on
our ability to retain and motivate our other officers and key
personnel. The loss of the services of any of our executive
officers or other key employees could harm our business. We do
not have long-term employment agreements with any of our key
personnel, we do not maintain any key person life
insurance policies, and our Chief Executive Officer has fully
vested the vast majority of her equity incentives. Our new
businesses are all dependent on attracting and retaining key
personnel. The land-based auction businesses are particularly
dependent on specialists and senior management because of the
relationships these individuals have established with sellers
who consign property for sale at auction. We have had some
turnover of these personnel, and continued losses of these
individuals could result in the loss of significant future
business and would harm us. In addition, employee turnover and
other labor problems frequently increase during the period
following an acquisition as employees evaluate possible changes
in compensation, culture, reporting relationships and the
direction of the business. These labor issues may be more severe
if employees receive no significant financial return from the
acquisition transaction, as has been the case with several of
our recent acquisitions. Such increased turnover could increase
our costs and reduce our future revenues. Our future success
also will depend on our ability to attract, train, retain and
motivate highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing and
customer support personnel. Competition for these personnel is
intense, especially for engineers and other professionals,
especially in the San Francisco Bay Area, and we may be unable
to successfully attract, integrate or retain sufficiently
qualified personnel. In making employment decisions,
particularly in the Internet and high-technology industries, job
candidates often consider the value of the stock options they
are to receive in connection with their employment. Fluctuations
in our stock price may make it more difficult to retain and
motivate employees whose stock option strike prices are
substantially above current market prices.

Terrorist Acts.

The September 11 terrorist attacks adversely
affected our revenues and profits, particularly in the
U.S. and in the weeks immediately following these attacks.
Any further terrorist actions, whether in the U.S. or
elsewhere, would likely adversely affect our business. In
particular, any action that makes consumers less willing to
purchase or receive goods from third parties they do not know
could disproportionately and adversely affect our business.



We Are Subject to the Risks of Owning Real
    Property.

In connection with the acquisitions of Kruse and
Butterfields, eBay acquired real property including land,
buildings and interests in partnerships holding land and
buildings. In addition, PayPal owns approximately 22 acres
of land near Omaha, Nebraska and has entered into an agreement
to have a building constructed on this land. We have little
experience in managing real property. Ownership of this property
subjects us to risks, including:

 

the possibility of environmental contamination
    and the costs associated with fixing any environmental problems;

 

adverse changes in the value of these properties,
    due to interest rate changes, changes in the neighborhoods in
    which the properties are located, or other factors;

 

the possible need for structural improvements in
    order to comply with zoning, seismic, disability act or other
    requirements; and

 

possible disputes with tenants, partners or
    others.

Our Industry Is Intensely
    Competitive.

Depending on the category of product, we
currently or potentially compete with a number of companies
serving particular categories of goods as well as those serving
broader ranges of goods. The Internet provides new, rapidly
evolving and intensely competitive channels for the sale of all
types of goods. We expect competition to intensify in the future
as the barriers to entry into these channels are relatively low,
as current offline and new competitors can easily launch online
sites at a nominal cost using commercially available software.
Our broad-based competitors include the vast majority of
traditional department, warehouse, discount and general
merchandise stores, emerging online retailers, online classified
services, and other shopping channels such as offline and online
home shopping networks. These include most prominently:
Wal-Mart, Kmart, Target, Sears, Macys, JC Penney,
Costco, Office Depot, Staples, OfficeMax, Sams Club,
Amazon.com, Buy.com, AOL.com, Yahoo! Shopping, MSN, QVC and Home
Shopping Network/ HSN.com.

In addition, we face competition from local,
regional and national specialty retailers and exchanges in each
of our categories of products. For example:

    VerticalNet

Additionally, we face competition from various
online commerce sites including: Amazon.com, Surplus Auction,
uBid, Yahoo! Auctions and a large number of other regional and
national companies engaged in consumer-to-consumer or
business-to-consumer sales. Overseas, we face competition from
similar channels in most countries and from a large number of
regional and national online and offline competitors in each
country. Different aspects of our fixed-priced business compete
with the major Internet portals (AOL, MSN, Yahoo! and comparable
companies outside the U.S.) as well as Amazon.com and
others.

The principal competitive factors for eBay
include the following:

 

ability to attract buyers;

 

volume of transactions and selection of goods;

 

customer service; and

 

brand recognition.

With respect to our online competition,
additional competitive factors include:

 

community cohesion and interaction;

 

system reliability;

 

reliability of delivery and payment;

 

website convenience and accessibility;



 

level of service fees; and

 

quality of search tools.

Some current and potential competitors have
longer company operating histories, larger customer bases and
greater brand recognition in other business and Internet spaces
than we do. Some of these competitors also have significantly
greater financial, marketing, technical and other resources.
Other online trading services may be acquired by, receive
investments from, or enter into other commercial relationships
with larger, well-established and well-financed companies. As a
result, some of our competitors with other revenue sources may
be able to devote more resources to marketing and promotional
campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote
substantially more resources to website and systems development
than we can. Increased competition may result in reduced
operating margins, loss of market share and diminished value of
our brand. Some of our competitors have offered services for
free, and others may do this as well. We may be unable to
compete successfully against current and future competitors.

In order to respond to changes in the competitive
environment, we may, from time to time, make pricing, service or
marketing decisions or acquisitions that could harm our
business. For example, we have implemented a buyer protection
program that generally insures items up to a value of $200, with
a $25 deductible, for users with a non-negative feedback rating
at no cost to the user. New technologies may increase the
competitive pressures by enabling our competitors to offer a
lower cost service. Some Internet-based applications that direct
Internet traffic to certain websites may channel users to
electronic-commerce services that compete with us.

Although we have established Internet traffic
arrangements with several large online services and search
engine companies, these arrangements may not be renewed on
commercially reasonable terms. Even if these arrangements are
renewed, they may not result in increased usage of our service.
In addition, companies that control access to transactions
through network access or Internet browsers could promote our
competitors or charge us substantial fees for inclusion.

The market for PayPals product is emerging,
intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological
change. PayPal competes with existing on-line and off-line
payment methods, including, among others:

 

MoneyZap and BidPay offered by Western Union, a
    subsidiary of First Data;

 

Yahoo! PayDirect offered by Yahoo!;

 

c2it offered by Citigroup;

 

Valid offered by CheckFree;

 

email payment services offered by the U.S. Postal
    Service through CheckFree; and

 

credit card merchant processors that offer their
    services to online merchants, including First Data, Concord EFS,
    Paymentech, VeriSign and Authorize.net.

Some of these competitors have longer operating
histories, significantly greater financial, technical,
marketing, customer service and other resources, greater name
recognition or a larger base of customers in affiliated
businesses than PayPal. For example, Citigroups c2it
has existing arrangements with AOL Time Warner and Microsoft.
PayPals competitors may respond to new or emerging
technologies and changes in customer requirements faster and
more effectively than PayPal. They may devote greater resources
to the development, promotion and sale of products and services
than PayPal, and they may offer lower prices. Some of these
competitors have offered, and may continue to offer, their
services for free in order to gain market share and PayPal may
be forced to lower its prices in response. Competing services
tied to established banks and other financial institutions may
offer greater liquidity and engender greater consumer confidence
in the safety and efficacy of their services than PayPal. If
these competitors acquired significant market share, this could
result in PayPal losing market share.

PayPal also competes with providers of
traditional payment methods, particularly credit cards, checks,
money orders and Automated Clearing House, or ACH, transactions.
Associations of traditional financial institutions such as Visa,
MasterCard and the National Automated Clearing House
Association, or



NACHA, generally set the features of these
payment methods. The associations have initiated programs to
enhance the usability of these payment methods for online
transactions and could lower fees charged to online merchants.
Either of these changes could make it more difficult for PayPal
to retain and attract customers.

Half.com competes directly with online and
offline retailers in its product categories such as Amazon.com,
as well as with traditional offline and online sellers of new
and used books, videos and CDs, consumer electronics and other
products. Kruse is subject to competition from numerous regional
competitors. In addition, competition with Internet-based
auctions may harm Kruses land-based auction business.

Our Business Is Dependent on the
    Development and Maintenance of the Internet
    Infrastructure.

The success of our service will depend largely on
the development and maintenance of the Internet infrastructure.
This includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with
the necessary speed, data capacity and security, as well as
timely development of complementary products, for providing
reliable Internet access and services. The Internet has
experienced, and is likely to continue to experience,
significant growth in the numbers of users and amount of
traffic. If the Internet continues to experience increased
numbers of users, increased frequency of use or increased
bandwidth requirements, the Internet infrastructure may be
unable to support the demands placed on it. In addition, the
performance of the Internet may be harmed by increased number of
users or bandwidth requirements or by viruses,
worms and similar programs. The Internet has
experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of
damage to portions of its infrastructure, and it could face
outages and delays in the future. These outages and delays could
reduce the level of Internet usage as well as the level of
traffic and the processing of transactions on our service.

Our Business Is Subject to Online Commerce
    Security Risks.

To succeed, online commerce and communications
must provide a secure transmission of confidential information
over public networks. Our security measures may not prevent
security breaches. Our failure to prevent security breaches
could harm our business. Currently, a significant number of our
users authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly
for all transaction fees charged by us. PayPal and Billpoint
users routinely provide credit card and other financial
information. We rely on encryption and authentication technology
licensed from third parties to provide the security and
authentication technology to effect secure transmission of
confidential information, including customer credit card
numbers. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in
the field of cryptography or other developments may result in a
compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect
customer transaction data. A number of websites have reported
breaches of their security. Any compromise of our security could
harm our reputation and, therefore, our business. In addition, a
party who is able to circumvent our security measures could
misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in
our operations. We may need to expend significant resources to
protect against security breaches or to address problems caused
by breaches. These issues are likely to become more difficult as
we expand the number of places where we operate.

Security breaches could damage our reputation and
expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible
liability. Our insurance policies carry low coverage limits,
which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by
security breaches.

We Must Keep Pace with Rapid Technological
    Change to Remain Competitive.

Our competitive space is characterized by rapidly
changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new
service and product introductions and enhancements and changing
customer demands. These characteristics are caused in part by
the emerging and changing nature of the Internet. Our future
success therefore will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly
changing technologies, to adapt our services to evolving
industry standards and to improve the performance, features and
reliability of our service. Our



failure to adapt to such changes would harm our
business. New technologies, such as the development of a
peer-to-peer personal trading technology, could adversely affect
us. In addition, the widespread adoption of new Internet,
networking or telecommunications technologies or other
technological changes could require substantial expenditures to
modify or adapt our services or infrastructure.

We Need to Develop New Services, Features
    and Functions in Order to Expand.

We plan to expand our operations by developing
new or complementary services, products or transaction formats
or expanding the breadth and depth of services. We may be unable
to expand our operations in a cost-effective or timely manner.
Even if we do expand, we may not maintain or increase our
overall acceptance. If we launch a new business or service that
is not favorably received by consumers, it could damage our
reputation and diminish the value of our brand. We anticipate
that future services will include pre-trade and post-trade
services.

We are pursuing strategic relationships with
third parties to provide many of these services. Because we use
third parties to deliver these services, we may be unable to
control the quality of these services, and our ability to
address problems if any of these third parties fails to perform
adequately will be reduced. Expanding our operations in this
manner also will require significant additional expenses and
development, operations and other resources and will strain our
management, financial and operational resources. The lack of
acceptance of any new services could harm our business.

Our Growth Will Depend on Our Ability to
    Develop Our Brands.

We believe that eBays historical growth has
been largely attributable to word of mouth. Both eBay and PayPal
have benefited from frequent and high visibility media exposure
both nationally and locally. We believe that continuing to
strengthen our brand will be critical to achieving widespread
acceptance of our service. Promoting and positioning our brand
will depend largely on the success of our marketing efforts and
our ability to provide high quality services. In order to
promote our brand, we will need to increase our marketing budget
and otherwise increase our financial commitment to creating and
maintaining brand loyalty among users. Brand promotion
activities may not yield increased revenues, and even if they
do, any increased revenues may not offset the expenses we
incurred in building our brand. If we do attract new users to
our service, they may not conduct transactions over our service
on a regular basis. If we fail to promote and maintain our brand
or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to
promote and maintain our brand, our business would be harmed.

We May Be Unable to Protect or Enforce Our
    Own Intellectual Property Rights Adequately.

We regard the protection of our trademarks,
copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets
as critical to our success. We aggressively protect our
intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of
trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade dress and trade secrets
and through the domain name dispute resolution system. We also
rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary
rights in products and services. We have entered into
confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our
employees and contractors, and nondisclosure agreements with
parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access
to and disclosure of our proprietary information. These
contractual arrangements and the other steps taken by us to
protect our intellectual property may not prevent
misappropriation of our technology or deter independent
third-party development of similar technologies. We pursue the
registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks
in the U.S. and internationally. Effective trademark, copyright,
patent, trade dress, trade secret and domain name protection is
very expensive to maintain and may require litigation.
Protection may not be available in every country in which our
services are made available online. Furthermore, we must also
protect our trademarks, patents and domain names in an
increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive
and may not be successful in every location. We have licensed in
the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our
proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material,
to third parties. These licensees may take actions that might
diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our
reputation. We also rely on certain technologies that we license
from third parties, such as Oracle Corporation, IBM, Microsoft,
Sun Microsystems, Inc.



and Veritas Software. These third-party
technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on
commercially reasonable terms. The loss of these technologies
could require us to obtain substitute technologies of lower
quality or performance standards or at greater cost.

Customer Complaints or Negative Publicity
    About Our Customer Service Could Affect Use of Our Services
    Adversely and, as a Result, Our Business Could
    Suffer.

Customer complaints or negative publicity about
our customer service could diminish severely consumer confidence
in and use of our services. Breaches of our customers
privacy and our security measures could have the same effect.
Measures we sometimes take to combat risks of fraud and breaches
of privacy and security can damage relations with our customers.
These measures heighten the need for prompt and accurate
customer service to resolve irregularities and disputes. PayPal
has received negative media coverage, as well as public
criticism regarding customer disputes. Effective customer
service requires significant personnel expense, and this
expense, if not managed properly, could impact our profitability
significantly. Any inability by us to manage or train our
customer service representatives properly could compromise our
ability to handle customer complaints effectively. If we do not
handle customer complaints effectively, our reputation may
suffer and we may lose our customers confidence.

Our Offline Auction Business Needs to
    Continue to Acquire Auction Properties.

The business of Kruse is dependent on the
continued acquisition of high quality auction properties from
sellers. Its future success will depend in part on its ability
to maintain an adequate supply of high quality auction property,
particularly collectible automobiles. There is intense
competition for these pieces with other auction companies and
dealers. In addition, a small number of key senior management
and specialists maintain the relationships with the primary
sources of auction property and the loss of these individuals
could harm the business of Kruse.

Some Anti-Takeover Provisions May Affect
    the Price of eBay Common Stock.

The board of directors has the authority to issue
up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the
preferences, rights and privileges of those shares without any
further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the
holders of eBay common stock may be harmed by the rights of the
holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future.
Some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws
could have the effect of making it more difficult for a
third-party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting
stock. These include provisions that provide for a classified
board of directors, prohibit stockholders from taking action by
written consent and restrict the ability of stockholders to call
special meetings. We are also subject to provisions of Delaware
law that prohibit us from engaging in any business combination
with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from
the date the person became an interested stockholder, unless
certain conditions are met. This restriction could have the
effect of delaying or preventing a change of control.

Risks Related to PayPals Business Prior
to and After the Merger

PayPal Faces Significant Risks of Loss Due
    to Fraud and Disputes Between Senders and Recipients. If PayPal
    Is Unable to Deal Effectively with Losses from Fraudulent
    Transactions, PayPals Losses from Fraud Would Increase,
    and Its Business Would Be Harmed.

PayPal faces significant risks of loss due to
fraud and disputes between senders and recipients, including:

 

unauthorized use of credit card and bank account
    information and identity theft;

 

merchant fraud and other disputes over the
    quality of goods and services;

 

breaches of system security;



 

employee fraud; and

 

use of PayPals system for illegal or
    improper purposes.

For the year ended December 31, 2001, and
the six months ended June 30, 2002, PayPals provision
for transaction losses totaled $14.8 million and
$13.1 million, representing 0.42% and 0.43% of
PayPals total payment volume. In April 2002, PayPal
increased the credit card funding limit for unverified
U.S.-based users from $1,000 to $2,000. This increase may result
in higher transaction losses.

When a sender pays a merchant for goods or
services through PayPal using a credit card and the cardholder
is defrauded or otherwise disputes the charge, the full amount
of the disputed transaction gets charged back to PayPal and its
credit card processor levies additional fees against PayPal,
unless PayPal can successfully challenge the chargeback.
Chargebacks may arise from the unauthorized use of a
cardholders card number or from a cardholders claim
that a merchant failed to perform. If PayPals chargeback
rate becomes excessive, credit card associations also can
require PayPal to pay fines and could terminate its ability to
accept their cards for payments. Early in 2001, as a result of
high chargeback rates in the second half of 2000, MasterCard
determined that PayPal violated its operating rules by having
excessive chargebacks and fined PayPals card processor
$313,600, which was subsequently passed on to PayPal. Although
PayPal resolved this situation to MasterCards satisfaction
and has reduced its chargeback rate, we cannot assure you that
new causes of excessive chargebacks will not arise in the future.

PayPal has taken measures to detect and reduce
the risk of fraud, but it cannot assure you of these
measures effectiveness. If these measures do not succeed,
PayPals business will suffer.

PayPal Incurs Chargebacks and Other Losses
    from Merchant Fraud, Payment Disputes and Insufficient Funds,
    and Its Liability from These Items Could Have a Material Adverse
    Effect on Its Business and Result in PayPal Losing the Right to
    Accept Credit Cards for Payment. If PayPal Is Prohibited from
    Accepting Credit Cards for Payment, Its Ability to Compete Could
    Be Impaired, and Its Business Would Suffer.

PayPal incurs substantial losses from merchant
fraud, including claims from customers that merchants have not
performed, that their goods or services do not match the
merchants description or that the customer did not
authorize the purchase. PayPal also incurs losses from erroneous
transmissions and from customers who have closed bank accounts
or have insufficient funds in them to satisfy payments.
PayPals merchant-related chargebacks totaled
$5.1 million for transactions that occurred during the year
ended December 31, 2000. The cumulative gross amount of
chargebacks received through June 30, 2002 with respect to
merchant-related disputes for transactions that occurred during
the year ended December 31, 2001 totaled
$18.7 million. The gross amount of chargebacks received
through June 30, 2002 with respect to merchant-related
disputes for transactions that occurred during the six months
ended June 30, 2002 totaled $10.6 million.
PayPals liability for such items could have a material
adverse effect on its business, and if they become excessive,
could result in PayPal losing the right to accept credit cards
for payment. eBay is currently not subject to risks related to
chargeback losses because its credit card payment processing
agreement with Wells Fargo provides that Wells Fargo generally
bears the risk related to chargebacks in exchange for higher
processing fees.

Unauthorized Use of Credit Cards and Bank
    Accounts Could Expose PayPal to Substantial Losses. If PayPal Is
    Unable to Detect and Prevent Unauthorized Use of Cards and Bank
    Accounts, Its Business Would Suffer.

The highly automated nature of, and liquidity
offered by, PayPals payment product makes PayPal an
attractive target for fraud. In configuring its product, PayPal
faces an inherent trade-off between customer convenience and
security. Identity thieves and those committing fraud using
stolen credit card or bank account numbers, often in bulk and in
conjunction with automated mechanisms of online communication,
potentially can steal large amounts of money from businesses
such as PayPals. PayPal believes that several of
PayPals current and former competitors in the electronic
payments business have gone out of



business or significantly restricted their
businesses largely due to losses from this type of fraud. PayPal
expects that technically knowledgeable criminals will continue
to attempt to circumvent PayPals anti-fraud systems.
During the four months between July and October 2000, PayPal
experienced a significant fraud episode and, as a result, it
incurred gross losses due to unauthorized chargebacks totaling
$5.7 million. This amount represented 64.0% of total
chargebacks due to unauthorized transactions for the year ended
December 31, 2000. The cumulative gross amount of
chargebacks received through June 30, 2002 with respect to
unauthorized use of credit cards for transactions that occurred
during the year ended December 31, 2001 totaled
$7.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2001,
the amount of PayPals losses with respect to unauthorized
use of bank accounts totaled $1.2 million. The gross amount
of chargebacks received through June 30, 2002 with respect
to unauthorized use of credit cards for transactions that
occurred during the six months ended June 30, 2002 totaled
$5.4 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2002,
the amount of PayPals losses with respect to unauthorized
use of bank accounts totaled $2.3 million. eBay is
currently not subject to risks related to chargeback losses
because its credit card payment processing agreement with Wells
Fargo provides that Wells Fargo generally bears the risk related
to chargebacks in exchange for higher processing fees.

PayPals Processes to Reduce Fraud
    Losses Depend in Part on Its Ability to Restrict the Withdrawal
    of Customer Funds While It Investigates Suspicious Transactions.
    PayPal Has Been and Could Be Sued by Plaintiffs Alleging That
    PayPals Restriction and Investigation Processes Violate
    Federal and State Law on Consumer Protection and Unfair Business
    Practice, and Are Inconsistent with PayPals User
    Agreement. If PayPal Is Unable to Defend Itself Successfully, It
    Could Be Required to Restructure Its Anti-Fraud Processes in
    Ways That Would Harm Its Business, and to Pay Substantial
    Damages.

As part of PayPals program to reduce fraud
losses, it may temporarily restrict the ability of customers to
withdraw their funds if those funds or their account activity
are identified by PayPals anti-fraud models as suspicious.
On February 20, 2002, PayPal was sued in California state
court in a proposed class action alleging that its restriction
of customer accounts and failure to promptly un-restrict
legitimate accounts violates state law on consumer protection
and unfair business practices and is in breach of PayPals
User Agreement. This class action was refiled with different
named plaintiffs on June 6, 2002. On March 12, 2002,
PayPal was sued in the U.S. District Court for the District
of Northern California in a proposed class action alleging that
its restriction of customer accounts and failure to promptly
un-restrict legitimate accounts violates federal and state law
on consumer protection and unfair business practices. PayPal
could be sued in the future by other persons making similar
claims. If PayPal is unable to defend itself successfully, it
could be required to restructure its anti-fraud processes in
ways that would harm its business, and to pay substantial
damages. Even if PayPal is able to defend itself successfully,
the litigation could cause damage to its reputation, could
consume substantial amounts of its managements time and
attention, and could require PayPal to change its customer
service and operations in ways that could increase its costs and
decrease the effectiveness of its anti-fraud program.

Security and Privacy Breaches in
    PayPals Electronic Transactions May Expose PayPal to
    Additional Liability and Result in the Loss of Customers, Either
    of Which Events Could Harm Its Business and Cause the Price of
    PayPal or eBay Common Stock to Decline.

Any inability on PayPals part to protect
the security and privacy of its electronic transactions could
have a material adverse effect on its profitability. A security
or privacy breach could:

 

expose PayPal to additional liability;

 

increase PayPals expenses relating to
    resolution of these breaches; and

 

deter customers from using PayPals product.

We cannot assure you that PayPals use of
applications designed for data security will effectively counter
evolving security risks or address the security and privacy
concerns of existing and potential



customers. Any failures in PayPals security
and privacy measures could have a material adverse effect on its
business, financial condition and results of operations.

PayPal Could Incur Substantial Losses from
    Employee Fraud and, as a Result, Its Business Would
    Suffer.

The large volume of payments that PayPal handles
for its customers makes it vulnerable to employee fraud or other
internal security breaches. We cannot assure you that
PayPals internal security systems will prevent material
losses from employee fraud.

Our Payment System Might Be Used for
    Illegal or Improper Purposes, Which Could Expose PayPal to
    Additional Liability and Harm Its Business.

Despite measures PayPal has taken to detect and
prevent identity theft, unauthorized uses of credit cards and
similar misconduct, its payment system remains susceptible to
potentially illegal or improper uses. These may include illegal
online gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illicit
sales of prescription medications or controlled substances,
software and other intellectual property piracy, money
laundering, bank fraud, child pornography trafficking,
prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products and
online securities fraud. Despite measures PayPal has taken to
detect and lessen the risk of this kind of conduct, we cannot
assure you that these measures will succeed. In addition, future
regulations under the USA Patriot Act may require PayPal to
revise the procedures it takes to verify the identity of
customers and to monitor more closely international
transactions. PayPals business could suffer if customers
use its system for illegal or improper purposes.

In addition, PayPal classifies merchants who
historically have experienced significant chargeback rates, such
as online gaming-related service providers and online gaming
merchants as higher risk. The legal status of many
of these higher risk accounts is uncertain, and if these
merchants are prohibited or restricted from operating in the
future, PayPals revenue from fees generated from these
accounts would decline. Proposed legislation has been introduced
in the U.S. Congress to clarify that operation of an
Internet gaming business violates federal law, and to prohibit
payment processors such as PayPal from processing payments for
online gaming merchants. Even if this proposed legislation is
not enacted, online gaming merchants could be determined to be
in violation of existing federal and state laws resulting from
its activities. In particular, the New York State Attorney
General recently stated that even under current law, the
processing of known gambling transactions may lead to liability
for facilitating or aiding and abetting the underlying activity.
On August 20, 2002, PayPal reached an agreement with the
Attorney General of the State of New York in the
states inquiry into payments made through PayPals
service to online gambling merchants. In an assurance of
discontinuance made to the New York Attorney General,
PayPal agreed to cease processing payments from its
New York members to online gambling merchants by
September 1, 2002. PayPal took this action in voluntary
cooperation with the New York Attorney General and did not
admit to a violation of law. The New York Attorney General
has agreed to accept PayPals assurance of discontinuance
in lieu of commencing a statutory proceeding. PayPal also agreed
to pay $200,000 to the State of New York in penalties,
disgorged profits and to cover the New York Attorney
Generals costs of investigation. In addition, PayPal has
received federal grand jury subpoenas issued at the request of
the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri.
These subpoenas seek the production of documents related to
online gambling activities. PayPal intends to cooperate fully
with the United States Attorneys office in this matter.

If the online gaming merchants that accept PayPal
are operating illegally, PayPal could be subject to civil and
criminal lawsuits, administrative action, forfeiture proceedings
and prosecution for, among other things, money laundering or for
aiding and abetting violations of law. PayPal would lose the
revenues associated with these accounts and could be subject to
material penalties and fines, both of which would seriously harm
its business.



                       The
Divestiture or Discontinuance of PayPals Business
Operations Relating to the Processing of Payments for Online
Gambling Merchants Would Adversely Affect PayPals Business
and Results of Operations.

eBay has announced that upon completion of the
proposed merger, eBay intends to discontinue these business
operations. On August 20, 2002, PayPal reached an agreement
with the Attorney General of the State of New York in the
states inquiry into payments made through PayPals
service to online gambling merchants. In an assurance of
discontinuance made to the New York Attorney General,
PayPal agreed to cease processing payments from its
New York members to online gambling merchants by
September 1, 2002. PayPals board of directors has not
yet made, but could make, a determination to discontinue these
business operations in other states during the period before the
proposed merger is completed or after the termination of the
merger agreement if such termination occurs. As a result of the
eBay announcement, the assurance of discontinuance in New York
or any future PayPal announcement, PayPal may lose significant
revenues associated with online gambling merchants seeking
alternatives to PayPal for payment processing as a result of the
uncertainty of how long PayPal may continue to process payments
for online gambling merchants. Approximately 8% of PayPals
revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2002 were
derived from these business operations. There can be no
assurance that PayPal will continue these business operations
prior to the merger or following the termination of the merger
agreement, as the case may be. The divestiture or discontinuance
of these business operations would result in a loss of revenue
to PayPal and would adversely affect PayPals business and
results of operations.

Changes to Card Association Rules or
    Practices Could Negatively Affect PayPals Service and, if
    It Does Not Comply with the Rules, Could Result in a Termination
    of PayPals Ability to Accept Credit Cards. If PayPal Is
    Unable to Accept Credit Cards, PayPals Competitive
    Position Would Be Seriously Damaged.

Because PayPal is not a bank, it cannot belong to
and directly access the Visa and MasterCard credit card
associations or the ACH payment network. As a result, PayPal
must rely on banks and their service providers to process its
transactions. PayPal must comply with the operating rules of the
credit card associations and NACHA as they apply to merchants.
The associations member banks set these rules, and the
associations interpret the rules. Some of those member banks
compete with PayPal. Visa, MasterCard, American Express or
Discover could adopt new operating rules or interpretations of
existing rules which PayPal or its processors might find
difficult or even impossible to comply with, in which case
PayPal could lose its ability to give customers the option of
using credit cards to fund their payments. If PayPal were unable
to accept credit cards, our competitive position would be
seriously damaged.

MasterCard has announced that, effective
May 1, 2002, it will require each customer that regularly
uses PayPal to accept payment for goods or services, to enter
into a contract with the bank that processes MasterCard
transactions for PayPal and to agree to observe MasterCard
rules. We believe that PayPal can comply with this rule through
changes to its User Agreement, but we are unable at this time to
predict precisely how this rule will affect PayPals
business. It appears likely that PayPal will be required to
change the interrelationship among itself, its customers and its
credit card processing bank in ways that could increase
PayPals costs, reduce the attractiveness of its service,
or both.

In 2001, Visa indicated that some of
PayPals practices violated its operating rules, and PayPal
implemented changes in response. In January 2002, PayPal
received correspondence through its credit card processor that
three issues remain unresolved. These issues relate to
PayPals international membership fees, its fees for
international credit card funded payments, and its process for
obtaining authorization to charge a customers Visa account
if the customers ACH transfer fails. In connection with
these issues, Visa has assessed fines on PayPals processor
totaling $130,000 through June 30, 2002, $95,000 of which
PayPals processor has passed through to PayPal. PayPal has
implemented changes to its practices to resolve these issues,
including changing its fee structure so that it no longer
assesses fees on international credit card funded payments.
PayPal believes these changes have resolved all outstanding
issues that resulted in compliance fines from Visa. However,
these changes could make the PayPal service less attractive to
its customers.



PayPals Status Under State, Federal
    and International Financial Services Regulation Is Unclear.
    Violation of or Compliance with Present or Future
    Regulation Could Be Costly, Expose PayPal to Substantial
    Liability, Force PayPal to Change Its Business Practices or
    Force PayPal to Cease Offering Its Current
    Product.

PayPal operates in an industry subject to
government regulation. PayPal currently is subject to some
states money transmitter regulations, to federal
regulations in its role as transfer agent and investment adviser
to the PayPal Money Market Fund, or the Fund, and to federal
electronic fund transfer and money laundering regulations. In
the future, PayPal might be subjected to:

 

state or federal banking regulations;

 

additional states money transmitter
    regulations and federal money laundering regulations;

 

international banking or financial services
    regulations or laws governing other regulated industries; or

 

U.S. and international regulation of Internet
    transactions.

If PayPal is found to be in violation of any
current or future regulations, PayPal could be:

 

exposed to financial liability, including
    substantial fines which could be imposed on a per transaction
    basis and disgorgement of its profits;

 

forced to change its business practices; or

 

forced to cease doing business altogether or with
    the residents of one or more states or countries.

If PayPal Were Found to Be Subject to or in
    Violation of Any Laws or Regulations Governing Banking, It Could
    Be Subject to Liability and Forced to Change Its Business
    Practices.

PayPal believes that the licensing requirements
of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal
Reserve Board and other federal or state agencies that regulate
banks, bank holding companies or other types of providers of
electronic commerce services do not apply to PayPal, except for
certain money transmitter licenses mentioned below. However, one
or more states may conclude that, under its or their statutes,
PayPal is engaged in an unauthorized banking business. PayPal
has received written communications from regulatory authorities
in New York, most recently in February 2002, and Louisiana
expressing the view that its service as it formerly operated
constituted an unauthorized banking business, and from
authorities in California and Idaho in 2001 that its service
might constitute an unauthorized banking business. PayPal has
taken steps to address these states concerns, and has
received a conclusion from the New York Banking Department that
its current business model does not constitute illegal banking.
PayPal also has obtained licenses to operate as a money
transmitter in Louisiana and Idaho. However, we cannot assure
you that the steps PayPal has taken to address state regulatory
concerns will be effective in all states. If PayPal is found to
be engaged in an unauthorized banking business in one or more
states, it might be subject to monetary penalties and adverse
publicity and might be required to cease doing business with
residents of those states. Even if the steps it has taken to
resolve these states concerns are deemed sufficient by the
state regulatory authorities, PayPal could be subject to fines
and penalties for its prior activities. The need to comply with
state laws prohibiting unauthorized banking activities could
also limit PayPals ability to enhance its services in the
future.

If PayPal Were Found to Be Subject to or in
    Violation of Any Laws or Regulations Governing Money
    Transmitters, It Could Be Subject to Liability and Forced to
    Change Its Business Practices.

A number of states have enacted legislation
regulating money transmitters and PayPal has applied for
licenses under this legislation in 28 jurisdictions. To
date, PayPal has obtained licenses in 12 states and the
District of Columbia. As a licensed money transmitter, PayPal is
subject to bonding requirements, restrictions on its investment
of customer funds, reporting requirements and inspection by
state regulatory agencies. If PayPals pending applications
were denied, or if it were found to be subject to and in
violation



of any money services laws or regulations, PayPal
also could be subject to liability or forced to cease doing
business with residents of certain states or to change its
business practices. Even if PayPal is not forced to change its
business practices, it could be required to obtain licenses or
regulatory approvals that could impose a substantial cost on
PayPal.

If PayPal Were to Be Found Subject to or in
    Violation of Any Laws or Regulations Governing Electronic Fund
    Transfers, It Could Be Subject to Liability and Forced to Change
    Its Business Practices.

Although there have been no definitive
interpretations to date, PayPal has assumed that its product is
subject to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and
Regulation E of the Federal Reserve Board. As a result,
among other things, PayPal must provide advance disclosure of
changes to its product, follow specified error resolution
procedures and absorb losses from transactions not authorized by
the consumer. In addition, PayPal is subject to the financial
privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related
regulations. As a result, some customer financial information
that PayPal receives is subject to limitations on reuse and
disclosure. Additionally, pending legislation at the state and
federal levels may restrict further PayPals information
gathering and disclosure practices. Existing and potential
future privacy laws may limit PayPals ability to develop
new products and services that make use of data gathered through
its product. The provisions of these laws and related
regulations are complicated, and PayPal does not have extensive
experience in complying with these laws and related regulations.
Even technical violations of these laws can result in penalties
of up to $1,000 assessed for each non-compliant transaction.
During the year ended December 31, 2001 and the six months
ended June 30, 2002, PayPal processed approximately 189,000
and 306,000 transactions per day, and any violations could
expose PayPal to significant liability.

PayPal Is Subject to Laws and Regulations
    on Money Laundering and Reporting of Suspicious Activities That
    Could Have a Material Adverse Impact on Its Business and Could
    Subject It to Civil and Criminal Liability.

PayPal is subject to money laundering laws and
regulations that prohibit, among other things, its involvement
in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities. These laws
and regulations require PayPal to operate an anti-money
laundering program that contains at least the following
elements: written policies and procedures (including those
relating to customer identification), training for employees,
designation of a compliance officer, and regular independent
review of the program. Such a program must be in place by
July 24, 2002. PayPal has adopted a program to comply with
these regulations, but any errors or failure to implement the
program properly could lead to lawsuits, administrative action,
fine and/or prosecution by the government. PayPal is also
subject to regulations that require it to report suspicious
activities involving transactions of $2,000 or more and to
obtain and keep more detailed records on the senders and
recipients in transfers of $3,000 or more. The interpretation of
suspicious activities in this context is uncertain. Future
regulations under the USA Patriot Act may require PayPal to
revise the procedures it takes to verify the identity of its
customers and to monitor more closely international
transactions. These regulations could impose significant costs
on PayPal and make it more difficult for new customers to join
its network. PayPal could be required to learn more about its
customers before opening an account, to obtain additional
verification of international customers and to monitor its
customers activities more closely. These requirements
could raise PayPals costs significantly and reduce the
attractiveness of its product. Failure to comply with federal
and state money laundering laws could result in significant
criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties and forfeiture of
significant assets.

Even if PayPal complies with these laws, federal
and state law enforcement agencies could seize customer funds
that are proceeds of unlawful activity, which could result in
adverse publicity for PayPal and affect its business adversely.
Some online casinos use PayPals product to accept and make
payments. If these casinos are operating illegally, PayPal may
be subject to civil proceedings or criminal prosecution under
numerous laws, including but not limited to money laundering
laws, as discussed above under the caption  The
Divestiture or Discontinuation of PayPals Business
Operations Relating to the Processing of Payments for Online
Gambling Merchants Would Adversely Affect PayPals Business
and Results of



Operations. In addition, future regulation
in this area is likely, and PayPal cannot predict how such
regulation would affect it. Complying with such regulation could
be expensive or require PayPal to change the way it operates its
business.

PayPals Status Under Banking or
    Financial Services Laws or Other Laws in Countries Outside the
    U.S. Is Unclear. The Cost of Obtaining Any Required Licenses or
    Regulatory Approvals in These Countries Could Affect
    PayPals Future Profitability.

PayPal currently offers its product to customers
with credit cards in 37 countries outside the U.S. In
sixteen of these countries  Canada, the United
Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Australia, New
Zealand, Hong Kong, Japan, Spain, Mexico, Singapore, Sweden,
Denmark, Finland and Norway  customers can withdraw
funds to local bank accounts. In these countries, it is not
clear whether, in order to provide its product in compliance
with local law, PayPal needs to be regulated as a bank or
financial institution or otherwise. If PayPal were found to be
subject to and in violation of any foreign laws or regulations,
it could be subject to liability, forced to change its business
practices or forced to suspend operations in one or more
countries. Alternatively, PayPal could be required to obtain
licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose a substantial
cost on it and involve considerable delay to the provision or
development of its product. Implementation of PayPals
plans to enhance the attractiveness of its product for
international customers, in particular its plans to offer
customers the ability to transact business in major currencies
in addition to the U.S. dollar, will increase the risks that it
could be found to be in violation of laws or regulations in
countries outside the U.S.

PayPal Is Subject to U.S. and Foreign
    Government Regulation of the Internet, the Impact of Which Is
    Difficult to Predict. PayPal Could Be Exposed to Significant
    Liabilities and Expenses if It Is Required to Comply with New or
    Additional Regulations, and as a Result, PayPals Business
    Could Suffer.

There are currently few laws or regulations that
apply specifically to the sale of goods and services on the
Internet. The application to PayPal of existing laws and
regulations relating to issues such as banking, currency
exchange, online gaming, electronic contracting, consumer
protection and privacy is unclear. PayPals liability if
its customers violate laws on pricing, taxation, impermissible
content, intellectual property infringement, unfair or deceptive
practices or quality of services is also unclear. In addition,
PayPal may become subject to new laws and regulations directly
applicable to the Internet or PayPals activities. Any
existing or new legislation applicable to PayPal could expose it
to substantial liability, including significant expenses
necessary to comply with these laws and regulations, and reduce
use of the Internet on which PayPal depends.

In 1998, the U.S. government enacted a
three-year moratorium prohibiting states and local governments
from imposing new taxes on Internet access or electronic
commerce transactions. This moratorium has been extended until
November 1, 2003. After that date, unless it is renewed,
states and local governments may levy additional taxes on
Internet access and electronic commerce transactions. An
increase in the taxation of electronic commerce transactions may
make the Internet less attractive for consumers and businesses.

PayPals Financial Success Will Remain
    Highly Sensitive to Changes in the Rate at Which Its Customers
    Fund Payments Using Credit Cards Rather Than Bank Account
    Transfers or Existing PayPal Account Balances. PayPals
    Profitability Could Be Harmed if the Rate at Which Customers
    Fund Using Credit Cards Goes Up.

PayPal pays significant transaction fees when
senders fund payment transactions using credit cards, nominal
fees when customers fund payment transactions by electronic
transfer of funds from bank accounts and no fees when customers
fund payment transactions from an existing PayPal account
balance. For the year ended December 31, 2001 and the six
months ended June 30, 2002, senders funded 51.5% and 46.9%,
respectively, of PayPals payment volume using credit
cards. Senders may resist funding payments by electronic
transfer from bank accounts because of the greater protection
offered by credit



cards, including the ability to dispute and
reverse merchant charges, because of frequent flier miles or
other incentives offered by credit cards or because of
generalized fears regarding privacy or loss of control in
surrendering bank account information to a third party.

Increases in Credit Card Processing Fees
    Could Increase PayPals Costs, Affect Its Profitability, or
    Otherwise Limit Its Operations.

From time to time, Visa, MasterCard, American
Express and Discover increase the interchange fees that they
charge for each transaction using their cards. MasterCard
implemented an increase to its interchange fees effective April
2002. PayPals credit card processors have the right to
pass any increases in interchange fees on to PayPal. Any such
increased fees could increase PayPals operating costs and
reduce its profit margins. Furthermore, PayPals credit
card processors require it to pledge cash as collateral with
respect to PayPals acceptance of Visa, MasterCard,
American Express and Discover and the amount of cash that PayPal
is required to pledge could be increased at any time.

PayPal Has Limited Experience in Managing
    and Accounting Accurately for Large Amounts of Customer Funds.
    PayPals Failure to Manage These Funds Properly Would Harm
    Its Business.

PayPals ability to manage and account
accurately for customer funds requires a high level of internal
controls. PayPal has neither an established operating history
nor proven management experience in maintaining, over a long
term, these internal controls. As PayPals business
continues to grow, it must strengthen its internal controls
accordingly. PayPals success requires significant public
confidence in its ability to handle large and growing
transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure
to maintain necessary controls or to manage accurately customer
funds could diminish customer use of PayPals product
severely.

Loss of Principal of Customer Funds Placed
    in Bank Accounts or in the PayPal Money Market Fund May Affect
    Adversely Customer Perceptions About the Safety of PayPals
    Service and as a Result Could Reduce Its Payment Volume and Its
    Ability to Operate Its Business Profitably.

PayPal places customer funds that are not
withdrawn from the PayPal system in bank accounts as agent for
the customer, unless the customer is a U.S. resident and has
chosen to enroll in the money market sweep, in which case the
customers balances are directed to purchase shares in the
Fund. PayPal seeks to place customer funds in well-capitalized
banks, and it has obtained an opinion from the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation that funds placed in bank accounts will be
eligible for federal deposit insurance on a per-customer basis
as long as PayPal maintains accurate records and continues to
act as agent for the customer. However, customer funds could be
lost in the event of the insolvency of one or more of these
banks. Customers who opt to invest their money in the Fund may
lose the original principal value of their initial investment.
If these losses occur, perceptions regarding PayPals
safety and handling of customer funds may result in decreased
customer balances and payment volume, which would increase
PayPals costs and reduce its revenue.

The PayPal Special Meeting

Date, Time and Place

The special meeting will be held at
9:00 a.m., local time, on October 3, 2002 at 1840
Embarcadero Road, Palo Alto, California 94303.

Items of Business

At the special meeting, you will be asked to
consider and vote upon the proposal to approve and adopt the
merger agreement and approve the merger. You also will consider
and vote upon any other business that may properly come before
the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the
special meeting. PayPal currently does not contemplate that any
other matters will be considered at the special meeting.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors of
PayPal

After careful consideration, the board of
directors of PayPal determined that the merger is advisable, and
is fair to and in the best interests of PayPal and its
stockholders and approved the merger agreement and the merger.
Accordingly, the board of directors of PayPal recommends that
you vote FOR the proposal to approve and adopt the merger
agreement and approve the merger.

Admission to the Special Meeting

Only PayPal stockholders, including joint
holders, as of the close of business on August 28, 2002 and
other persons holding valid proxies for the special meeting are
entitled to attend the special meeting. All stockholders and
their proxies should be prepared to present photo
identification. In addition, if you are a record holder, your
name is subject to verification against the list of record
holders on the record date prior to being admitted to the
meeting. PayPal stockholders who are not record holders but hold
shares through a broker or nominee (
i.e.,
 in
street name) should be prepared to provide proof of
beneficial ownership on the record date, such as a recent
account statement or similar evidence of ownership. If you do
not provide photo identification or comply with the other
procedures outlined above upon request, you will not be admitted
to the special meeting.

Method of Voting; Record Date; Stockholders
Entitled to Vote; Quorum

PayPal stockholders are being asked to vote both
shares held directly in their name as stockholders of record and
any shares they hold in street name as beneficial
owners. Shares held in street name are shares held in a stock
brokerage account or shares held by a bank or other nominee.

The method of voting differs for shares held as a
record holder and shares held in street name. Record holders
will receive proxy cards. Holders of shares in street name will
receive voting instruction cards in order to instruct their
brokers or nominees how to vote.

Proxy cards and voting instruction cards are
being solicited on behalf of the board of directors of PayPal
from PayPal stockholders in favor of the proposal to approve and
adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger.

Stockholders may receive more than one set of
voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy
statement/ prospectus and multiple proxy cards or voting
instruction cards. For example, stockholders who hold shares in
more than one brokerage account will receive a separate voting
instruction card for each brokerage account in which shares are
held. Stockholders of record whose shares are registered in more
than one name will receive more than one proxy card. PayPal
stockholders should complete, sign, date and return each proxy
card and voting instruction card they receive.

Only stockholders of record of PayPal at the
close of business on August 28, 2002, the record date for
the special meeting, are entitled to receive notice of, and have
the right to vote at, the special meeting. On



the record date, 61,559,502 shares of PayPal
common stock were issued and outstanding. Stockholders of record
of PayPal on the record date are entitled to one vote per share
of PayPal common stock on the proposal to approve and adopt the
merger agreement and approve the merger.

A quorum of stockholders is necessary to have a
valid meeting of PayPal stockholders. A majority of the shares
of PayPal common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to
vote on the record date must be present in person or by proxy at
the special meeting in order for a quorum to be established.

Abstentions and broker non-votes
count as present for establishing a quorum. A broker
non-vote occurs on an item when a broker is not
permitted to vote on that item without instructions from the
beneficial owner of the shares and no instructions are given.
Shares held by PayPal in its treasury do not count toward
establishing a quorum.

Adjournment and Postponement

PayPal stockholders may be asked to vote upon a
proposal to adjourn or postpone the special meeting.

Required Vote

Approval and adoption of the merger agreement and
approval of the merger will require the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares of PayPal common stock
outstanding on the record date. Under applicable Delaware law,
for the purpose of determining whether the proposal to approve
and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger has
received the requisite number of affirmative votes, abstentions
will be counted and have the same effect as a vote
against the proposal. In addition, failing to vote
will have the same effect as a vote against the
proposal. A proxy card that is signed and returned that does not
indicate a vote for or against the
proposal will be counted as a vote for the approval
and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger.
A broker or nominee who holds shares for customers, who are the
beneficial owners of those shares, are prohibited from giving a
proxy to vote those customers shares with respect to the
proposal to be voted on at the special meeting without
instructions from the customer. Shares held by a broker or
nominee which are not voted because the customer has not
provided instructions to the broker or nominee will have the
same effect as a vote against the proposal.

Share Ownership of PayPal Directors and
Executive Officers

At the close of business on the record date for
the special meeting, directors and executive officers of PayPal
and their affiliates beneficially owned and were entitled to
vote 36.5% of the 61,559,502 shares of PayPal common stock
outstanding on that date.

Voting Procedures

Submitting Proxies or Voting
    Instructions

PayPal stockholders of record may vote their
shares by attending the special meeting and voting their shares
in person at the special meeting, or by completing their proxy
cards and signing, dating and mailing them in the enclosed
self-addressed envelopes. If a proxy card is signed by a
stockholder of record of PayPal and returned without voting
instructions, the shares represented by the proxy will be voted
FOR the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and
approve the merger, and in the discretion of Peter A. Thiel
and John D. Muller, as the proxy holders, on any other
business that may properly come before the special meeting or
any adjournment or postponement of the PayPal special meeting.

Because Delaware, the state in which PayPal is
incorporated, permits electronic submission of proxies, PayPal
stockholders who are stockholders of record have the option to
submit their proxies by using the telephone or the Internet. The
telephone and Internet voting procedures are designed to
authenticate votes cast by use of a personal identification
number. These procedures allow PayPal stockholders to appoint a
proxy to vote their shares of PayPal common stock and to confirm
that their instructions have been



properly recorded. Instructions for voting by
using the telephone or the Internet are printed on the proxy
card for PayPal stockholders of record.

PayPal stockholders whose shares are held in the
name of a broker or nominee must either direct the record holder
of their shares as to how to vote their shares of PayPal common
stock or obtain a proxy from the record holder to vote at the
special meeting. Beneficial holders of PayPal common stock
should check the voting instruction cards used by their brokers
or nominees to see if they may vote by using the telephone or
the Internet.

Revoking Proxies or Voting
    Instructions

PayPal stockholders of record may revoke their
proxies at any time prior to the time their proxies are voted at
the special meeting. Proxies may be revoked by written notice to
the corporate secretary of PayPal, by a later-dated proxy signed
and returned by mail, or by attending the special meeting and
voting in person. PayPal stockholders of record may also revoke
proxies by a later-dated proxy using the telephone or Internet
voting procedures described on their proxy cards. Remember that
your proxy card or voting instruction card must be received, or
you must vote using the telephone or Internet if available, no
later than 11:00 a.m., local time, on October 2, 2002
in order for your shares to be voted at the special meeting,
unless you attend and vote at the special meeting.

PayPal stockholders whose shares are held in the
name of a broker or nominee may change their votes by submitting
new voting instructions to their brokers or nominees. Those
PayPal stockholders may not vote their shares in person at the
special meeting unless they obtain a signed proxy from the
record holder giving them the right to vote their shares.

Proxy Solicitation

The board of directors of PayPal is soliciting
proxies for the special meeting from PayPal stockholders. Each
company will share equally the cost of printing and filing this
proxy statement/prospectus and the registration statement on
Form S-4, of which it forms a part, that has been filed by
eBay with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Other than the costs shared with eBay, the cost
of soliciting proxies from PayPal stockholders will be paid by
PayPal. In addition to solicitation by mail, directors, officers
and employees of PayPal may also solicit proxies from
stockholders by telephone, telecopy, telegram or in person.
PayPal will also make arrangements with brokerage houses and
other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to send the proxy
materials to beneficial owners. Upon request, PayPal will
reimburse those brokerage houses and custodians for their
reasonable expenses in so doing.

PayPal has retained Georgeson Shareholder
Communications Inc., or Georgeson, to assist it with the
solicitation of proxies and to verify certain records related to
the solicitations. PayPal will pay Georgeson a fee of $6,500,
plus their reasonable expenses, for these services. PayPal has
agreed to indemnify Georgeson against certain liabilities
resulting from claims involving Georgeson that directly relate
to or arise out of Georgesons engagement (except for those
directly or principally resulting from any gross negligence, bad
faith or willful or intentional misconduct by Georgeson).

Please do not send in any PayPal stock
certificates with your proxy cards or voting instruction cards.
Mellon Investor Services LLC, the exchange agent for the merger,
will send transmittal forms with instructions for the surrender
of certificates representing shares of PayPal common stock to
former PayPal stockholders shortly after the merger is
completed.

Other Matters

PayPal is not aware of any other business to be
acted upon at the special meeting. If, however, other matters
are properly brought before the special meeting or any
adjournment or postponement of the special meeting, the persons
named as proxy holders, Peter A. Thiel and John D.
Muller, will each have discretion to act on those matters, or to
adjourn or postpone the special meeting.

The Merger

General

The following section summarizes the material
terms of the merger agreement, a copy of which is included in
this proxy statement/ prospectus as Annex A and is
incorporated herein by reference. We urge you to read the merger
agreement in its entirety for a more complete description of the
terms and conditions upon which the merger is to be effected.

If the merger agreement is approved and adopted
by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of PayPal
common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting and the
other conditions to closing are satisfied or waived, Vaquita
Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of eBay, will be
merged with and into PayPal. PayPal will be the surviving
corporation and will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of eBay.
As a result of the merger, each holder of PayPal common stock
will be entitled to receive from eBay, in exchange for each
share of PayPal stock, 0.39 of a share of eBay common stock.

Merger Consideration

If the merger agreement is approved and adopted
and the merger is completed, each share of PayPal common stock
will be converted into the right to receive 0.39 of a share of
eBay common stock.

You will not receive fractional shares of eBay
common stock. Instead, you will receive a cash payment, without
interest, for any fractional share of eBay common stock you
might otherwise have been entitled to receive, which payment
represents your proportionate interest in the net proceeds from
the sale by the exchange agent of the aggregate fractional
shares of eBay common stock.

Special meeting

The merger is expected to close in the first part
of the fourth quarter of 2002. However, we cannot predict the
exact timing because the merger is subject to regulatory
approvals and other conditions.

Background of the Merger

PayPal and eBay first discussed a possible
transaction in November 2000. These initial discussions involved
a proposal that PayPal and Billpoint be combined into a single
company, the stockholders of which would include PayPals
then existing stockholders and Billpoints then existing
two stockholders, eBay and Wells Fargo.

On December 5, 2000, PayPal retained Morgan
Stanley to serve as its financial advisor in connection with a
possible sale of PayPal. PayPal engaged in discussions regarding
a possible strategic transaction with several different parties
over the next several months, including eBay.

In February and March 2001, discussions between
eBay and PayPal focused on an acquisition of PayPal by eBay.
During this period eBay retained Goldman, Sachs & Co. as its
financial advisor in connection with an acquisition of PayPal.
After eBay conducted preliminary due diligence on PayPal, the
companies were not able to agree on a valuation for PayPal and
in March 2001 discussions between the companies ceased.
Discussions with other parties concerning a possible strategic
transaction did not result in any proposals that were acceptable
to PayPal.

During the summer of 2001, representatives of
PayPal and eBay had a series of meetings to discuss the
assumptions underlying their divergent valuations of PayPal. The
companies were unable to reach agreement on PayPals
valuation. eBay made PayPal an offer that was rejected and the
discussions ended.



In September 2001, PayPal filed a registration
statement with the SEC for its initial public offering.

In November 2001, eBay contacted PayPal regarding
a possible acquisition of PayPal. Representatives of the two
companies held a series of meetings to discuss PayPals
valuation and the terms of a possible transaction. eBay made
PayPal an offer in January 2002 to acquire PayPal for
$825 million of eBay common stock. This offer was rejected
by PayPal and the discussions ended. PayPal subsequently
completed its initial public offering.

In late February 2002, eBay acquired the interest
in Billpoint that it did not own, which enabled eBay to enter
into a transaction with PayPal without obtaining the consent of
Wells Fargo. Thereafter, PayPal contacted eBay to determine
whether eBay had an interest in pursuing an acquisition of
PayPal now that eBay owned 100% of Billpoint and PayPal was a
public company.

After discussions that led to a preliminary
understanding of certain key financial terms, eBay and PayPal
signed a mutual non-disclosure agreement dated as of
March 25, 2002. The parties agreed to negotiate numerous
other terms as part of the process of reaching agreement on
definitive acquisition documents.

On March 26, 2002, representatives of the
two companies gave presentations to each other regarding their
respective business models, strategy, operations and financial
results and commenced due diligence on each other that continued
over the next two weeks.

On March 29, 2002, representatives of eBay
delivered a draft merger agreement to representatives of PayPal
and PayPal notified Morgan Stanley of the potential transaction.
Over the course of the next two weeks, representatives of the
companies negotiated over the terms of the merger agreement and
other related agreements while also continuing to perform due
diligence. During this period, the market price of PayPal common
stock increased relative to the market price of eBay common
stock.

On April 7, 2002, PayPal entered into a new
letter agreement with Morgan Stanley pursuant to which Morgan
Stanley was formally retained to meet with PayPals board
of directors and provide a financial opinion letter in
connection with a possible transaction.

During the morning of April 11, 2002,
representatives of the companies met to continue negotiations
over the terms of the merger agreement and other related
agreements. Later that day, PayPals board of directors met
and determined not to proceed with the on-going negotiations on
the terms then under discussion. Representatives of PayPal were
directed to meet with representatives of eBay to convey the
determination by PayPals board of directors that it would
be willing to complete negotiations on a transaction prior to
each company announcing first quarter results only on the basis
of specified improved financial and other terms.

At a subsequent meeting on April 11, 2002,
eBay rejected PayPals proposed new terms and negotiations
ceased.

After this meeting, the subsequent contacts
between the companies were infrequent and incidental to their
respective businesses. On May 15, 2002, PayPal sent a
letter to representatives of eBay requesting the return of all
materials provided to eBay and its representatives in connection
with eBays due diligence investigation of PayPal. On
May 16, 2002, eBay sent a similar letter to PayPal and the
parties complied with the respective requests.

Shortly after the termination of negotiations on
April 11, 2002, eBay intensified its efforts regarding a
potential strategic transaction with another company relating to
the provision of online payment services.

Incidental to its business, PayPal participated
as an exhibitor at the eBay Live conference, held from
June 22, 2002 through June 24, 2002 in Anaheim,
California and attended by more than 5,000 eBay sellers,
including many of the largest sellers on eBays website.
During the course of the conference on June 23, 2002, a
senior officer from each of PayPal and eBay had a spontaneous
conversation on the exhibition floor of the conference and
discussed the reasons why the previous negotiations between the
companies had failed. Each officer expressed regret over the
failure of the previous negotiations and



discussed whether it would be possible to start
new negotiations. At a second meeting later that afternoon, the
PayPal officer conveyed to the eBay officer that there was
interest within PayPals senior management for starting new
discussions with eBay where the negotiations between the
companies had ended on April 11, 2002. Late that evening,
eBay stated that it was not willing to engage in negotiations
with PayPal at that time and that PayPal should not postpone its
then pending secondary offering of PayPal common stock. At this
time, eBays discussions concerning an alternative
strategic transaction were still actively ongoing.

On June 29, 2002, the PayPal officer and the
eBay officer talked by telephone concerning whether it would be
possible for the two sides to meet.

In the late morning of July 2, 2002, the two
officers agreed to arrange a meeting for later that day. That
afternoon, representatives of the two companies attended a
meeting to discuss the possible terms and timing of eBays
potential acquisition of PayPal, including a proposed exchange
ratio. In light of the breakdown of the previous negotiations,
representatives of eBay indicated that eBay would not be willing
to start new merger discussions unless PayPals board of
directors provided its preliminary approval of the financial
terms proposed by eBay and agreed to work with the objective of
concluding negotiations by July 8, 2002 to minimize market
risk, the possibility of rumors developing in the marketplace
concerning the proposed transaction and business disruption.
Representatives of PayPal agreed to seek to convene a special
meeting of PayPals board of directors for the next day to
consider the proposed terms and timing of the transaction.

On July 3, 2002, eBay provided PayPal with a
written preliminary proposal setting forth the proposed terms
that were discussed during the meeting on July 2, 2002.

Later that day, PayPals board of directors
held a telephonic meeting at which time they discussed the
preliminary proposal received earlier that day from eBay. After
discussing the proposal, the board of directors decided to
pursue discussions with eBay regarding a potential transaction.

Following the meeting of PayPals board of
directors, an organizational conference call was held among
representatives of eBay and PayPal. The parties discussed the
timetable for initiating the process of performing business,
financial, accounting, regulatory, legal and other due diligence
on the respective companies and negotiating the terms of the
merger transaction with the objective of executing the merger
agreement and related agreements by July 8, 2002.

On July 4, 2002 through July 6, 2002,
representatives of eBay and PayPal participated in a series of
meetings to perform business, operations, financial, accounting,
regulatory, legal and other due diligence on each of the
respective companies.

On July 4, 2002 through July 6, 2002,
representatives of eBay and PayPal participated in a series of
meetings to negotiate the terms of the merger agreement and
other related agreements. The negotiations covered all aspects
of the transaction and, as a result, among other things, the
representations and warranties made by PayPal were narrowed, the
restrictions on the conduct of PayPals business were
loosened, the conditions to completion of the proposed merger
were limited, the provisions regarding termination of the merger
agreement were limited, the details of the no shop
clause were finalized, the amount of the termination fees was
reduced and the events triggering payment of such fees were
limited and the consequences of termination and the terms and
delivery of the employment agreements and stockholders
agreements were finalized. In addition, the negotiations
resulted in fewer shares of PayPal common stock being subject to
the stockholders agreements.

On the afternoon of July 6, 2002,
PayPals board of directors held a telephonic meeting to
discuss the status of negotiations of the proposed transaction
and to meet with PayPals management and its financial,
accounting and legal advisors. Members of PayPals
management and each of the companys financial, accounting
and legal advisors presented and discussed with the board the
results of their business, operations, financial, accounting,
regulatory, legal and other due diligence review of eBay and
reviewed the terms and conditions of the merger agreement that
had been negotiated by management. A representative of
PayPals outside legal counsel made a presentation
concerning the fiduciary duties of PayPals directors



in considering and approving the merger.
PayPals board of directors engaged in extensive discussion
and consideration of the proposed transaction, the potential
alternatives to the transaction and the benefits and risks of
entering into the merger agreement compared to continuing as a
stand alone entity. One of PayPals directors was not
present at this meeting.

On July 7, 2002, PayPals board of
directors met to discuss the terms and conditions set forth in
the final documentation for the proposed merger and to receive
the presentation and financial opinion letter of Morgan Stanley,
as more fully described under Opinion of PayPals
Financial Advisor on page 70. After making its
presentation and answering the questions of the board, Morgan
Stanley delivered its opinion that, as of July 7, 2002 and
based on and subject to the considerations in its opinion, the
exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a
financial point of view to holders of PayPal common stock. After
further deliberation with PayPal management and its legal
advisors, PayPals board of directors determined that the
terms of the merger were fair to and in the best interests of
PayPal and its stockholders and as such, by a unanimous vote of
the directors present, voted to enter into the merger agreement
and to recommend that PayPal stockholders approve and adopt the
merger agreement and approve the merger. One of PayPals
directors was not present at this meeting.

On July 7, 2002, eBays board of
directors held a telephonic meeting to review the proposed terms
of the merger and the merger agreement, stockholders agreements
and employment agreements. eBays management reviewed with
eBays board of directors the strategic rationale for the
merger and the results of managements business,
operations, risk management, financial, accounting, regulatory
and legal due diligence investigation of PayPal and responded to
questions by eBays board of directors. eBays
financial advisor reviewed the financial terms of the proposed
merger and delivered advice relating to financial matters
involving the transaction. Following that presentation, a
representative of eBays outside legal counsel described to
eBays board of directors the terms of the merger agreement
and made a presentation concerning the fiduciary duties of
eBays directors in considering and approving the merger.
After further deliberations, eBays board of directors
determined, among other things, that the terms and conditions of
the merger were fair to and in the best interests of eBay and
its stockholders and approved, with one director absent from the
meeting and one director voting against, the merger, the merger
agreement, the stockholders agreements and the employment
agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby.
eBays board of directors also approved the issuance of a
press release reporting eBays results of operations for
the quarter ended June 30, 2002.

In the afternoon of July 7, 2002, eBay and
PayPal entered into the merger agreement.

Also on July 7, 2002, eBay and certain
PayPal stockholders entered into stockholders agreements
pursuant to which those PayPal stockholders each agreed to vote
certain of their shares of PayPal common stock, representing in
the aggregate approximately 27.7% of the outstanding PayPal
common stock, for the proposal to approve and adopt the merger
agreement and approve the merger. In addition, eBay and PayPal
entered into employment agreements with Peter A. Thiel,
Max R. Levchin, David O. Sacks, Roelof F. Botha,
John Muller and Ryan Downs. For a discussion of these
agreements, see Other Material Agreements Relating to the
Merger on page 95.

On July 8, 2002, a joint press release was
issued announcing the signing of the merger agreement.

PayPals Reasons for the Merger;
Recommendation of the PayPal Board

PayPals Reasons for the
    Merger

PayPals board of directors approved the
merger agreement and the merger by a unanimous vote of those
members considering the merger. In the course of reaching its
decision to approve the merger agreement and the merger,
PayPals board of directors consulted with PayPals
management, as well as its outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor. At its meeting on July 7, 2002,
PayPals board of directors:

 

determined that the merger is advisable, and is
    fair and in the best interests of PayPal and its stockholders;



 

determined that the exchange ratio is fair from a
    financial point of view to PayPals stockholders;

 

approved the merger agreement and the merger;

 

directed the merger agreement be submitted for
    consideration by PayPals stockholders; and

 

recommended that PayPals stockholders vote
    FOR the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and
    approve the merger.

One of PayPals directors was not present at
this meeting.

PayPals board of directors identified and
considered a variety of potential positive factors in its
deliberations concerning the merger agreement and the merger,
including without limitation the following, each of which,
individually and in the aggregate, in the opinion of the board,
supported its decision:

 

PayPals and eBays financial
    condition, results of operations, business quality, prospects
    and businesses as separate entities and on a combined basis,
    including:

 

the revenues, cash flows and operating margins of
    PayPal, eBay and the pro forma projected earnings of the
    combined company; and

 

the recent and historical stock price performance
    of PayPals common stock and eBays common stock;

 

the strategic nature of the merger and increased
    opportunity for growth;

 

the increased ability of the combined company to
    manage PayPals growth and international expansion;

 

the fact that PayPal actively tested the market
    for an acquisition of the business in the winter and spring of
    2001, and the results of the market test and the periods since
    then indicated that there have not been any proposals from any
    company other than eBay to merge with or acquire PayPal or any
    other attractive proposals for any other transactions with
    PayPal;

 

the possible alternatives to the merger,
    including to operate PayPal as an independent company and the
    associated risks in light of: (1) the possibility of an
    impairment of PayPals ability to process payments for
    online auctions; (2) changes to card association rules;
    (3) losses due to fraud and disputes between senders and
    recipients; and (4) PayPals status under state,
    federal and international financial services regulation,
    including the uncertain legal status of PayPals processing
    for online gambling-related businesses;

 

the opportunity for PayPals stockholders to
    participate in a larger company with a more liquid market for
    its stock and, as stockholders of the combined company, to
    participate in any increases in the value of its business
    following the merger;

 

the fact that the exchange ratio would enable
    PayPals stockholders after the merger to own approximately
    8% of the common stock of the combined company;

 

the intrinsic value and historical market prices
    of PayPals common stock and the fact that the exchange
    ratio (based on eBays trading price at the close of
    business of July 5, 2002, the last trading day before
    PayPals board of directors approved the merger agreement)
    to be paid by eBay in the merger represented a premium of:

 

18% to PayPals trading price at the close
    of business on July 5, 2002;

 

24% over the price of PayPal common stock sold in
    a secondary offering on June 27, 2002;

 

82% over the price of PayPal common stock in
    PayPals initial public offering on February 15, 2002;
    and

 

9% over the average trading price since the
    initial public offering;



 

the directors belief that the consideration
    to be paid by eBay in the merger represented the highest price
    per share that could be negotiated with eBay;

 

the presentation of Morgan Stanley to
    PayPals board of directors on July 7, 2002, including
    the opinion of Morgan Stanley presented to PayPals board
    of directors to the effect that, as of July 7, 2002 and
    based on and subject to the considerations in its opinion, the
    exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a
    financial point of view to holders of shares of PayPal common
    stock (See  Opinion of PayPals Financial
    Advisor on page 70);

 

the likely ability to complete the merger as a
    reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes in
    which PayPal stockholders generally would not recognize any gain
    or loss, except for any gain or loss realized in connection with
    any cash received for fractional shares of eBays common
    stock (See  Material Federal Income Tax
    Consequences on page 76);

 

the financial and non-financial terms and
    conditions of the merger agreement, including:

      

the merger consideration;

      

the fact that certain types of adverse
    developments are not considered in whether the conditions to
    eBays obligation to complete the merger have been
    satisfied;

      

the fact that eBays obligation to complete
    the merger is not conditioned on eBays receipt of any
    financing;

      

the right of PayPals board of directors, in
    connection with the discharge of their fiduciary duties to
    PayPal and its stockholders or in response to certain
    unsolicited alternative acquisition proposals, to withdraw,
    modify or qualify its recommendation to PayPals
    stockholders to approve the merger agreement and pursue a
    competing transaction with another party, and the financial
    consequences of such withdrawal, modification or qualification;
    and

      

the absence of any right of eBay to terminate the
    merger agreement if the value of a share of eBay common stock
    rises above a particular level prior to the consummation of the
    merger.

PayPals board of directors also identified
and considered a variety of potentially adverse factors in its
deliberations concerning the merger agreement and the merger,
including the following:

 

the risk that the potential benefits sought in
    the merger might not be fully realized;

 

the possibility that the merger might not receive
    regulatory clearance from the appropriate government agencies;

 

the possibility that the merger might not be
    consummated and the potential adverse effects of the public
    announcement of the merger on:

      

PayPals operating results;

      

PayPals ability to attract and retain key
    employees; and

      

PayPals overall competitive position;

 

the risk that key personnel might not remain
    employees of the combined company following the merger;

 

the absence of any right of PayPal to terminate
    the merger agreement if the value of eBays common stock
    falls below any particular level prior to the merger; and

 

that the consummation of the merger will preclude
    PayPal stockholders from participating in the future growth of
    PayPal as an independent public company.

PayPals board of directors specifically
considered that the inclusion in the merger agreement of the
covenant prohibiting any solicitation by PayPal of alternative
acquisition proposals and the $45 million termination fee
payable to eBay in certain circumstances were each a
prerequisite to eBays willingness to



enter into the transaction on the terms outlined
above. PayPals board of directors considered that while
these provisions might have the effect of discouraging other
offers, PayPals board of directors retained the ability to
negotiate with third parties expressing an unsolicited interest
in PayPal after the announcement of the transaction, and
PayPals board of directors determined that the benefits to
PayPals stockholders of securing an agreement with eBay
outweighed any potential detriment.

In view of the complexity and wide variety of
information and factors, both positive and potentially adverse,
considered by PayPals board of directors, PayPals
board of directors did not find it practical to quantify, rank
or otherwise assign relative or specific weights to the
information and factors considered. In addition, PayPals
board of directors did not reach any specific conclusion with
respect to the information and each of the factors considered,
or any aspect of any particular factor, but, rather, conducted
an overall analysis of the information and factors described
above, including, among other things, by engaging in thorough
discussions with PayPals management and legal and
financial advisors. In considering the information and factors
described above, individual members of PayPals board of
directors may have given different weight to different
information or factors. PayPals board of directors
considered all of the information and these factors as a whole
and believed the information and factors supported its decision
to approve the merger agreement and the merger. After taking
into consideration all of the information and factors described
above, PayPals board of directors concluded that the
merger was fair to, and in the best interests of, PayPal and its
stockholders and that PayPal should proceed with the merger.

Recommendation of PayPals Board of
    Directors

PayPals board of directors believes that
the merger is advisable, and is fair and in the best interests
of PayPal and its stockholders and recommends that PayPals
stockholders vote FOR the proposal to approve and adopt the
merger agreement and approve the merger.

Opinion of PayPals Financial
Advisor

Morgan Stanley was engaged to render a financial
opinion letter in connection with the merger. Morgan Stanley was
selected based on its qualifications, expertise and reputation,
as well as its understanding of the business and affairs of
PayPal and because of its prior work for PayPal in connection
with a potential sale by PayPal pursuant to the terms of a
letter agreement dated December 5, 2000, which was
superseded by the letter agreement dated April 7, 2002. On
July 7, 2002, Morgan Stanley delivered its oral opinion,
subsequently confirmed in writing, to the PayPal board of
directors that, as of July 7, 2002 and subject to and based
on the considerations in its opinion, the exchange ratio
pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of PayPal common stock.

The full text of Morgan Stanleys written
opinion, dated as of July 7, 2002, which sets forth, among
other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken by Morgan
Stanley in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex D to
this proxy statement/prospectus. Holders of PayPals common
stock are urged to, and should, read this opinion carefully and
in its entirety. Morgan Stanleys opinion is directed to
the board of directors of PayPal, addresses only the fairness of
the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement from a
financial point of view to the holders of PayPal common stock
and does not address any other aspect of the acquisition or
constitute a recommendation to any PayPal stockholder as to how
to vote at the special meeting. This summary is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion.

In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among
other things:

 

reviewed certain publicly available financial
    statements and other information of PayPal and eBay;

 

reviewed certain internal financial statements
    and other financial and operating data concerning PayPal and
    eBay prepared by the management of PayPal and eBay,
    respectively, including in the case of PayPal and eBay,
    preliminary results for the quarter ended June 30, 2002;

 

reviewed certain financial projections prepared
    by the management of PayPal and eBay, respectively;



 

discussed the past and current operations and
    financial condition and the prospects of PayPal and eBay,
    including information relating to certain strategic, financial
    and operational benefits anticipated from the merger, with
    senior executives of PayPal and eBay, respectively;

 

reviewed the pro forma impact of the merger on
    eBays earnings per share;

 

reviewed the reported prices and trading activity
    for the PayPal common stock and the eBay common stock;

 

compared the financial performance of PayPal and
    eBay and the prices and trading activity of the PayPal common
    stock and the eBay common stock with that of certain other
    comparable publicly-traded companies and their securities;

 

reviewed the financial terms, to the extent
    publicly available, of certain comparable transactions;

 

participated in discussions and negotiations
    among representatives of PayPal and eBay and their financial and
    legal advisors;

 

reviewed the merger agreement and certain related
    documents;

 

discussed with the management of PayPal the
    strategic rationale for the merger, including the existing and
    anticipated future relationship between PayPal and eBay; and

 

performed such other analyses and considered such
    other factors as Morgan Stanley deemed appropriate.

Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon without
independent verification the accuracy and completeness of the
information reviewed by Morgan Stanley for the purposes of its
opinion. With respect to the financial projections, including
information relating to certain strategic, financial and
operational benefits anticipated from the merger that Morgan
Stanley discussed with PayPal, Morgan Stanley assumed that they
were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of the future financial
performance of PayPal and eBay. Morgan Stanley also relied
without independent verification on the assessment by the
management of PayPal on the strategic rationale for the merger,
including their assessment of the existing and anticipated
future relationship between PayPal and eBay. In addition, Morgan
Stanley relied upon the assessment by the managements of PayPal
and eBay of their ability to retain key employees of PayPal and
eBay. Morgan Stanley also relied upon, without independent
verification, the assessment by the managements of PayPal and
eBay of the timing and risks associated with the integration of
PayPal and eBay and the validity of, and risks associated with,
PayPals and eBays existing and future technologies,
services or business models.

In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the
merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms set
forth in the merger agreement, including that the merger would
be treated as a tax-free reorganization, pursuant to the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Morgan Stanleys opinion was
necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other
conditions as in effect on, and the information made available
to Morgan Stanley as of, the date of its opinion.

The following is a brief summary of the material
financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection
with preparing its opinion. Some of these summaries of financial
analyses include information presented in tabular format. In
order to understand fully the financial analyses performed by
Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text
of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete
description of the financial analyses performed by Morgan
Stanley.



Trading Analysis

Morgan Stanley reviewed the implied premium over
PayPals stock price based on eBays July 5, 2002
closing price of $60.55 per share and using the exchange ratio
of 0.39 from the merger agreement and noted the following:

PayPal/eBay Relationship

Morgan Stanley analyzed PayPals sensitivity
to eBays transaction revenues. To conduct this analysis,
Morgan Stanley assumed that:

 

60% of PayPals Gross Merchant Sales
    originated on the eBay network;

 

PayPals net revenue from Gross Merchant
    Sales was 3.7% of Gross Merchant Sales and PayPals gross
    margin was 53%, consistent with PayPals net revenue and
    gross margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2002; and

 

PayPal continued to trade at 53.6x 2002 estimated
    cash earnings, the level at which PayPal was trading as of the
    close of market on July 5, 2002.

Potential Value Creation

Morgan Stanley calculated the implied value of
each share of PayPal common stock at the exchange ratio of 0.39
shares of eBay common stock for each share of PayPal common
stock, assuming:

 

PayPal management estimates of 2003 cash earnings
    of $0.68 per share and IBES estimates of 2003 cash earnings of
    $1.11 for eBay;

 

a 2003 price to cash earnings multiple of 54.5x
    for eBay and a market capitalization weighted blended 2003 price
    to earnings ratio of 52.8x; and

 

synergies in 2003 based upon
    (decreases)/increases in PayPal standalone revenues of (5)%, 0%,
    5% and 10%.

Pro Forma Merger Analysis

Morgan Stanley analyzed the financial impact of
the merger on eBays estimated earnings per share and cash
earnings per share. Morgan Stanleys analysis was based on:

 

2003 cash earnings management estimates for
    PayPal of $0.68 per share and IBES estimates of 2003 cash
    earnings of $1.11 for eBay; and

 

synergies in 2003 based upon (decreases)/
    increases in PayPal standalone revenues of (5)%, 0%, 5%
    and 10%.

This analysis indicated that, in all scenarios,
the merger would be dilutive to eBays 2003 estimated
earnings per share and accretive to eBays 2003 estimated
cash earnings per share.

Trading Characteristics

Morgan Stanley analyzed trading characteristics
of PayPal common stock and eBay common stock, including:

 

average daily trading ranges for PayPal and eBay
    common stock over selected periods, based on publicly available
    information; and

 

the relative liquidity of eBay and PayPal common
    stock, based on publicly available information.

Morgan Stanley reviewed the recent stock price
performance of PayPal and eBay in terms of:

 

stock price performance since February 15,
    2002, the date PayPal became public;

 

exchange ratio implied by the value of PayPal
    common stock and eBay common stock since February 15, 2002
    and average over the same period; and



 

implied premium at fixed exchange ratio of 0.39
    shares of eBay common stock for each share of PayPal common
    stock since February 15, 2002

Precedent Transaction
    Analysis

Morgan Stanley performed an analysis of thirteen
precedent transactions involving cash processing/payment
services companies with announced deal values of over
$50 million since January 1, 1998 (the Precedent
Transactions) that shared characteristics with the merger
to compare the multiple of projected earnings/ growth and the
implied premium over previous day stock price indicated by the
merger consideration to the same multiple and premia indicated
for the Precedent Transactions. For each transaction, the
acquired companys estimated earnings per share was based
on IBES estimates of its earnings per share prior to
announcement of the transaction.

The thirteen transactions constituting the
Precedent Transactions were:

No company or transaction used in the comparable
transaction analyses is identical to PayPal or the merger.
Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the foregoing
necessarily involves complex considerations and judgments
concerning financial and operating characteristics of PayPal and
other factors that could affect the public trading value of the
companies to which they are being compared. Mathematical
analysis, such as determining the average or median, is not in
itself a meaningful method of using comparable transaction data
or comparable company data.

In connection with the review of the acquisition
by PayPals board of directors, Morgan Stanley performed a
variety of financial and comparative analyses for the purpose of
rendering its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is
a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a
partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its
opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its
analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight
to any particular analysis or factor considered by it.
Furthermore, Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion
of its analyses, without considering all of its analyses, would
create an incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses
and the opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have deemed
various assumptions more or less probable than other
assumptions, so that the ranges of valuations resulting from any
particular analysis described above should not be taken to be
Morgan Stanleys view of the actual value of PayPal or eBay.

In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made
numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance,
general business and economic conditions and other matters, many
of which are beyond the control of PayPal or eBay. Any estimates
contained in the analyses performed by Morgan Stanley are not



necessarily indicative of future results or
actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable
than those suggested by such estimates.

Such analyses were prepared solely as a part of
Morgan Stanleys analysis of the fairness from a financial
point of view to the holders of shares of PayPal common stock of
the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement and were
provided to the PayPal board of directors in connection with the
delivery of the Morgan Stanley opinion. The analyses do not
purport to be appraisals of value or to reflect the prices at
which PayPal or eBay might actually trade. In addition, as
described above, the Morgan Stanley opinion was one of the many
factors taken into consideration by the PayPal board of
directors in making its determination to approve the merger
agreement. The consideration to be paid to holders of shares of
PayPal common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was
determined through arms-length negotiations between PayPal
and eBay and was approved by the PayPal board of directors.
Morgan Stanley did not recommend any specific consideration to
PayPal or advise that any given consideration constituted the
only appropriate consideration for the acquisition.
Consequently, the Morgan Stanley analyses as described above
should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the
PayPal board of directors with respect to the value of PayPal or
of whether the PayPal board of directors would have been willing
to agree to different consideration.

Morgan Stanley is an internationally recognized
investment banking and advisory firm. Morgan Stanley, as part of
its investment banking business, is continuously engaged in the
valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive
biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted
securities, private placements and valuations for corporate,
estate and other purposes. In the past, Morgan Stanley and its
affiliates have provided financial advisory services for PayPal
and have provided financial advisory and financing services for
eBay and have received fees for the rendering of such services.
In addition, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates may from time to
time act as a counter-party to either PayPal or eBay and may
have received compensation for such activities. In the ordinary
course of its business, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates may,
from time to time, trade in the securities and indebtedness of
PayPal or eBay for its own accounts or the account of investment
funds and other clients under the management of Morgan Stanley
and for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at
any time hold a long or short position in such securities or
indebtedness for any such account.

Pursuant to a letter agreement dated as of
April 7, 2002, Morgan Stanley was formally retained to
provide advice to PayPals board of directors with regard
to a potential transaction between PayPal and eBay. On
July 3, 2002, PayPal informed Morgan Stanley about the new
potential transaction and the parties agreed to continue the
engagement of Morgan Stanley under the terms of the
April 7, 2002 letter agreement to meet with PayPals
board of directors and provide a financial opinion in connection
with any agreement reached between PayPal and eBay. PayPal
agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a fee of $1,600,000 at the time
such opinion was delivered.

PayPal also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley
for expenses incurred by Morgan Stanley in performing its
services. In addition, PayPal has also agreed to indemnify
Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, their respective directors,
officers, agents and employees and each person, if any,
controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against
certain liabilities and expenses, including liabilities under
the federal securities laws, related to or arising out of Morgan
Stanleys engagement and any related transactions.

eBays Reasons for the Merger

eBay believes that its proposed acquisition of
PayPal is a natural extension of eBays trading platform
and supports its mission to create an efficient global online
marketplace. eBay is acquiring PayPal for the following reasons:

To create an overall better experience for
    eBays users:

 

Ease of Use: The acquisition is intended to
    result in a simpler and less confusing purchasing process for
    buyers and sellers;



 

Transaction Velocity: A better electronic payment
    solution is expected to increase the percentage of eBay
    transactions completed electronically which should result in
    faster payments to sellers and faster receipt of goods by
    buyers; and

 

Safety: Improved fraud detection and prevention
    for buyers and sellers using PayPal and eBay is intended to make
    eBay safer and more attractive to buyers.

An easier, faster, safer experience on eBay
should make eBay more attractive for both buyers and sellers,
which we expect to result in more transactions, revenue and
income.

To continue to grow the reach of the
    combined company outside of eBay:

 

PayPals non-eBay transactions represent the
    fastest growing portion of PayPal; and

 

Anticipated continued growth of business off-eBay
    will allow eBay to participate in and market to other areas of
    e-commerce.

To minimize losses and increase
    profits:

 

Reduce eBays cost of billing and bad debt
    for its own services;

 

Reduce overlapping costs, including those
    associated with Billpoint; and

 

Reduce payouts for eBays buyer protection
    programs because of better fraud protection.

Material Federal Income Tax
Consequences

In the opinion of Sullivan & Cromwell and in
the opinion of Kirkland & Ellis, the following are the
material United States federal income tax considerations of the
merger generally applicable to PayPal stockholders. These
opinions and the following discussion are based on and subject
to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code,
the regulations promulgated under the Code, existing
interpretations and court decisions, all of which are subject to
change, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change could
affect the continuing validity of the discussion. This
discussion does not address all aspects of United States federal
income taxation that may be important to you in light of your
particular circumstances or if you are subject to special rules,
such as rules relating to:

 

stockholders who are not United States persons;

 

financial institutions;

 

tax exempt organizations;

 

insurance companies;

 

dealers in securities;

 

traders in securities that elect to use a
    mark-to-market method of accounting;

 

stockholders who acquired their shares of PayPal
    common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options
    or otherwise acquired shares as compensation; and

 

stockholders who hold their shares of PayPal
    common stock as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk
    reduction, constructive sale or conversion transaction.

This discussion assumes you hold your shares of
PayPal common stock as capital assets within the meaning of
Section 1221 of the Code.

It is intended that the merger shall qualify as a
reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of
the Code. eBays and PayPals obligations to complete
the merger are conditioned on, among other things, eBays
receipt of an opinion from Sullivan & Cromwell and
PayPals receipt of an opinion from Kirkland & Ellis,
each dated the closing date, to the effect that, on the basis of
the facts, representations and assumptions set forth in the
opinions, the merger will be treated for federal income tax
purposes as a



reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and that each of eBay, Vaquita
Acquisition Corp. and PayPal will be a party to that
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the
Code. The opinions of counsel will be based on the then-existing
law, will assume the absence of changes in existing facts, will
rely on customary assumptions and may rely on representations
contained in certificates executed by officers of eBay and
PayPal. The opinions neither bind the Internal Revenue Service,
nor preclude them from adopting a contrary position, and it is
possible that they may successfully assert a contrary position
in litigation or other proceedings. Neither eBay nor PayPal
intends to obtain a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service
with respect to the tax consequences of the merger.

In the opinion of Sullivan & Cromwell
and in the opinion of Kirkland & Ellis, assuming that
the merger is consummated in accordance with the terms of the
merger agreement and as described in this proxy statement/
prospectus and that the assumptions and representations
described in the preceding paragraph are true and complete as of
the effective date, the merger will be treated for federal
income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and that each of eBay, Vaquita
Acquisition Corp. and PayPal will be a party to that
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the
Code. The following discussion assumes that the merger will be
treated accordingly.

Tax Implications to PayPals
    Stockholders

If you are a holder of PayPal common stock, your
exchange of PayPal common stock for eBay common stock will have
the following consequences to you:

 

Except as discussed below with respect to cash
    received in lieu of fractional shares, you will not recognize
    gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes when
    you exchange your PayPal common stock solely for eBay common
    stock pursuant to the merger.

 

The aggregate tax basis of the eBay common stock
    you receive as a result of the merger will be the same as your
    aggregate tax basis in PayPal common stock you surrender in
    exchange for the eBay common stock, decreased by any amount of
    such tax basis that is allocable to a fractional share interest
    in PayPal common stock for which you receive cash instead of a
    fractional share of eBay common stock.

 

The holding period of the eBay common stock you
    receive as a result of the exchange will include the holding
    period of PayPal common stock you exchange in the merger.

 

If you receive cash in the merger instead of a
    fractional share interest in eBay common stock, you will be
    treated as having received the cash in redemption of the
    fractional share interest. Assuming that, immediately after the
    merger, you hold a minimal interest in eBay, you exercise no
    control over eBay and, as a result of the deemed redemption and
    after giving effect to certain constructive ownership rules, you
    experience an actual reduction in your interest in eBay, you
    will recognize capital gain or loss on the deemed redemption in
    an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash
    received and your adjusted tax basis allocable to such
    fractional share. Otherwise, the cash payment may be taxable to
    you as a dividend. Any capital gain or loss will be long-term
    capital gain or loss if you have held your shares of PayPal
    common stock for more than one year at the time the merger is
    completed. Long-term capital gain of a non-corporate
    U.S. stockholder is generally subject to a maximum rate of
    20%.

Tax Implications to eBay, PayPal and
    Vaquita Acquisition Corp.

None of eBay, PayPal or Vaquita Acquisition Corp.
will recognize gain or loss for United States federal income tax
purposes as a result of the merger.

The foregoing discussion is not intended to be
a complete analysis or description of all potential United
States federal income tax consequences of the merger. In
addition, the discussion does not address tax consequences which
may vary with, or are contingent on, your individual
circumstances. Moreover, the discussion does not address any
non-income tax or any foreign, state or local tax consequences
of the merger. Accordingly, you are strongly urged to consult
with your tax advisor to



determine the particular United States
federal, state, local or foreign income or other tax
consequences to you of the merger.

Accounting Treatment for the Merger

In accordance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles, eBay will account for the merger
using the purchase method of accounting.

Regulatory Matters

Antitrust Approvals

The Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
of 1976, as amended, or the HSR Act, and the rules and
regulations thereunder, provide that certain merger
transactions, including the merger, may not be consummated until
required information and materials have been furnished to the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, and
the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, and certain waiting
periods have expired or been terminated.

On July 18, 2002, eBay and PayPal filed
their respective Pre-Merger Notification and Report Forms with
the DOJ and the FTC under the HSR Act. Early termination of the
required waiting period was granted on August 19, 2002.

On August 1, 2002, pursuant to
Germanys Act against Restraints of Competition, eBay and
PayPal jointly notified the German Federal Cartel Office of the
proposed merger. The Act against Restraints of Competition and
the rules and regulations thereunder provide that certain merger
transactions, including the merger, may not be consummated until
required information and materials have been furnished to the
German Federal Cartel Office and a 30-day review period has
expired or voluntarily been terminated prior to the expiration
of the 30-day review period by the Federal Cartel Office as
permitted under applicable German law. Voluntary termination of
the review period was granted on August 21, 2002. eBay and
PayPal are also required to make antitrust filings in Brazil.
Antitrust clearance in Brazil is not required before the
completion of the merger. On July 26, 2002, eBay and PayPal
jointly notified the Brazilian antitrust authorities.

At any time before or after the merger, the DOJ,
FTC or other national antitrust agencies could take such action
under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in
the public interest, including the DOJ, FTC or other national
antitrust agencies seeking changes or restrictions in the
operations of any of the assets or businesses of eBay or PayPal
or their affiliates. Private parties and state attorneys general
may also bring an action under the antitrust laws under certain
circumstances. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the
merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a
challenge is made, that it would not be successful.

Other Regulatory Approvals

eBay is required to make filings under applicable
money transmitter laws in the States of Arizona, Maryland and
Vermont and the District of Columbia and to obtain required
approvals in those jurisdictions prior to the completion of the
merger. Prior filings by eBay and the necessary approvals are
also required in other states in which PayPal is seeking to
obtain money transmitter licenses if such licenses are granted
before the completion of the merger. eBay and PayPal will also
make similar filings in other jurisdictions if filings in those
jurisdictions are required.

The merger is conditioned on all filings required
to be made prior to the effective time of the merger by eBay and
PayPal, or any of their respective subsidiaries, and all
consents, registrations, approvals and authorizations required
to be obtained prior to the effective time of the merger by eBay
and PayPal or any of their respective subsidiaries from, any
governmental entity in connection with the execution and
delivery of the merger agreement and the completion of the
merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement by eBay, PayPal and Vaquita Acquisition Corp. having
been made or obtained, except that this condition will be deemed
to have been satisfied unless the failure to make such notices,
reports



and other filings or obtain such consents,
registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations,
individually or in the aggregate, has had, or is reasonably
likely to have, a material adverse effect on eBay or PayPal.

Federal Securities Laws Consequences

All shares of eBay common stock received by
PayPal stockholders in the merger who are not affiliates of
PayPal prior to the merger will be freely transferable. However,
shares of eBay common stock received by persons who are deemed
to be affiliates of PayPal prior to the merger may be resold by
them only in transactions permitted by the resale provisions of
Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933, or Rule 144
promulgated under the Securities Act in the case of such persons
who become affiliates of eBay, or as otherwise permitted under
the Securities Act. Persons deemed to be affiliates of PayPal
are those individuals or entities that control, are controlled
by, or are under common control with, PayPal. Affiliates
generally include executive officers and directors of PayPal as
well as certain principal stockholders of PayPal. This proxy
statement/prospectus does not cover any resales of eBay common
stock received by affiliates of PayPal in the merger.

Nasdaq National Market Listing

The shares of eBay common stock to be issued in
the merger will be quoted on the Nasdaq National Market. If we
complete the merger, PayPal common stock will no longer be
registered under the Exchange Act or quoted on the Nasdaq
National Market.

No Appraisal Rights

In accordance with Section 262 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law, no appraisal rights are
available to PayPal stockholders in connection with the merger.

Litigation Related to the Merger

Three purported class action complaints have been
filed in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware in and
for New Castle County by alleged stockholders of PayPal. Two
additional purported class action complaints have been filed in
the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa
Clara by alleged PayPal stockholders. These complaints name as
defendants PayPal and each member of its board of directors as
well as eBay. The complaints are purported class actions that
allege, among other things, that eBay controls PayPal, the
defendants have breached fiduciary duties they assertedly owed
to PayPals stockholders in connection with PayPal entering
into the merger agreement and the exchange ratio is unfair and
inadequate. The plaintiffs in each lawsuit seek, among other
things, an injunction against the consummation of the merger and
an award of unspecified compensatory damages. We believe that
each of the lawsuits is without merit and intend to defend
ourselves vigorously.

Executives; Executive Compensation;

Stock Ownership of Directors, Executive
Officers and Five Percent Stockholders

Information concerning current directors and
officers of eBay, executive compensation and ownership of eBay
common stock by eBays management and principal
stockholders is contained in eBays Annual Report on
Form 10-K as of December 31, 2001, including the
information incorporated by reference from eBays
definitive proxy statement relating to eBays 2002 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders, and is incorporated herein by
reference. See Where You Can Find More Information
on page 165.

Information concerning current directors and
executive officers of PayPal, executive compensation, certain
relationships and related transactions and ownership of PayPal
common stock by PayPals management and principal
stockholders is discussed below in Information About
PayPal on page 98.



Interests of Certain Persons in the
Merger

In considering the recommendations of
PayPals board of directors with respect to the merger, you
should be aware that certain executive officers and members of
the board of directors of PayPal have agreements or arrangements
that provide them with interests in the merger that may be
different from, or in addition to, the interests of the other
stockholders of PayPal. PayPals board of directors was
aware of these agreements during its deliberations of the merits
of the merger and in determining to recommend to PayPal
stockholders that they vote for the proposal to approve and
adopt the merger agreement and the merger.

Common Stock

As of August 28, 2002, the record date of
the special meeting, the executive officers and directors of
PayPal and their affiliates beneficially owned an aggregate of
22,482,091 shares, or 36.5%, of outstanding PayPal common
stock, which will be treated in the merger in the same manner as
shares of PayPal common stock held by other stockholders of
PayPal.

eBay Employment Agreements

In connection with the merger agreement, eBay and
PayPal entered into employment agreements with each of
Peter A. Thiel, Max R. Levchin, David O. Sacks,
Roelof F. Botha, John Muller and Ryan Downs, who are all
PayPal executives. For a discussion of these employment
agreements, see Other Material Agreements Relating to the
Merger  eBay Employment Agreements on
page 96.

PayPals Stock Options and Performance
Awards

When the merger occurs, the vesting of all
outstanding options issued pursuant to PayPals 1999 Stock
Plan, 2001 Equity Incentive Plan and the Confinity 1999 Stock
Plan will accelerate. The number of shares which accelerate and
vest immediately upon the occurrence of the merger will be the
lesser of (1) 25% of the total number of shares subject to
an option or restricted stock grant or (2) the remaining
unvested options or shares of restricted stock.

The following table shows the number of shares of
PayPal common stock subject to outstanding options and the
number of shares of restricted stock in each case held by PayPal
executive officers and directors whose exercisability, in the
case of options, and vesting, in the case of restricted stock,
will accelerate as a result of the merger. PayPals
executive officers and directors also hold in the aggregate
options to purchase 543,599 shares of PayPal common stock
that are currently vested and exercisable. At the effective time
of the merger, each outstanding PayPal stock option under
PayPals stock option plans will be deemed to constitute an
option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under the PayPal stock option, the number of shares
of eBay common stock equal to the number of shares of PayPal
common stock that were issuable upon exercise of the PayPal
stock option immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger multiplied by the exchange ratio (rounded down to the
nearest whole number), at a price per share (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price per share



at which the PayPal stock option was exercisable
immediately prior to the effective time divided by the exchange
ratio.

If the effective time of the merger had been
June 30, 2002, an option held by an executive officer or
director of PayPal to purchase 100 shares of PayPal common
stock at $1 per share would have been converted into an option
to purchase 39 shares of eBay common stock at
$2.5640 per share.

Outstanding Officer Loan

In April 2000, PayPal assumed a loan of $70,000
at an interest rate of 9% per annum payable by Roelof F.
Botha, PayPals Chief Executive Officer, to his former
employer. Mr. Botha has agreed to repay this loan as a
single payment in June 2004 or at such time as he ceases to be
an employee of PayPal, if sooner. PayPal forgave 25% of the loan
in June 2001, another 25% in June 2002, and has agreed to
forgive the remainder in 25% increments in June 2003 and June
2004. The merger will accelerate Mr. Bothas loan
forgiveness and when the merger occurs PayPal will forgive the
entire remaining amount of Mr. Bothas loan. If this
loan forgiveness would constitute a parachute
payment under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1968, the combined company will reimburse Mr. Botha
for the Federal excise taxes that are imposed as a result of the
loan forgiveness plus the additional taxes due on the
reimbursement.

Employee Benefits

Please refer to The Merger
Agreement  Effect on Benefit Plans on
page 89 for a discussion of the employee benefits to be
provided to PayPal employees, including any executive officers,
who remain at the combined company following the merger.



Stockholders Agreements

In connection with the merger agreement, eBay
entered into stockholders agreements with each of Peter A.
Thiel, Max R. Levchin, David O. Sacks and
Roelof F. Botha, Reid G. Hoffman, Elon R. Musk
and James E. Templeton, who are all PayPal executives. For
a discussion of these stockholders agreements, see Other
Material Agreements Relating to the Merger 
Stockholders Agreements on page 95.

Indemnification and Insurance

Pursuant to the merger agreement, eBay has agreed
that, after the effective time of the merger, it will provide
certain indemnification and liability insurance benefits to
present and former directors and officers of PayPal. See
The Merger Agreement  Indemnification and
Insurance on page 94.



The Merger Agreement

This section of the proxy statement/prospectus
describes the material provisions of the merger agreement.
Because the description of the merger agreement contained in
this proxy statement/prospectus is a summary, it does not
contain all of the information that may be important to you. You
should carefully read the entire copy of the merger agreement
attached as Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus,
which is hereby incorporated into this proxy
statement/prospectus by reference, before you decide how to vote.

Structure of the Merger

The merger agreement provides for the merger of
Vaquita Acquisition Corp., a newly-formed and wholly-owned
subsidiary of eBay, into PayPal. After the merger, PayPal will
become a wholly-owned subsidiary of eBay.

Completion and Effectiveness of the
Merger

We will complete the merger as promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than the fifth business day,
after the last of the conditions to completion are satisfied or
waived, or at such other time or date as PayPal and eBay may
agree in writing.

The merger will become effective at the time when
the certificate of merger has been filed with and accepted by
the Secretary of the State of Delaware. We anticipate that the
filing will be made simultaneously with, or as soon as
practicable after, the closing of the merger.

Conversion of PayPal Common Stock in the
Merger

Each share of PayPal common stock issued and
outstanding immediately before the effective time of the merger,
other than shares owned by eBay, Vaquita Acquisition Corp. or
any other direct or indirect subsidiary of eBay or shares that
are owned by PayPal or its direct or indirect subsidiaries that
in each case are not held on behalf of third parties, will
automatically convert into the right to receive 0.39 of a share
of eBay common stock. eBay will not issue any fractional shares.
Instead, you will receive a cash payment in accordance with the
terms of the merger agreement, as described below in
 Fractional Shares.

Exchange Procedures

Promptly after the effective time of the merger,
Mellon Investor Services LLC, the exchange agent for the merger,
will mail to you a letter of transmittal and instructions for
surrendering your PayPal stock certificates in exchange for eBay
stock certificates, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and
any unpaid dividends and distributions to which you are
entitled. When you surrender a PayPal stock certificate in the
manner provided in the merger agreement, you will be entitled to
receive a certificate representing the number of whole shares of
eBay common stock that you are entitled to receive, a check in
the amount, after giving effect to any required tax
withholdings, of any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any
unpaid dividends and distributions as contemplated by the merger
agreement. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender of the certificates.

You should not send stock certificates with
your proxy card and should not surrender stock certificates
prior to the adoption and approval of the merger agreement by
the stockholders of PayPal and the receipt of a transmittal
form.

Fractional Shares

Each PayPal stockholder who would otherwise have
been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of eBay common
stock will receive cash, without interest, in an amount equal to
such stockholders proportionate interest in the net
proceeds from the sale by the exchange agent on behalf of all
such



stockholders of the aggregate fractional shares
of eBay common stock that such stockholders otherwise would be
entitled to receive.

Dividends and Distributions

All shares of eBay common stock to be issued
pursuant to the merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as
of the effective time of the merger. Whenever a dividend or
other distribution is declared by eBay in respect of eBay common
stock, and the record date for the dividend or distribution is
on or after the date of the effective time of the merger, the
declaration will include such dividends or other distributions
in respect of all eBay common stock issued or issuable pursuant
to the merger agreement. No dividends or other distributions
with respect to eBay common stock will be paid to you if you do
not surrender your PayPal stock certificate.

Transfer of Ownership and Lost Stock
Certificates

If your PayPal stock certificate has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, you may need to deliver an affidavit or
bond prior to receiving your eBay stock certificate.

No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals by
PayPal

The merger agreement provides that neither PayPal
nor any of its subsidiaries nor any of the officers and
directors of PayPal or its subsidiaries will, and that it will
not authorize or knowingly permit its and its subsidiaries
employees, agents and representatives to directly or indirectly:

 

initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or
    facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer
    with respect to an acquisition proposal; and

 

engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide
    any confidential information or data to, or have any discussions
    with, any person relating to an acquisition proposal or
    otherwise entertain or knowingly facilitate any effort or
    attempt to make or implement an acquisition proposal.

Under the merger agreement, an acquisition
proposal is a merger, reorganization, share exchange,
consolidation or similar transaction involving, or any purchase
of all or any material portion of the assets of, or 20% or more
of the equity securities in, PayPal or any of its subsidiaries.

The merger agreement does not prevent PayPal or
its board of directors or its officers, employees, agents or
representatives from complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act with regard to an acquisition proposal or
making any disclosure required by applicable law.

The merger agreement does not prevent PayPal or
its board of directors or its officers, employees, agents or
representatives from doing the following:

 

at any time prior, but not after, the
    stockholders meeting is convened, providing information in
    response to a request therefor by a person who has made an
    unsolicited bona fide written



acquisition proposal if the board of directors
    receives from the person requesting such information an executed
    confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar to
    those contained in the confidentiality agreement provided for in
    the merger agreement;

 

engaging in any negotiations or discussions with
    any person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written
    acquisition proposal; or

 

recommending such an acquisition proposal to the
    stockholders of PayPal;

if, in each case, PayPals board of
directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that such action is necessary in order
for its directors to comply with their fiduciary duties and the
board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisor, that the acquisition proposal is, or
is reasonably likely to result in, a superior proposal.

Under the merger agreement, a superior proposal
is an acquisition proposal that, if accepted, would be
reasonably likely to be completed, taking into account the
legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal, and
would, if completed, result in a transaction more favorable to
PayPals stockholders from a financial point of view than
the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement.

In addition, PayPal has agreed, pursuant to the
merger agreement, that it will:

 

immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
    existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
    parties conducted prior to July 7, 2002 with respect to any
    acquisition proposal;

 

take the necessary steps to promptly inform its
    subsidiaries and any officers or directors of PayPal or its
    subsidiaries of the obligations with respect to acquisition
    proposals and in the confidentiality agreement;

 

notify eBay immediately if any inquiries,
    proposals or offers are received by, any such information is
    requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to
    be initiated or continued with, any of its representatives
    indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such
    person and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or
    offers; and

 

promptly request each person that has prior to
    the date of the merger agreement executed a confidentiality
    agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring it
    or any of its subsidiaries to return or destroy all confidential
    information furnished to such person by or on behalf of it or
    any of its subsidiaries.

The merger agreement provides that PayPal will
take, in accordance with applicable law and its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, all action necessary to call, hold and
convene a meeting of holders of PayPal common stock as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the registration statement of
which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part is declared
effective to consider and vote upon the approval of the merger
agreement. Except on the determination of the occurrence of a
superior proposal and during such time as there remains a
superior proposal or as PayPals board of directors may
determine in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, in order to comply with its fiduciary duties
under applicable law, PayPals board of directors will
recommend such approval, PayPals board of directors will
not amend, modify, withdraw, condition or qualify such
recommendation and will take all lawful action to solicit such
approval. PayPal has agreed that it will provide eBay with at
least 48 hours prior notice of PayPals board of
directors intention to make any such amendment,
modification, withdrawal, condition or qualification, except
that such notice will not be required to the extent that
PayPals board of directors determines, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that such notice violates its
fiduciary duties or would cause PayPal to violate any applicable
law. PayPals obligation to convene the stockholders
meeting will not be limited or otherwise affected by the
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to it of
any acquisition proposal, or by any change of recommendation of
PayPals board of directors. The merger agreement provides
that PayPal will not submit to the vote of its stockholders any
acquisition proposal or propose to do so.



Effect on PayPal Stock Options

At the effective time of the merger, each
outstanding PayPal stock option under PayPals stock option
plans, whether vested or unvested, will be deemed to constitute
an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under the PayPal stock option, the number of shares
of eBay common stock equal to the number of shares of PayPal
common stock that were issuable upon exercise of the PayPal
stock option immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger multiplied by the exchange ratio (rounded down to the
nearest whole number), at a price per share (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price per share at
which the PayPal stock option was exercisable immediately prior
to the effective time divided by the exchange ratio.

However, in the case of any PayPal incentive
stock option, the option price, the number of shares purchasable
pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise
of such option will be determined in accordance with the merger
agreement, but are subject to adjustments necessary in order to
satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code.

Effective at the effective time of the merger,
eBay will assume each PayPal stock option in accordance with the
terms of the PayPal stock option plan under which it was issued
and the stock option agreement by which it is evidenced. As soon
as practicable after the effective time of the merger but in no
event later than seven days after the closing date, eBay will
file a registration statement on Form S-3 or Form S-8
with respect to the eBay common stock subject to the PayPal
stock options, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts
to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for
so long as the PayPal stock options remain outstanding.

Effect on PayPal Warrants

At the effective time of the merger, each
outstanding warrant issued by PayPal will be deemed to
constitute a warrant to acquire, on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under the PayPal warrant, the
number of shares of eBay common stock equal to the number of
shares of PayPal common stock that were issuable upon exercise
of the PayPal warrant immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger multiplied by the exchange ratio (rounded up to the
nearest whole number), at a price per share (rounded down to the
nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price per share at
which the PayPal warrant was exercisable immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger divided by the exchange ratio.

Effect on Benefit Plans

Subject to any necessary transition periods
(during which eBay will cause PayPal to maintain its applicable
existing welfare plans), from and after the effective time of
the merger, eBay will provide PayPal employees who become
employees of eBay or any of its subsidiaries or remain employees
of PayPal with employee welfare and pension benefits no less
favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of
eBay and its subsidiaries. In addition, eBay will cause each
employee welfare and pension benefit plan, program, policy or
arrangement of eBay in which employees of PayPal become eligible
to participate to take into account for purposes of eligibility
and vesting thereunder the service of such employees with PayPal
to the same extent as such service was credited for such purpose
by PayPal.

When employees of PayPal become eligible to
participate in a medical, dental or health plan of eBay, to the
extent permissible under such benefit plan, eBay will cause each
plan to waive any preexisting condition limitations to the
extent those conditions were covered under the applicable PayPal
benefit plan and waive any waiting period limitation or evidence
of insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable
to such employee on or after the effective time of the merger to
the extent such employee had satisfied any similar limitation or
requirement under an analogous PayPal benefit plan prior to the
effective time of the merger.



eBay has also agreed with PayPal to grant options
to purchase approximately 1.2 million shares of eBay common
stock to existing PayPal employees to encourage their continued
employment following the completion of the merger.

Waiver and Amendment of the Merger
Agreement

Subject to the provisions of the applicable law,
at any time prior to the effective time of the merger, the
parties to the merger agreement may modify or amend the merger
agreement, by written agreement executed and delivered by duly
authorized officers of the respective parties.

The conditions to each of the parties
obligations to consummate the merger are for the sole benefit of
such party and may be waived by such party in whole or in part
to the extent permitted by applicable law.

Affiliate Agreements

Prior to the date of the stockholders meeting,
eBay will deliver to PayPal a list of names and addresses of
those persons who are, in the opinion of eBay, as of the time of
the stockholders meeting, affiliates of PayPal
within the meaning of Rule 145 under the Securities Act.
PayPal will provide to eBay the information and documents as
eBay may reasonably request, for purposes of preparing such
list. PayPal will exercise its best efforts to deliver or cause
to be delivered to eBay, prior to the date of the stockholders
meeting, from each of the affiliates of PayPal identified, an
affiliates letter, dated as of the closing date.



Under the affiliates letter, eBay will be
entitled to place customary legends on the certificates
evidencing any eBay common stock to be received by these

Securities Act may apply to shares of eBay common stock to be
received by them in the merger.

Termination of the Merger Agreement

The merger agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the effective time of the merger, whether before
or after approval by stockholders of PayPal, by mutual written
consent of PayPal and eBay by action of their respective boards
of directors.

The merger agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the effective time of the merger, whether before
or after approval by stockholders of PayPal by action of either
the board of directors of eBay or PayPal if:

 

the merger has not been consummated by
    December 31, 2002, except that if either party determines
    that additional time is necessary in order to forestall any
    action to restrain, enjoin or prohibit the merger by any
    federal, state, local or foreign court or governmental entity
    with jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable antitrust
    laws, the termination date may be extended by such party to a
    date not beyond March 31, 2003, so long as the party
    seeking to terminate pursuant to the merger agreement has not
    breached in any material respect its obligations under the
    merger agreement in any manner that has proximately caused the
    occurrence of the failure of the merger to be consummated;

 

the approval of PayPals stockholders
    required by the merger agreement has not been obtained at a
    meeting convened therefor or at any adjournment or postponement
    thereof; or

 

any order permanently restraining, enjoining or
    otherwise prohibiting consummation of the merger becomes final
    and non-appealable.

If a party elects to extend the termination date
to March 31, 2003 as described above, then the other party
may deliver a written update of its disclosure letter within
three business days of such election to reflect new facts
occurring after the date of the merger agreement. The update may
be accompanied by a written request that the party electing to
extend the termination date confirm that such new facts will not
be deemed to render any of the non-extending partys
representations and warranties untrue or incorrect as of such
date or deemed to constitute a PayPal material adverse effect or
an eBay material adverse effect, as the case may be, as of such
date. If the party electing to extend the termination date does
not provide such confirmation prior to the fifth business day
after receiving such written update, then the termination date
may not be extended.

The merger agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the effective time of the merger, whether before
or after approval by PayPal stockholders, by action of the board
of directors of PayPal if there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by eBay or
Vaquita Acquisition Corp. in the merger agreement, or any such
representation and warranty becomes untrue after the date of the
merger agreement, such that certain conditions to closing of
PayPal would not be satisfied and such breach or condition is
not curable or, if curable, is not cured within 30 days
after written notice thereof is given by PayPal to eBay.

The merger agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the effective time of the merger, by action of the
board of directors of eBay, if:

 

the board of directors of PayPal has withdrawn or
    adversely modified its approval or recommendation of the merger
    agreement; or

 

there has been a breach of any representation,
    warranty, covenant or agreement made by PayPal in the merger
    agreement, or any such representation and warranty becomes
    untrue after the date of the merger agreement, such that certain
    conditions to closing of eBay would not be satisfied and



such breach or condition is not curable or, if
    curable, is not cured within 30 days after written notice
    thereof is given by eBay to PayPal.

Termination Fee and Expense
Reimbursement

PayPal has agreed to pay to eBay a termination
fee equal to $5,000,000 and to pay eBays charges and
expenses if the merger agreement is terminated by eBay after
PayPals board of directors has withdrawn or adversely
modified its approval or recommendation of the merger agreement
in the absence of an acquisition proposal. PayPal must pay the
termination fee to eBay no later than two days after the date of
the termination. In addition, PayPal must pay eBays
expenses and charges no later than two days after eBay notifies
PayPal of its expenses and charges.

PayPal has agreed to pay eBay a termination fee
equal to $45,000,000 and to pay eBays charges and expenses
if an acquisition proposal has been made to PayPal or any of its
subsidiaries or any of its stockholders or any person has
publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to
make any acquisition proposal with respect to PayPal or any of
its subsidiaries and thereafter the merger agreement is
terminated by either eBay or PayPal because

 

the merger has not been consummated by
    December 31, 2002 (or, if applicable, March 31, 2003),

 

the approval of PayPals stockholders has
    not been obtained at a meeting,

 

PayPals board of directors has withdrawn or
    adversely modified its approval or recommendation, or

 

there has been a breach of any representation,
    warranty, covenant or agreement made by PayPal in the merger
    agreement, or any such representation and warranty becomes
    untrue after the date of the merger agreement, such that certain
    conditions to closing of eBay would not be satisfied and such
    breach or condition is not curable or, if curable, is not cured
    within 30 days after written notice thereof is given by
    eBay to PayPal and

thereafter PayPal enters into any agreement to
consummate a transaction or series of transactions which, had
such agreement been proposed or negotiated during the term of
the merger agreement, would have constituted an acquisition
proposal, which is

 

publicly announced within 12 months after
    the termination of the merger agreement and

 

consummated within 18 months after the
    termination of the merger agreement,

whether or not such agreement related to an
acquisition proposal which had been made or announced at the
time of the termination of the merger agreement. PayPal must pay
the termination fee contemporaneously with completion of the
transactions contemplated by such agreement. PayPal must pay
eBays expenses or charges no later than two days after
eBay notifies PayPal of its expenses and charges.

Indemnification and Insurance

eBay has agreed that from and after the effective
time of the merger, it will indemnify and hold harmless each
present and former director and officer of PayPal, when acting
in such capacity, determined as of the effective time of the
merger, against any costs or expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees, judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages
or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing
or occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger.

However, any person to whom expenses are advanced
must provide an undertaking to repay such advance if it is
ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification. Generally, eBay is required to provide
indemnification to the fullest extent that PayPal would have
been permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law and
for all claims arising from or relating to the merger.

eBay has agreed, for six years after the
effective time of the merger, to maintain in effect
PayPals current officers and directors
insurance, subject to certain limitations.



Other Material Agreements Relating to the
Merger

Stockholders Agreements

Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery
of the merger agreement, eBay and certain PayPal stockholders
entered into stockholders agreements. Approximately 27.7% of the
outstanding shares of PayPal common stock are subject to the
stockholders agreements. We refer to these shares as the
subject PayPal shares.

The foregoing is a summary description of the
stockholders agreements. The stockholders agreements are
attached as Annex B and Annex C to this proxy
statement/ prospectus and are hereby incorporated by reference
into this proxy statement/ prospectus.

Agreement to Vote and Irrevocable
    Proxy

These PayPal stockholders have agreed to vote the
subject PayPal shares at the stockholders meeting:

 

in favor of the merger and the merger agreement
    and approval of the terms thereof;

 

against approval of any acquisition proposal or
    any acquisition agreement or similar agreement related to an
    acquisition proposal;

 

against any change in the persons who constitute
    the board of directors of PayPal that is not approved in advance
    by at least a majority of the persons who were directors of
    PayPal as of July 7, 2002; and

 

against any other action or proposal involving
    PayPal or any of its subsidiaries that is intended, or could
    reasonably be expected, to prevent, impede, interfere with,
    delay, postpone or adversely affect the transactions
    contemplated by the merger agreement.

These PayPal stockholders also granted to eBay an
irrevocable proxy and irrevocably appointed eBay such
stockholders attorney and proxy to vote the subject PayPal
shares with regard to any of the foregoing matters at the
stockholders meeting.

Transfer Restrictions

In addition, these PayPal stockholders agreed
that they would not, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit,
encourage or otherwise facilitate any inquiries or the making of
any acquisition proposal.

These PayPal stockholders also agreed to certain
restrictions on the transfer of their subject PayPal shares.

Under their stockholders agreement, subject to
certain exceptions, Reid G. Hoffman, Max R. Levchin, Elon Reeve
Musk, David O. Sacks, James E. Templeton and Peter A. Thiel may
not, without the prior written consent of eBay, during the
period commencing on July 7, 2002 and ending 30 days

stockholders subject PayPal shares or any shares of eBay
common stock received in exchange therefor in the merger, except
that each such stockholder may transfer:

 

up to one-half of such stockholders subject
    PayPal shares pursuant to, and in accordance with the
    requirements of, Rule 144 under the Securities Act from the
    later of the date of the meeting of stockholders of PayPal at
    which the stockholders of PayPal vote on the approval of the
    merger and the merger agreement and the terms thereof and
    November 13, 2002; and

 

up to one-half of the shares of eBay common stock
    issued in exchange for the subject PayPal shares held by such
    stockholder at the effective time of the merger from the
    effective time through and including the 30th day following the
    effective time of the merger.

Under their stockholders agreement, subject to
certain exceptions, Roelof F. Botha, Madison Dearborn Capital

Equity III, L.P., Nokia Ventures, LP,



Sequoia Capital IX, Sequoia Capital
Entrepreneurs Fund, Sequoia Capital IX Principals Fund and Thiel
Capital International, LLC may not, without the prior written
consent of eBay, during the period commencing on July 7,
2002 and ending 30 days after the effective time of the
merger, transfer any of such stockholders subject PayPal
shares or any shares of eBay common stock received in exchange
therefor in the merger, except that each such stockholder may
transfer up to one-half of the shares of common stock issued in
exchange for the subject PayPal shares held by such stockholder
at the effective time of the merger from the effective time
through and including the 30th day following the effective time
of the merger. As of July 7, 2002, these stockholders owned
an aggregate of approximately 6.9 million shares of PayPal

shares currently may be sold subject to applicable securities
laws. One or more of such stockholders has sold all or a portion
of such shares and PayPal anticipates that one or more of such
stockholders may sell or distribute all or a portion of any
remaining shares prior to the effective time of the merger.

be eligible to participate in various employee pension and
welfare benefit plans of eBay.

In the event that any payments under the
employment agreement, as a result of the merger, or otherwise
result in the executive being subject to the golden parachute
excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code,
eBay will make additional cash payments so that the executive
will be in the same after-tax position as if no excise tax had
been imposed, subject to certain limitations.

The employment agreements provide that the stock
options and restricted stock that are unvested and owned by each
executive on July 7, 2002 will vest on an accelerated
schedule:

 

If the executive remains employed throughout the
    term, then the executives stock options and restricted
    stock which are not vested at the end of the term will fully
    vest at the end of the term.

 

If the executive is terminated by eBay without
    cause prior to the end of the term or if the executive
    terminates the agreement with good reason prior to the end of
    the term, then the executives stock options and restricted
    stock which are not vested will fully vest at the time of such
    termination.

 

If the executive dies or eBay determines that a
    disability of the executive has occurred prior to the end of the
    term, then the executives stock options and restricted
    stock owned will fully vest on that date.



If the executive is terminated for cause, then
the executive will not receive accelerated vesting of any of his
stock options or restricted stock.

Under the employment agreements,
cause means the commission by the executive of a
felony involving fraud or an act of dishonesty against eBay or
PayPal which adversely affects eBay or PayPal in a material way,
subject to various exceptions.

Under the employment agreements, good
reason means:

 

the assignment to the executive of duties that
    are materially inconsistent with the executives title,
    position, authority, duties or responsibilities, as contemplated
    by the employment agreement, without the consent of the
    executive;

 

the failure of eBay to comply with its
    obligations with respect to the executives compensation
    and benefits, without the consent of the executive; or

 

a requirement that the executive be based
    anywhere more than 35 miles from the executives
    principal place of employment, as specified in the employment
    agreement, without the consent of the executive.

Each executive has agreed that between the date
of the agreement and two and one-half years after the effective
time of the merger, the executive may not own a 5% or greater
interest or be involved in any business enterprise that is
primarily engaged in the business of providing online
person-to-person payment services.



Information About PayPal

Business

Overview

PayPal enables any business or consumer with
email to send and receive online payments securely, conveniently
and cost-effectively. PayPals network builds on the
existing financial infrastructure of bank accounts and credit
cards to create a global payment system. PayPal delivers a
product well suited for small businesses, online merchants,
individuals and others.

PayPal seeks to become the global standard for
online payments. PayPal currently offers its account-based
system to users in 38 countries including the United States. For
the year ended December 31, 2001 and for the six months
ended June 30, 2002, PayPals payment volume sent to
business accounts, which PayPal refers to as Gross Merchant
Sales, or GMS, totaled $3.10 billion and
$2.76 billion. GMS equaled 87.9% and 89.8% of PayPals
total payment volume of $3.52 billion and
$3.08 billion for the same periods. PayPals GMS
consists mainly of payments to small businesses. Currently, the
majority of these payments relate to sales of goods and services
through online auctions. As of June 30, 2002, PayPal had
17.8 million accounts, including 3.7 million business
accounts and 14.1 million personal accounts. During the six
months ended June 30, 2002, 7.2 million of these
accounts sent or received a payment that resulted in a fee. As
of December 31, 2001, PayPal had 12.8 million total
accounts, of which 7.1 million sent or received a payment
that resulted in a fee during the year ended December 31,
2001.

To send a payment, a PayPal account holder enters
the email address of the recipient and the payment amount, and
selects a funding source  credit card, bank account
or PayPal balance. In addition, with PayPals Web Accept
feature, merchants can accept PayPal payments directly from
their websites. When a consumer who has not yet registered with
PayPal visits the website of a merchant that has integrated Web
Accept, the consumer can open a PayPal account from the
merchants site in order to make a purchase.

Payment recipients may use their funds to make
payments to others, leave the funds in their PayPal accounts and
earn a money market rate of return, or withdraw the funds at any
time by requesting a bank account transfer or a check delivered
by mail or by using the PayPal ATM/debit card. When a PayPal
sender makes an email payment to a recipient who does not yet
have a PayPal account, the recipient follows a link in the
payment notification email to register with PayPal and gain
access to the funds.

PayPal has achieved its rapid growth through a
combination of the push nature of email payments to
non-registered recipients and the pull nature of Web
Accept. During the six months ended June 30, 2002,
PayPals total number of accounts grew by 5.0 million,
an average of 28,000 per day, at an average total marketing
expense of $0.53 per new account, which includes an average
promotional bonus cost of $0.09 per new account. Due to seasonal
fluctuations and consistent with PayPals experience in
2001, the average number of accounts added per day during the
three months ended June 30, 2002, decreased as compared to
the three months ended March 31, 2002.

During the six months ended June 30, 2002,
PayPal processed an average of 306,000 payments per day
totaling $17.0 million in daily volume. The average payment
amount sent equaled $56.

Industry Overview

Growth of Online Commerce

Forrester Research projects consumer purchases on
the Internet to grow from an estimated $51.5 billion in
2001 to an estimated $195.0 billion in 2006. The emergence
of auction-based marketplaces, which provide small merchants and
consumers access to the global market, contribute significantly
to this growth. For example, eBay reported gross merchandise
sales of $6.5 billion for the six months ended
June 30, 2002, an increase of 54% over the comparable
period in 2001. Forrester projects continued robust growth in
total consumer auction sales  from an estimated
$8.4 billion in 2001 to $48.5 billion in 2006.



Legacy Payment Systems

Traditionally, consumers and businesses have
effected payments by delivering cash, paper checks or money
orders, by instituting wire transfers or by using credit cards.
According to The Nilson Report, an estimated $5.5 trillion in
consumer payments were made in the U.S. in 2001. Paper checks,
the most common method of settling commercial transactions,
comprised 41.1% of the total dollar value of commercial payments
in 2001. Credit card transactions represented 24.5% of the
total. Many small to mid-sized businesses wishing to conduct
transactions online may find these traditional payment methods
insecure, expensive or inconvenient.

Cash: 
Cash payments,
while effective for face-to-face low-value transactions, do not
function effectively for transactions in which the buyer and
seller are in different locations.

Checks: 
Both the
sender and the recipient of paper checks can find them costly
and inconvenient in terms of printing, mailing, delivering and
processing. In addition, checks settle slowly, as even after
delivery and deposit checks still can take several days to clear
and allow the recipient access to the funds.

Wire Transfer:

Individuals sending money overseas and
persons without bank accounts primarily use wire transferors and
money transmission services. These services often charge high
fees, particularly for low- and mid-value payments, and involve
inefficient methods of payment notification and receipt.

Credit Cards: 
Credit
cards accounted for approximately 98.5% of payment volume for
online transactions in 2000 according to ActivMedia. However,
many small and mid-sized businesses may find drawbacks to
accepting credit cards for online transactions. In order to
obtain a merchant agreement and accept credit cards online, many
merchants need to provide a personal guaranty, acquire
specialized hardware, prepare a loan application, establish
secure Internet connections and encrypt all customer credit card
data. In addition, the up-front and monthly fixed costs and the
relatively high variable processing costs at low volumes may
make credit cards prohibitively expensive for smaller merchants.
Fraud poses a major problem for online merchants, which bear
responsibility for fraudulent credit card payments. According to
Global Industry Analysts, online fraud accounted for
approximately 5% of total online transactions in 1999.

PayPals History

PayPal set out to develop a payment system
combining the pervasiveness of email with the existing financial
infrastructure  the Automated Clearing House, or ACH,
system, the credit card networks and the ATM/debit card
networks. PayPal launched its product in October 1999, offering
free email-driven, person-to-person payments. In order to
encourage growth, PayPal designed its system to allow senders to
pay people who did not yet have PayPal accounts. Every time a
PayPal user sent money to someone who had not joined the PayPal
network, the recipient received an email with a link to open a
PayPal account and claim his money. In this way, the user base
grew as a direct function of people using the PayPal system.
PayPal augmented this user-driven growth with various
promotional bonuses.

Recognizing that much of its payment volume
involved businesses, in June 2000 PayPal began charging fees to
its higher volume individual and commercial recipients by
launching business accounts. Unlike personal accounts, business
accounts may receive unlimited credit card funded payments and
also take advantage of e-commerce-enabling features such as Web
Accept, which allows merchants to receive payments directly from
their websites. A number of previous attempts to create new
payment mechanisms failed largely because of the chicken
and egg problem  consumers did not adopt the
mechanism because merchants did not accept it, and merchants
would not accept it because no consumers used it. PayPal solved
this problem by making it virtually costless for merchants to
sign up for accounts. A business only needed email and an
Internet connection. At the same time, PayPals growing
customer base encourages merchants to register simply by sending
them email payments.

For the six months ended June 30, 2002,
PayPal processed an average of 306,000 payments per day,
totaling $17.0 million in daily volume. PayPal has refined
its sign-up and referral bonus requirements to encourage its
customers to utilize the full range of its product, including
the ability to link a bank account



and to earn a money market rate of return on
their respective PayPal balances. As PayPal has grown its
customer base and added features to its product, it has
increased the prices charged to business accounts with no
noticeable adverse effect on GMS.

PayPal believes that its market exhibits network
characteristics, meaning that as the number of participants
within the PayPal network grows, the value of joining the
network grows as well.

The PayPal Product

PayPal enables any business or consumer with
email to send and receive online payments securely, conveniently
and cost-effectively. Its email-driven system builds on the
legacy financial infrastructure of bank accounts and credit
cards to create an online payment network available to users in
38 countries.

How PayPal Works

Joining the Network.

To send or receive a payment, a user
first must open a PayPal account. A new recipient opens an
account after receiving notification of a payment, and each new
sender opens an account in the process of making a payment,
either at the PayPal website or at the website of a merchant
that has integrated PayPals Web Accept feature. Allowing
new users to join the network at the time of making or receiving
payments encourages PayPals natural, user-driven growth.
PayPals fast and simple account sign-up process asks each
new user to register with PayPal his name, street address and
email address, which serves as the unique account identifier.

Making Payments.

Senders make payments at the PayPal
website or at the sites of merchants that have integrated
PayPals Web Accept feature. To make a payment at
PayPals website, a sender logs in to his account and
enters the recipients email address and the dollar amount
of the payment. To make a payment through Web Accept, a sender
selects an item for purchase, confirms the payment information
and enters his email address and password to authorize the
payment. In both scenarios, PayPal debits the money from the
senders PayPal balance, credit card or bank account and
instantly credits it to the recipients PayPal balance. In
turn, the recipient can make payments to others or withdraw his
funds at any time. PayPal earns revenues when a business account
receives a payment.

PayPal uses the terms balance and
PayPal balance to refer to funds that PayPal
customers choose either to invest in the PayPal Money Market
Fund (offered only to U.S. customers) or to authorize
PayPal to place in pooled bank accounts as agent for its
customers. These funds belong to the customers and hence are not
shown as an asset on PayPals balance sheet. Such funds are
available to the customer for immediate spending or withdrawal
through PayPal.

Funding Payments.

Senders fund payments in three ways:

 

from the senders existing PayPal balance;

 

from the senders bank account, using the
    Automated Clearing House, or ACH, network; or

 

from the senders credit card.

PayPal incurs no funding cost on payments made
from existing PayPal balances. PayPal incurs a cost of $0.01 for
each bank account ACH transfer. By contrast, on credit
card-funded payments, on average, PayPal incurs processing and
interchange fees of 1.9% of the payment amount plus $0.15 per
transaction. As a result, PayPal encourages its users to make
bank account-funded payments. To those users who choose to
maintain PayPal balances, PayPal offers a money market rate of
return on PayPal account balances placed in its affiliated Money
Market Fund, or the Fund. The Fund, which is managed by Barclays
Global Fund Advisors, bears a current compound annual yield of
1.92% as of June 30, 2002. For the six months ended
June 30, 2002, customers funded 22.7% of payment volume
through their existing PayPal balances, 30.4% via bank account
transfers and 46.9% by credit cards. While PayPal encourages
senders to make payments from bank account transfers or existing
PayPal balances, PayPal also welcomes and encourages senders to
register and use credit cards. Many senders prefer to fund
transactions using credit cards, and their participation in
PayPals user base increases the value of its payment
network. In



early 2002, PayPal began to permit users in the
Netherlands and Germany to fund their PayPal accounts directly
from their bank accounts.

Verification of PayPals Account Holders.

In order for senders to fund payments
from their bank accounts, they first must become verified PayPal
users through its Random Deposit technique for which PayPal has
applied for a patent: PayPal makes two deposits ranging from 1
to 99 cents to the users bank account. To verify
ownership of the account, the user then enters the two amounts
as a four-digit code at the PayPal website. In addition to
allowing funding via bank accounts, verification also removes
some spending limits on users accounts and gives them
reputational advantages when transacting with other members of
the PayPal community.

Withdrawing Money.

Each U.S.-based account holder may
withdraw money from his PayPal account via an ACH transfer to
his bank account or by a mailed check from PayPal. ACH
withdrawals may take three to five business days to arrive in
the account holders bank account, depending on the bank.
Mailed checks may take one to two weeks to arrive and PayPal
charges $1.50 per check. Qualifying PayPal users also can
receive a PayPal ATM/debit card, which provides instant
liquidity to their respective PayPal account balances. ATM/debit
card holders can withdraw cash, for a $1.00 fee per transaction,
from any ATM connected to the Cirrus or Maestro networks and can
make purchases at any merchant accepting MasterCard. For the six
months ended June 30, 2002, PayPal earned revenues net of
cash back payments of approximately 0.8% on PayPal ATM/debit
card transactions.

In September 2001, PayPal launched its new
virtual debit card feature called Shop Anywhere. Shop Anywhere
allows PayPal users to make purchases up to $150 per day using
their PayPal balances at any online merchant accepting
MasterCard.

Timing of Payments and
    Withdrawals

The time it takes for a sender to complete a
transaction using PayPal and for a recipient to have use of the
transferred funds depends on the senders funding source
for the payment and the recipients choice regarding use of
the funds he or she receives. The sender can fund a payment from
one of three sources: an existing PayPal balance, a credit card
or, for U.S. customers, a bank account. If the sender funds
the payment in full using a pre-existing PayPal balance, PayPal
instantly debits the amount specified by the sender from the
senders balance and simultaneously credits that amount,
less any applicable fees, to the recipients PayPal
balance. If the sender instead funds the payment in part or in
full using a credit card, PayPal credits the amount of the
payment, less any fees, to the recipients account as soon
as PayPal receives information from the applicable credit card
network that the senders payment is authorized, which
usually takes a few seconds. Similarly, if the sender has
registered both a primary bank account and an alternate funding
source with PayPal and qualifies for PayPals Instant
Transfer feature, PayPal will credit the recipients
account instantly. PayPal will concurrently initiate a debit to
the senders primary



bank account through the ACH network. The only
type of payment in which PayPal does not credit funds instantly
to the recipient occurs if the sender chooses to use bank
account funding but does not qualify for, or elects not to use,
Instant Transfer. In these eCheck payments, PayPal
will initiate a debit to the senders bank account through
the ACH network, and will notify the recipient immediately that
the sender has initiated payment, but will credit funds to the
recipients account only after the debit has been
completed, which usually takes three to four business days.

Once the funds have been credited to the
recipients account, the recipient can leave the funds in
the PayPal system or can at any time initiate a withdrawal. The
customer can withdraw funds either by ACH transfer to his or her
bank account, if the customer is in the U.S. or one of 16 other
countries, or by check for U.S. customers. Recipients who are
U.S. customers can also immediately spend up to $150 per day
from their PayPal balance at online sellers that accept
MasterCard, using PayPals Shop Anywhere feature.
U.S. recipients who have a business account may also be
eligible for the PayPal ATM/debit card, which can be used to
spend PayPal balances at online sellers and physical retail
locations that accept MasterCard and withdraw cash at ATMs.

If the recipient initiates a withdrawal by ACH
transfer, he or she will typically receive the funds in his or
her bank account within four business days, or five business
days in the 16 countries outside the U.S. where PayPal offers
withdrawals to local bank accounts. If the recipient initiates a
withdrawal by check, PayPal will send a request on the following
business day to its processing bank to issue and send the check
through the U.S. mail, but the time needed for the recipient to
receive the check will depend on the speed of mail delivery and
the recipients geographic location. The full process from
initiation of a check withdrawal request to receipt of the check
by the customer can take up to two weeks. Even after the
customer has received the check, he or she will need either to
cash the check or deposit it in his or her bank. If he or she
deposits the check in the bank, depending on the customers
location, the bank may take up to five additional days to credit
the customers account with the funds.

Users may also add funds to their PayPal accounts
without making a payment. This is not possible by credit card,
but only by ACH transfer from a bank account, which generally
takes three to four business days to complete.

The following tables summarize the timing of
payments and withdrawals.

Business Accounts.

PayPals customers choose either
PayPal business accounts or PayPal personal accounts. Gross
Merchant Sales, or GMS, equals the total dollar volume of
payments sent to business accounts. Business accounts pay PayPal
transaction fees on all payments they receive. Since
July 14, 2001, PayPals per transaction rate varied
according to the following schedule: 2.2% of the GMS payment
amount plus $0.30 per transaction for merchants in good standing
receiving an average of at least $1,000



per month in payments; 2.9% of the GMS payment
amount plus $0.30 per transaction for merchants receiving an
average of less than $1,000 per month in payments; and from 3.4%
to 3.9% of the GMS payment amount plus $0.30 per transaction for
higher risk accounts.

Business accounts benefit from a number of
additional features:

 

the right to receive credit card-funded payments;

 

the ability to apply for the PayPal ATM/debit
    card;

 

the right to list on PayPal Shops, a searchable
    directory of approximately 28,000 online businesses that accept
    PayPal;

 

PayPals Web Accept feature, which enables
    businesses to accept payments directly from their websites;

 

the PayPal shopping cart feature, which allows a
    business accounts customers to purchase multiple items
    with a single payment; and

 

subscriptions, allowing businesses to receive
    regularly scheduled payments.

As of June 30, 2002, PayPal had
approximately 3.1 million accounts designated as
premier and approximately 500,000 accounts
designated as business.

Personal Accounts.

PayPal personal accounts allow users
to make and receive online payments, except that personal
accounts may not receive credit card-funded payments. Personal
accounts can upgrade to business accounts at any time and
thereby avail themselves of all the benefits of a business
account, including the ability to receive credit card-funded
payments. During the six months ended June 30, 2002,
717,000 customers upgraded from personal to business
accounts.

International Accounts.

PayPal currently allows residents of
37 foreign countries to open PayPal accounts. These
international senders make payments through credit cards, from
their PayPal account balances, or in the case of Germany and the
Netherlands, from their bank accounts via electronic bank funds
transfers. International recipients may withdraw money from
their PayPal accounts to a U.S. bank account free of charge. In
addition, international recipients in sixteen countries can make
electronic funds transfer withdrawals to their local bank
accounts. PayPal charges a per-item transaction fee plus a
markup on foreign exchange conversions. These fees vary across
the various countries to which PayPal offers these services. As
of June 30, 2002, the per-item transaction fee across all
countries was approximately $1.00 per withdrawal and the markup
was approximately 3.1% of the withdrawal amount. Towards the end
of the first quarter of 2002, PayPal began charging an
additional 1% fee to recipients of cross-border payments rather
than charging fees to international senders. As of June 30,
2002, PayPal had 1.8 million international accounts,
compared with 1.0 million as of December 31, 2001.
PayPal intends to develop multi-currency functionality in 2002,
which will enable international users in some countries to hold
balances in their local currencies.

Security and Privacy

PayPal users choose a unique password to protect
their accounts. To make payments, senders need to disclose only
their email addresses to recipients. Similarly, to receive
payments, recipients need to disclose



only their email addresses to senders. Many
buyers and sellers wary of disclosing financial information
online find this high level of personal privacy attractive. See
 Technology.

PayPals Strategy

PayPal seeks to become the online payment network
of choice around the world. To establish itself as the online
payment standard, PayPal will continue to identify transactions
and markets not served adequately by existing payment systems
and to develop product features that improve upon those legacy
systems. In addition to growing its customer base, PayPals
business strategy includes the following:

Expand Small Business Payment Volume.

PayPal intends to continue to develop
features to spur its growth as a payment vehicle for small
businesses. During the past year, PayPal added features such as
a PayPal shopping cart, which allows buyers to make a single
payment for multiple items from a merchants website,
PayPal Shops, a directory of approximately 28,000 businesses
that accept PayPal, a reputation system to give buyers
information on the integrity of businesses, and a subscription
feature, allowing recurring payments for digital content.

Strengthen PayPals Position as the
Payment Method of Choice on Online Auctions.

PayPal has become a popular payment
network for online auction websites, including eBay, partially
due to the size of PayPals network and widening acceptance
of PayPals product. PayPal intends to strengthen its
position in the auction business by continuing to add product
features important to auction participants. During the past
year, PayPal added features such as automated invoicing, bidder
notification emails, automatic PayPal logo insertion into
auction listings and the ability for auction sellers to accept
payments directly from their auction pages. In addition, in June
2002 PayPal announced a partnership with United Parcel Service
Inc., or UPS, to integrate UPS shipping capability into the
PayPal interface, allowing auction sellers to ship merchandise
to winning bidders more conveniently. In July 2002 PayPal
announced a partnership with Stamps.com that will allow PayPal
users to buy and print U.S. Postal Service postage online from
their PayPal account. These initiatives will allow auction
sellers to ship merchandise to winners more conveniently.

Expand Recurring Revenue.

PayPals growing installed user
base provides it with recurring revenue. PayPal intends to
expand this revenue by continuing to enhance the product
features PayPal offers its current customers.

Increase Volume of International Payments.

PayPal plans to grow its international
volume by adding product features designed to increase
international access to its network and enhance its
functionality. PayPal intends to expand PayPals reach
beyond the current 38 countries. PayPal plans to increase the
number of foreign countries where users can withdraw funds to
their local bank accounts. PayPal also is developing a
multi-currency platform to enable international users to
transact in local currencies.

Maintain Low Variable Costs, Particularly
Transaction Losses. 
PayPals
relatively low variable operating costs and high per transaction
revenue creates an attractive profit opportunity as PayPal grows
its volume. Risk management represents a critical component of
maintaining low variable operating costs.

Grow PayPal ATM/ Debit Card Usage.

The PayPal ATM/debit card allows
selected PayPal account holders to access their account balances
from any ATM connected to the Cirrus or Maestro networks and to
make purchases from any merchant that accepts MasterCard. PayPal
earns a transaction fee whenever its customers make debit card
purchases or withdraw money from an ATM using this card. For the
six months ended June 30, 2002, 17.2% of the funds leaving
the PayPal system were withdrawn using the PayPal ATM/debit
card. PayPal intends to increase its ATM/debit card volume by
further broadening its distribution to qualified PayPal account
holders.



PayPals Customers

Customer Activity and Concentration

During the six months ended June 30, 2002:

 

2.1 million unique PayPal accounts received
    at least one payment;

 

7.3 million unique PayPal accounts sent at
    least one payment; and

 

7.7 million unique PayPal accounts sent or
    received at least one payment, of which 7.2 million, or
    93.1%, sent or received a payment that resulted in a fee.

For the six months ended June 30, 2002,
PayPals top 100 customers in terms of payment volume
received accounted for 7.4% of its total payment volume
received. For the same period, PayPals top 100 customers
in terms of payment volume sent accounted for 4.0% of its total
payment volume sent.

Online Auctions

PayPal has emerged as a method of choice for many
small and medium-sized businesses to receive payments for
auctions on eBay.

For the six months ended June 30, 2002,
PayPals customers identified to it approximately 59.8% of
its payment volume as settlements from online auction
transactions, and 40.2% as non-auction related. During 2001,
PayPals percentage of auction-related payment volume
decreased as it continued to diversify and its
non-auction-related business grew more rapidly than did its
auction-related business. The following table sets forth

Business Customers

In addition to online auction commerce,
PayPals business accounts conduct a wide variety of
commercial transactions using PayPal, including the sale of
goods online such as electronics and household items, the sale
of services online such as web design and travel, and the sale
of digital content. Offline businesses, including lawyers,
contractors and physicians, also receive payments online through
PayPal.



Personal Customers

PayPals personal accounts primarily use
PayPal to make payments to businesses for goods and services.
PayPal also enables person-to-person payments,
examples of which include roommates sharing living expenses,
parents sending money to children, friends sharing travel
expenses and purchases from small-scale, infrequent online
auction sellers.

least one international account, as compared to 17.2% for the
three months ended December 31, 2001. PayPal is developing
a multi-currency platform to enable international users to
transact in local currencies, initially euros, British pounds
and Canadian dollars.

Currently, residents of 38 countries have access
to the PayPal network. As of June 30, 2002, PayPals
largest markets outside the U.S. included 547,000 accounts in
Canada, 423,000 accounts in the United Kingdom, 134,000 accounts
in Australia, 108,000 accounts in Germany, 48,000 accounts in
the Netherlands, and 40,000 accounts in Japan.

Higher Risk Accounts

PayPal classifies merchants in industries that
historically have experienced significant chargeback rates,
primarily online gaming-related service providers and online
gaming merchants, as higher risk. As of
June 30, 2002, PayPal had 1,193 accounts designated as
higher risk compared with 569 accounts as of
December 31, 2001. For the twelve months ended
December 31, 2001 and for the six months ended
June 30, 2002, 3.9% and 8.5% of the dollar volume of
payments received through PayPal, and 1.7% and 4.3% of the total
number of payments received through PayPal, were received by
higher risk accounts. In order to control the risks presented by
these merchants, PayPal researches the owners of these accounts,
their financial condition and their licenses to operate in their
home jurisdictions, and PayPal closes the accounts of merchants
that do not satisfactorily complete its review. PayPal typically
charges higher fees to these merchants, ranging from 3.4% to
3.9% of the payment amount plus $0.30 per transaction. PayPal



also holds a percentage of their incoming
payments, typically ranging from 10% to 15%, as a reserve
against future chargebacks. To date, customers have not
charged-back payments to these merchants at a materially higher
rate than customers making other types of payments, and the
reserves that PayPal holds have been sufficient to cover all
chargebacks of payments to higher risk accounts. The legal
status of many of these higher risk accounts is uncertain, and
these businesses could be prohibited or restricted from
operating in the future. Proposed legislation has been
introduced in the U.S. Congress to clarify that operation
of an Internet gaming business violates federal law, and to
prohibit payments processors such as PayPal from processing
payments for online gaming merchants. Even if this proposed
legislation is not enacted, online gaming merchants could be
determined to be in violation of existing federal and state
gambling laws. In particular, the New York State Attorney
General recently stated that even under current law, the
processing of known gambling transactions may lead to liability
for facilitating or aiding and abetting the underlying activity.
On August 20, 2002, PayPal reached an agreement with the
Attorney General of the State of New York in the
states inquiry into payments made through PayPals
service to online gambling merchants. In an assurance of
discontinuance made to the New York Attorney General,
PayPal agreed to cease processing payments from its
New York members to online gambling merchants by
September 1, 2002. PayPal took this action in voluntary
cooperation with the New York Attorney General and did not
admit to a violation of law. The New York Attorney General
has agreed to accept PayPals assurance of discontinuance
in lieu of commencing a statutory proceeding. PayPal also agreed
to pay $200,000 to the State of New York in penalties,
disgorged profits and to cover the New York Attorney
Generals costs of investigation.

PayPal has received federal grand jury subpoenas
issued at the request of the United States Attorney for the
Eastern District of Missouri. These subpoenas seek the
production of documents related to online gambling activities.
PayPal intends to cooperate fully with the United States
Attorneys office in this matter. If the online gaming
merchants that accept PayPal are operating illegally, PayPal
could be subject to civil or criminal prosecution for, among
other things, money laundering or for aiding and abetting
violations of law. PayPal would also lose the revenues
associated with these accounts and could be subject to material
penalties and fines.

In the third quarter of 2001, PayPal developed a
subscription payments feature that could prove attractive to
online vendors of adult content. For the six months ended
June 30, 2002, 0.4% of the dollar volume of payments sent
through PayPal was sent using its subscription feature, however,
PayPal is unable to determine what percentage of these payments
was attributable to vendors of adult content.

Sales and Marketing

From its launch, PayPal has grown primarily
through organic, user-driven means. Each time an existing PayPal
customer sends or receives funds to or from someone who has not
yet registered with PayPal, the other party must open a PayPal
account in order to receive or send the payment. Thus, when a
PayPal user makes an email payment to someone who does not yet
have a PayPal account, the recipient follows a link in the
payment notification email to register with PayPal and gain
access to the funds. Similarly, when a consumer who has not yet
registered with PayPal visits the website of a merchant that has
integrated its Web Accept feature, the consumer opens a PayPal
account from the merchants site in order to make the
purchase. PayPal has achieved its growth through this
combination of push- and pull-driven new
customer acquisition. Starting with payments made from its 24
employees to their friends in October 1999, PayPals user
base grew to 10,000 in December 1999, to 100,000 by early
February 2000, to 1,000,000 by mid-April 2000 and to 10,000,000
by September 2001.

PayPal accelerated its natural growth with
promotional bonuses, its only significant marketing
expenditures. Thus, in late 1999 and early 2000, PayPal offered
qualified new users a $5 to $10 sign up bonus, automatically
credited to their respective PayPal accounts. Additionally, for
each qualified new member one of its users introduced to the
network, PayPal credited the original users PayPal account
with a $5 to $10 referral bonus. PayPal has continued to refine
the criteria qualifying users for promotional bonuses. During
the six months ended June 30, 2002, PayPal expensed as
incurred $476,000 on promotional bonuses and acquired
5.0 million accounts, for an average expense of $0.09 per
account.



PayPals organic, user-driven growth has
proven more cost-effective than traditional sales and marketing
channels, such as television, radio and print advertising, or
Internet-based promotional methods such as banner ads and
directed email campaigns.

Risk Management

PayPals account-based network enables it to
detect and prevent fraud when funds enter the PayPal network, as
funds move within the network and when they leave. Striking the
optimal balance between the dual objectives of controlling fraud
and providing a user-friendly system will remain a key challenge
for PayPal.

PayPals risk management techniques include
the following:

 

Card Evaluation.

    PayPal deploys rigorous anti-fraud screens for every credit card
    transaction it processes. PayPal uses internally developed
    behavioral scores and third party software, in addition to
    running Address Verification System, or AVS, and more advanced
    credit card checks.

 

Proprietary Fraud Detection
    Software.
 PayPal has developed
    proprietary fraud detection systems to efficiently identify
    potentially fraudulent transactions. The IGOR system monitors
    account and transaction relationship patterns in order to
    control PayPals loss exposure if fraudulent funds enter
    the PayPal system, and the ILYA system utilizes account and
    transactional characteristics to help prevent fraudulent funds
    from entering or leaving the PayPal system. Max Levchin,
    PayPals Chief Technology Officer and the architect of its
    anti-fraud technology, received the Innovator of the Year award
    from Technology Review magazine, a publication of the
    Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in May 2002.

 

Experience.

    PayPals experience and cumulative knowledge in dealing
    with attempted fraud perpetrators represents an additional
    anti-fraud advantage.

PayPal is not aware of any banks having
prohibited or restricted their customers from conducting
transactions with PayPal, although PayPal is aware of two
incidents in which customers of a bank temporarily were unable
to conduct transactions with PayPal. These incidents, one of
which involved miscoding of transactions, and the other
involving suspected fraud, were resolved quickly.

Technology

PayPals technology facilitates easy access
to the PayPal website, both to acquire new customers and to
allow existing ones to conduct financial transactions. PayPal
focuses much of its development efforts on creating specialized
software that enhances its Internet-based customer
functionality. One of PayPals key challenges remains
building and maintaining a scalable and reliable system, capable
of handling traffic and transactions for a growing customer
base. The major components of PayPals network reside at
its corporate headquarters in Mountain View, California, at an
Equinix data center in San Jose, California, and at its
operations and customer support facility in Omaha, Nebraska.
PayPal has a second data center with Exodus in Santa Clara,
California.

Because of the financial nature of its product,
PayPal seeks to offer a high level of data security in order to
build customer confidence and to protect its customers
private information. PayPal has designed its security
infrastructure to protect data from unauthorized access, both
physically and over the Internet. PayPals most sensitive
data and hardware reside at its Equinix data center. This data
center has redundant connections to the Internet, as well as
fault-tolerant power and fire suppression systems. Because of
its special security needs, PayPal houses its equipment in
physically secure data vaults and tightly controls physical
access to its systems.

Multiple layers of network security and network
intrusion detection devices further enhance the security of
PayPals systems. PayPal segments various components of the
system logically and physically from each other on its networks.
Components of the system communicate with each other via Secure
Sockets Layer, or SSL, an industry standard communications
security protocol, and require mutual



authentication. Access to a system component
requires at least two authorized staff members simultaneously to
enter secret passphrases. This procedure protects PayPal from
the unauthorized use of its infrastructure components. Finally,
PayPal stores all data it deems private or sensitive only in
encrypted form in its database. PayPal decrypts data only on an
as-needed basis, using a specially designated component of its
system which requires authentication before fulfilling a
decryption request.

Customer Service and
    Operations

As of June 30, 2002, PayPals
Omaha-based customer service and operations team consisted of
543 employees, 484 of which were front-line representatives
supporting customer service and financial operations. In
March 2002, PayPal discontinued its relationship with Daksh
eServices Private Limited in India which formerly provided
outsourced email customer support.

PayPals customer service representatives
provide phone and email support to personal and business
accounts. PayPal has experienced improvement in response time
for servicing email and phone inquiries. Recently PayPal created
specialization within the organization to service specific
customer inquires more efficiently. PayPal has also successfully
redesigned its Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system to
route calls directly to specialized representatives. As a
result, the IVR routes approximately 80% of customer inquires
directly to an agent with the appropriate expertise to service
the customer. Customer service needs have not grown as quickly
as PayPals user base, and PayPal expects this trend to
continue.

PayPal has also created a new Product Integration
and Education department to improve agent knowledge. PayPal
conducts periodic skills testing of its representatives.
PayPals quality assurance department also spot-checks the
representatives multiple times per month by recording and
listening to random samples of their calls and reviewing samples
of their email responses.

In addition to the customer service functions,
PayPals operations team in Omaha has built expertise in
payments industry rules and best practices in Visa, MasterCard,
American Express, Discover, Regulation E, National
Automated Clearing House Association and Maestro processing.

Vendor Relationships

Wells Fargo

Since August 2000, PayPal has processed all of
its ACH and check transactions through Wells Fargo Bank. Wells
Fargo also provides other services for PayPal, including wire
transfers, check printing, mailing and reconciling as well as
fraud protection. Under the terms of the contract governing this
relationship, neither party has given the other exclusivity in
terms of services, and either party can terminate upon ten
days notice. In general, PayPal pays a transaction fee for
each ACH and check transaction processed by Wells Fargo. Pricing
depends on a number of factors, including domestic or
international location, the total volume of payments and other
factors. PayPal is required to keep minimum amounts on account
with Wells Fargo in order to obtain Wells Fargos ACH
processing services. Until December 2001, this requirement was
met by holding sufficient customer funds as agent in a pooled
account at Wells Fargo. The requirement is now met by pledging
securities owned by PayPal and held in a brokerage account at
Wells Fargo. These securities, as of June 30, 2002, have a
fair market value of $5.6 million and are accounted for as
restricted investments. Although PayPal maintains a good working
relationship with Wells Fargo, it continues to examine all of
its options for ACH processing, especially in terms of specialty
processing such as international payments. Although it is not
required to do so, PayPal also places at Wells Fargo the
majority of its customers funds that PayPal handles as
agent.

In May 2002, PayPal entered into an agreement to
appoint Wells Fargo as its provider of U.S. credit card
processing services, and Wells Fargo agreed to accept the
appointment and provide processing services for PayPals
U.S. customers credit card transactions. PayPal has
completed the transition to Wells Fargo as its credit card
processor for Visa and MasterCard transactions as of
August 23, 2002. During the term of the agreement, PayPal
may not enter into an agreement with anyone other than Wells
Fargo to provide it with U.S. credit card payment processing
services. The term of the agreement runs until May 2004 unless
terminated earlier for cause or in accordance with the agreement.



Under the credit card processing agreement, Wells
Fargo will process properly-presented card transactions, provide
daily reports of transactions and will transfer the funds from
such transactions to PayPal on a daily basis. PayPal assumes
liability for all chargeback losses and PayPal agrees to be the
merchant of record for each PayPal transaction. Wells Fargo is
required to meet specified service levels regarding the
availability, response times, security procedures, problem
resolution and chargeback processing. The contract limits the
liability of Wells Fargo Bank for any breaches of the agreement
to the amount of fees PayPal has paid, except in the event of
Wells Fargos gross negligence or willful misconduct.

PayPal will pay Wells Fargo a fee for each credit
card authorization, as well as a fee for each settled credit
card transaction and a processing fee for each chargeback. Wells
Fargo also will pass through to PayPal the amounts that it is
charged by the card associations for issuer interchange on
completed transactions, which consist of a percentage of the
transaction amount. PayPal is required to maintain a reserve of
$3 million at all times with Wells Fargo as security for
the performance of its obligations. Wells Fargo may increase
this amount, but only as reasonably related to its potential
liability for transactions that it processes for PayPal.

Electronic Payment Exchange

From December 2001 to August 2002, PayPal
processed all of its customers credit card transactions
through Electronic Payment Exchange, Inc., or EPX. EPX provided
the systems and services that allowed PayPal to direct
transaction information to the merchant bank that provided
transaction processing services to PayPal and sponsored its
acceptance of Visa and MasterCard cards. For Visa transactions,
First Union National Bank acted as PayPals merchant bank,
and for MasterCard, Discover and American Express transactions,
TheBancorp.com Bank acted as PayPals merchant bank. PayPal
expects that EPX and TheBancorp.com Bank will continue to
process its Discover and American Express transactions.
PayPals agreements with EPX, First Union National Bank,
Certegy Card Services, Inc., which provides processing services
for First Union, and TheBancorp.com Bank make PayPal responsible
for all chargebacks unless PayPal obtains a physical signature
from the cardholder, and require PayPal to comply with the rules
and guidelines of the card associations.

In turn, EPX and the applicable bank have agreed
to process properly-presented card transactions and to transfer
the funds from such transactions to PayPal on a daily basis. EPX
is also required to meet specified service levels regarding the
availability, response times and security of their processing
services, their settlement of funds due PayPal, and their
chargeback processing. The contract limits the liability of EPX
and the applicable bank for any breaches of the agreement to the
amount of fees PayPal has paid during the six-month period
immediately prior to the event giving rise to PayPals
damages.

PayPal pays EPX and the applicable bank a fee for
each credit card authorization, as well as a fee for each
completed credit card transaction. The banks also pass through
to PayPal standard industry fees that they are charged by the
card associations for issuer interchange on completed
transactions, which consist of a percentage of the transaction
amount. PayPal also is subject to additional fees and must
reimburse EPXs development costs if PayPal submits less
than 50.0% of its customers credit card transactions
through EPX during the first year of the contract, which was
entered into in November 2001. As a result of PayPals
transition to Wells Fargo Bank as its credit card processor for
Visa and MasterCard transactions on August 23, 2002, PayPal
will submit fewer than 50% of its customers credit card
transactions through EPX beginning on that date. If the dollar
amount of credit card transactions that PayPals customers
charge back exceed 1.0% of its credit card transaction volume,
EPX and the applicable bank can require PayPal to establish a
reserve account at the bank equal to the total amount of
chargebacks over the last 30 to 120 days, depending on the
extent to which PayPals chargeback ratio exceeds 1.0%. At
its current chargeback rates, PayPal does not need to provide
any funds to this reserve account. However, in connection with
the termination of PayPals relationship with EPX and
transition to Wells Fargo Bank as credit card processor, as of
August 23, 2002, EPX, First Union and TheBancorp.com Bank
are holding $14.15 million of PayPals funds in a
reserve account to cover chargebacks they may



receive after termination. PayPal is negotiating
with EPX and these banks to substitute letters of credit in the
amount of $14.15 million for these reserve accounts.

Chase Merchant Services

Until December 1, 2001, PayPals
processor for substantially all credit card transactions was
Chase Merchant Services, or CMS. Chase Merchant Services remains
responsible to Visa and MasterCard for any chargebacks on
PayPals customers credit card transactions that
occurred prior to December 1, 2001. To protect CMS against
the risk of such chargebacks, PayPal had pledged certificates of
deposit totaling $3.0 million at December 31, 2001. In
December 2001, CMS had retained approximately an additional
$11.3 million in settlement funds due to PayPal in an
escrow account. As of June 30, 2002, the $11.3 million
amount had decreased to $3.4 million. Thus, the total
amount of restricted cash for CMS as of June 30, 2002 was
$6.4 million. In July 2002, CMS released $3.0 million
of the pledged certificates of deposit and an additional
$300,000 that CMS had retained directly in an escrow account.
PayPal believes that the remaining $3.1 million balance
held in escrow will likely be reduced or eliminated by the end
of this calendar year as the risk to CMS decreases over time.

Bank of America

As PayPal expands the ability of customers in
countries outside the U.S. to withdraw funds from the PayPal
system to their local bank accounts, and to fund their PayPal
transactions from their local bank accounts, PayPal anticipates
using Bank of America to process these bank account transfers.
PayPal currently uses Bank of America for this purpose in nine
of the sixteen countries outside the U.S. where customers can
withdraw funds to their local bank accounts (Japan, Spain, Hong
Kong, Singapore, Mexico, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway).
PayPal pays Bank of America a transaction fee based on the
country involved, the total volume of payments and other factors.

First Data

In October 2000, PayPal launched the PayPal ATM/
debit card to qualifying PayPal members through an arrangement
with MasterCard International and with First Data Resources,
Inc., which provides its debit card processing services. The
PayPal ATM/ debit card allows qualified PayPal account holders
to access their account balances from any ATM connected to the
Cirrus or Maestro networks and at any merchant that accepts
MasterCard. PayPal recently launched a virtual debit
card which allows any customer with a PayPal account balance to
use that balance at online merchants that accept MasterCard.
Under the terms of the contract governing this relationship,
First Data agreed to certain minimum uptime and other detailed
service level requirements. PayPal, in turn, agreed to use First
Data exclusively for processing of debit card transactions.
PayPal also agreed to remain eligible for sponsorship by a
sponsor bank, which is, in PayPals case,
BankOne Indiana, N.A. PayPal pays First Data fees on a
per-transaction, rather than percentage, basis. In all years
after the first year of the contract, PayPal is required to pay
First Data a minimum fee, even if the volume of transactions
processed by First Data would yield a lower amount.
Additionally, PayPal agreed to obtain a letter of credit for the
benefit of First Data as collateral to cover its settlement risk
with the sponsoring bank. PayPal has pledged a certificate of
deposit as security for the letter of credit. If PayPals
debit card transaction volume increases, First Data may require
it to increase the letter of credit to the average amount of
PayPal debit card transactions in recent 4-day periods. In March
2002, PayPal completed negotiations with First Data Resources,
Inc. to increase the amount of its letter of credit to
$7.0 million from $2.0 million at December 31,
2001 based on debit card volumes as per the agreement with First
Data. In addition to the $2.0 million already secured by a
certificate of deposit, PayPal deposited $5.0 million into
a restricted money market account, which is classified as
restricted cash. If the volume decreases, or First Datas
settlement risk otherwise decreases, PayPal has the right to
request, but not to require, a corresponding reduction in the
letter of credit. This agreement, which has a five-year term,
expires on November 1, 2005.



Visa and MasterCard

PayPal does not have any direct contractual
relationship with Visa or MasterCard other than an agreement
relating to PayPals participation in MasterCards
Remote Payment and Presentment Service for online bill payment.
As a merchant that accepts Visa and MasterCard credit cards,
however, PayPal is subject to, and must comply with, the
operating rules of the Visa and MasterCard credit card
associations. Under these operating rules, in cases of fraud or
disputes between senders and recipients in transactions
involving Visa or MasterCard cards, PayPal faces chargebacks
when cardholders dispute items for which they have been billed.
Because it is not a bank, PayPal is not eligible to belong to
the credit card associations. As a result, PayPal must rely on
banks that are members of these associations or their
independent service organizations to process its transactions,
to challenge chargebacks on its behalf where appropriate, to
inform it of changes to Visa and MasterCard operating rules, and
to communicate with the Visa and MasterCard associations on its
behalf.

In late 2000, MasterCard indicated it would
terminate PayPals ability to accept MasterCard cards for
payment if PayPal did not change some of its practices and
procedures immediately. PayPal and its credit card processor had
a series of meetings with MasterCard to discuss how to bring
PayPals practices and procedures into compliance. As a
result of those meetings, PayPal made changes to its system that
PayPal believes resolved MasterCards concerns, but
MasterCard has not communicated to PayPal that its concerns have
been fully resolved. In 2001, Visa informed PayPals credit
card processor that some of PayPals practices violated its
operating rules, and PayPal made certain changes to its
practices in response. Specifically, Visa objected to
PayPals charging and immediately rebating international
membership fees, and to PayPals charging fees to
international customers for payments that are funded using
credit cards, but not for payments that are funded from balances
in the PayPal system. Visa also objected to PayPals
practice of obtaining a card holders single up-front
authorization, rather than authorization on a transaction by
transaction basis, to charge that card holders Visa
account if the card holder requests an ACH transfer and that
transfer fails. Visa has assessed fines on PayPals
processor totaling $130,000 through July 31, 2002, $95,000
of which the processor has passed on to PayPal. Although Visa
has not threatened to suspend, terminate or otherwise limit or
restrict PayPals ability to accept Visa cards, PayPal has
changed its practices to resolve these three outstanding issues.
These changes include not rebating international membership
fees, charging fees to recipients of cross-border payments
rather than to international senders, and seeking authorization
on a transaction by transaction basis to charge a card
holders Visa account if a related ACH transfer fails.
PayPal believes these changes have resolved all outstanding
issues that resulted in fines from Visa. However, these changes
could make the PayPal service less attractive.

MasterCard announced that, effective May 1,
2002, it will require each customer that regularly uses PayPal
to accept payment for goods or services to enter into a contract
with the bank that processes MasterCard transactions for PayPal
and must agree to observe MasterCard rules. PayPal believes it
can comply with this rule through changes to its User Agreement,
but PayPal is unable at this time to predict precisely how this
rule will affect its business. It could require PayPal to change
the interrelationship among itself, its customers and its credit
card processing bank in ways that could increase PayPals
costs, reduce the attractiveness of its service or both.

Providian

In March 2002, PayPal entered into a Credit Card
Alliance Agreement with Providian Bancorp Services, an affiliate
of Providian National Bank and Providian Bank, each an issuer of
general-purpose credit cards. This agreement replaced and
superseded the prior agreement PayPal entered into with
Providian in February 2001. Under the terms of this new
agreement, Providian agrees to offer PayPal-branded credit cards
to PayPals account holders and to cooperate with PayPal in
developing the marketing for this program. The agreement
provides that Providian will pay PayPal a one-time payment in
order to redesign the PayPal website and market the strategic
alliance, as well as certain bounty fees for each new Providian
account referred by the program. These bounties are based on the
number of active new accounts during a three-month period, with
a higher bounty per account accompanying a larger number of



new accounts booked. Additionally, whenever a
PayPal Visa card is used by an account holder, PayPal receives a
share of Providians transaction fee revenue. This revenue
share applies to purchases and quasi-cash transactions on all
accounts booked under both the new and old agreements.

PayPal agreed to make the Providian-issued
co-branded credit card the exclusive U.S. credit card promoted
in the registration process on the PayPal website, and not to
sponsor or participate in any competing co-branded credit card
product marketed to U.S. PayPal members. Under the terms of the
contract governing this relationship, Providian is responsible
for loan underwriting decisions, loan servicing and legal
compliance, and bears all the costs of issuing cards and
underwriting the portfolio. The contract has a five-year term,
with renewal for an additional 2-year period unless either party
gives written termination notice to the other at least
90 days before March 1, 2007. Either party may also
terminate the contract if the other party is acquired or is
subject to a change of control, subject to payment of an early
termination fee, which is determined based in part on whether or
not the party is acquired by a competitor of the other party.

Competition

The market for PayPals product is emerging,
intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological
change. PayPal competes with a number of companies, both with
email-based online payment providers and traditional payment
methods such as credit cards, checks, money orders and ACH
transactions. In order to retain existing customers and attract
new customers, PayPal must offer an attractive combination of
the following factors:

 

Convenience.
 Senders
    and recipients both prefer an easy-to-use payment system. PayPal
    emphasized convenience in designing the process by which its
    customers open PayPal accounts and has streamlined the process
    of sending and receiving payments. In addition, PayPals
    patent-pending account verification method allows it to
    authenticate users with a high degree of reliability, without
    the delay and inconvenience to customers of mailing or faxing
    documents. Some of PayPals competitors, however, may have
    an advantage in encouraging buyers to use their product by
    allowing new customers to make payments without opening an
    account.

 

Size of the Network.

    PayPals network continues to grow relative to many of its
    competitors, and PayPals size encourages usage by new
    customers. PayPal believes that it has a significantly larger
    network of both senders and recipients than other email-based
    online payment providers. However, some of PayPals
    competitors, including credit card products offered under the
    Visa and MasterCard brands, enjoy significantly wider adoption
    than PayPal does.

 

Price.
 Subject to
    the other factors listed, users generally will use the lowest
    cost payment system. PayPals product is free for users to
    send payments, and PayPal has set the fees it charges business
    accounts to receive payments at rates that PayPal believes are
    lower than most new or small businesses could obtain if they
    sought to accept credit cards directly. Some of its competitors
    in the online payment market charge lower fees than PayPal does,
    including Citibanks c2it, which currently makes its
    product available for free to senders and recipients within the
    U.S.

 

Security and
    Privacy.
 PayPal has addressed and
    continues to address security and privacy concerns in designing
    the PayPal system, which PayPal believes builds user confidence
    and drives growth. In particular, for a buyer deciding whether
    to pay an unfamiliar seller through PayPal or directly by credit
    card, PayPal offers the advantage of keeping the buyers
    credit card information secret from the merchant. Many of
    PayPals competitors, however, provide the same feature.

 

Brand Recognition.

    While PayPal enjoys strong brand recognition, many current and
    potential competitors have established long-standing
    relationships with their users. Many of PayPals
    competitors, including credit card products under the Visa and
    MasterCard brands, enjoy significantly greater brand recognition
    than does PayPal.

 

Customer Service.

    PayPal has strengthened its customer support network by
    establishing a large customer call center. PayPal believes that
    its commitment to customer service helps it attract and



retain customers. Although PayPal has devoted
    substantial resources to customer service, some of its
    competitors, including c2it, enjoy the backing of large
    financial institutions with the ability to devote significantly
    more resources to customer service than could PayPal.

 

Timing of Payments.

    When buyers and sellers are in different locations, the PayPal
    product offers buyers a fast method of completing payment, and
    offers sellers the ability to know that the buyer has sent the
    payment more quickly than waiting for cash, a check or a money
    order to arrive in the mail. This knowledge often allows
    sellers, in particular those who do not accept credit cards, to
    deliver their goods or services more quickly, which in turn
    encourages customer use of PayPal. Most PayPal payments are
    credited instantly to the recipients PayPal account, and
    the recipient may then use those funds to pay others or may
    choose to withdraw them. Some of PayPals competitors offer
    equivalent advantages in processing speed compared to cash,
    checks or money orders by mail, and also allow customers to
    transfer funds to their bank accounts as fast or, in some cases,
    faster than does PayPal. However, PayPals Shop Anywhere
    feature and the large number of individuals and businesses that
    accept PayPal allow recipients to use funds immediately upon
    receipt to make online purchases, and provide PayPal a
    competitive advantage over some of its competitors in this
    respect. PayPals ATM/debit card also allows select
    merchants to access the funds they receive through PayPal at
    ATMs and at merchants that accept MasterCard, without waiting
    for funds to be transferred to their bank accounts.

PayPal anticipates continued challenges from
current competitors, who may enjoy greater resources, as well as
by new entrants into the industry.

Prior to the consummation of the merger, or in
the event that the proposed merger does not occur, PayPals
competitors include, among others:

 

eBay Payments, owned by eBay, enjoys the strong
    eBay brand name. Its ability to integrate with eBay auctions
    could allow it to offer new and convenient features;

 

MoneyZap and BidPay offered by Western Union, a
    subsidiary of First Data;

 

Yahoo! PayDirect offered by Yahoo!;

 

c2it offered by Citigroup;

 

Valid offered by CheckFree;

 

email payment services offered by the U.S. Postal
    Service through CheckFree; and

 

credit card merchant processors that offer their
    services to online merchants, including First Data, Concord EFS,
    Paymentech, VeriSign and Authorize.net.

MasterCard recently announced a new online
payment service in conjunction with CertaPay, and Visa has also
expressed interest in developing an online email-based payment
product for use by its members. Other potential competitors
include Amazon and American Express.

In addition, PayPal competes with credit card
products offered under the Visa and MasterCard brands, which
enjoy significant brand recognition and marketing resources, and
with merchant processors, such as First Data and VeriSign, which
assist online merchants in accepting credit cards. PayPal also
competes with online wallets such as Microsofts Passport.

Many of PayPals competitors have longer
operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical,
marketing, customer service and other resources, greater name
recognition or a larger base of customers in affiliated
businesses than PayPal has. For example, Citigroups c2it
has existing arrangements with AOL Time Warner and Microsoft.
c2it could use these arrangements to market directly its
competing payment product to the customers of AOL Time Warner
and Microsoft, which could result in c2it gaining substantial
market share in a short period of time.



Intellectual Property

PayPal protects its intellectual property rights
through a combination of trademarks, copyrights and trade
secrets and through the domain name dispute resolution system.
In order to limit access to and disclosure of PayPals
proprietary information, all of PayPals employees have
signed confidentiality and invention assignment arrangements,
and PayPal enters into nondisclosure agreements with third
parties. PayPal cannot provide assurance however, that the steps
it has taken to protect its intellectual property rights will
adequately prevent infringement or misappropriation of those
rights. Particularly given the international nature of the
Internet, the rate of growth of the Internet and the ease of
registering new domain names, PayPal may not be able to detect
unauthorized use of its intellectual property or take
enforcement action.

In particular, PayPal has applied to register the
PayPal service mark in the U.S. and Canada and
PayPal has obtained registration of the PayPal mark in the
European Community, Japan and China. PayPal also has applied to
register the service mark X.com in the U.S. PayPal
has registered the domain name www.paypal.com for
ten years and various related domain names for periods ranging
from two to ten years and has filed to protect its rights to the
PayPal name in the new .biz and .info
top level domains that became operational in Fall 2001.

PayPal has applied in the U.S. and certain other
countries for five patents. These patent applications relate to
PayPals core system of transferring value from point to
point between two users of a communications network that are not
linked directly, its technology to detect suspicious patterns of
transactions, its process of verifying a customers control
of the bank account or credit card he has registered with
PayPal, its process of enabling merchants to integrate PayPal
into their websites or online auctions, and its process for
determining whether to complete immediately a customers
ACH-funded payment, before PayPal has received any assurances of
payment, if the customer presents an alternate payment method to
be used if the primary payment method fails. PayPal cannot
predict whether the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or
PTO, will issue these patents in their requested form or at all
or whether these patents will be valid even if issued.

Whether or not the PTO issues patents to PayPal,
third parties may claim that PayPal has infringed upon their
patents or misappropriated or infringed on other proprietary
rights. These claims and any resultant litigation could subject
PayPal to significant liability for damages. In addition, even
if PayPal prevails, the litigation could be time consuming and
expensive to defend and could affect PayPals business
materially and adversely. Any claims or litigation from third
parties may also result in limitations on PayPals ability
to use the service marks, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets,
patents, and other intellectual property subject to these claims
or litigation, unless PayPal enters into license agreements with
the third parties. However, these agreements may be unavailable
on commercially reasonable terms, or not available at all.

Patent Litigation; Third Party License
    Demand

On May 7, 2002, Tumbleweed Communications
Corp. filed a lawsuit for patent infringement against PayPal in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California. Tumbleweed is a software company headquartered in
Redwood City, California, that specializes in Internet security.
The lawsuit claims infringement of two U.S. patents:
U.S. Patent Number 5,790,790 (the 790 patent),
entitled Electronic Document Delivery System in Which
Notification of Said Electronic Document is Sent to a Recipient
Thereof, and U.S. Patent Number 6,192,407 (the
407 patent), entitled Private, Trackable URLs
For Directed Document Delivery. The Tumbleweed patents
relate to techniques for the delivery of electronic documents to
users over the Internet. Specifically, the 790 patent
relates to an electronic document delivery system and methods of
its use where a document is forwarded to a remote server. The
server sends a generic notification of the document, with direct
reference to the document, to an intended recipient, and the
recipient can download the document from the server using local
protocols. The 407 patent relates to a document delivery
architecture that dynamically generates a private Uniform
Resource Locator to retrieve documents. PayPal believes that it
does not infringe the 790 or 407 patents, and
will



contest the suit vigorously. In PayPals
answer filed May 28, 2002, PayPal denied any infringement
and asserted that the Tumbleweed patents are invalid. In
addition, PayPal brought counterclaims for declaratory judgment
that the patents are not infringed or in the alternative are
invalid. Tumbleweed has notified PayPal that it has received a
Notice of Allowance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office of
an additional patent related to the delivery of electronic
documents. Tumbleweed has further notified PayPal that
Tumbleweed intends to seek leave to amend its complaint to add
claims under this additional patent when issued, and to name
eBay as a defendant in the lawsuit.

On February 15, 2002, PayPal received a
letter from counsel to NetMoneyIN, Inc., a privately held
company based in Arizona. The letter from NetMoneyINs
counsel alleges that PayPal is infringing at least claim 13 of
U.S. patent Number 5,822,737 (the 737 patent)
and claim number 1 of U.S. Patent Number 5,963,917 (the
917 patent), which is a continuation of the
737 patent, when PayPal engages in working with
merchant websites to check credit card purchases. The
737 patent and the 917 patent relate to a
financial transaction system for processing payments over a
network, in particular for credit and debit card payments.
PayPal believes that it does not infringe the 737 or
917 patents, among other reasons because PayPal does
not provide direct credit or debit card processing for
merchants. PayPal has responded to this effect to the letter
from NetMoneyINs counsel. NetMoneyIN has not commenced any
legal action against PayPal; however, the letter from NetMoneyIN
states that PayPal will be sued if it remains unlicensed.

If PayPal were to conclude based on additional
information that some element of its processes is or might be
covered by the Tumbleweed or NetMoneyIN patents, PayPal might
seek to negotiate and obtain licenses from these parties. If it
were unwilling or unable to obtain a license from these third
parties, PayPal would remain subject to potential liability for
patent infringement. Although it will contest any lawsuit
vigorously, PayPal cannot make assurances that it will prevail
in the Tumbleweed lawsuit or that it would prevail in a
NetMoneyIN lawsuit if NetMoneyIN were to sue PayPal for
infringement of their patents. If any portions of its service
were found to be infringing Tumbleweeds or
NetMoneyINs patents, then PayPal would likely be unable to
continue to offer those portions of its service found to be
infringing. PayPal could also then be required to pay damages
for past infringing use, possibly attorneys fees, and
possibly treble damages. This could have a material adverse
effect on PayPals business prospects, financial condition,
and results of operations.

On February 4, 2002, CertCo, Inc. filed a
lawsuit for patent infringement against PayPal in the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware. On
April 25, 2002, CertCo agreed to drop the patent
infringement suit that it had asserted against PayPal. The
settlement involved an inconsequential payment by PayPal and
mutual releases.

Regulation

Money Transmitter Laws

More than 40 states in the U.S. regulate bill
payers, money transmitters, check sellers, issuers of payment
instruments or similar non-bank payment businesses, which PayPal
refers to collectively as money services businesses.
The states enacted most of these statutes before the Internet
emerged as a commercial forum, and the application of these
statutes to online payment service providers has not been
interpreted by courts or most regulatory authorities. Based on
the specific provisions of these state statutes and the nature
of its services, PayPal believes that money services regulations
cover its business only in some states that regulate money
transmitters, and not in states that only regulate check sellers
or issuers of payment instruments.

PayPals analysis is subject to significant
uncertainty, however, and PayPal cannot assure you that state
regulators and courts will agree with its interpretations.
Beginning in May 2000, PayPal has contacted regulatory
authorities to describe its service or PayPal has filed
applications in the 36 jurisdictions, including the
District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, that regulate money
transmitters or were subject to the greatest uncertainty. Eight
states have provided a written interpretation that PayPals
service, as PayPal



described it to them, does not require a money
services license from their state. These eight states are
Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma
and Wisconsin.

Based on the replies received from the other
states that PayPal contacted and its analysis of state law,
PayPal has applied for money services business licenses in a
total of 28 jurisdictions. Of the 28 jurisdictions
where PayPal has filed applications, PayPal has obtained a money
services business license in 13 jurisdictions: Arizona,
Colorado, the District of Columbia, Idaho, Illinois, Louisiana,
Maine, Maryland, Nebraska, Oregon, Texas, Vermont and West
Virginia. The 15 jurisdictions where PayPal has pending
applications are California (as to transmission of money
abroad), Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts (as to
transmission of money abroad), Minnesota, New Jersey,
New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico,
Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Virginia. Most of these
applications were filed in February and March 2002.

In California, a money transmitter license is
required only for engaging in the business of transmission of
money abroad. After discussions with the California Department
of Financial Institutions, in January 2002, in connection with
PayPals pending application for a California license,
PayPal suspended processing money transfer payments to
international accounts. In the year ended December 31,
2001, such payments constituted less than 0.5% of the total
dollar volume of PayPals payments. PayPal will not be able
to resume processing such payments until it has obtained a
California license to transmit money abroad.

Even if all of these state license applications
are ultimately granted, state regulatory authorities have the
ability to impose fines and other penalties for the period of
time PayPal provided services without a license to residents of
those states that require it to have a license. Under the
recently enacted USA Patriot Act, PayPal could be subject
to federal civil and criminal penalties if it is deemed to be
operating without an appropriate money transmitting license in a
state where such operation is punishable as a misdemeanor or a
felony under state law. PayPal has not to date been fined or
received notice of fines or other penalties under state or
federal money transmitter laws.

Because it has money transmitter licenses in
twelve states and the District of Columbia and expects to obtain
other state money services business licenses, PayPal must file
periodic reports with state regulators, obtain bonds and
maintain minimum levels of capital, ensure that it holds
customer funds only in liquid and highly rated investments and
provide notice or receive advance approval of any change in
control of PayPal. State money services business regulators will
have the authority to examine PayPal for compliance with these
laws and as to the safety and soundness of its operations and
financial condition. The minimum capitalization requirements
vary from state to state but do not currently exceed
$2.0 million in any state, although each state has the
authority to set higher minimums on a case-by-case basis. The
bonding company PayPal uses requires it to obtain standby
letters of credit for their benefit to support the issuance of
bonds to satisfy state requirements. As of June 30, 2002,
PayPal had pledged cash, in the form of certificates of deposit,
totaling $6.6 million to secure the letters of credit. This
amount is classified as restricted cash.

Bank Regulation

Because PayPal is not licensed as a bank, it is
not permitted to engage in a banking business. PayPal does not
require customers to keep funds in its system in order to use
its product. Although the definition of a banking
business varies among state laws, and is n
