Dear
Fellow Stockholders: 

        We
are pleased to inform you that Gart Sports Company and The Sports Authority, Inc. have entered into a merger agreement providing for a "merger of equals" that we believe will
create the nation's preeminent sporting goods retailer. 

        In
the merger, The Sports Authority's stockholders will receive 0.37 of a share of Gart common stock for each share of The Sports Authority common stock that they own. The number of
shares of Gart common stock held by current Gart stockholders will not change as a result of the merger. Stockholders of Gart and The Sports Authority will each own approximately 50% of the combined
company. Following the merger, the combined company's board of directors will consist of nine members, four designated by each of Gart and The Sports Authority from their current boards and one new
director, currently unaffiliated with either company. The transaction is structured to be tax free to the stockholders of The Sports Authority and is expected to close in the second or early third
calendar quarter of 2003. 

        If
the merger is completed, the combined company will be named The Sports Authority, Inc. Gart common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol
"GRTS." Gart intends to apply to have the shares of the combined company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "TSA" prior to the effective time of the merger. If Gart's application
for listing on the New York Stock Exchange is successful, Gart common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market. 

        After
careful consideration, the boards of directors of each of Gart and The Sports Authority have determined that the merger and the transactions associated with it are fair to, and in
the best interests of, their respective companies and stockholders. The boards of directors of each of Gart and The Sports Authority have unanimously approved the merger, and unanimously recommend
that their stockholders vote "FOR" the proposals relating to the merger. 

        Meetings
of the stockholders of Gart and The Sports Authority are scheduled to be held on                        , 2003. We cannot complete
the merger without the approval of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of each of Gart and The Sports Authority. 

        Your
vote is very important. Please promptly complete, date, sign and return the enclosed proxy card in the enclosed prepaid envelope to ensure that your shares will be represented at
your stockholders meeting. If you do not vote, it will, in effect, be counted as a vote against the merger. Please review carefully the entire joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

In particular, you should consider the matters
discussed under the section entitled "Risk Factors," commencing on page 16 of the joint proxy statement/prospectus before
voting.

        We
look forward to the successful combination of Gart and The Sports Authority and to your continued support as a stockholder of the combined company. 

On behalf of the boards of directors of Gart and The Sports Authority, we urge you to vote "FOR" the approval of the proposals relating to the
merger.

Questions and Answers    

Q:
Why are the companies proposing to merge?

A:
We
are proposing to merge because we believe that the combined company will be a stronger, more competitive company capable of achieving greater financial strength, earnings power and
operational efficiencies due to greater economies of scale, improved purchasing ability and an expanded distribution network, sourcing capabilities, product expertise and growth potential. These
synergies will enable the combined company to be a stronger, more efficient competitor, better able to serve customers by providing them with a broader selection of sporting goods at competitive
prices. We also believe that the complementary geographical presence of our two companies will result in the combined company being the first truly national sporting goods retailer with a presence in
many markets in the United States.

bonus plan. 

A:
The

A:

Conditions to the Completion of the Merger (Page 59)    

        Gart and The Sports Authority will complete the merger only if a number of conditions are satisfied or waived, including, but not limited to, the following: 


approval
of the merger proposals by the stockholders of Gart and The Sports Authority;


absence
of any legal restraint;


Gart's
entering into a credit facility providing a specified level of financing (or a lesser amount mutually acceptable to Gart and The Sports Authority);


each
party's receipt of legal opinions that the merger will be treated as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and


absence
of a material adverse effect on the other party, accuracy of the representations made by the other party and performance of covenants by the other
party. 

Termination of the Merger Agreement (Page 60)    

        Gart and The Sports Authority mutually may agree to terminate the merger agreement at any time. In addition, either party may terminate the merger agreement if: 


the
merger is not completed by December 31, 2003; 


a
court order prohibiting the merger becomes final and nonappealable, or a required governmental approval is not obtained;


Gart's
or The Sports Authority's stockholders do not approve the merger proposals;


the
other party is in breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in the merger agreement, and the breach would
give rise to the failure of a condition to the merger and has not been or is incapable of being cured within 30 days after the breaching party received written notice of the breach; or


in
response to an unsolicited proposal to acquire a party, that party's board determines that the unsolicited proposal is more favorable to the party than
the merger, gives notice to the other party and pays the required termination fee. 

Termination Fees (Page 61)    

        In circumstances set forth in the merger agreement, Gart or The Sports Authority may become obligated to pay a $7.4 million termination fee upon the
termination of the merger agreement. Additionally, in other circumstances set forth in the merger agreement, Gart or The Sports Authority may become obligated to reimburse the other for up to a
maximum of $3.7 million of out-of-pocket fees and expenses of the other party upon the termination of the merger agreement. 

Directors and Executive Officers of the Combined Company Following the Merger (Page 55)    

        Following the merger, the combined company's board of directors will consist of nine directors, composed of four designees of Gart from its current board of
directors and four designees of The Sports Authority from its current board of directors. The reconstituted board will appoint a ninth member who is not currently affiliated with either company. 

        Following
the merger, Martin E. Hanaka, the current chairman and chief executive officer of The Sports Authority, will serve as chairman of the combined company; Doug Morton, the current
chairman, president and chief executive officer of Gart, will become the combined company's vice chairman and chief executive officer; Elliott Kerbis, the current president and chief merchandising
officer of The Sports Authority, will become president and chief merchandising officer of the combined company; and Thomas Hendrickson, executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
of Gart, will become non-director vice chairman, chief administrative officer, chief financial officer and treasurer of the combined company. 

        The
rest of the management team of the combined company will consist of executives of both Gart and The Sports Authority. 

Material Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (Page 49)    

        The merger is intended to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. It is a
condition to each company's obligation to complete the merger that they receive opinions of counsel to this effect. The condition relating to the tax opinions will not be waived after receipt of
stockholder approval unless further stockholder approval is obtained with appropriate disclosure. Assuming the merger qualifies as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, holders of The Sports Authority common stock will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the exchange of their common
stock for Gart common stock in the merger (except for gain or loss recognized because of cash received in lieu of fractional shares). Holders of Gart common stock will not recognize gain or loss as a
result of the merger. 

Tax matters are very complicated and holders of The Sports Authority common stock are strongly urged to consult their tax advisors as to the specific tax
consequences to them of the merger, including  

 the applicability and effect of federal, state, local, foreign and other applicable tax laws that relate to their particular circumstances.

Regulatory Filings and Approvals (Page 51)    

        The completion of the merger is subject to the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
of 1976, as amended. Gart and The Sports Authority both made the required filings with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission on March 3, 2003 and the waiting period expired
at 11:59 p.m. on April 2, 2003. 

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger (Page 44)    

        When considering the recommendation of Gart's and The Sports Authority's boards of directors, you should be aware that directors, officers and stockholders of
Gart and The Sports Authority have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, yours. Two of Gart's current directors are partners in a merchant banking firm that will be paid
$4.25 million by Gart upon the completion of the merger in accordance with the terms of a management agreement that Gart entered into with that firm in 1998. The Sports Authority's and Gart's
executive officers have executed or will execute employment agreements with Gart, which will become effective upon completion of the merger. Some of The Sports Authority's directors, officers and
employees who hold stock options and/or shares of restricted stock pursuant to existing plans will, in accordance with the provisions of those existing plans, receive benefits upon completion of the
merger, including accelerated vesting of those stock options and/or shares of restricted stock. The Sports Authority's executive officers will receive severance payments after the merger is
consummated, even if their employment is not terminated after the merger. The Sports Authority's directors and officers will also receive indemnification and liability insurance benefits from Gart
pursuant to the merger agreement. Executive officers of Gart that are party to severance agreements with Gart will, in accordance with such agreements, receive severance payments if their employment
is terminated without cause after the merger is consummated. 

        The
board of directors of each of Gart and The Sports Authority was aware of these interests and considered them in making their recommendations. 

No Dissenters' or Appraisal Rights (Page 52)    

        Under Delaware law, no dissenters' or appraisal rights are available to Gart's or The Sports Authority's stockholders in connection with the merger. 

Trading of Gart Common Stock (Page 52)  

        Gart common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "GRTS." In the merger agreement, Gart agreed to change its name to "The
Sports Authority, Inc." and to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the common stock of the combined company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "TSA" as of or
prior to the effective time of the merger. If Gart's application for listing on the New York Stock Exchange is successful, the common stock of the combined company, which will include the shares of
Gart common stock issued by Gart in connection with the merger, will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Gart common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market. If Gart's
application for listing on the New York Stock Exchange is not successful, the combined company's common stock, including the shares of common stock issued by Gart in connection with the merger, will
be listed on the Nasdaq National Market. 

Risk Factors (Page 16)    

        In addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, you should carefully consider the
factors discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors," commencing on page 16 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus in deciding whether to vote in favor of the merger proposals.

Gart Selected Consolidated Financial Data    

        The selected consolidated financial data presented below for each of the fiscal years in the five-year period ended February 1, 2003 are
derived from Gart's audited consolidated financial statements for each of the fiscal years in the five-year period ended February 1, 2003. This data should be read in conjunction
with Gart's consolidated financial statements, the accompanying notes and the sections of Gart's annual reports entitled, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations," all of which have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and incorporated into this joint proxy statement/prospectus by reference. 

        Gart's
2002 fiscal year began on February 3, 2002 and ended on February 1, 2003 and included 52 weeks of operations, Gart's 2001 fiscal year began on February 4,
2001 and ended on February 2, 2002 and included 52 weeks of operations, Gart's 2000 fiscal year began on January 30, 2000 and ended on February 3, 2001 and included 53 weeks of

and ended on January 30, 1999 and included 52 weeks of operations. 

        The
results for Gart's 2001 fiscal year are not comparable to the other periods presented, due to the inclusion of Oshman's results of operations, since June 7, 2001, the date of
acquisition. The results for Gart's 2000 fiscal year, although it includes a fifty-third week of operations, and Gart's 1999 and 1998 fiscal years are considered comparable to each other. For more

repurchased in fiscal 2000, The Sports Authority recorded no income tax provision in fiscal years 2002, 2001 or 2000 due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and the net reversal of
other tax deductible differences to offset taxable income.

Comparative Per Share Data    

        The following table shows, for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2003, (1) the historical net income and book value per share of Gart common stock
and the historical net income and book value per share of The Sports Authority common stock in comparison with the unaudited pro forma combined net income and book value per share after giving effect
to Gart's proposed merger with The Sports Authority and
(2) the equivalent historical net income and book value per share attributable to 0.37 of a share of Gart common stock, which will be received for each share of The Sports Authority common
stock. 

        The
historical book value per share data is computed by dividing stockholders' equity by the number of shares of Gart common stock or The Sports Authority common stock in each case
outstanding at the end of each period. The pro forma book value per share data is computed by dividing pro forma stockholder's equity by the pro forma number of shares of Gart common stock outstanding
at the end of each period. The Sports Authority's equivalent pro forma combined net income per share and book value per share amounts are calculated by multiplying Gart's pro forma combined net income
per share and book value by 0.37, the exchange ratio used in the merger. 

        The
following information should be read in conjunction with (1) the separate historical consolidated financial statements and related notes of Gart and The Sports Authority
incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and (2) the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information and related notes of the combined company commencing
on page 67 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the selected consolidated financial data of each of Gart and The Sports Authority commencing on pages 9 and 11, respectively, of
this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes only, and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial position that
would have occurred if the merger with The Sports Authority had been completed as of the beginning of the earliest period presented, nor is it necessarily indicative of the future operating results or
financial position of the combined company. No cash dividends have been declared or paid on Gart common stock or The Sports Authority common stock for the last five fiscal years of each company.

        Stockholders
are urged to obtain current market quotations. 

        In
the merger agreement, Gart has agreed to change its name to "The Sports Authority, Inc." and to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the common stock of the combined
company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Gart intends to apply to list the common stock of the combined company on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "TSA." If the common stock
of the combined company is approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, Gart will delist its common stock from the Nasdaq National Market. 

Risk Factors    

Both the merger and an investment in Gart common stock involve a high degree of risk. By voting in favor of the merger, The Sports
Authority's current stockholders will be choosing to invest in Gart common stock, and Gart's current stockholders will be choosing to combine The Sports Authority's business with Gart's business and
to dilute their percentage ownership interest in Gart. In addition to the other information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this joint proxy statement/prospectus, you should consider
carefully the following risk factors in deciding whether to vote in favor of the merger or the related issuance of shares of Gart common stock and amendment to Gart's certificate of
incorporation.

Risks Related to the Merger    

 The number of shares of Gart common stock to be received by The Sports Authority's stockholders in the merger will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of Gart common stock or The Sports
Authority common stock.  

        In the merger, The Sports Authority's stockholders will receive 0.37 of a share of Gart common stock in exchange for each share of The Sports Authority common
stock. This exchange ratio is a fixed number and will not be adjusted for subsequent changes in the market price of either Gart common stock or The Sports Authority common stock. Neither party may
terminate the merger agreement solely because of changes in the market price of Gart common stock or The Sports Authority common stock. Consequently, the specific dollar value of Gart common stock to
be received by The Sports Authority's stockholders will depend on the market value of Gart common stock at the time of completion of the merger. The merger may not be completed immediately following
the special meeting of The Sports Authority's stockholders if all conditions have not been satisfied or waived. We cannot assure you that the value of the Gart common stock that The Sports Authority's
stockholders will receive in the merger will not decline before or after the completion of the merger. 

 Integration of Gart and The Sports Authority may be difficult and expensive to achieve.  

        The merger involves the integration of companies that have previously operated independently. The integration will be a complex, time consuming and expensive
process and may materially harm Gart's and The Sports Authority's respective businesses if not completed in a timely and efficient manner. We may not be able to integrate the operations of our
companies without encountering difficulties, including possible unanticipated costs, failure to retain key employees, the diversion of management attention or failure to integrate our information
systems. In addition, following the merger, the combined company may not realize the increased revenues and cost savings that Gart and The Sports Authority expect to achieve or that would justify the
investment made. 

 Gart's and The Sports Authority's officers and directors have conflicts of interest that may have influenced them to support or approve the merger.  

        Gart's and The Sports Authority's officers and directors participate in arrangements that provide them with interests in the merger that are different from, or in
addition to, yours. The board of directors of each of Gart and The Sports Authority was aware of these interests and considered them in approving the merger agreement and the merger. Gart's
stockholders and The Sports Authority's stockholders should consider, however, whether these interests may have influenced these officers and directors to support or approve the merger. You should
read more about these interests under the section entitled "The Merger and Related TransactionsInterests of Certain Persons in the Merger," commencing on page 44 of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus. 

 Uncertainties associated with the merger may cause Gart and The Sports Authority to lose key personnel.  

        Gart's and The Sports Authority's current personnel may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. This uncertainty may adversely
affect The Sports Authority's and Gart's ability to attract and retain key personnel. Additionally, our ability to successfully integrate the two companies may be adversely affected if a significant
number of Gart's or The Sports Authority's key personnel depart before or after the completion of the merger, which would adversely affect the combined company's business and results of operations.
Gart has entered into three-year employment agreements with John Douglas Morton, currently Gart's chairman, president and chief executive officer, and Martin E. Hanaka, currently The
Sports Authority's chairman and chief executive officer, which will be effective upon consummation of the merger, and intends to enter into employment agreements with several other senior executives
of the two companies. For a description of the foregoing employment agreements, see the section entitled "Related AgreementsGart Employment Agreements," commencing on page 64 of
this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

 The costs of the merger could adversely affect combined financial results.  

        We estimate that we will incur, in addition to costs already incurred in connection with the merger, direct transaction costs of approximately $54 million
in connection with the merger, including approximately $25 million in connection with severance payments, approximately $19 million in connection with third-party advisors and printing
fees and approximately $10 million in connection with costs of relocating current employees of The Sports Authority to Colorado. In addition, Gart has established a reserve of approximately
$42 million in connection with stores that the parties expect to close. If the benefits of the merger do not exceed the costs associated with the merger, including any dilution to the
stockholders of both companies resulting from the issuance of shares in connection with the merger, the combined company's financial results, including earnings per share, could be adversely affected. 

Risks Related to Gart and The Sports Authority    

Except as otherwise specified, the following risk factors relate to the businesses of each of Gart and The Sports Authority prior to the
merger. If the merger is not completed for any reason, each company expects to continue to be subject to such risks, in addition to other risks to which each company is subject. If the merger is
completed, the combined company will be subject to the risks of each of Gart and The Sports Authority.

 Intense competition in the sporting goods industry could limit our growth and reduce our profitability.  

        The sporting goods retail market is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. Our current and prospective competitors include many large companies that have
substantially greater market presence, name recognition, financial, marketing and other resources than we do separately or on a combined basis. We compete directly or indirectly with the following
categories of companies: 


full-line
sporting goods retailers;


traditional
sporting goods stores and chains;


specialty
sporting goods retailers and pro shops;


mass
merchandisers, warehouse clubs, discount stores and department stores; and


catalog
and Internet-based retailers. 

        Increased
competition in markets in which we have stores, the adoption by competitors of innovative store formats, pricing strategies and retail sale methods, or the entry of new
competitors or 

the expansion of operations by existing competitors in our markets could cause us to lose market share, limit our growth and reduce our profitability. 

 If we are unable to predict or react to changes in consumer demand, our sales may decline and we may be required to take significant markdowns in inventory.  

        Our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demand and preferences regarding sporting goods. Our products
must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. Additionally, we often make commitments to purchase products from our vendors
several months in advance of the proposed delivery. If we misjudge the market for our merchandise, we may lose sales or we may overstock unpopular products, which may require us to take significant
inventory markdowns. In either case, our revenues and profit margins could significantly decline and our business and financial results may suffer. 

 We sell products that expose us to a greater risk of product liability and infringement claims, and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover damages related to those claims. Additionally, The
Sports Authority faces claims in Illinois relating to its sale of handguns before 1999.  

        We may be subject to lawsuits resulting from injuries associated with the use of sporting goods equipment that we sell or rent. Among other things, Gart sells
long guns, handguns and air pistols and The Sports Authority sells long guns and air pistols (and prior to 1999, handguns), which are products that are associated with an increased risk of injury and
related lawsuits. 

        The
Sports Authority is one of thirty-three named defendants, including firearms manufacturers and retailers, in City of Chicago and County of Cook v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp. et al.,
Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois. This suit was served on The Sports Authority in November 1998. The complaint was
based on legal theories of public nuisance and negligent entrustment of firearms and alleged that the defendants distributed, marketed and sold firearms in the portion of Cook County outside Chicago
that were found illegally in Chicago. The complaint sought damages allocated among the defendants exceeding $433 million to compensate the City of Chicago and Cook County for their alleged
costs resulting from the alleged public nuisance. The complaint also sought punitive damages and injunctive relief imposing additional regulations on the methods the defendants use to distribute,
market and sell firearms in Cook County. In February 2000, the court dismissed the complaint's negligent entrustment count. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint with the court's permission
in March 2000, which contained both the public nuisance and negligent entrustment counts. In September 2000, the court granted the motions of the defendants to dismiss the amended
complaint, in its entirety, with prejudice. In October 2000, the plaintiffs appealed to the Appellate Court of Illinois, First Judicial District, but did not pursue the negligent entrustment
issue. On November 4, 2002, the Appellate Court reversed the dismissal of the amended complaint and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings on the public nuisance issue. On
November 25, 2002, The Sports Authority filed a petition for rehearing with the Appellate Court, which was denied on March 7, 2003. On March 27, 2003, The Sports Authority joined
in the petition for leave to appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court by the other defendants of the Appellate Court's decision reversing the trial court's dismissal of the amended case. The Sports
Authority is currently unable to predict the outcome of this case. 

        There
is a risk that claims or liabilities with respect to lawsuits will exceed our insurance coverage. Additionally, we may be unable to purchase adequate liability insurance in the
future. Although we have entered into product and infringement liability indemnity agreements with many of our vendors, we cannot assure you that we will be able to collect payments sufficient to
offset product liability losses. Furthermore, we are subject to regulation by the Consumer Product Safety Commission and similar state regulatory agencies. If we fail to comply with government and
industry safety standards, we may 

be subject to claims, lawsuits, fines and adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

 If our suppliers and distributors do not provide us with sufficient quantities of products, or if conditions in any of the foreign countries where they source merchandise adversely change, we may not
be able to offer competitively priced merchandise or the quantities or assortment that our customers demand.  

        Gart purchases merchandise from over 1,000 vendors and The Sports Authority purchases merchandise from over 625 vendors, some of which are the same as Gart's
vendors. In fiscal 2002, purchases from Nike represented approximately 11.2% of Gart's total purchases and approximately 12.7% of The Sports Authority's total purchases. Although purchases from no
other vendor represented more than 10% of the total purchases of either Gart or The Sports Authority, our dependence on our principal suppliers involves risk. We do not have long-term
agreements with our suppliers and cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain our relationships with them. If there is a disruption in supply from a principal supplier or distributor, we may be
unable to obtain the merchandise that we desire to sell and that consumers desire to purchase. Moreover, many of our suppliers provide us with incentives, such as return privileges, volume purchasing
allowances and cooperative advertising allowances. A decline or discontinuation of these incentives could reduce our profits. 

        Additionally,
we believe that a significant portion of the products that we purchase, including those purchased from domestic suppliers, are manufactured abroad. Government regulations,
political unrest, war, changes in local economic or labor conditions, trade issues or interruptions or delays in imports could disrupt or delay shipments of merchandise to our stores and cause
shortages in our inventory and a decline in our sales. If one or more of these factors occur, our business and financial results could suffer. 

 Our business is seasonal, and our annual results are highly dependent on the success of our holiday selling season.  

        Our business is highly seasonal in nature. Our highest sales and operating profitability historically occurs during the fourth fiscal quarter, which is due, in
part, to the holiday selling season and, in part, in the case of Gart, to its strong sales of cold weather sporting goods and apparel. Fourth quarter sales comprised approximately 30.1% of Gart's net
sales and approximately 50.1% of Gart's operating income for the 2002 fiscal year, and approximately 27.2% of The Sports Authority's net sales and approximately 56.6% of The Sports Authority's
operating income for the 2002 fiscal year. Any decrease in our fourth quarter sales, whether because of a slow holiday selling season, poor snowfall in ski areas near our markets (principally in the
case of Gart), or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results for the entire fiscal year. 

 A downturn in the economy could significantly reduce our revenues.  

        Sales of sporting goods historically depend on consumers' discretionary spending. An economic downturn in any of our major markets, or in general, could reduce
consumer spending on discretionary items that could adversely impact our revenues and cause our business and financial results to suffer. 

        General
economic conditions are beyond our control and are affected by: 


the
impact of an economic recession;


unemployment
trends;


interest
rates and inflation;


consumer
and commercial credit availability;


consumer
debt levels; 


geopolitical
uncertainty;


tax
rates and tax policy;


the
impact of natural disasters; and


other
factors that influence consumer confidence and spending. 

        Increasing
volatility in financial markets may cause the above factors to change with an even greater degree of frequency and magnitude. 

 The combined company will have a significant amount of debt that could adversely affect its business and growth prospects.  

        The combined company, on a pro forma combined basis, would have had approximately $267 million of long-term debt at February 1, 2003.
The combined company intends to enter into a new credit facility at the completion of the merger that will provide for loans of up to $600 million. This debt could have significant adverse
effects on the business of the combined company. This debt: 


makes
it more difficult for the combined company to obtain additional financing on favorable terms;


requires
the combined company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flows from operations to the repayment of its debt and the interest on its debt;


limits
the combined company's ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities; and


makes
the combined company more vulnerable to economic downturns. 

        If
the combined company is unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future, it may have to refinance all or a portion of its debt and/or obtain additional
financing. We cannot assure you that refinancing or additional financing on favorable terms could be obtained or that the combined company will be able to operate at a profit. 

        Additionally,
the credit facility to be entered into upon consummation of the merger is likely to impose on the combined company, operating and financial restrictions that may impair its
ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to grow its business. 

 Our business depends on our ability to satisfy our labor needs. Additionally, Gart faces wage and hour litigation, which, if determined adversely against it, could have an adverse impact on its
financial performance.  

        Many of our employees are in entry-level or part-time positions that historically have high rates of turnover. We may be unable to satisfy our labor
needs and control our costs due to external factors such as unemployment levels, minimum wage legislation and wage inflation. If general economic conditions improve, it may be more difficult to
attract and retain quality employees. As a result, our business may suffer. 

        In
addition, in June 2000, a former employee of Sportmart brought two class action complaints in California against Gart, alleging several wage and hour claims in violation of the
California Labor Code, California Business and Professional Code Section 17200 and other related matters. One complaint alleges that Gart classified certain managers in its California stores as
exempt from overtime pay when they should have been classified as non-exempt and paid overtime. The second complaint alleges that Gart failed to pay hourly employees in its California
stores for all hours worked. In March 2001, a third class action complaint was filed in the same court in California alleging the same wage and hour violations regarding classification of
certain managers as exempt from overtime pay. In July 2001, a fourth complaint was filed alleging that store managers should also not be classified as 

employees exempt from overtime pay. All the complaints seek unspecified amounts of compensatory damages, punitive damages and penalties. The court denied motions to dismiss the first two complaints
and discovery is currently in progress. At this time, Gart has not ascertained the future liability, if any, of these complaints and has not accrued any reserves relating to these claims. 

 Gart is subject to an income tax contingency that could have an adverse impact on its liquidity.  

        Under the terms of Gart's tax sharing agreement with its former parent, Gart is responsible for its share, on a separate return basis, of any tax liabilities
associated with proposed deficiencies or adjustments and related interest and penalties charged to the controlled group that may arise as a result of an assessment by the Internal Revenue Service. 

        On
July 24, 1997, the Internal Revenue Service proposed adjustments to Gart's and its former parent's (now Thrifty Payless Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary of Rite Aid
Corporation) 1992 and 1993 consolidated federal income tax returns, in conjunction with an Internal Revenue Service examination of Gart's former parent. The proposed adjustments relate to the manner
in which last-in first-out inventories were characterized on these tax returns. On November 1, 2002, in order to eliminate the accrual of additional interest on taxes
owed to the Internal Revenue Service, Gart entered into an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service based upon the terms of the settlement that is currently pending between the Internal Revenue
Service and Gart's former parent. Pursuant to the agreement, Gart paid the Internal Revenue Service taxes of $1.1 million and interest of $0.5 million. In fiscal 2002, Gart utilized
approximately $20.0 million of net operating loss carry forwards to reduce taxable income in connection with its agreement with the IRS. Gart believes this to be a full and complete settlement
of all its separate return issues under review by the Internal Revenue Service. 

        The
Internal Revenue Service settlement with Gart's former parent has not been finalized. Under the terms of Gart's tax sharing agreement with its former parent, Gart could be liable for
amounts that arise out of Gart's former parent's settlement with the Internal Revenue Service. Based on management's discussions with Gart's former parent and Gart's settlement that was reached with
the Internal Revenue Service as described above, Gart believes its portion of the potential accelerated tax liability from the settlement with the Internal Revenue Service by Gart's former parent
ranges from approximately $0 to $3.3 million. Gart has a long term deferred tax liability of $3.3 million recorded for the settlement of this matter. Gart does not expect that any
penalties will be assessed relating to this matter although Gart cannot be certain that penalties will not be assessed. Any accelerated tax liability, including any interest charges and penalties, may
have an adverse impact on Gart's, and after the merger, the combined company's, liquidity. 

 Terrorist attacks or acts of war may seriously harm our business.  

        Terrorist attacks or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to us and our employees, facilities, information systems, vendors, and customers, which could
significantly impact our net sales, costs and expenses, and financial condition. The threat of terrorist attacks in the United States since September 11, 2001 continue to create many economic
and political uncertainties. The potential for future terrorist attacks, the national and international responses to terrorist attacks, and other acts of war or hostility may cause greater uncertainty
and cause our business to suffer in ways that we
currently cannot predict. The military action taken by the United States and its allies against the government of Iraq could have a short or long term negative economic impact upon the financial
markets and our business in general. In addition, events such as those referred to above could cause or contribute to a general decline in equity valuations, which in turn could reduce the market
value of your investment in the combined company. 

 Because an equity owner of a significant stockholder of Gart is a member of the board of directors of one of Gart's and The Sports Authority's competitors, there may be conflicts of interest.  

        Leonard Green currently holds a significant equity interest in Gart and also holds a significant equity interest in Big 5 Sporting Goods, one of Gart's and The
Sports Authority's competitors. Jonathan D. Sokoloff and Jonathan A. Seiffer, equity owners of Leonard Green, currently serve on Gart's board of directors. After the consummation of the merger,
Leonard Green's ownership interest in Gart will be reduced from approximately 26% to approximately 13% and only Mr. Sokoloff will serve on Gart's board of directors. John G. Danhakl, an equity
owner of Leonard Green, currently serves on the board of directors of Big 5 Sporting Goods. Messrs. Seiffer, Sokoloff and Danhakl may have conflicts of interest with respect to various matters
affecting Gart and The Sports Authority, including the pursuit of business opportunities presented to Leonard Green. All potential conflicts may not be resolved in a manner that is favorable to us. We
believe that it is impossible to predict the precise circumstances under which future potential conflicts may arise, and, therefore, we intend to address potential conflicts on a
case-by-case basis. 

 Anti-takeover provisions may prevent stockholders from realizing a premium return.  

        Anti-takeover provisions in the combined company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws may deter unfriendly offers or other efforts to obtain
control over the combined company. These anti-takeover provisions, among other things: 


allow
the combined company's board of directors to issue "blank check" preferred stock without stockholder approval, and establish the rights, including
voting rights, preferences and limitations of the preferred stock;


establish
advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to the board of directors or for stockholder proxy proposals;


permit
the board of directors to increase its own size and fill the resulting vacancies through a majority vote of directors, even if less than a quorum; and


require
that mergers and other business combinations with certain interested stockholders, including any holder of 10% or more common stock, be approved by a
supermajority of the holders of common stock that are not interested in the transaction. 

        Section 203
of the Delaware General Corporate Law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between the combined company and any holder of 15% or more
of the combined company's common stock. 

        These
measures could make the combined company less attractive to a potential acquiror and deprive stockholders of the opportunity to sell their common stock at a premium price. 

 Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate substantially, which may adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock, particularly if our quarterly results fall below the
expectations of securities analysts.  

        Our sales and results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may vary from quarter to quarter in the future. These fluctuations may adversely affect our
business, financial condition and the market price of our common stock, particularly if our quarterly results fall below the expectations of securities analysts. A number of factors, many of which are
outside our control, may cause variations in our quarterly net sales and operating results, including: 


changes
in consumer demand for the products that we offer in our stores;


pre-opening
costs associated with new stores; 


costs
related to the closures of existing stores;


litigation;


changes
in merchandise mix;


sales
and promotional events sponsored by our competitors; and


general
economic conditions. 

 The stock price of each of Gart and The Sports Authority has been and may remain volatile, and the value of our common stock may decline as a result of this volatility.  

        The market price of the common stock of Gart and The Sports Authority has been in the past, and may in the future be, subject to wide fluctuations in response to
factors such as: 


fluctuations
in quarterly operating results;


announcements,
by us or our competitors, of actual or expected financial results, significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures
or capital commitments;


changes
in recommendations or financial estimates by securities analysts;


conditions
and trends in the sporting goods industry; and


general
conditions in the economy or the financial markets. 

        Additionally,
in recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, which are often unrelated to the performance or condition of particular
companies. Such broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company's securities,
securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company. If we become subject to this kind of litigation in
the future, it could result in substantial litigation costs, damages awards against us, and the diversion of our management's attention and resources. 

 The loss of key executives could have a material adverse effect on our business.  

        Our future success depends on the continued services of our senior management, particularly John Douglas Morton, who will be the combined company's vice chairman
and chief executive officer, and Martin E. Hanaka, who will be the combined company's chairman. Any loss or interruption of the services of our senior management could significantly reduce our ability
to effectively manage our operations and implement our key initiatives because we cannot assure you that we would be able to find appropriate replacements for our senior management should the need
arise. Gart has entered into three-year employment agreements with each of Mr. Morton and Mr. Hanaka, which will be effective upon consummation of the merger, and intends to
enter into employment agreements with several other senior executives of the two companies. For a description of these employment agreements, see the section entitled "Related
AgreementsGart Employment Agreements," commencing on page 64 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The Sports Authority is currently party to an employment agreement with
Mr. Hanaka that will be terminated upon consummation of the merger. If we were to lose any key senior management, our business could be materially adversely affected. 

 We rely on our information systems to operate our business and if our information systems fail to adequately perform these functions, our businesses and financial results could be adversely affected.  

        The efficient operation of our business is dependent on the successful integration and operation of our information systems. In particular, we rely on our
information systems to effectively manage our sales, warehousing, distribution, merchandise planning and replenishment and to optimize our overall 

inventory levels. Most of our information systems are centrally located at our respective headquarters, with offsite backup at other locations. Some of The Sports Authority's systems have not been
fully implemented and require additional configuration, testing and user training before they become fully operational. The failure to successfully integrate our information systems or their failure
to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business, adversely affect our revenues and cause our business and financial results to suffer. 

 A disruption in the operation of our distribution centers would affect our ability to deliver merchandise to our stores, which could adversely impact our revenues and harm our business and financial
results.  

        Most of our merchandise is shipped by our vendors to a limited number of distribution centers. Our distribution centers receive and allocate merchandise to our
stores. Events such as fire or other catastrophic events, any malfunction or disruption of our centralized information systems or shipping problems may result in delays or disruptions in the timely
distribution of merchandise to our stores, which could adversely impact our revenues and our business and financial results. 

        The
Sports Authority is in the process of opening a new distribution center in Burlington, New Jersey. The ability of The Sports Authority to establish this new regional distribution
center will depend on the ability of third parties to prepare the facility for use, successful integration of its warehouse management systems and the availability of an adequate labor force. In
addition, the success of this and other supply chain initiatives is heavily dependent on the implementation and consistent execution of new processes and the use of new systems capabilities by The
Sports Authority's merchandising and supply chain personnel. The Sports Authority's new distribution center may not enable it to improve the flow of merchandise to its stores or improve its inventory
management. 

The Merger and Related Transactions    

Background of the Merger    

        Gart and The Sports Authority are both participants in the retail sporting goods industry and, accordingly, members of the senior management of Gart and The
Sports Authority have been familiar with each other for several years. From time to time they have had preliminary discussions regarding a possible business combination of Gart and The Sports
Authority. 

        During
August and September 2002, investment banking firms separately contacted Gart and The Sports Authority and suggested several possible strategic and financing transactions,
including the possibility of a combination of Gart and The Sports Authority. In September 2002, Credit Suisse First Boston, financial advisor to The Sports Authority, had telephone
conversations with representatives of Leonard Green (which owns approximately 26% of Gart's shares) regarding a possible combination of Gart and The Sports Authority. 

        In
October 2002, while at an industry association board meeting, John Douglas Morton, Gart's chief executive officer, and Martin E. Hanaka, The Sports Authority's chief executive
officer, again raised the possibility that Gart and The Sports Authority might explore a business combination. 

        During
October and November 2002, Banc of America Securities, financial advisor to Gart, and Credit Suisse First Boston held several discussions on behalf of Gart and The Sports
Authority regarding a possible business combination of the two companies. Gart, through Banc of America Securities, proposed a "merger of equals" of Gart and The Sports Authority that would result in
50% of Gart's fully diluted common stock being owned by its current stockholders and 50% by current stockholders of The Sports Authority. The financial advisors also discussed on behalf of their
clients additional terms of the possible transaction, including that following the merger the combined company's board of directors would consist of an equal number of directors chosen by each of Gart
and The Sports Authority and that the combined company would be headquartered in Englewood, Colorado and be named "The Sports Authority." They also discussed that Mr. Hanaka would be the
chairman of the board, Mr. Morton would be the chief executive officer and other members of senior management of the
combined company would be chosen from existing management of Gart and The Sports Authority. The financial advisors noted that any agreement on these issues would depend on several factors, including
due diligence, the negotiation of financial terms and transaction documents and approval by the companies' respective boards. 

        On
November 1, 2002, The Sports Authority's board of directors reviewed and discussed with Credit Suisse First Boston the preliminary discussion that had taken place between
Credit Suisse First Boston and Banc of America Securities, including financial implications and other issues in connection with the possible transaction with Gart, and appropriate next steps. It was
the consensus of The Sports Authority's board that it, through Credit Suisse First Boston, should continue to engage in discussion with Banc of America Securities about a possible transaction with
Gart. 

        On
November 20, 2002, the board of directors of The Sports Authority met again with Credit Suisse First Boston to discuss the possible transaction with Gart and authorized Credit
Suisse First Boston to continue discussions with Gart. 

        On
November 25, 2002, the companies executed a confidentiality agreement and agreed to meet to discuss a possible business combination. 

        On
November 26, 2002, Gart's board of directors held a meeting to discuss the potential business combination with The Sports Authority. At the meeting, Gart's management outlined
the terms of a possible transaction and informed the board of activities being undertaken in connection with the possible transaction. Following a discussion of the issues, the board authorized
management to proceed with discussions regarding a combination with The Sports Authority. 

        On
December 4, 2002, senior management of the two companies, together with representatives of Banc of America Securities and Credit Suisse First Boston, met to continue
discussions of a possible transaction, including an overview of their respective businesses and a schedule for conducting due diligence. 

        On
December 6, 2002, Gart and The Sports Authority executed an exclusivity letter in which both parties agreed that they would not negotiate a business combination with any third
parties through January 15, 2003 or any earlier termination of discussions. 

        Representatives
of the two companies, together with their financial advisors and Clifford Chance US LLP, counsel to Gart, met in New York on December 12, 2002, to make
presentations to each other
regarding their respective businesses. On December 16, 2002, each of Gart and The Sports Authority commenced due diligence reviews of the other company. 

        On
December 17, 2002, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, counsel to The Sports Authority, delivered a draft merger agreement to Gart's representatives. Shortly thereafter, Morgan
Lewis delivered a proposed stockholder's agreement pursuant to which directors and executive officers of both companies and Leonard Green would agree to vote in favor of the proposals relating to the
merger. The parties commenced negotiation of the terms of these agreements. 

        On
December 18, 2002, the board of directors of The Sports Authority met and further discussed the possible merger with Gart, the status of the due diligence and the negotiations. 

        Extensive
due diligence continued between December 2002 and mid-February 2003. During the same period, the parties and their advisors continued to meet and
negotiate the terms of the transaction and the proposed operation of the combined company. These negotiations included discussions of the financial terms of the transaction, deal protection issues
(including the need for Leonard Green to enter into a stockholder's agreement), employment arrangements for senior management and closing conditions. 

        On
January 28, 2003, the board of directors of The Sports Authority met to discuss the transaction. The Sports Authority's management, financial advisor, counsel and independent
accountants discussed with the board the results of the financial, legal and accounting due diligence conducted to date, and the status of due diligence efforts on behalf of both parties. The board
also discussed with The Sports Authority's financial advisor the financial aspects of the proposed transaction, and counsel discussed the status of negotiations and the principal issues being
negotiated. The board authorized management to continue negotiations with Gart and to report back to the board. 

        On
February 3, 2003, Gart's board of directors met to discuss the transaction. After discussions with management and Gart's legal and financial advisors and independent
accountants, the board authorized management to continue negotiations with The Sports Authority with a view toward negotiating a definitive merger agreement for submission to the board for its
consideration. 

        On
February 9, 2003, the board of directors of The Sports Authority held a meeting at which it was advised by The Sports Authority's management and financial and legal advisors
regarding the status of the negotiations of a merger agreement with Gart, and by The Sports Authority's independent accountants regarding accounting due diligence. In addition, the
non-employee directors of The Sports Authority met separately to discuss the status of negotiations of the proposed employment contract between Mr. Hanaka and Gart. 

        During
February, Gart and The CIT Group/Business Credit, Inc. (the agent under Gart's existing credit facility) negotiated the terms of a commitment letter under which CIT would
provide a credit facility to the combined company following the merger. See the section entitled "The Merger and Related TransactionsFinancing of the Combined Company Following the
Merger," commencing on page 46 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Gart and The Sports Authority discussed the terms of 

the financing and the terms of a closing condition in the merger agreement relating to financing. They also decided not to require directors or executive officers of either company to enter into
stockholder's agreements. 

        On
February 16, 2003, Gart's board of directors held a meeting to discuss the transaction and to hear presentations from management, Gart's financial and legal advisors and
independent accountants. 

        On
February 19, 2003, the contemplated 50%-50% equity split implied an exchange ratio of approximately 0.37 of a share of Gart common stock for each share of The Sports Authority
common stock. 

        On
February 19, 2003, the board of directors of The Sports Authority held a meeting at which The Sports Authority's management and financial and legal advisors made presentations
on the negotiations that had taken place prior to the board meeting. The board was presented with and discussed the following proposed terms of the transaction that were the result of the negotiations
between the representatives and advisors of the two companies: an exchange ratio of 0.37, the proposed deal protection features, the proposed CIT credit facility and the Leonard Green fee that had
been negotiated by Gart's independent directors. For a more detailed description of this fee, see the section entitled "The Merger and Related TransactionsInterests of Certain Persons in
the Merger," commencing on page 44 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. In addition, the non-employee directors of The Sports Authority who had met separately prior to the
board meeting announced to the full board of directors that they had reviewed and approved the proposed contract between Mr. Hanaka and Gart. Credit Suisse First Boston rendered its oral
opinion to the board, which opinion was subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion dated February 19, 2003, to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the
matters stated in its opinion, the exchange ratio of 0.37 of a share of Gart common stock for each share of The Sports Authority common stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders
of The Sports Authority common stock. For a more complete discussion of Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion, see the section entitled "The Merger and Related TransactionsOpinion of The
Sports Authority's Financial Advisor," commencing on page 38 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. After extensive deliberation, the board of directors of The Sports Authority unanimously
determined that the merger was fair to and in the best interests of its stockholders, approved the merger agreement subject to the execution of a stockholder's agreement (which was then approved by
the board) by Leonard Green and a revision to the financing condition in the merger agreement to increase the likelihood that the transaction would close. The board of directors also amended The
Sports Authority rights agreement so that it would not apply to the merger with Gart. 

        The
Sports Authority reported to Gart that its board of directors had met and was prepared to execute a merger agreement containing an exchange ratio of 0.37 of a share of Gart common
stock for each
share of The Sports Authority common stock, provided that Leonard Green agree to the proposed stockholder's agreement and that Gart agree to the proposed revision to the financing condition in the
merger agreement. 

        On
February 19, 2003, Gart's board of directors held a meeting at which Gart's management and financial and legal advisors made presentations, including as to the exchange ratio
and The Sports Authority's proposed provisions. At the meeting, representatives of Banc of America Securities rendered its oral opinion, which opinion was subsequently confirmed by delivery of its
written opinion dated February 19, 2003, that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions and limitations set forth in its written opinion, the exchange ratio of 0.37 of a
share of Gart common stock per share of common stock of The Sports Authority was fair, from a financial point of view, to Gart. For a more complete discussion of Banc of America Securities' opinion,
see the section entitled "The Merger and Related TransactionsOpinion of Gart's Financial Advisor," commencing on page 32 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. After further
deliberation with its management and its legal 

advisors, Gart's board of directors determined, among other things, that the terms and conditions of the merger were fair to, and in the best interests of, Gart and its stockholders and unanimously
approved the merger, the merger agreement, the stockholder's agreement with Leonard Green, the employment arrangements for senior management and the transactions contemplated as a result of these
matters. 

        Later
in the evening of February 19, 2003, Gart and The Sports Authority executed the merger agreement, The Sports Authority and Leonard Green executed the stockholder's agreement
and Gart entered into employment agreements with Douglas Morton and Martin Hanaka. The employment agreements will become effective upon consummation of the merger. For a discussion of these
agreements, see the section entitled "Related Agreements," commencing on page 63 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

        On
February 20, 2003, before the markets opened, Gart and The Sports Authority issued a joint press release announcing the merger. 

Recommendation of Gart's Board of Directors    

        After careful consideration, Gart's board of directors unanimously determined the merger to be fair to, and in the best interests of, Gart's stockholders. Gart's
board of directors approved the merger agreement and unanimously recommends that Gart's stockholders vote "FOR" the amendments to Gart's certificate of incorporation to change its name and increase
its authorized capital stock and the issuance of Gart common stock to The Sports Authority's shareholders in the merger. 

Gart's Reasons for the Merger    

        Gart's board of directors believes that the merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, Gart and its stockholders because it believes that, as a result of
this strategic merger, the long-term value to Gart's stockholders of an investment in the combined company will likely be superior to the long-term value of an investment in
Gart as a stand-alone company. In deciding to approve the merger agreement, including the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement, and to recommend the merger to Gart's stockholders, Gart's
board of directors considered various factors, including the following: 


the
board's belief that the combination would create a pre-eminent sporting goods retailer;


the
merger would enable the combined company to realize significant operating synergies and cost savings, including increased purchasing power with its
vendors, improved merchandising opportunities, reduced corporate overhead as a percentage of sales, maximization of profitability of new store growth in existing markets, expanded distribution
networks and the consolidation of sales and marketing organizations;


the
combination would create a national sporting goods retailer, melding the complementary geographic footprints of Gart and The Sports Authority, and
operating approximately 385 stores in 45 states with combined 2002 sales of $2.5 billion;


the
opportunity for enhanced brands offering, given the potential for the expansion of premium brands into all stores and the ability to strengthen vendor
relationships and gain volume discounts with key national brands and use the best practices of each company in marketing;


the
combination would enable the combined company to offer a broader selection of sporting goods to a greater number of consumers at competitive prices;


competitive
conditions in the sporting goods retail sector, including the continued expansion of a number of competitors, in particular, sporting goods
retailers and mass merchandisers, and the 

board's
belief that the combined company would be better able to compete over the long term than would Gart on a stand-alone basis; 


the
opportunity for private label expansion, leveraging The Sports Authority's hardlines expertise and Gart's softline expertise and leveraging the size of
the combined company to facilitate new product offerings and lower costs;


the
board's understanding of current market and industry conditions;


the
board's belief that the merger could result in a higher market valuation of Gart's assets, revenues and cash flows;


the
analyses and presentations of Banc of America Securities and Banc of America Securities' opinion to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and
based upon and subject to the assumptions and limitations set forth therein, the exchange ratio in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to Gart as described more fully in the section
entitled "The Merger and Related TransactionsOpinion of Gart's Financial Advisor," commencing on page 32 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus;


the
terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including the provisions that restrict each company's ability, subject to the conditions and procedures
described in the merger agreement, to enter into transactions with other potential acquirors;


that
Gart's management has previously demonstrated an ability to successfully execute and integrate business combinations; and


that
Leonard Green, the largest holder of Gart common stock, agreed to support the merger. 

        Gart's
board of directors also considered the principal potential detriments of the merger to Gart and its stockholders, including the following: 


the
risk that the potential benefits sought in the merger might not be fully realized;


the
potential adverse effects on Gart's business, operations and financial condition that might result if the merger is not completed following public
announcement of the merger agreement;


the
risk that, although Gart has the right to terminate the agreement if a third party makes a superior proposal for a business combination with Gart, the
termination fee payable by Gart in such a situation would discourage such a proposal and limit Gart's ability to pursue alternative transactions;


the
costs associated with the merger, as more fully described in the section entitled "Risk FactorsRisks Related to the MergerThe
costs of the merger could adversely affect combined financial results," commencing on page 16 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus;


the
difficulties of integrating Gart and The Sports Authority, including integration of the management teams and cultures of both companies, and the
management effort and costs required to complete the integration following the merger;


that,
as a result of the merger, the existing obligations and liabilities of The Sports Authority, whether contingent or otherwise, would be borne in part by
Gart's stockholders as a result of becoming stockholders of the combined company; and


the
other applicable risks described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus in the section entitled "Risk Factors," commencing on page 16 of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

        Gart's
board considered these negative factors, but concluded that, on balance, the potential benefits to Gart and its stockholders of the merger outweighed the risks associated with the
merger. The board voted unanimously in favor of the transaction. 

        The
discussion above is not intended to be exhaustive, but Gart believes that it includes all material factors considered by Gart's board of directors in connection with its evaluation
of the merger. In light of the number of factors and the variety of information that Gart's board of directors considered, the board did not find it practicable to, and did not, assign any specific or
relative weights to the factors listed above. Additionally, individual directors may have assigned differing weights to different factors. The board of directors was aware of the interests of Gart's
management in the merger, as described in the section entitled "The Merger and Related TransactionsInterests of Certain Persons in the Merger," commencing on page 44 of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus. 

Recommendation of The Sports Authority's Board of Directors    

        After careful consideration, The Sports Authority's board of directors unanimously determined the merger to be fair to, and in the best interests of, The Sports
Authority's stockholders. The Sports Authority's board of directors unanimously approved the merger agreement and unanimously recommends that The Sports Authority's stockholders vote "FOR" the
adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the merger. 

The Sports Authority's Reasons for the Merger    

        The Sports Authority's board of directors believes that the merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, The Sports Authority and its stockholders because it
believes that, as a result of this strategic merger, the long-term value to The Sports Authority's stockholders of an investment in the combined company will likely be superior to the
long-term value of an investment in The Sports Authority as a stand-alone company. In deciding to approve the merger agreement, including the transactions contemplated in the merger
agreement, and to recommend the merger to The Sports Authority's stockholders, The Sports Authority's board of directors considered various factors, including the following: 


the
exchange ratio, which the board believed to be fair in relation to market prices for The Sports Authority and Gart common shares over both recent and
extended periods of time;


the
board's belief that as a consequence of the merger a higher valuation of The Sports Authority's assets, revenues and cash flow could result;


the
expectation that the combination would enable the combined company to realize substantial operating synergies and cost savings, including increased
purchasing power with its vendors, improved merchandising opportunities, reduced corporate overhead as a percentage of sales and improved supply chain efficiency;


the
complementary locations of the stores operated by The Sports Authority and Gart, and that the combination would give the combined company a broader
national presence with the capability of national advertising for the "Sports Authority" brand;


the
combination would enable the combined company to offer a broader selection of sporting goods to a greater number of consumers at competitive prices;
including that the combination would create opportunities for enhanced brand offerings, given the potential for the expansion of premium brands into all stores;


the
combination would create opportunities for private label expansion, leveraging The Sports Authority's hardlines expertise and Gart's winter and outdoor
expertise;


the
combination would improve the combined company's access to financial resources;


the
combination would enable the acceleration of The Sports Authority's store remodel program; 


the
increased growth potential (and the opportunity for The Sports Authority's stockholders to participate in such growth) that may result from a combination
of The Sports Authority and Gart, including as a result of the combined company's improved asset base, geographic diversification, portfolio of growth opportunities, operating skills, financial
stability and strength;


competitive
conditions in the sporting goods retail sector, including the continued expansion of a number of competitors, in particular, sporting goods
retailers and mass merchandisers, and the board's belief that the combined company would be better able to compete over the long term than would The Sports Authority on a stand-alone basis;


the
board's belief that the merger is the best strategic alternative available to The Sports Authority at this time. In making such determination, the board
considered the following strategic alternatives and constraints: (a) continued pursuit of The Sports Authority's long-term strategic plan as a stand-alone company, (b) the
business and financial attributes of Gart compared to other possible strategic merger candidates, (c) the likelihood of future consolidation in the retail sporting goods industry and
(d) the constraints on The Sports Authority's ability to take advantage of available acquisition and expansion opportunities due to The Sports Authority's current size and financial
circumstances;


that
implementation of The Sports Authority's long-term strategic plan is subject to risks and uncertainties;


that
the combined company's board of directors will consist of nine directors, four of whom are to be designated by The Sports Authority, four of whom are to
be designated by Gart and a ninth director who is to be unaffiliated with either company;


that
various senior officers of The Sports Authority will serve in senior management positions in the combined company;


the
terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including provisions that restrict each company's ability, subject to the conditions and procedures
described in the merger agreement, to enter into transactions with other potential acquirors;


that
the completion of the merger will be on a tax-free basis to The Sports Authority stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except
for cash received in lieu of fractional shares; and


the
opinion given by Credit Suisse First Boston to The Sports Authority board of directors dated February 19, 2003, regarding the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to holders of The Sports Authority common stock of the exchange ratio provided for in the merger, as described more fully in the section entitled "The Merger and Related
TransactionsOpinion of The Sports Authority's Financial Advisor," commencing on page 38 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

        The
Sports Authority's board of directors also considered the principal potential detriments of the merger to The Sports Authority and its stockholders, including the following: 


that
the merger would be effected at a time when The Sports Authority's stock was trading below its previous high levels and at a time before the company's
strategic plans had been fully implemented and its expected benefits fully achieved;


the
risk that the merger might not be consummated, and the potential implications to The Sports Authority's business, operations, financial conditions and
employee morale and attrition in that event;


the
risk that, although The Sports Authority has the right to terminate the merger agreement if a third party makes a superior proposal for a business
combination with The Sports Authority, 

the
termination fee provisions of the merger agreement would have the effect of discouraging such a proposal and limits the ability of The Sports Authority to pursue alternative transactions; 


that,
as a result of the merger, the existing obligations and liabilities of Gart, whether contingent or otherwise, would be borne in part by The Sports
Authority's stockholders as a result of becoming stockholders of the combined company; and


the
other applicable risks described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus in the section entitled "Risk Factors," commencing on page 16 of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

        The
Sports Authority's board of directors determined, however, that these detriments were substantially offset by the potential benefits of the merger summarized above, including the
opportunity for The Sports Authority's stockholders to share in the benefits of the combined company's long-term prospects. 

        In
reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and to recommend the adoption of the merger to The Sports Authority's stockholders, The Sports Authority's board of directors did
not view any single factor as determinative, and did not find it necessary or practicable to assign relative or specific weights to the various factors considered. Further, individual directors may
have given differing weights to different factors. The board of directors was aware of the interests of The Sports Authority's management in the merger, as described in the section entitled "The
Merger and Related TransactionsInterests of Certain Persons in the Merger," commencing on page 44 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, in determining to approve the merger
agreement. 

Opinion of Gart's Financial Advisor    

        Gart retained Banc of America Securities to act as its financial advisor in connection with the merger. Banc of America Securities is an internationally
recognized investment banking firm and regularly engages in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. Gart selected Banc of America Securities to act as its financial advisor on the
basis of Banc of America Securities' experience and expertise in transactions similar to the merger, its reputation in the investment community and its familiarity with Gart's business and its
long-standing working relationship with Gart. 

        In
connection with Banc of America Securities' engagement as financial advisor to Gart, Gart requested that Banc of America Securities render an opinion to Gart's board of directors as
to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Gart of the exchange ratio in the merger. On February 19, 2003, Banc of America Securities delivered its oral opinion, which opinion was
subsequently confirmed by delivery of its written opinion dated February 19, 2003, to Gart's board of directors that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions and
limitations summarized below, the exchange ratio in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to Gart. 

The full text of Banc of America Securities' written opinion to Gart's board of directors, dated February 19, 2003, is attached as Annex C to this joint
proxy statement/prospectus. This opinion sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, other matters considered and limitations of the review undertaken. We incorporate the Banc of America
Securities opinion in its entirety into this document and this section by reference and urge you to read the opinion carefully and in its entirety. This section is only a summary of the Banc of
America Securities opinion and as a summary is qualified by reference to, and not a substitute for, the full text of the opinion.

Banc of America Securities' analyses and opinion were prepared for and addressed to Gart's board of directors and are directed only to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to Gart of the exchange ratio provided for in connection with the merger as of the date of the opinion and do not constitute an opinion as to the merits of the merger or a
recommendation to any stockholder as to  

 how to vote on the proposed merger. The exchange ratio was determined through negotiations between Gart and The Sports Authority and not pursuant to recommendations of Banc of America Securities. In
furnishing its opinion, Banc of America Securities did not admit that it is an "expert" as that term is used in the Securities Act of 1933, nor did Banc of America Securities admit that its opinion
constitutes a report or valuation within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933. Statements to that effect are included in the Banc of America Securities opinion.

        In

reviewed
certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of The Sports Authority and Gart, respectively;

        In
conducting its review and arriving at its opinion, Banc of America Securities assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the financial
and other information reviewed by it for the purposes of the opinion. With respect to the financial forecasts, 

including information relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the merger, Banc of America Securities assumed that they were reasonably prepared on bases
reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the future financial performance of The Sports Authority and Gart. Banc of America Securities did not make any independent
valuation or appraisal of The Sports Authority's assets or liabilities, nor was Banc of America Securities furnished with any such appraisals. In addition, Banc of America Securities did not assume
any obligation to conduct, nor did it conduct, any physical inspection of the properties and facilities of Gart or The
Sports Authority. Banc of America Securities assumed that the merger would be consummated as provided in the merger agreement, with full satisfaction of all covenants and conditions and without any
waivers thereof. Banc of America Securities also assumed that, in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or other consents or approvals (contractual or otherwise) for the merger, no
restrictions, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, would be imposed beyond those restrictions to which the parties would be required to agree under the terms of the
merger agreement or that would otherwise have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived from the proposed merger. Banc of America Securities was informed by Gart,
and it assumed, that the merger would be treated as a tax-free reorganization pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 

        As
is customary in the rendering of fairness opinions, Banc of America Securities based its opinion on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to Banc of America Securities as of, February 19, 2003. It was understood that, although subsequent developments may affect Banc of America Securities' opinion, Banc
of America Securities does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. Banc of America Securities' opinion did not address the prices at which Gart common stock will trade
following the announcement or consummation of the merger. The opinion of Banc of America Securities expressed in its opinion letter was provided for the information of Gart's board of directors. Banc
of America Securities expressed no opinion or recommendation as to how the stockholders of Gart and The Sports Authority should vote with respect to the merger. 

        In
accordance with customary investment banking practice, Banc of America Securities employed generally accepted valuation methods in reaching its opinion. The following is a summary of
the material financial analyses that Banc of America Securities utilized in providing its opinion. Some of the summaries of financial analyses are presented in tabular format. In order to understand
the financial analyses used by Banc of America Securities more fully, you should read the tables together with the related text. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the
financial analyses utilized by Banc of America Securities. 

 Contribution Analysis  

        Banc of America Securities compared the pro forma ownership of the combined company to the ownership level implied by the pro forma contribution by each of Gart
and The Sports Authority of 2002E and 2003P sales, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (also referred to as EBITDA) and net income (on a fully taxed basis) to the combined
company assuming completion of the merger. In conducting its analysis, Banc of America Securities utilized estimated and projected operating and financial information provided by the management of
Gart and The Sports Authority and did not take into consideration any synergies anticipated from the merger. 

        The
following table sets forth a summary of the exchange ratios implied by the ownership levels suggested by the selected financial performance benchmarks, as compared to the exchange
ratio in the merger of 0.370.

 Analysis of Selected Publicly Traded Companies  

        Using publicly available and other information, Banc of America Securities compared selected historical and projected operating and financial data of Gart and The
Sports Authority with similar data for Big 5 Sporting Goods, Dick's Sporting Goods, Galyan's Trading and Hibbett Sporting Goods, publicly traded companies engaged in businesses that Banc of America
Securities judged to be generally comparative to those of Gart and The Sports Authority. 

        For
each of these companies, Banc of America Securities calculated the multiples of enterprise value (which Banc of America Securities defined as diluted equity market value plus total
debt, less cash and cash equivalents) to each of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for 2002 and 2003 and price-earnings ratio for 2002 and 2003, yielding the
ranges as set forth below.

        Banc of America Securities then selected a range of 4.5x to 6.5x for 2002E EBITDA and applied this range to the respective operating statistics of Gart and The Sports Authority. This
analysis yielded an implied trading value for Gart common stock of approximately $13.00 to $22.00 per share, as compared to Gart's closing common stock price of $14.94 on February 19, 2003, and
an implied trading value for The Sports Authority common stock of approximately $4.00 to $7.00 per share, as compared to the price per share of The Sports Authority common stock of $5.53 implied by
the exchange ratio. Banc of America Securities also selected a range of 7.0x to 10.0x for 2003P price-earnings ratio and applied this range to the respective operating statistics of Gart and The
Sports Authority. This analysis yielded an implied trading value for Gart common stock of approximately $15.00 to $21.50 per share, as compared to Gart's closing common stock price of $14.94 on
February 19, 2003, and implied trading value for The Sports Authority common stock of approximately $5.00 to $7.00 per share, as compared to the price per share of The Sports Authority common
stock of $5.53 implied by the exchange ratio in the merger. 

        Although
the selected companies were used for comparative purposes, none of such companies is directly comparable to Gart or The Sports Authority. Accordingly, an analysis of the results
of such a comparison is not purely mathematical but instead involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in historical and projected financial and operating characteristics of
the selected companies and other factors that could affect the public trading value of the companies or Gart or The Sports Authority to which they are being compared. 

 Discounted Cash Flow Analysis  

        Banc of America Securities performed discounted cash flow analyses to determine the diluted equity value per share of Gart common stock and The Sports Authority
common stock by using unlevered financial cash flow projections of Gart and The Sports Authority for fiscal year 2003 through fiscal year 2007 prepared by Gart's management. In conducting this
analysis, Banc of America Securities assumed that the companies would perform in accordance with these projections. In calculating the range of terminal values, Banc of America Securities applied a
multiple of 2007 EBITDA, ranging from 4.5x to 6.5x, to Gart and The Sports Authority projected 2007 EBITDA. Banc of America Securities then calculated the present values of the projected cash flows
and the terminal values using weighted-average costs of capital ranging from 11% to 13% for Gart and The Sports Authority. Based on the results of this analysis, Banc of America Securities derived a
reference range of equity values of $23.00 to $27.00 per share for Gart common stock and $8.00 to $12.00 per share for The Sports Authority common stock and an implied exchange ratio range of 0.397 to
0.406, as compared to the exchange ratio in the merger of 0.370. 

 Analysis of Selected Transactions  

        Banc of America Securities analyzed publicly available financial information relating to selected stock-for-stock merger of equals
transactions with equity values in excess of $100,000,000 that were 

completed on or after January 1, 2000 and which Banc of America Securities deemed relevant in evaluating the merger. Banc of America Securities analyzed the following transactions:

        Although
the selected transactions were used for comparison purposes, none of these transactions is directly comparable to the merger, and none of the companies in such transactions is
directly comparable to Gart or The Sports Authority. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of such a comparison is not purely mathematical but instead involves complex considerations and judgments
concerning differences in historical and projected financial and operating characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the acquisition value of such companies or Gart
and The Sports Authority to which they are being compared. 

 Pro Forma Merger Analysis  

        Banc of America Securities performed pro forma analyses of the financial impact of the merger using financial projections of Gart and The Sports Authority and
synergy and integration cost projections for fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2004 prepared by Gart's management. In conducting these analyses, Banc of America Securities assumed that the companies
would perform in accordance with these projections. For fiscal years 2003 and 2004, Banc of America Securities compared the earnings per share of Gart common stock, on a stand-alone basis, to the
earnings per share of the combined company on a pro forma basis. Based on these analyses, the proposed transaction would result in a decrease in earnings on a per share basis in 2003 and an increase
in earnings per share in 2004, as compared to Gart's earnings per share on a stand-alone basis for 2003 and 2004, respectively. 

        The
summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete description of all the analyses performed by Banc of America Securities. The preparation of a fairness opinion involves
various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analyses and the application of these methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, such an opinion is not
readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Banc of America Securities did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it, but rather made
qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly, notwithstanding the separate factors summarized above, Banc of America Securities believes, and has
advised Gart's board of directors, that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and the factors considered by it, without considering all analyses and
factors, could create an incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion. In performing its analyses, Banc of America Securities made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance,
business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Gart and The Sports Authority. These analyses performed by Banc of America Securities are not necessarily
indicative of actual values or future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses. In addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses do not
purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities may actually be sold. Accordingly, such analyses and estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based
upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of Gart and The Sports Authority, Banc of America Securities or any other person assumes
responsibility if future results are materially different from those projected. As mentioned above, the analyses supplied by Banc of America Securities and its opinion were among the factors taken
into consideration by Gart's board of directors in making its decision to enter into the merger agreement and should not be considered as determinative of such decision. 

 Miscellaneous  

        Gart has agreed to pay customary fees to Banc of America Securities for its financial advisory services provided in connection with the transaction. The payment
of a significant portion of these fees is contingent upon the closing of the merger. Gart has also agreed to reimburse Banc of America Securities for all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable fees and disbursements of Banc of America Securities' counsel, and to indemnify Banc of America Securities against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws. 

        Banc
of America Securities and its affiliates have provided and may in the future provide financial advisory and financing services for Gart and have received or may in the future
receive fees for the rendering of these services. Bank of America, N.A., an affiliate of Banc of America Securities, is a lender under The Sports Authority's credit facility. In addition, in the
ordinary course of their businesses, Banc of America Securities and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities of The Sports Authority and Gart for their own account and for the
accounts of their customers, and, accordingly, Banc of America Securities or its affiliates may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. 

Opinion of The Sports Authority's Financial Advisor    

        Credit Suisse First Boston has acted as The Sports Authority's exclusive financial advisor in connection with the merger. The Sports Authority selected Credit
Suisse First Boston based on Credit Suisse First Boston's experience and reputation, and its familiarity with The Sports Authority and its business. Credit Suisse First Boston is an internationally
recognized investment banking firm and is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, negotiated underwritings,
competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. 

        In
connection with Credit Suisse First Boston's engagement, The Sports Authority requested that Credit Suisse First Boston evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of The Sports Authority common stock of the exchange ratio provided for in the merger. On February 19, 2003, at a meeting of The Sports Authority's board of directors held to evaluate
the merger, Credit Suisse First Boston rendered to The Sports Authority's board of directors an oral opinion, which opinion was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated February 19,
2003, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to the matters described in its opinion, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of The Sports
Authority common stock. 

The full text of Credit Suisse First Boston's written opinion, dated February 19, 2003, to The Sports Authority's board of directors, which sets forth the
procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex D and is incorporated into this document by reference. Holders of The Sports
Authority common stock are encouraged to read this opinion carefully in its entirety. Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion is addressed to The Sports Authority's board of directors and relates only to
the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio, does not address any other aspect of the proposed merger or any related transaction and does not constitute a recommendation to any
stockholder as to any matters relating to the merger. The summary of Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion in this document is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
opinion.

        In
arriving at its opinion, Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed the merger agreement and related documents, as well as publicly available business and financial information relating to
The Sports Authority and Gart. Credit Suisse First Boston also reviewed other information relating to The Sports Authority and Gart, including financial forecasts, provided to or discussed with Credit
Suisse First Boston by The Sports Authority and Gart. Credit Suisse First Boston also met with the managements of The Sports Authority and Gart to discuss the businesses and prospects of The Sports
Authority and Gart. Credit Suisse First Boston also considered financial and stock market data of The Sports Authority and Gart, and compared those data with similar data for publicly held companies
in businesses similar to The Sports Authority and Gart and considered, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of other business combinations and transactions which have been effected or
announced. Credit Suisse First Boston also considered other information, financial studies, analyses and investigations and financial, economic and market criteria that it deemed relevant. 

        In
connection with its review, Credit Suisse First Boston did not assume any responsibility for independent verification of any of the information that was provided to or otherwise
reviewed by it and relied on that information being complete and accurate in all material respects. With respect to the financial forecasts for The Sports Authority and Gart, Credit Suisse First
Boston was advised, and assumed, that the forecasts were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the managements of The Sports Authority and
Gart as to the future financial performance of The Sports Authority and Gart and the strategic benefits and potential synergies, including the amount, timing and achievability thereof, anticipated to
result from the merger. Credit Suisse First Boston also assumed, with The Sports Authority's consent, that the merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, without
amendment, modification or waiver of any material term, condition or agreement contained in the merger agreement, and that, in the course of obtaining any necessary regulatory and third party
approvals and consents relating to the merger, no modification, condition, restriction, limitation or delay would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on The Sports Authority or Gart or the
contemplated benefits of the merger. Credit Suisse First Boston assumed, with The Sports Authority's consent, that the merger would be treated as a tax-free reorganization for federal
income tax purposes. 

        Credit
Suisse First Boston was not requested to make, and has not made, an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of The Sports
Authority or Gart, and Credit Suisse First Boston was not furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals. Credit 

Suisse First Boston's opinion was necessarily based on information available to it, and financial, economic, market and other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on the date of the
Credit Suisse First Boston opinion. Credit Suisse First Boston did not express any opinion as to the actual value of Gart common stock when issued in the merger or the prices at which Gart common
stock would trade at any time. Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to other business strategies that may be available to The Sports
Authority, and it did not address the underlying business decision of Sports Authority to engage in the merger. 

        In
preparing its opinion to The Sports Authority's board of directors, Credit Suisse First Boston performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses, including those described
below. The summary of Credit Suisse First Boston's analyses described below is not a complete description of the analyses underlying Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion. The preparation of a fairness
opinion is a complex process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances
and, therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Credit Suisse First Boston made qualitative judgments as to the
significance and relevance of each analysis and factor that it considered. Accordingly, Credit Suisse First Boston believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions
of its analyses and factors or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading
or incomplete view of the processes underlying its analyses and opinion. 

        In
its analyses, Credit Suisse First Boston considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the
control of The Sports Authority and Gart. No company, transaction or business used in Credit Suisse First Boston's analyses as a comparison is identical to The Sports Authority or Gart or the proposed
merger, and an evaluation of the results of those analyses is not entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating
characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies, business segments or transactions analyzed. The estimates contained in Credit
Suisse First Boston's analyses and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may
be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by the analyses. In addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the
prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, Credit Suisse First Boston's analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. 

        Credit
Suisse First Boston's opinion and financial analyses were only one of many factors considered by The Sports Authority's board of directors in its evaluation of the proposed merger
and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of The Sports Authority's board of directors or management with respect to the merger or the exchange ratio. 

        The
following is a summary of the material financial analyses underlying Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion dated February 19, 2003 delivered to The Sports Authority's board of
directors in connection with the merger. 
The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand Credit Suisse
First Boston's financial analyses, the tables must be
read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the data in the tables below without considering the full
narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Credit Suisse First Boston's
financial analyses.

 Discounted Cash Flow Analysis  

        Credit Suisse First Boston calculated the estimated present value of the stand-alone, unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that each of The Sports
Authority and Gart could generate for fiscal years 2003 through 2007 based on two scenarios for each of The Sports Authority and Garta management case and a revised case. The Sports
Authority management case was based on internal estimates of The Sports Authority's management for fiscal years 2003 through 2005 and extrapolated for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 based on guidance from
The Sports Authority's management. Gart's management case was based on internal estimates of Gart's management for fiscal year 2003 and extrapolated for fiscal years 2004 through 2007 based on
guidance from Gart's management. The Sports Authority's revised case and Gart's revised case included adjustments to the management case estimates for The Sports Authority and Gart to reflect, among
other things, the potential for decreased revenue and profitability. Credit Suisse First Boston calculated ranges of estimated terminal values for The Sports Authority and Gart by multiplying fiscal
year 2007 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, commonly referred to as EBITDA, of The Sports Authority and Gart by selected multiples ranging from 5.0x to 6.0x. The
estimated after-tax free cash flows and terminal values were then discounted to present value using discount rates of 10% to 11%. Credit Suisse First Boston then derived the following
implied exchange ratio reference ranges, as compared to the exchange ratio provided for in the merger:

 Pro Forma Merger Analysis  

        Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed the potential pro forma effect of the merger on the combined company's estimated earnings per share for fiscal years 2003 and
2004, both before and after taking into account potential cost savings and other synergies anticipated by the management of The Sports Authority to result from the merger. When potential cost savings
and other synergies from the merger were taken into account, Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed the potential pro forma effect of the merger on the combined company's estimated earnings per share,
both with and without integration costs anticipated by the management of The Sports Authority. Estimated financial data for The Sports Authority and Gart were based on The Sports Authority and Gart
management cases. Based on the exchange ratio of 0.37x, this analysis indicated that the merger could be: 


dilutive
to the combined company's estimated earnings per share for fiscal year 2003 both before and after taking into account potential cost savings and
other synergies from the merger, with integration costs, and accretive to the combined company's estimated earnings per share for fiscal year 2003 after taking into account potential cost synergies
from the merger, without integration costs; and


accretive
to the combined company's estimated earnings per share for fiscal year 2004 both before and after taking into account potential cost synergies from
the merger. 

        The
actual results achieved by the combined company may vary from these projected results and the variations may be material. 

 Miscellaneous  

        The Sports Authority has agreed to pay Credit Suisse First Boston for its financial advisory services in connection with the merger customary fees. The payment of
a significant portion of these fees is contingent upon the closing of the merger. The Sports Authority also has agreed to reimburse Credit Suisse First Boston for its
out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel and any other advisor retained by Credit Suisse First Boston, and to indemnify Credit Suisse
First Boston and related parties against liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising out of its engagement. 

        Credit
Suisse First Boston and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing and may in the future provide, investment banking and financial services to The Sports
Authority and Gart unrelated to the merger, for which services Credit Suisse First Boston has received, and expects to receive, compensation. In the ordinary course of business, Credit Suisse First
Boston and its affiliates may actively trade the securities of The Sports Authority and Gart for their own accounts and for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold long or
short positions in those securities.

        Gart's and The Sports Authority's officers and directors participate in arrangements and have continuing indemnification against liabilities that provide them
with interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, yours. 

 Payment of Transaction Fees  

        Gart is a party to a management agreement with Leonard Green (the holder of approximately 26% of Gart's outstanding common stock) that provides for Gart to pay
Leonard Green "reasonable and customary fees" for financial advisory and investment banking services in connection with major financial transactions, such as the proposed merger. Jonathan D. Sokoloff
and Jonathan A. Seiffer are current directors of Gart and are also partners in Leonard Green. In connection with the determination of the amount of the transaction fee payable to Leonard Green in
connection with the merger, Gart's board of directors established a special committee consisting of all directors other than management directors and Messrs. Sokoloff and Seiffer. The special
committee retained Cypress Associates LLC as its financial advisor. Following negotiation of the fee, Cypress Associates gave its opinion to the special committee to the effect that the
$4.25 million fee to be paid to Leonard Green in connection with the merger was reasonable and customary and was fair, from a financial point of view,
to Gart and its stockholders other than Leonard Green. Messrs. Sokoloff and Seiffer are being nominated for re-election to Gart's board of directors at Gart's annual meeting. In
addition, Mr. Sokoloff has been designated as a Gart nominee to serve as a member of the board of directors of the combined company following the merger. As a result of their relationship with
Leonard Green, Messrs. Sokoloff and Seiffer will receive a benefit from the merger that is in addition to the benefits that will be received by Gart's stockholders. 

 Gart Employment Agreements  

        Gart and The Sports Authority have agreed that, after the merger is completed, Martin E. Hanaka, The Sports Authority's current chairman and chief executive
officer, will serve as the combined company's chairman and that John Douglas Morton, Gart's current chairman, president and chief executive officer, will serve as the combined company's vice chairman
and chief executive officer. Gart has entered into employment agreements with each of Mr. Hanaka and Mr. Morton, which will become effective upon the consummation of the merger. Gart and
The Sports Authority have also agreed that, after the merger is completed, Elliot Kerbis, The Sports Authority's current president and chief merchandising officer, will serve as the combined company's
president and chief merchandising officer; Thomas Hendrickson, Gart's current executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer, will serve as the combined company's
non-director vice chairman, chief administrative officer, chief financial officer and treasurer, and Todd Weyhrich, The Sports Authority's current senior vice president and controller will
serve as the combined company's senior vice president-integration. Gart has indicated that it intends to enter into employment agreements with each of Mr. Kerbis, Mr. Hendrickson and
Mr. Weyhrich, as well as with Nesa Hassanein, Gart's senior vice president and general counsel, and Gregory Waters, Gart's executive vice president-store operations, in each case effective upon
consummation of the merger. 

        For
a description of the foregoing employment agreements, see the section entitled "Related AgreementsGart Employment Agreements," commencing on page 64 of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus. 

 The Sports Authority's Stock Options and Restricted Stock  

        Upon the approval of the merger by The Sports Authority's stockholders, the vesting of all outstanding stock options issued by The Sports Authority pursuant to
The Sports Authority's 2000 

Stock Option and Stock Award Plan, Directors Stock Plan, and Salaried Employees Stock Option and Stock Award Plan will accelerate in accordance with the terms of such options. At the effective time
of the merger, each such stock option will be deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under The Sports Authority's stock option, the number of
shares of Gart common stock that is equal to the number of shares of The Sports Authority common
stock that were issuable upon exercise of the stock option of The Sports Authority immediately prior to the effective time of the merger multiplied by the 0.37 (rounded down to the nearest whole
share), at an exercise price per share equal to the exercise price per share at which the stock option of The Sports Authority was exercisable immediately prior to the effective time divided by 0.37
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent). As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, The Sports Authority's directors and executive officers together hold options to acquire an aggregate
of 2,542,435 shares of The Sports Authority common stock at an average exercise price of approximately $4.99. Additionally, restrictions on transfer of shares of restricted stock held by directors and
executive officers will terminate as a result of the merger in accordance with the terms of such restricted stock. 

 Entitlement to Severance Payments and Other Benefits  

        The Sports Authority has entered into an employment agreement with Martin E. Hanaka, its chairman and chief executive officer, which provides that, upon
termination of his employment by The Sports Authority without "cause" or by Mr. Hanaka for "good reason," within two years after a change in control of The Sports Authority, Mr. Hanaka
will receive a severance payment equal to 2.99 times his base salary plus his target annual bonus under The Sports Authority's bonus plan for the current or previous fiscal year, whichever is greater,
plus medical, dental, long-term disability and life insurance benefits for a period of three years. Under this agreement, "good reason" includes a material diminution of the benefits
(taken as a whole) provided to Mr. Hanaka immediately prior to the change in control, the relocation of the company's principal executive offices to a location outside of South Florida or any
requirement that he be based anywhere other than the company's principal executive offices. Mr. Hanaka will receive the severance payment described above and this agreement will terminate
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and will be superseded by the employment agreement entered into between Gart and Mr. Hanaka that provides that, upon termination of his
employment by Gart without "cause" or by Mr. Hanaka for "good reason," Mr. Hanaka will receive a severance payment in an amount equal to the base salary and target bonus payable through
the remainder of the term of the agreement (but not less than one year's base salary and target bonus), automatically become fully vested in all outstanding long-term incentive awards and
continue to receive health, life insurance, long term disability, dental and medical benefits, and all perquisites through the remainder of the term of the agreement (but for no less than one year
following such termination). If Mr. Hanaka terminates his employment with the combined company voluntarily, but remains chairman of the board of directors of the combined company, the health
insurance benefit will continue so long as he is associated with the combined company in that capacity. See the section entitled "Related AgreementsGart Employment Agreements," commencing
on page 64 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

        The
Sports Authority has, in the past, entered into severance agreements with five executive officers (other than Mr. Hanaka) that provide for substantial payments and benefits to
be made after a change in control of The Sports Authority (which would include the proposed merger). These executive officers have the right to receive such payments and benefits, subject to limited
exceptions, if they are terminated "without cause" within two years following the change in control or if they resign for any "good reason" after 90 days and before two years after a change in
control. Under each of these agreements, "good reason" includes a material diminution of the benefits (taken as a whole) provided to the executive immediately prior to the change in control, the
relocation of the company's principal executive offices to a location outside of South Florida or any requirement that the executive be based anywhere other than the company's principal executive
offices. Therefore, as a result of the merger and 

the contemplated relocation of The Sports Authority's principal executive offices to Colorado these executive officers would be entitled to terminate their employment for "good reason" and receive
these severance payments. These executive officers will receive these severance payments 90 days after the consummation of the merger even if their employment is not terminated. 

        In
addition, The Sports Authority's severance agreements with three of these executive officers, Elliott Kerbis, George Mihalko and Louis-Philippe Vanier also provide that if the
executive remains employed by The Sports Authority during the 90-day period following the consummation of a change in control of The Sports Authority or if his employment is terminated
within such 90-day period under circumstances that would have entitled him to the severance payments described above, his base salary for such 90-day period will be increased
by 50%. This 50% increase will not be included in any calculation of the annual base salary of an executive at the time of termination for purposes of calculating severance payments due to such
executive. 

        Under
all of the agreements described above, including Mr. Hanaka's, the executive is entitled to reimbursement for any excise tax payable by him (as well as any resulting income
taxes payable upon receipt of such reimbursement) upon the receipt of any payments that would result in his receipt of any "excess parachute payment" (as defined under Section 280G of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986). 

        The
aggregate severance payments that will be made to The Sports Authority's executive officers, including Mr. Hanaka, in connection with the merger will be approximately
$10.3 million. In addition, the payment of $4.3 million in benefits under other existing compensation plans will be accelerated. 

        Executive
officers of Gart that are party to severance agreements with Gart will receive severance payments and other benefits as set forth in such agreements if their employment is
terminated without cause after the merger is consummated. 

 Indemnification  

        Gart has agreed in the merger agreement that it will indemnify any of The Sports Authority's officers or directors against liabilities with respect to all acts
and omissions arising out of such person's services as an officer or director of The Sports Authority prior to the effectiveness of the merger. Gart also has agreed to cause to be maintained in effect
for the next six years directors' and officers' liability insurance to cover any such liabilities. 

 Board of Directors of the Combined Company Following the Merger  

        In accordance with the merger agreement, immediately following the merger, the combined company will reconstitute its board to consist of four designees of Gart
and four designees of The Sports Authority. A ninth director who is currently unaffiliated with either company will be elected by the reconstituted board. Gart has designated John Douglas Morton,
Jonathan D. Sokoloff, Peter R. Formanek and Gordon D. Barker to serve on the board of the combined company following the merger, and The Sports Authority has designated Martin E.
Hanaka, Mary Elizabeth Burton, Cynthia R. Cohen and Kevin M. McGovern to serve on the board of the combined company following the merger. 

Financing of the Combined Company Following the Merger    

 General  

        Gart and The Sports Authority are parties to secured credit facilities that will be accelerated upon consummation of the merger. In the merger agreement, Gart
agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, and the consummation of the merger is subject to, among other things, the condition that Gart has obtained, a credit facility for the combined
company providing substantially the same amount of financing as that described in a letter agreement provided by The CIT Group/Business Credit, Inc. 

(the agent and a lender under Gart's current credit facility) to Gart prior to the execution of the merger agreement or such lesser amount of financing as is otherwise mutually acceptable to Gart and
The Sports Authority, and The Sports Authority agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to assist Gart in obtaining such financing. Gart executed a commitment letter agreement with The CIT
Group/Business Credit, Inc. in March 2003 pursuant to which CIT has committed to enter into a new secured credit facility following the merger, which will replace Gart's current
facility, providing for loans to Gart and its subsidiaries (which after the merger will include The Sports Authority) of up to $600 million. The CIT letter agreement contemplates that: 


the
new credit facility will be executed in connection with the consummation of the merger; and


concurrently
with such execution, each of the Amended and Restated Financing Agreement by and among The CIT Group/Business Credit, Inc. (as Agent and
a Lender) and various lenders and Gart Bros. Sporting Goods Company, Sportmart, Inc., Oshman's Sporting Goods, Inc. and certain subsidiaries of Oshman's Sporting Goods, Inc. dated
as of June 7, 2001 (the "Gart Financing Agreement"), and the
Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement between Fleet Retail Finance Inc., as Agent for the Lenders referenced therein, and The Sports Authority and its wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries,
dated as of August 3, 2000, (the "TSA Financing Agreement"), will be terminated. 

 Revolving Line of Credit; Letters of Credit  

        The CIT commitment letter contemplates that the credit facility will provide for loans to the combined company on a revolving basis of up to the lesser of
$600 million and the sum of: (1) the lesser of (A) 70% of eligible inventory and (B) 85% of the liquidation value of eligible inventory, except for periods of at least
30 days, or a Seasonal Advance Period, when the advance rate may, at Gart's discretion, increase to the lesser of (A) 80% of eligible inventory or (B) 90% of the liquidation value
of eligible inventory; (2) the lesser of (A) $40 million and (B) 85% of eligible credit card accounts receivable and wholesale accounts receivable; and (3) the
lesser of (A) $20 million during the first year of the term of the loan, $10 million during the second year and zero thereafter and (B) 50% of the fair market value of
eligible real estate. The CIT letter also contemplates that the lenders will assist the combined company in obtaining documentary or standby letters of credit, and that up to a maximum amount of
$75 million of obligations under documentary or standby letters of credit may be outstanding at any time. 

 Interest Rate Elections  

        The CIT commitment letter provides that the combined company will be able to elect one of two interest rate options: 


the
annual rate of interest announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank as its prime rate, in effect at its principal office in New York City (this is sometimes
referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Chase Bank Rate); or


the
London Interbank Offered Rate paid by JPMorgan Chase dollar deposits, plus 2.0% (this is sometimes referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus
as the LIBOR Rate). 

        Additionally,
the CIT commitment letter provides that after the six month anniversary of the closing of the financing, the interest rate will be reduced or increased quarterly, based on
the combined company's EBITDA for the 12 months most recently ended (excluding up to $140 million of merger and integration costs incurred in the 12 months following the closing
of the merger). The margin for the interest rate will range from 0.0% to 0.50% over the Chase Bank Rate and from 1.50% to 2.50% over the LIBOR Rate. 

 Fees and Expenses  

        The CIT commitment letter provides that the combined company will pay a line of credit fee of 0.375% per annum on the unused portion of the line of credit,
payable at the end of each month and for letters of credit, the lenders will receive fees in an amount equal to 1.25% per annum of the face amount of each outstanding letter of credit, less all
amounts previously drawn under the letters of credit, payable monthly. The CIT commitment letter provides that any charges imposed on the lenders by the banks issuing the letters of credit will be
borne by the combined company. 

        Additionally,
the CIT commitment letter provides that CIT will receive a commitment fee of $500,000 if the merger is consummated but the financing with CIT is not consummated and that
Gart will reimburse CIT for all of its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the line of credit, including reasonable attorneys' fees. 

 Collateral  

        The CIT commitment letter contemplates that in order to secure its obligations under the credit facility, the combined company will give the lenders a first
priority lien on all of its current and future accounts receivable, equipment, inventory, trademarks, patents, general intangibles, owned real estate and issued and outstanding stock of any of Gart's
subsidiaries. 

 Guarantees  

        The CIT commitment letter contemplates that The Sports Authority and all of Gart's other subsidiaries that are not borrowers under the credit facility will
guarantee the line of credit. 

 Conditions to Financing; Covenants  

        The CIT commitment letter contemplates that the funding of the new credit facility will be subject to the following conditions and other customary closing
conditions: 


the
successful completion of, and compliance with, the terms of the commitment letter, including an inventory appraisal in CIT's discretion and payment of
fees and expenses;


the
execution and delivery of legal documentation satisfactory in form to the combined company, CIT and their respective counsel;


the
absence of a material adverse effect on:


the
combined company's business, as now conducted or proposed to be conducted; its results of operations; its financial or other condition; its assets or
liabilities, contingent or otherwise; or its prospects; or


the
combined company's ability to perform its obligations pursuant to the commitment letter or pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the commitment
letter; 


the
combined company's excess revolving loan availability on the day of closing only must be at least $75 million;


CIT's
receipt of legal opinions from the combined company's counsel that are satisfactory to CIT, including a legal opinion to the effect that federal and
state securities laws and the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 have been fully complied with;


satisfactory
review of Gart's and The Sports Authority's audited financial statements as of February 1, 2003, and the combined company's integration
plan and monthly financial projections for the period through January 31, 2005; and


CIT's
receipt of, and satisfaction with, the merger agreement. 

        In connection with the new credit facility, the borrowers under the facility also will make customary representations, warranties and covenants. Under the facility contemplated by the
CIT commitment letter, financial covenants would be limited to covenants regarding the combined company's minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and its minimum interest coverage ratio. The combined
company would not be required to comply with these financial covenants if it maintains availability under the facility of at least $50 million during the first year of the facility,
$60 million during the second year of the facility and $75 million thereafter. Up to $140 million of merger and integration costs incurred in connection with the merger in the
12 months following the closing of the merger would be excluded from the calculation of compliance with any covenants. Additionally, under this facility, the borrowers under the facility would
be required to provide the lenders with monthly interim financial statements, fiscal year-end audited financial statements and annual operating budgets and the agent under the facility
would have the right to require inventory appraisals to be performed. 

 Term of Credit Facility; Termination  

        The credit facility contemplated by the CIT commitment letter has an initial term of four years, and will be renewable automatically for additional
one-year terms, unless terminated by either party at the expiration of the initial term upon 60 days' written notice. Additionally, the lenders will be able to terminate this credit
facility upon the occurrence of certain events of default. The combined company will be able to terminate this credit facility at any time, with 60 days' prior written notice to CIT, but the
combined company will be required to pay an early termination premium if such termination is before the end of the expiration of the initial term. The early termination premium will be calculated by
multiplying the revolving line of credit by (1) 0.50%, if this credit facility is terminated prior to one year after closing, or (2) 0.25%, if this credit facility is terminated more
than one year but prior to two years after closing, and (3) no early termination fee will be payable thereafter. 

Completion and Effectiveness of the Merger    

        Gart and The Sports Authority will complete the merger when all of the conditions to the completion of the merger are satisfied or waived, including adoption of
the merger agreement by The Sports Authority's stockholders and approval of the issuance of Gart common stock in connection with the merger and the amendment to Gart's certificate of incorporation by
Gart's stockholders. The merger will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the State of Delaware. 

        Gart
and The Sports Authority are working towards completing the merger as quickly as possible. Gart and The Sports Authority currently expect to complete the merger in the second or
early third calendar quarter of 2003. 

Material Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger    

        The following, as it relates to matters of U.S. federal income tax law, constitutes the opinions of Clifford Chance US LLP, counsel to Gart, and Morgan,
Lewis & Bockius LLP, counsel to The Sports Authority, subject to the qualifications set forth below and contained herein, as to the material federal income tax consequences of the merger to
Gart, The Sports Authority and The Sports Authority's stockholders. Such opinions are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or any court. It is assumed for purposes of this discussion that the
shares of The Sports Authority common stock are held as "capital assets" within the meaning of section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The tax consequences to each
stockholder of The Sports Authority will depend in part upon such stockholder's particular situation. Special tax consequences not described herein may be applicable to particular classes of
taxpayers, such as financial institutions, insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, broker-dealers, traders in securities that elect to mark to market, persons that hold The Sports
Authority common stock as part of a straddle, hedge or conversion transaction, persons who are not citizens or residents of the United States, stockholders that are foreign corporations, partnerships, 

estates or trusts, and stockholders who acquired their shares of The Sports Authority common stock through the exercise of an employee stock option or otherwise as compensation. The following is a
summary of material federal income tax consequences and is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations thereunder, published
rulings and decisions, all as currently in effect as of the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Tax consequences under state, local and foreign laws
are not addressed herein. The Sports Authority's stockholders are urged to consult with their own tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences to them of the merger, including the application and
effect of federal, state, local and foreign income and other tax laws. 

        It
is a condition to the consummation of the merger that Gart receive an opinion from its counsel, Clifford Chance US LLP, and The Sports Authority receive an opinion from its counsel,
Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, dated as of the effective date of the merger, to the effect that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for federal income tax purposes. The condition relating to the tax opinions will not be waived after receipt of stockholder approval unless further
stockholder approval is obtained with appropriate disclosure. The opinions will be based on customary assumptions and customary representations made by, among others, Gart and The Sports Authority. An
opinion of counsel represents counsel's best legal judgment and is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or any court. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service
will agree with the conclusions set forth in the opinion letters, and it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service or another tax authority could assert a position contrary to one or all of those
conclusions and that a court could sustain that contrary position. Neither Gart nor The Sports Authority intends to obtain a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the tax
consequences of the merger. 

        Assuming
the merger qualifies as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (i) no gain or loss will be
recognized by Gart or by The Sports Authority as a result of the merger; and (ii) holders of The Sports Authority common stock who exchange their common stock of The Sports Authority solely for
Gart common stock in the merger will not recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes, except with respect to cash, if any, they receive in lieu of a fractional share of Gart common stock.
The aggregate tax basis in Gart common stock received in the merger by each holder of The Sports Authority common stock will be the same as his or her aggregate tax basis in The Sports Authority
common stock surrendered in the merger, decreased by the amount of any tax basis allocable to any fractional share interest for which cash is received. The holding period of Gart common stock received
in the merger by a holder of The Sports Authority common stock will include the holding period of The Sports Authority common stock that he or she surrendered in the merger. A holder of The Sports
Authority common stock who receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of Gart common stock will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and the portion of
his or her tax basis in The Sports Authority common stock surrendered in the merger that is allocable to the fractional share. That gain or loss generally will constitute capital gain or loss. In the
case of an individual stockholder, any such capital gain generally will be subject to a maximum federal income tax rate of 20% if the individual has held his or her common stock of The Sports
Authority for more than one year on the date of the merger. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations for both individuals and corporations. 

        Each
stockholder in The Sports Authority that receives Gart common stock in the merger will be required to file a statement with his or her federal income tax return setting forth
his or her basis in The Sports Authority common stock surrendered and the fair market value of Gart common stock and cash received in the merger, and to retain permanent records of these facts
relating to the merger. 

        Unless
an exemption applies under applicable law and regulations, the exchange agent is required to withhold, and will withhold at the applicable backup withholding rate (currently 30%)
on any cash payments to a stockholder in The Sports Authority unless the stockholder provides the appropriate 

form described below. Each stockholder in The Sports Authority should complete and sign the Substitute Form W-9 included as part of the letter of transmittal to be sent to each
stockholder in The Sports Authority, so as to provide the information, including such stockholder's taxpayer identification number, and certification necessary to avoid backup withholding, unless an
applicable exemption exists and is proved in a manner satisfactory to Gart and the exchange agent. 

The Sports Authority's stockholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences to them of the merger, including tax return
reporting requirements, the applicability and effect of federal, state, local, and other applicable tax laws and the effect of any proposed changes in the tax laws.

Accounting Treatment of the Merger    

        Gart and The Sports Authority will account for the merger using the purchase method of accounting with Gart as the acquiror. 

Regulatory Filings and Approvals Required to Complete the Merger    

        The Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, requires each of Gart and The Sports Authority to file Notification and Report
Forms with the Bureau of Competition of the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice containing information relating to the parties to the merger agreement and
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Gart and The Sports Authority are required to observe a 30-day waiting period after the filings have been made before completing the
merger. In compliance with the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, Gart and The Sports Authority both filed their Notification and Report Forms on March 3, 2003. The
waiting period expired at 11:59 p.m. on April 2, 2003. Termination or expiration of the waiting period is a condition to the consummation of the merger. 

        The
Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice frequently scrutinize the legality under the antitrust laws of transactions such as the merger. Accordingly, at any time before
or after the completion of the merger, either the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice could take action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public
interest. Such actions may include seeking to challenge the merger, to limit Gart's or The Sports Authority's ownership of the combined company after the merger, to limit the operation of the combined
company after the merger or otherwise to restrict the combined operations of Gart and The Sports Authority as a condition to approving the merger. Any challenges, limitations or restrictions imposed
by government agencies could prevent the merger or diminish the benefits of the merger to Gart, The Sports Authority and their stockholders. In addition, state antitrust authorities or private persons
or entities could take certain actions, including seeking to enjoin the merger under the antitrust laws at any time prior to the completion of the merger or could compel rescission or divestiture
after completion of the merger. Gart and The Sports Authority believe that the consummation of the merger will not violate antitrust laws. There can be no assurance, however, that a challenge to the
merger on antitrust grounds will not be made, or, if such a challenge is made, what the result will be. 

Restrictions on Sales of Shares by Affiliates of The Sports Authority    

        The shares of Gart common stock to be issued in connection with the merger will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and will be freely transferable
under the Securities Act of 1933, except for shares of Gart common stock issued to any person who is deemed to be an "affiliate" of The Sports Authority. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates
include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with The Sports Authority and may include some of its officers and directors as well as its principal
stockholders. The Sports Authority's affiliates 

may not sell their shares of Gart common stock acquired in connection with the merger except pursuant to: 


an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 covering the resale of those shares;


an
exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933; or


any
other exemption under the Securities Act of 1933 which may be relied upon in the opinion of legal counsel reasonably acceptable to Gart. 

        Gart's
registration statement on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, does not cover the resale of shares of Gart common stock to be
received by affiliates of The Sports Authority or the combined company in the merger. 

Listing of Gart Common Stock to be Issued in the Merger    

        Gart common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "GRTS." Gart agreed in the merger agreement to change its name to "The Sports
Authority, Inc." and to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the common stock of the combined company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange at or prior to the effective time of merger
under the symbol "TSA." Gart intends to apply to have the common stock of the combined company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. If Gart's application for listing on the New York Stock Exchange
is successful, the shares of Gart common stock currently outstanding and the shares of Gart common stock to be issued in the merger will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange before completion of
the merger and the shares of Gart common stock currently outstanding will be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market. If Gart's application for listing on the New York Stock Exchange is not
successful, the shares of Gart common stock to be issued in the merger will be listed on the Nasdaq National Market. 

Delisting and Deregistration of The Sports Authority Common Stock After the Merger    

        When the merger is completed, The Sports Authority common stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and will be deregistered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. 

No Dissenter's or Appraisal Rights    

        In accordance with Delaware law, no holder of Gart common stock or The Sports Authority common stock will have any dissenter's or appraisal rights in connection
with the merger. 

The Merger Agreement    

This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus is a summary of the material terms of the merger agreement, a copy of which is
attached as Annex A to this document. Because the description is a summary, it does not contain all of the information that may be important to you. You should refer to the full text of the merger
agreement, which is hereby incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, for details of the merger and the terms and conditions of the merger agreement.

The Merger    

        The merger agreement provides that when all closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, Gold Acquisition Corp. will be merged with and into The Sports
Authority. As a result of the merger, the separate corporate existence of Gold Acquisition Corp. will cease and The Sports Authority will continue as the surviving corporation. As a result of the
merger, The Sports Authority will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gart. The merger will become effective on the date of filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware or on a later date as is specified in the certificate of merger and agreed upon by the parties. This is referred to as the effective time of the merger. 

Conversion of The Sports Authority's Shares in the Merger    

        At the effective time of the merger, each share of The Sports Authority common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, other than
shares of The Sports Authority common stock held in The Sports Authority's treasury, or owned by Gart or Gold Acquisition Corp. or any subsidiary of The Sports Authority, will be converted into the
right to receive 0.37 of a share of Gart common stock. 

        No
fractional shares of Gart common stock will be issued in the merger. Instead of issuing fractional shares of Gart common stock to the holders of shares of The Sports Authority common
stock, Gart will pay cash in an amount equal to the fractional amount of a share of Gart common stock that The Sports Authority common stockholders would otherwise receive multiplied by the closing
price of a share of Gart common stock on the National Market System on the business day immediately prior to
the day on which the merger is consummated. No interest will be paid or accrued on cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any. 

Adjustment to Exchange Ratio    

        The exchange ratio will be adjusted to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including a dividend or distribution of
securities exchangeable for or convertible into common stock of Gart or The Sports Authority), reorganization, recapitalization or similar event in respect of the common stock of Gart or The Sports
Authority occurring after the date of the merger agreement and prior to the effective time of the merger. Additionally, the exchange ratio will be adjusted to reflect the effect of any breach by
either Gart or The Sports Authority of their representations and covenants regarding their respective capital structures as of the date of the merger agreement. Any such adjustment will result in
holders of common stock or options, rights or convertible securities exercisable for or convertible into Gart and The Sports Authority common stock immediately prior to the effective time owning 50%
of Gart common stock on a fully diluted basis immediately after the effective time. 

Exchange of Certificates    

        Gart will appoint an exchange agent for the purpose of exchanging The Sports Authority's stock certificates for Gart's stock certificates. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the effective time of the merger, the exchange agent will mail to each stockholder of record of The Sports Authority a letter of 

transmittal and instructions for the surrender of certificates representing The Sports Authority common stock in exchange for certificates representing Gart common stock. If a stock certificate is
lost, stolen or destroyed, The Sports Authority stockholder will have to deliver an affidavit and, if required, a bond to receive certificates representing Gart common stock. 

Holders of The Sports Authority common stock should not send in their certificates until they receive a letter of transmittal and instructions from the exchange
agent.

Corporate Organization and Governance    

        Upon consummation of the merger, The Sports Authority will continue to be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. The directors of Gold Acquisition Corp.
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be the directors of the surviving corporation and the officers of The Sports Authority immediately prior to the effective time of the merger
will be the officers of the surviving corporation, in each case, until their respective successors are duly elected, appointed or qualified or until their
earlier death, removal or resignation in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation. 

Representations and Warranties    

        The merger agreement contains reciprocal representations and warranties made by each party to the other. All representations and warranties of Gart and The Sports
Authority will expire upon the completion of the merger. 

        A
number of the representations and warranties are qualified by a material adverse effect standard. A material adverse effect with respect to Gart or The Sports Authority means any
change, event or effect that has occurred, or to the knowledge of Gart or The Sports Authority, as the case may be, has been threatened, that is or is reasonably expected to be materially adverse to
the business, results of operations, properties, condition (financial or otherwise), assets and liabilities of Gart or The Sports Authority, as the case may be, and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or that may prevent or materially delay the performance by Gart or The Sports Authority, as the case may be, of any of its obligations under the merger agreement or the consummation of the merger or
the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, in each case, other than any change, event or effect which occurred prior to the date of the merger agreement and which was disclosed to
the other party in writing prior to that date. 

Covenants    

        The merger agreement contains reciprocal covenants made by each party to the other relating to certain matters. The following summarizes the more significant of
these covenants. 

 Interim Operations  

        Each of Gart and The Sports Authority has agreed that it will carry on its business in the usual, regular and ordinary course substantially consistent with past
practice and will use its reasonable best efforts to maintain its rights and franchises and preserve its relationships with customers, suppliers and others who have business dealings with it. The
merger agreement contains a number of specific restrictions on each party and its subsidiaries. 

 Access to Information  

        Each of Gart and The Sports Authority has agreed that it will, and it will cause its subsidiaries to, afford to the other party and to the other party's officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to all of its 

properties, books, contracts, commitments and records and that it will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the other party consistent with its legal obligations all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other party may reasonably request. This access will be afforded until the effective time of the merger and will be subject to
certain limitations. 

 Approvals From Governmental Entities and Third Parties  

        Each of Gart and The Sports Authority has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to complete the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement as soon as practicable. This includes using reasonable best efforts to obtain all
approvals, consents, waivers, registrations, permits, authorizations, clearances and other confirmations required to be obtained from any third parties or from governmental entities that are
necessary, proper or advisable to complete the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Each of Gart and The Sports Authority has agreed to use its reasonable best
efforts to cooperate with the other party in connection with any such filing or submission or investigation or other inquiry related thereto. 

 Financing  

        Gart has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to obtain, as of or prior to the closing of the merger, a credit facility providing substantially the same amount
of financing as that provided in a financing commitment letter received by Gart from The CIT Group/Business Credit, Inc., or such lesser amount of financing as is otherwise mutually acceptable
to Gart and The Sports Authority. The Sports Authority has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to assist Gart in obtaining such financing. For more information about the terms of the CIT letter
agreement, see the section entitled "The Merger and Related TransactionsFinancing of the Combined Company Following the Merger," commencing on page 46 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. 

 Directors' and Officers' Insurance and Indemnification  

        Gart and The Sports Authority have agreed that all rights to indemnification and exculpation now existing in favor of any current or former director or officer of
The Sports Authority or any of its subsidiaries as provided in their respective charters or bylaws will survive the merger. 

        Additionally,
Gart has agreed to maintain or cause to be maintained in effect for six years after the effective time of the merger the current policies (or their equivalent) of
directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by The Sports Authority covering acts or omissions occurring prior to the merger, subject to certain limitations. 

 Post Merger Operations; Directors Designated by The Sports Authority to Serve on the Combined Company's Board of Directors  

        After the merger, the headquarters of the combined company and its subsidiaries will be located in Englewood, Colorado. Gart and The Sports Authority have agreed

effective time, the reconstituted board will elect to the board of directors an additional individual who will satisfy the independence requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq National

merchandising officer, Thomas T. Hendrickson will be combined company's non-director vice chairman, chief administrative officer, chief financial officer and treasurer, Greg A. Waters will

 Stockholders' Meetings  

        Gart and The Sports Authority have agreed to hold meetings of their respective stockholders as soon as practicable following the execution of the merger
agreement, for the purpose of voting: (1) in the case of The Sports Authority, to adopt the merger agreement; and (2) in the case of Gart, to approve the issuance of Gart common stock in
the merger and the amendment to Gart's certificate of incorporation. Gart and The Sports Authority have agreed, to the extent practicable, to hold such meetings on the same date. 

 Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment  

        Gart, The Sports Authority and their respective subsidiaries have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the merger to qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 

 NYSE Listing  

        Gart's shares of common stock are currently listed on the Nasdaq National Market. Gart has agreed to change its name to "The Sports Authority, Inc." and to
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the common stock of the combined company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol "TSA," subject to official notice of issuance, as
of or prior to the effective time of the merger. If Gart's application for listing on the New York Stock Exchange is successful, the common stock of the combined company, which will include the shares
of Gart common stock to be issued by Gart in the merger, will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange at the effective time of the merger, subject to official notice of issuance and Gart common stock
will be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market at the effective time of the merger. If Gart's application for listing on the New York Stock Exchange is not successful, the common stock of the
combined company, including the shares of Gart common stock to be issued by Gart in the merger, will be listed on the Nasdaq National Market at the effective time of the merger, subject to official
notice of issuance. 

 No Solicitation  

        In the merger agreement, each party has agreed that it will, and it will cause its subsidiaries and representatives, to cease, as of the date of the merger
agreement, any existing discussions with any parties conducted before that date with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. 

        An
"Acquisition Proposal" refers to any written bona fide proposal made by a third party relating to either: 


the
direct or indirect acquisition of 20% or more of either party's assets or combined voting power or any tender offer or exchange offer related thereto; or


a
merger, consolidation or other business combination involving Gart or The Sports Authority or any of their subsidiaries in which the party making the
proposal or its stockholders will own 20% or more of the combined voting power of the parent entity resulting from such transaction. 

        Each
party has further agreed that it will not, nor will it permit any of its subsidiaries to, nor will it authorize or permit any of its directors, officers or employees or any
representative retained by it, directly or indirectly, to: 


solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal; or


participate
in any discussions or negotiations, including by way of furnishing information, regarding any Acquisition Proposal, subject to limited exceptions
in the event of a Superior Proposal, as discussed below. 

        A
"Superior Proposal" refers to any written bona fide proposal made by a third party and not solicited by Gart or The Sports Authority, as applicable, relating to either: 


the
direct or indirect acquisition of 50% or more of either party's assets or combined voting power or any tender offer or exchange offer related thereto; or


a
merger, consolidation or other business combination involving Gart or The Sports Authority or any of their subsidiaries in which the party making the
proposal or its stockholders will own 50% or more of the combined voting power of the parent entity resulting from such transaction. 

        In
addition, in order to qualify as a Superior Proposal, the proposal must be on terms that the board of directors of Gart or The Sports Authority, as applicable, determines in its good
faith judgment, (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and considering any modifications to the merger agreement proposed by the Gart or The Sports Authority,
as applicable) taking into account legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal deemed appropriate by the board of directors: 


to
be more favorable to its stockholders from a financial point of view than the merger;


to
be capable of being completed reasonably promptly; and


for
which financing, to the extent required, is then committed or capable of being obtained by the party making the Superior Proposal. 

        The
merger agreement allows each party, prior to the date of the meeting of its stockholders contemplated by this joint proxy statement/prospectus, to furnish information to, negotiate
or otherwise engage in discussions with a party in response to an Acquisition Proposal if all of the following conditions are satisfied: 


it
enters into a customary confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable to it than those obtained in the confidentiality agreement between Gart and
The Sports Authority;


the
Acquisition Proposal is, in the reasonable judgment of its board of directors, likely to lead to a Superior Proposal;


its
board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel) that it is required to furnish information, negotiate or engage
in discussions in order to comply with the fiduciary duties of the board of directors under applicable law; and


the
Acquisition Proposal was not solicited by it in breach of, or otherwise does not result from a breach of, the non-solicitation provisions in
the merger agreement. 

        Each
party has also agreed in the merger agreement that its board of directors may not: 


withdraw
or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the other party, its approval or recommendation of the merger or the
merger agreement or fail to reaffirm such approval or recommendation within a reasonable amount of time after the other party requests such an affirmation; 


approve
or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal;


approve
or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into any agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or Superior
Proposal; or


propose
publicly or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

        If
prior to the date of its stockholders meeting contemplated by this joint proxy statement/prospectus, however, Gart or The Sports Authority receives a Superior Proposal which was not
solicited by it in breach of, or otherwise does not result from a breach of the non-solicitation provisions in the merger agreement, and if its board of directors determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of national reputation) that it is required to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to its stockholders under
applicable law, then the board of directors may take any of the actions described above. However, its board of directors may only take any of the actions described above if, simultaneously with taking
such action, it also terminates the merger agreement and executes a definitive agreement to implement the Superior Proposal, but only if it has given the other party five business days notice that it
is prepared to accept a Superior Proposal. Such notice must specify the terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal. At the time that such party terminates the merger agreement it must pay the other
party a $7.4 million termination fee. 

        The
merger agreement also allows each party's board of directors to take and to disclose to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and make all other disclosures which, in the good faith judgment of the board of directors, are required by applicable law. 

        Each
party has agreed to promptly (and no more than 24 hours after receipt) advise the other party of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry that would reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or of any request for information in connection with a possible Acquisition Proposal, and to provide to the other party the material terms and
conditions of such request and the identity of the party making the Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and to keep the other party reasonably and promptly informed of the status of any such request or
proposal and the substance of any
discussions relating to such Acquisition Proposal. Each party has further agreed to provide the other party with a copy of any written materials received from any third party with respect to or which
could lead to an Acquisition Proposal and of any materials provided to such third party. 

Treatment of The Sports Authority's Stock Options    

        Upon the approval of the merger by The Sports Authority's stockholders, the vesting of all outstanding stock options issued by The Sports Authority pursuant to
The Sports Authority's 2000 Stock Option and Stock Award Plan, Directors Stock Plan and Salaried Employees Stock Option and Stock Award Plan will accelerate in accordance with the terms of the
options. At the effective time of the merger, each stock option will be deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under The Sports Authority's
stock option, the number of shares of Gart common stock that is equal to the number of shares of The Sports Authority common stock that were issuable upon exercise of the stock option of The Sports
Authority immediately prior to the effective time of the merger multiplied 0.37 (rounded down to the nearest whole share), at an exercise price per share equal to the exercise price per share at which
the stock option of The Sports Authority was exercisable immediately prior to the effective time divided by 0.37 (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). 

        At
the effective time of the merger, Gart will assume all of The Sports Authority's stock options in accordance with the terms of the stock option plan under which they were issued and
the stock option agreement by which they are evidenced. As soon as practicable after the effective time of the merger 

Gart will file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or another appropriate form) with respect to the Gart common stock subject to the stock options of The Sports Authority,
and will maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such stock options remain outstanding. 

The Sports Authority's Employee Benefit Plans and Agreements    

        Gart has agreed to adopt all The Sports Authority benefit plans and agreements, including the executive severance agreements described under the section entitled
"The Merger and Related TransactionsInterests of Certain Persons in the MergerEntitlement to Severance Payments and Other Benefits" commencing on page 45 of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus, and to perform The Sports Authority's obligations under these plans and agreements that are outstanding as of the effective time of the merger. Gart may amend or terminate
these plans and agreements but may not reduce the accrued benefits in a manner that is prohibited by law or the relevant plan or agreement. Prior to the effective time of the merger, Gart and The
Sports Authority will determine which company's benefit plans will survive following completion of the merger. 

Conditions to the Completion of the Merger    

        The respective obligations of Gart, Gold Acquisition Corp. and The Sports Authority to complete the merger and the related transactions contemplated by the merger

Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended;


The
Sports Authority must have received from Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP on the date of the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this

reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the other party and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; 


the
other party shall have performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under the merger agreement; and


changes,
conditions, events or developments will not have occurred that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the other party.

        The merger agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement may be abandoned at any time prior to the effective time of the
merger, whether before or after stockholder approval, as follows: 


if
Gart and The Sports Authority mutually consent in writing to terminate the merger agreement;


by
Gart or The Sports Authority if the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are not completed on or before December 31, 2003, but only if
the failure to complete the transactions by that date did not result from the failure to fulfill an obligation under the merger agreement by the party seeking termination;


by

permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or any governmental entity fails to issue an order, decree or ruling, or take any
other action which is necessary to fulfill the conditions to the consummation of the merger set forth in the merger agreement, but only if such action or inaction did not result from the failure of
the party seeking termination to comply with the merger agreement;

from the party wishing to terminate;

simultaneously terminates the merger agreement. 

        The
Sports Authority will be required to pay a termination fee in the amount of $7.4 million if: 


an

Gart's certificate of incorporation; or

        and,

        The
Sports Authority will be required to pay to Gart all fees and expenses (up to $3.7 million) incurred by Gart in connection with the merger if:

merger by Gart's and The Sports Authority's stockholders by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, unless the amendment requires the approval of the stockholders of Gart,

Related Agreements    

Stockholder's Agreement Between The Sports Authority and Leonard Green    

        In connection with and as a condition to entering into the merger agreement, The Sports Authority has entered into a stockholder's agreement with Leonard Green,
which, as of February 1, 2003, owned approximately 26% of the outstanding shares of Gart common stock. Pursuant to the stockholder's agreement, Leonard Green has agreed, among other things: 


to
vote in favor of the adoption and approval of the issuance of Gart common stock and the amendment to Gart's certificate of incorporation contemplated by
the merger agreement and any other actions in furtherance thereof requiring a vote of Gart's stockholders;


to
vote against any Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal;


to
vote against any proposal, action, transaction or agreement that would result in a breach in any material respect of any covenant, representation or
warranty or any other obligation or agreement of Gart or Gold Acquisition Corp. under the merger agreement or that is reasonably likely to result in any of Gart's or Gold Acquisition Corp.'s
conditions to their respective obligations not being fulfilled;


to
vote against any other action that could reasonably be expected to prevent, impede, interfere with or adversely affect the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement or the likelihood of such transaction being consummated;


to
vote in favor of any other matter necessary for consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;


not
to transfer, sell, assign, gift, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of or create or permit to exist any encumbrance, or consent to any such
transfer or encumbrance of, any of Gart's shares held by it except to persons who expressly consent to be bound by the terms of the stockholder's agreement;


not
to enter into any contract, option or other agreement or understanding with respect to, or consent to, any transfer or any or all of Gart's shares held
by it or any interest therein except to persons who consent to be bound by the terms of the stockholder's agreement;


not
to grant any proxy, power-of-attorney or other similar authorization in or with respect to Gart's shares held by it;


not
to deposit Gart's shares held by it into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or arrangement with respect to the shares or any interest
therein; and


not
to take any action that would have the effect of materially interfering with the performance of its obligation under the stockholder's agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. 

        The
stockholder's agreement will terminate at the earlier of: 


the
effective time of the merger;


the
date on which the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms; and


the
mutual consent of The Sports Authority and Leonard Green. 

        As
a means to enforce Leonard Green's performance under the stockholder's agreement, Leonard Green has appointed The Sports Authority as its proxy to vote the shares in any vote related
to the above matters. Leonard Green's obligations with respect to the voting of its shares of Gart common stock will terminate if Gart's board of directors, in accordance with the terms of the merger
agreement, withdraws its recommendation of the issuance of Gart common shares in the merger and the amendment to Gart's certificate of incorporation. For a more complete description of this
stockholder's 

agreement, you should refer to the stockholder's agreement attached as Annex B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

The Sports Authority Rights Agreement    

        The Sports Authority has adopted a stockholder rights agreement pursuant to which it has declared a dividend distribution of one right per outstanding share of
its common stock. Each right entitles the holder to buy a unit consisting of one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares or, in certain
circumstances, a combination of securities and assets of equivalent value, at a purchase price of $35 per unit, subject to adjustment. Each unit carries voting and dividend rights that are intended to
produce the equivalent of one share of common stock. Unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of the rights agreement, the rights expire on September 11, 2011. 

        The
rights become exercisable only if a person or group acquires 20% or more, or a person or group announces a tender offer for 20% or more, of The Sports Authority's outstanding common
stock. In certain events the rights entitle each holder to receive shares of common stock having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the right, and the rights of the acquiring person or
group will become null and void. These events include, but are not limited to, a merger in which The Sports Authority is the survivor, and an acquisition of 20% or more of The Sports Authority's
outstanding common stock other than through a tender offer that provides fair value to all shareholders. If The Sports Authority is acquired in a merger in which it is not the surviving corporation,
or more than 50% of its assets or earning power is sold or transferred, each holder of a right will have the right to receive, upon exercise, common shares of the acquiring company. The Sports
Authority can redeem each right for $.01 at any time before the rights become exercisable.

to the execution of the merger agreement, The Sports Authority amended its rights agreement to provide that the execution of the merger agreement and the stockholder's agreement
and the transactions contemplated by such agreements would not cause these rights to become exercisable. This amendment also provides that the rights issued under the rights agreement will expire
immediately prior to the consummation of the merger. 

Gart Employment Agreements    

        In connection with the merger agreement, Gart entered into employment agreements with John Douglas Morton and Martin E. Hanaka that will become effective upon the
consummation of the merger. Mr. Morton's agreement has a term of three years commencing at the effective time of the merger (which term will be automatically extended thereafter for consecutive
one year periods unless terminated by either party on 90 days prior written notice) and provides that he will serve as vice chairman and chief executive officer of the combined company. Among
other things, Gart has agreed
to pay Mr. Morton an annual base salary of $1,100,000 and an annual bonus as established by the compensation committee of the board of directors. Mr. Hanaka's agreement has a term of
three years commencing at the effective time of the merger (which term will be automatically extended thereafter for consecutive one year periods unless terminated by either party on 90 days
prior written notice) and provides that he will serve as chairman of the combined company. Among other things, Gart has agreed to pay Mr. Hanaka an annual base salary of $900,000 and an annual
bonus, as determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors, not to exceed $700,000 during 2003 and $500,000 during 2004 and 2005. 

        Under
the employment agreements, upon the termination of Mr. Morton's or Mr. Hanaka's employment either by the combined company for "cause" or by Mr. Morton or
Mr. Hanaka without "good reason," Mr. Morton or Mr. Hanaka, as applicable, will be entitled to receive, among other things, his base salary through the date of termination of his
employment. 

        If
Mr. Morton terminates his employment for "good reason" or if he is terminated without "cause," he shall be entitled to receive (in addition to salary and certain other benefits
earned prior to termination) a single lump sum payment in an amount equal to three times the sum of his then-current annual base salary and his target bonus for the year in which such
termination occurs. In addition, Mr. Morton will become fully vested in all outstanding long-term incentive awards, and shall be entitled to certain health and welfare benefits for
a period of three years following such termination. 

        If
Mr. Hanaka terminates his employment for "good reason" or if he is terminated without "cause," he shall be entitled to receive (in addition to salary and certain other benefits
earned prior to termination) a single lump sum payment in an amount equal to the annual base salary and target bonus (based upon the year in which such termination occurs) otherwise payable for the
remainder of the term of his employment agreement (but no less than one year's base salary and such target bonus). In addition, Mr. Hanaka shall become fully vested in all outstanding
long-term incentive awards, and shall be entitled to certain health and welfare benefits for the remainder of the term of his employment agreement (but not less than one year following
such termination). 

        Under
the employment agreements, "cause" means, subject to various exceptions: 


a
material violation of any material written rule or policy of the combined company for which violation any employee may be terminated pursuant to the
combined company's written policies and which the executive fails to correct within 30 days after receipt of written notice from the combined company's board of directors of such violation;


misconduct
by the executive to the combined company's material and demonstrable detriment;


the
executive's conviction of, or pleading guilty to, a felony;


the
executive's continued and ongoing gross negligence in the performance of his duties and responsibilities to the combined company; or


the
executive's material failure to perform his duties and responsibilities to the combined company, which the executive fails to correct within
30 days after receipt of written notice from the combined company's board of directors of such failure. 

        Under
the employment agreements, "good reason" means, subject to certain exceptions: 


a
significant diminution by the combined company of the executive's role with the combined company or a significant detrimental change in the nature and/or
scope of the executive's status with the combined company (including a diminution in title or a failure of the executive to be elected or reelected to the combined company's board of directors);


a
reduction in the executive's base salary or target or maximum annual bonus opportunity, other than as part of an across the board reduction in salaries of
management personnel (including all vice presidents and positions above) of less than 20%;


at
any time following a change of control of the combined company, a material diminution by the combined company of compensation and benefits (taken as a
whole) provided to the executive immediately prior to a change of control;


the
relocation of the executive's principal executive office to a location more than 100 miles (or 35 miles in the case of Mr. Hanaka) further from
the executive's principal residence than the executive's principal executive office immediately prior to such relocation, or any requirement that the executive be based anywhere other than the
executive's principal executive office;


any
failure by the combined company to require a successor to the combined company to assume the agreement; or


any
other material breach by the combined company of any of the terms and conditions of the applicable employment agreement.

quotations. 

Dividend Information    

        Gart has never declared or paid any dividends on its common stock. Gart plans to retain earnings to finance future growth and therefore has no current plans to
pay cash dividends. The payment of any future cash dividend will be at the sole discretion of Gart's board of directors and will depend upon, among other things, future earnings, capital requirements
and Gart's general financial condition. The 

terms of the merger agreement with The Sports Authority restrict Gart's ability to pay dividends prior to the consummation of the merger. Gart's ability to declare or pay dividends on its common
stock is not limited under its revolving line of credit. The revolving line of credit does, however, limit the amount of loans that may be made to Gart. Gart's subsidiaries may loan it amounts needed
in the ordinary course of business, as defined in the credit agreement, and, in addition, up to $10.0 million in the aggregate and declare up to $6.0 million in dividends each fiscal
year. Beginning in August 2002 until August 31, 2003, Gart's subsidiaries may loan Gart additional amounts, totaling up to $15.0 million, to fund repurchases of its common stock. 

        The
Sports Authority has not declared or paid any dividends on its common stock since its initial public offering in 1994 and intends to retain its earnings to finance future internal
investments. Therefore, it does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The declaration and payment of dividends, if any, is subject to the discretion of The Sports
Authority's board of directors. In addition, certain agreements contain restrictions on The Sports Authority's ability to pay dividends, including the merger agreement with Gart, which restricts The
Sports Authority's ability to pay dividends on its common stock prior to the consummation of the merger. The timing, amount and form of dividends, if any, will depend on, among other things, The
Sports Authority's results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors. 

Repurchase of Stock    

        During Gart's 1999 fiscal year, its board of directors authorized a discretionary program to purchase up to $3 million of Gart common stock, from time to
time, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions using Gart's available cash. On March 5, 2001, Gart's board of directors authorized it to continue its discretionary share
purchase program and authorized it to purchase an additional $3 million of Gart common stock. Gart purchased 194,600 shares of its common stock during its 2000 fiscal year at a cost of
approximately $1,191,000 and 229,216 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $3,110,000 during its 2001 fiscal year. In July 2002, Gart's board of directors authorized it to
continue its discretionary share purchase program and authorized it to purchase an additional $12 million of its common stock. In August 2002, Gart's board of directors authorized it to
continue its discretionary share purchase program and authorized it to purchase an additional $15 million of its common stock. During Gart's 2002 fiscal year, Gart repurchased 961,399 shares of
its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $18 million. As of February 1, 2003, Gart has authorization from its board of directors to repurchase up to an
additional $9 million shares of Gart common stock. The merger agreement prohibits Gart from further repurchases of stock without The Sports Authority's prior written consent. 

Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Statements    

        The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements of the combined company are presented to show how they might have looked if Gart and
The Sports Authority had been combined for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2003. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements are based on the assumptions set forth in the
related notes and should be read in conjunction with the separate historical consolidated financial statements of Gart and The Sports Authority and related notes thereto. 

        The
unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of income for the 52 weeks ended February 1, 2003 presents the condensed statement of operations of the combined company as if
the merger of Gart and The Sports Authority had occurred on February 3, 2002, the first day of the fiscal year ended February 1, 2003. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance
sheet as of February 1, 2003 reflects Gart's financial position as if the merger of Gart with The Sports Authority had occurred on February 1, 2003. 

        The
unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements give effect to: 


the
merger, including the issuance of approximately 12 million shares of Gart common stock in the merger and the conversion of outstanding The Sports
Authority stock options to Gart options; 

the
repayment of indebtedness under both companies' existing bank facilities; 

additional
borrowings under the new term loan from CIT, at or shortly after the effective date of the merger, for direct costs of the merger and loan
origination fees totalling approximately $24.5 million. 

additional
borrowings under the new term loan from CIT for other costs to carry out the merger of the companies, estimated to be incurred within a year of
the effective date of the merger, including primarily severance, employee relocation costs, and estimated costs to close certain stores totalling approximately $67.0 million. 

an
independent assessment of The Sports Authority's contractual lease rates on its store operating leases compared to the net current market rents for those
locations; 

the
estimated costs associated with the closing of certain stores; 

elimination
of a non-recurring tax benefit recognized by The Sports Authority related to the reversal of deferred tax asset valuation allowances
and recording of tax expense at a statutory rate of 39%; and 

certain
other adjustments made to record the assets and liabilities of The Sports Authority at their estimated fair values. 

        The
unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements have not been adjusted to reflect any operating efficiencies that may be realized by the combined company as a result of
the merger. 

        The
merger will be treated as a purchase of The Sports Authority by Gart as the accounting acquiror in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141,
"Business Combinations." Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of The Sports Authority will be adjusted to their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of The Sports
Authority's net assets will be recorded as goodwill. The preliminary adjustments to net assets and goodwill which are shown in these unaudited combined condensed pro forma financial statements are
based upon various estimates and may be further adjusted based on certain valuation studies to be conducted. 

        The
combined company expects to incur certain charges and expenses related to integrating the operations of Gart and The Sports Authority. Both companies are assessing the combined
operating structure, human resource needs, business processes and circumstances that bear upon the operations, facilities and other assets of these businesses and are developing a combined strategic
and operating plan. The objective of this plan will be to enhance productivity and efficiency of combined operations. The nature of any integration-related charges and expenses may include provisions
for: duplicative costs to operate two corporate offices for a period of time after the merger becomes effective, advertising costs to perform grand re-openings or re-branding
of stores in certain markets, costs associated with consolidating corporate offices and relocating employees of The Sports Authority, or other charges identified in connection with the development and
implementation of the plan. The unaudited combined condensed pro forma financial statements do not reflect such anticipated charges and expenses. 

        The
unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements do not purport to be indicative of the results of the combined company's operations or financial position that would have
been achieved had the merger of Gart and The Sports Authority actually occurred as of the assumed dates and for the periods presented and they do not purport to project or predict the combined
company's future results of operations or financial position.

(B)  

        To reflect an increase in deferred financing costs of $6.0 million related to obtaining the new line of credit to finance the merger, offset by the
writeoff of lease acquisition and other lease costs, and unamortized bank fees as described in Note A, above. 

(C)  

        To eliminate the deferred rent liability and other long term liabilities currently recorded by The Sports Authority. The deferred rent liability is approximately
$36 million and represented the difference between the historical amounts recorded as expense compared to the actual cash payments made under the terms of The Sports Authority's operating
leases for their store locations. This deferred rent does not represent a liability to the combined company and as such is eliminated. A deferred rent liability will be recorded by the combined
company for the difference between amounts expensed and cash paid under the terms of these leases on a go forward basis. 

(D)  

        To reflect the elimination of The Sports Authority's stockholders' equity and to reflect the issuance of Gart common stock and granting of Gart's stock options as
consideration for the merger. 

(E)  

        To reflect amortization of the asset recorded for favorable leases, over the remaining terms of the leases, ranging from 1 to 20 years, totaling $2,148,
and a decrease in amortization of $354 related to the write off of lease acquisition and other lease costs of certain properties, which were being amortized over terms ranging from 15 to
20 years. The favorable lease asset represents the fair value attributable to the excess of current market rents over the contractual rents in The Sports Authority's store operating leases. The
lease acquisition costs represents costs incurred to secure certain store locations, the value of which were considered as part of the favorable lease assessment. 

(F)  

        To reflect a decrease in fixed asset depreciation and an increase in compensation expense. 

        The
decrease in fixed assets depreciation is due to the reduction in carrying value of certain leasehold improvements of The Sports Authority in connection with the anticipated closing
of certain stores. The useful lives of these assets are approximately eight years, and therefore the reduction will result in a decrease of approximately $329 per year. The $208 increase in
compensation expense reflects the impact of employment agreements entered into as part of the merger. 

(G)  

        To reflect the elimination of transaction costs recorded by The Sports Authority in their historical results of operations for fiscal 2002 totaling approximately
$1,600 that would not have been incurred if not for the merger. 

(H)  

        To reflect an increase in interest expense due to borrowings under the new line of credit to finance the merger. Interest expense was estimated using 5.0%. In
addition, interest expense was increased to reflect the amortization of the deferred financing costs described in Note B. 

(I)  

        To reflect adjustments to The Sports Authority's balances to conform them to Gart's presentation, including adjustments to reclassify certain employee discounts
from operating expenses to sales and certain service department fees, payroll and benefits of buying staff, and depreciation on facilities from operating expenses to cost of goods sold. Also,
adjustments were made to reclassify credit card receivables from accounts receivable to cash and equivalents. 

(J)  

        To record the tax effect of the net pro forma adjustments and record tax expense at an estimated statutory rate of 39%, eliminating the effect of a tax benefit
recorded by The Sports Authority related to the reversal of deferred tax asset valuation allowances. 

GENERAL:  


Adjustments
to inventories will be necessary at the effective date of the merger to adjust inventories to fair value, based upon an estimated selling price
less selling costs and a normal 

profit
margin thereon. Due to uncertainty concerning the amount of this item, no adjustment has been presented in the pro forma financial statements. 


The
Sports Authority accounts for its inventories under the lesser of weighted average cost or market method. Effective at the date of merger, The Sports
Authority's inventories will be recorded at fair value as described above and from that date forward, Gart's method of recording inventory on the last-in first-out method of
accounting will be used. The effect of the change from weighted average cost
to last-in first-out accounting for inventories on the historical results of The Sports Authority is not presented because it is not determinable.


Estimates
for the accrued liability related to store closings, as a result of the merger are included herein. The stores ultimately identified for closure
will be subject to additional detail analysis during the integration process and are subject to approval, after the effective date of the merger, and are subject to change.


The
pro forma amounts above result in a net deferred tax asset balance of approximately $76 million. There have been no pro forma adjustments made to
establish a valuation allowance to reduce this asset for amounts that may not be realized. At this time we are unable to completely assess if the net deferred tax asset will be fully utilized. We will
continue to assess the ability to fully utilize this asset, as more facts become available.


Additional
analysis will be required to determine the fair value of the fixed assets of The Sports Authority. Gart may determine that certain fixed assets
will not be utilized on a go forward basis and would assess fair value of those assets accordingly. At this time Gart has not completed its assessment of the fair value of fixed assets.


Additional
analysis will be required to determine the fair value of any finite-lived intangible assets. At this time, Gart has not completed its assessment
regarding intangible assets and, therefore, no adjustment has been made to reflect any such asset or related amortization expense. 

Description of Gart Capital Stock    

The following summary is a description of the material terms of Gart common stock, does not purport to be complete and is subject in all
respects to the applicable provisions of Delaware law and of the constituent documents of Gart and each of its subsidiaries. Gart's certificate of incorporation and bylaws are filed as exhibits to the
registration statement of which this document is a part.

General    

        Gart's certificate of incorporation currently authorizes the issuance of up to 22,000,000 shares of common stock, $.01 par value per share, and 3,000,000 shares
of preferred stock, $.01 par value per share, the rights and preferences of which may be established by Gart's board of directors. At its annual meeting, Gart's stockholders are being asked to approve
an amendment to Gart's certificate of incorporation that would be effective upon consummation of the merger and that would increase the number of authorized shares of Gart capital stock from
25,000,000 to 85,000,000, increase the number of authorized shares of Gart common stock, par value $.01 per share, from 22,000,000 to 75,000,000 and increase the number of authorized shares of Gart
preferred stock, par value $.01 per share, from 3,000,000 to 10,000,000. As of                        , 2003,
                        shares of Gart common stock were issued and outstanding and held by
            stockholders of record and no shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding. At its annual meeting, Gart's stockholders are being asked to approve the issuance of shares
of
common stock to the current stockholders of The Sports Authority in connection with the merger. 

Common Stock    

        The holders of Gart common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of Gart common stock and are entitled to vote for the election of directors and on all
other matters requiring stockholder action. Subject to the rights of the preferred stock, Gart's board of directors may declare dividends on Gart common stock out of any assets or funds legally
available for dividend payments. If Gart liquidates, dissolves or winds up, the holders of Gart common stock will be entitled to share ratably, in accordance with their rights and interests, in the
net assets of Gart. Holders of Gart common stock have no preemptive rights or rights to convert their shares of Gart common stock into any other securities. There are no redemption or sinking fund
provisions applicable to Gart common stock. All outstanding shares of Gart common stock are fully paid and nonassessable. 

        For
a summary of the provisions contained in Gart's certificate of incorporation that would have an effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Gart and that would
operate only with respect to extraordinary corporate transactions, such as a merger, reorganization, tender offer, or sale or transfer of substantially all of Gart's assets or liquidation, see the
section entitled "Comparison of Rights of Stockholders and Governance MattersProvisions Relating to Acquisitions and Business Combinations," commencing on page 80 of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus. 

Preferred Stock    

        Gart's board of directors is authorized to issue, in one or more series, up to an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock. If Gart's stockholders approve
the proposed amendment to Gart's certificate of incorporation, Gart will be authorized to issue, in one or more series, up to an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The number of
authorized shares of preferred stock may be increased or decreased by the affirmative vote of a majority of the holders of Gart's capital stock entitled to vote, without a separate vote of the
preferred stock as a class. Subject to any limitations prescribed by law, Gart's board of directors is authorized to fix the designation of each series of preferred stock and the powers, preferences,
and rights of the series, including, but not limited to, 

voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges, liquidation preferences and sinking fund provisions, as well as to fix the limitations or restrictions of the series. 

        The
rights of Gart common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. Issuance of preferred
stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or
of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, a majority of Gart's outstanding voting stock. Gart has no present plans to issue any shares of preferred stock. 

Registration Rights of Stockholders    

        Leonard Green is entitled to require Gart to register shares of Gart common stock under the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to a January 1998 registration
rights agreement with Gart. The agreement provides that, among other things, Leonard Green will have the right to make up to four demands that Gart register their shares and "piggyback" requests that
their shares be included in any registration statement relating to an offering of Gart's equity securities for Gart's own account or for the account of others under the Securities Act of 1933. These
rights are subject to certain conditions and limitations that are set forth in the agreement. These rights terminate on the earlier of the date when all the shares entitled to be registered have been
sold and the date when the shares entitled to be registered may be sold to the public without registration under the Securities Act of 1933. 

        Marilyn
Oshman and other former stockholders of Oshman's are entitled to require Gart to register shares of Gart common stock under the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to a
June 2001 registration rights agreement with Gart. The agreement provides that, among other things, these stockholders will have the right to make up to three demands that Gart register their
shares and "piggyback" requests that their shares be included in any registration statement relating to an offering of Gart's equity securities for Gart's own account or for the account of others
under the Securities Act of 1933. These rights are subject to certain conditions and limitations that are set forth in the agreement. These rights terminate no later than five years from the date of
the registration rights agreement (subject to extension in certain situations). 

Comparison of Rights of Stockholders and Governance Matters    

        The rights of Gart's stockholders currently are governed by Gart's certificate of incorporation and Gart's bylaws. The rights of The Sports Authority's
stockholders currently are governed by The Sports Authority's certificate of incorporation and The Sports Authority's bylaws. Upon the completion of the merger, the rights of The Sports Authority's
stockholders who become stockholders of Gart in the merger will be governed by Gart's certificate of incorporation and Gart's bylaws. Gart and The Sports Authority are each incorporated under the laws
of the State of Delaware. Accordingly, in addition to Gart's certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the Delaware General Corporation Law will continue to govern the rights of The Sports Authority's
stockholders after the completion of the merger. 

        The
following description summarizes the material differences between the rights of holders of Gart common stock and the rights of holders of The Sports Authority common stock. The
description, however, is not a complete statement of all those differences, nor is it a complete description of the specific provisions referred to in this summary. The identification of specific
differences is not intended to indicate that other equally or more significant differences do not exist. Stockholders should read carefully the relevant provisions of the Delaware General Corporation
Law, Gart's certificate of incorporation, Gart's bylaws, The Sports Authority's certificate of incorporation and The Sports Authority's bylaws. For information as to how to obtain those documents, see
the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information," commencing on page 118 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

statement/prospectus.

The Sports Authority's certificate of incorporation expressly opts out of the application of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

Certificate of Incorporation

/

% of the voting power inc of the then outstanding voting stock not beneficially owned by the interested stockholder or its affiliate to approve certain
business combinations between Gart or its subsidiaries and such interested stockholder or its affiliate. For more information, see " Business Combination Provision in Gart's Certificate of Incorporation" commencing on page 81 of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus.

The Sports Authority's certificate of orporation does not contain a "business combination" provision.

 Delaware "Business Combination" Statute  

        Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any "business combination" with any person, defined
broadly to include corporations and other business entities, who is an interested stockholder (defined as a person who owns 15% or more of a corporation's voting stock) for a period of three years
following the time that person became an interested stockholder, unless: 


before
the time at which the person became an interested stockholder, the corporation's board of directors has approved either the business combination or
the transaction that resulted in the person becoming an interested stockholder;


upon
consummation of the transaction that resulted in the person becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the
corporation's voting stock 

outstanding
at that time, excluding for determining voting stock outstanding the shares owned by persons who are both directors and officers and shares owned by employee stock plans in which employee
participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or 


at
or after the time at which the person became an interested stockholder, the business combination is approved by the corporation's board of directors and
is authorized by the affirmative vote, at an annual or special meeting and not by written consent, of at least 66

/

% of the corporation's outstanding voting stock not owned by the
interested stockholder. 

        For
purposes of determining whether a person is the "owner" of 15% or more of a corporation's voting stock for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law,
ownership generally is defined to include the right, directly or indirectly, to acquire the stock or to control the voting or disposition of the stock. 

        A
"business combination" generally is defined to include: 


any
merger or consolidation of the corporation or any of its majority-owned subsidiaries with the interested stockholder or with any other corporation or
business entity if the interested stockholder caused such merger or consolidation and as a result, the three exceptions to Section 203's general prohibition on business combinations with
interested stockholders as described above, are inapplicable to the surviving corporation;


sales
or other dispositions of 10% or more of the assets or outstanding stock of a corporation or any of its majority-owned subsidiaries with or to an
interested stockholder;


specific
transactions resulting in the issuance or transfer to the interested stockholder of any stock of the corporation or any of its majority-owned
subsidiaries;


specific
transactions that would result in an increase in the proportionate share of the stock of a corporation or any of its majority-owned subsidiaries
that is owned by the interested stockholder; and


any
receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit, directly or indirectly, except proportionately as a stockholder, of any loans, advances,
guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits provided by or through the corporation or any of its majority-owned subsidiaries. 

        A
Delaware corporation may elect not to be governed by Section 203 pursuant to a provision contained in (1) its original certificate of incorporation or (2) an
amendment by stockholder action to its certificate of incorporation or bylaws, provided that, in addition to any other vote required by law, such an amendment is approved by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares entitled to vote, which amendment shall not be effective until 12 months after its adoption. In the case of a bylaw, such an amendment adopted thereto may not be further
amended by the corporation's board of directors. 

 "Business Combination" Provision in Gart's Certificate of Incorporation  

        Gart's certificate of incorporation requires that, in addition to any vote required by law, the required vote for the approval of certain business combinations
between Gart or any of its subsidiaries and an "interested stockholder" or an affiliate thereof, must represent 66

/

% of the voting power of the then outstanding voting stock not
beneficially owned by the interested stockholder or an affiliate thereof. Additionally, the stockholders must be present in person or by proxy at the meeting of Gart's stockholders at which the
business combination is considered, and must vote together as a single class. For purposes of Gart's certificate of incorporation, an "interested stockholder" is any person or entity that: 


is
the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of Gart's outstanding voting stock; 


is
an affiliate of Gart and, at any time within the two-year period immediately preceding the transaction, was the beneficial owner of 10% or
more of the voting power of Gart's then outstanding voting stock; or


is
an assignee of, or has otherwise succeeded to, any shares of Gart's voting stock that were at any time within the two-year period immediately
preceding the transaction, beneficially owned by any interested stockholder, unless the assignment or succession occurred in a transaction or series of transactions involving a public offering. 

        A
person or entity generally has "beneficial ownership" of any shares of Gart's voting stock: (1) if it or any of its affiliates or associates beneficially owns the stock within
the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; (2) if it or any of its affiliates or associates has the right to acquire or vote the stock pursuant to
any agreement, arrangement or understanding, or upon the exercise or conversion of exchange rights, warrants or options; or (3) that are beneficially owned by any other person or entity with
which such person or entity or any of its affiliates or associates has an agreement for acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of any shares of voting stock. 

        The
following transactions require the special 66

/

% vote described above: 


a
merger or consolidation of Gart or any of its subsidiaries with any interested stockholder or with any other corporation which immediately before the
merger or consolidation is an affiliate of the interested stockholder;


the
sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition of 20% or more of the assets of Gart or any of its subsidiaries to an interested
stockholder or its affiliates;


the
issuance or transfer of any of Gart's or any of its subsidiaries' securities to an interested stockholder or its affiliates in exchange for cash or other
property that has a value equal to or greater than 20% of Gart's assets, unless the issuance or transfer of the securities is made ratably to all of Gart's stockholders;


the
adoption of a plan or proposal for Gart's liquidation or dissolution proposed by or on behalf of an interested stockholder or its affiliates; or


any
reclassification of securities, recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation of Gart or any other transaction that results in an increase of
the proportionate share of the outstanding shares of any
class of equity securities of Gart's or any of its subsidiaries that are beneficially owned by an interested stockholder or its affiliates. 

        Gart's
certificate of incorporation provides that the business combination described above will not be subject to the special 66

/

% vote described above if:
(1) the business combination is approved by a majority of Gart's disinterested directors or (2) the transaction meets the price and procedure requirements described in Gart's certificate
of incorporation. A "disinterested director" is a director of Gart who either (1) is not an affiliate of the interested stockholder and was a director of Gart before the business combination
was proposed or (2) succeeded a disinterested director and is not an affiliate of the interested stockholder and was recommended to succeed the interested director by a majority of the
disinterested directors on Gart's board of directors. 

        The
Sports Authority's certificate of incorporation does not contain a "business combination" provision. Instead, it expressly opts out of the application of Section 203.

Record Date and Outstanding Shares    

        Gart's board of directors has fixed the close of business
on                        , 2003, as the record date. Only stockholders of record of Gart common stock on the
books of Gart as of the close of business on the record date will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the annual meeting and any postponements or adjournments of the meeting.
On                        ,
2003, there were                        shares of Gart common stock issued and outstanding held
by                        stockholders of record. The record stockholder number does not include the number of persons
whose stock is held in nominee or "street name" accounts through brokers. 

Quorum and Vote Required    

        A majority of all shares of Gart common stock outstanding on the record date, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum for the transaction of
business at Gart's annual meeting. 

        If
a quorum is not obtained, or if fewer shares of Gart common stock are voted in favor of the matters presented for consideration and approval at Gart's annual meeting than the number
of shares necessary to approve these matters, Gart expects that the annual meeting will be postponed or adjourned for the purpose of allowing additional time for obtaining additional proxies or votes.
At any subsequent reconvening of Gart's annual meeting, all proxies will be voted in the same manner as such proxies would have been voted at the original convening of the annual meeting, except for
any proxies that have been effectively revoked or withdrawn prior to the subsequent annual meeting. 

        Each
holder of Gart common stock will be entitled to one vote, in person or by proxy, for each share of Gart common stock registered in the holder's name on the books of Gart as of the
record date on any matter submitted for the vote of the Gart's stockholders. The seven persons who receive the highest number of votes will be elected to Gart's board of directors. The proposals to
issue Gart common stock in the merger, and adopt the long-term incentive compensation plan and the performance bonus plan will each be approved if the number of shares voted in favor of
the applicable proposal exceeds the number of shares voted in opposition. The proposal to amend Gart's certificate of incorporation, effective upon consummation of the merger, to change its name and
increase its share capital will be approved if a majority of the outstanding shares of Gart common stock entitled to vote are voted in favor of this proposal. 

        Leonard
Green has entered into a stockholder's agreement with The Sports Authority, pursuant to which Leonard Green has agreed, among other things, to vote its shares in favor of the
issuance of Gart common stock in connection with the merger, the amendment to Gart's certificate of incorporation and any other matter necessary to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement. As of February 1, 2003, Leonard Green held 3,113,200 shares of Gart common stock, which represented approximately 26% of all outstanding shares of Gart common stock entitled to vote
at Gart's annual meeting. See the section entitled "Related AgreementsStockholder's Agreement Between The Sports Authority and Leonard Green," commencing on page 63 of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus. As of                        , 2003, Gart's directors and executive officers and their affiliates, as
a group, beneficially owned an aggregate of                        shares of Gart
common stock (excluding shares subject to options and 3,113,200 shares held by Leonard Green), which represented approximately    % of all outstanding shares of Gart common stock entitled
to vote at Gart's annual meeting. Gart's officers and directors have informed Gart that they intend to vote their shares in favor of the merger proposals. 

How Shares Will Be Voted at the Annual Meeting    

        All shares of Gart common stock represented by proxies properly executed and received by Gart before or at Gart's annual meeting, and not revoked, will be voted
in accordance with the instructions indicated on the proxies. If a proxy is properly executed and returned and no instructions are indicated thereon, the shares will be voted: 


"FOR"
the approval of the issuance of Gart common stock in the merger;


"FOR"
the approval of the amendment to Gart's certificate of incorporation, effective upon consummation of the merger;


"FOR"
each of the seven nominees named on page 86 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus;


"FOR"
the adoption of the long-term incentive compensation plan; and


"FOR"
the adoption of the performance bonus plan. 

        Abstentions
and broker non-votes are included in the determination of the number of shares present and voting. Abstentions and broker non-votes, however, are
tabulated separately. Abstentions are counted in tabulations of votes cast on proposals presented to the stockholders and will have the same effect as negative votes. Broker non-votes will
not be counted as votes cast for or against a 

particular proposal and therefore will have no effect in determining the outcome of the vote on a particular matter, except that a broker non-vote will have the same effect as a vote
against the amendment to Gart's certificate of incorporation. A broker "non-vote" occurs on a proposal when a broker is not permitted to vote on that proposal without instruction from the
beneficial owner of the shares and no instruction is given. 

        Gart's
board of directors currently is not aware of any business to be acted upon at the annual meeting other than as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. If, however,
other matters are properly brought before the annual meeting, or any adjournments or postponements of the meeting, in the absence of instructions to the contrary, persons appointed as proxies will
have discretion to vote or act on the matters in their best judgment. 

        The
people named as proxies by a stockholder may propose and vote for one or more adjournments of the annual meeting to permit further solicitations of proxies in favor of approval of
the share issuance, certificate of incorporation amendment and the other proposals to be voted on at the annual meeting, except that no proxy that is voted against the approval of the share issuance
or certificate of incorporation amendment will be voted in favor of any such adjournment. 

How to Revoke a Proxy    

        The presence of a Gart stockholder at the annual meeting, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, will not automatically revoke the stockholder's proxy. A
Gart stockholder who is the record holder of such stock, however, may revoke a proxy at any time prior to its exercise by: 


delivery
to Gart's secretary of a written notice of revocation prior to the annual meeting (or, if the annual meeting is adjourned or postponed, prior to the
time the adjourned or postponed meeting is actually held);


delivery
to Gart's secretary of a duly executed proxy bearing a later date prior to the annual meeting (or, if the annual meeting is adjourned or postponed,
prior to the time the adjourned or postponed meeting is actually held); or


attending
the annual meeting (or, if the annual meeting is adjourned or postponed, by attending the adjourned or postponed meeting) and voting in person at
the annual meeting. 

        If
a stockholder's shares are held in the name of a broker or nominee, that stockholder may change its vote by submitting new voting instructions to its broker or nominee. A stockholder
whose shares are held in the name of a broker or nominee may not vote its shares in person at its stockholders meeting unless it obtains a signed proxy from the record holder giving it the right to
vote its shares. 

Solicitation of Proxies    

        Proxies may be solicited by mail, personal interview, telephone, facsimile and electronic mail by Gart's directors, officers and employees on a
part-time basis and for no additional compensation. Gart will bear the costs it incurs in the solicitation of proxies under this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including amounts paid in
reimbursement to banks, brokerage firms, custodians, nominees and others for its expenses in forwarding soliciting material to the beneficial owners of Gart common stock. 

Communications by Gart's Stockholders with Gart    

        Any written revocation of a proxy or other communications in connection with this joint proxy statement/prospectus and requests for additional copies of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus or the proxy card should be addressed to Investor Relations, Gart Sports Company, 1050 W. Hampden Avenue, Englewood, Colorado 80110. If you have any questions or need
further assistance in voting your shares, please call Investor Relations at (303) 863-2293. 

Recommendation of Gart's Board of Directors    

Gart's board of directors has, by unanimous vote, approved each of the proposals and unanimously recommends that Gart's stockholders vote
"FOR" the approval of the proposals.

Additional Annual Meeting Matters for Gart    

Election of Directors of Gart    

General    

        At Gart's annual meeting, Gart's stockholders will be asked to vote on the election of seven directors. If the merger is not consummated, each director so elected
will hold office until Gart's next annual meeting and until his or her successor is elected and duly qualified. If the merger is consummated, Gart's board of directors will be reconstituted to consist
of four designees of Gart and four designees of The Sports Authority and the reconstituted board will elect a ninth director who is currently unaffiliated with either company. 

        There
are no family relationships between any director, nominee or executive officer of Gart and any other director, nominee or executive officer of Gart. Except as described in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, there are no arrangements or understandings between any director, nominee or executive officer of Gart and any other person pursuant to which he or she has been or
will be selected as a director and/or executive officer of Gart. 

Voting    

        The seven persons who receive the highest number of votes at Gart's annual meeting will be elected to Gart's board of directors. Each nominee has consented to
being named in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and to serve if elected. Stockholders are not allowed to cumulate their votes in the election of directors. An abstention will have the same effect
as a vote withheld for the election of directors. A broker non-vote will not be treated as voting in person or by proxy on the proposal. 

        Each
proxy received will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on the proxy. If a proxy is properly executed and returned but no instructions are indicated on the proxy,
then the proxy will be voted "FOR" the election of each of the nominees named below. Although it is not contemplated that
any nominee named below will decline or be unable to serve as a director, if any nominee declines or is unable to serve as a director, the proxies may be voted with discretionary authority for any
substitute designated by Gart's board of directors. 

Nominees    

        The names of the nominees and related information as of April 4, 2003 are set forth below.

Report of the Compensation Committee    

        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in any of Gart's previous filings under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that
might incorporate future filings, including this joint proxy statement/prospectus, in whole or in part, the following Report of the Compensation Committee and the Performance Graph set forth on
page 101 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus shall not be incorporated by reference into any such filings. 

        The
Compensation Committee of Gart's board of directors, composed of outside directors of Gart's board of directors, reviews the performance of Gart's executive officers, determines the
compensation of Gart's executive officers and is active in reviewing salaries, bonuses and other forms of compensation for other of Gart's officers and key employees. The Compensation Committee is
empowered by Gart's board of directors to award stock options, grants of restricted shares of Gart common stock, and permitted purchases of Gart common stock to Gart's key employees. 

        The
Compensation Committee has access to independent compensation data and is authorized, if determined appropriate in any particular case, to engage outside compensation consultants. 

        The
objectives of the Compensation Committee are to support Gart's achievement of desired standards of performance, to provide compensation and benefits that will attract and retain
superior talent and reward performance, and to cause some portion of compensation to be based on Gart's performance. 

        Gart's
executive compensation program generally is composed of base salary, bonuses based upon Gart's achievement of a target level of earnings before income taxes, interest expense and
other financing costs, and depreciation, and amortization, and long-term incentives in the form of stock options, restricted stock grants and permitted stock purchases. 

 Base Salaries  

        In Gart's fiscal year ended on February 1, 2003, base salaries for Gart's executive officers were competitively set relative to salaries of officers of
companies included in the Standard & Poor's Retail Index that are comparable to Gart in business and size. In each instance, base salary takes into account individual experience and performance
specific to Gart. The Compensation Committee generally attempts to provide compensation approximating the median of comparable companies. Except for increases associated with promotions or increased
responsibility, increases in base salaries for Gart's 

executive officers from year to year are limited to adjustments to reflect increases in the rate of inflation. 

        The
Compensation Committee is aware that the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, treats certain elements of executive compensation in excess of $1 million a year as an
expense not deductible by Gart for federal income tax purposes. For the fiscal year ended February 1, 2003, no executive officer's compensation exceeded the cap on deductibility. To the extent
compensation to an executive officer exceeds the cap in the future, the Compensation Committee will consider the facts and circumstances at that time to reach a determination regarding the impact of
the cap on such compensation. 

 Bonus Plan  

        Bonuses for executive officers and certain other officers and members of Gart's target bonus management team are paid pursuant to Gart's Bonus Plan. The purpose
of the Bonus Plan is to provide an incentive for executives and other of Gart's key employees and to reward them in relation to the degree to which specified earnings goals are achieved. Under the
Bonus Plan, eligible employees are awarded cash bonuses based upon the extent to which Gart achieves a target level of pre-tax earnings established each year by the Compensation Committee.
The amount of each employee's cash bonus, as determined by the Compensation Committee, is a percentage of salary ranging from a maximum of 70% (for the chief executive officer) to 10% depending on
position, if Gart achieves 100% of the target pre-tax earnings. Bonuses also can be increased or decreased, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, if the target
pre-tax earnings is exceeded or not achieved. Bonuses were awarded in respect of the fiscal year ended on February 1, 2003 based on Gart achieving 65% of the target
pre-tax earnings. Gart's board of directors may choose to continue, amend or terminate the Bonus Plan in future years. In addition, subject to the approval of its stockholders at its 2003
annual meeting, Gart intends to adopt a new bonus plan. Gart will not adopt this new bonus plan unless it is approved by Gart stockholders. See the section entitled "Adoption of the Gart Sports
Company 2003 Performance Bonus Plan" commencing on page 107 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

 1994 Management Equity Plan  

        The Compensation Committee administers Gart's 1994 Management Equity Plan, as amended. Under the terms of the 1994 Management Equity Plan, the Compensation
Committee may award key employees (including officers and directors who are employees) of Gart or its subsidiaries (1) grants of Gart common stock ("Grant Shares"), (2) permitted
purchases of Gart common stock ("Purchased Shares") or (3) options to purchase shares of Gart common stock, or any combination of the foregoing as determined by the Compensation Committee.
Three million shares of Gart common stock have been reserved for issuance pursuant to awards that may be granted under Gart's 1994 Management Equity Plan and, as of February 1, 2003, 349,054
shares of Gart common stock were available for issuance pursuant to awards that may be granted under this plan. 

        The
Compensation Committee believes that employee equity ownership provides significant additional motivation to maximize value for Gart's stockholders. Therefore, the Compensation
Committee periodically grants stock options to Gart's employees, including executive officers. Stock options are granted typically at the prevailing market price and, therefore, will only have value
if Gart common stock increases over the exercise price. The Compensation Committee believes that the grant of stock options provides a long-term incentive to employees to contribute to
Gart's growth and establishes a direct link between compensation and stockholder return, measured by the same index used by stockholders to measure Gart's performance. The terms of the stock options
granted by Gart, including number of shares, vesting, exercisability and stock option term, are determined by the Compensation Committee, based upon the position and responsibilities of the applicable
employee, the historical and expected contributions of the applicable employee, any previous option grants to the 

applicable employee and a review of competitive equity compensation for executive officers of similar rank in companies that are comparable to Gart's industry and size. 

        In
the case of stock options, the Compensation Committee has the authority to determine whether stock options shall be intended as "incentive stock options" or
"non-incentive" or "nonqualified" stock options under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. No more than an aggregate of 600,000 shares of Gart common stock
may be issuable upon the exercise of outstanding incentive stock options at any time. Stock options may be transferred by an optionee during his or her lifetime only to the extent permitted by the
Compensation Committee. Gart, subject to the approval of its stockholders at its 2003 annual meeting, intends to adopt a new long-term incentive compensation plan. See the section entitled
"Adoption of the Gart Sports Company 2003 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan," commencing on page 102 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

 Compensation of Chief Executive Officer  

        The compensation package of John Douglas Morton, Gart's president, chief executive officer and chairman, was determined in accordance with the principles
described above. In 2002, Mr. Morton received a base salary of $537,076 and a bonus of $261,625. In addition, Mr. Morton received certain other customary perquisites and benefits in
2002. The Compensation Committee approved Mr. Morton's total compensation based on the following factors, which are listed in the order of importance to the Compensation Committee:
(1) improvement in Gart's financial performance and (2) Gart's comparative performance with other companies in its industry. In February 2003, Gart entered into an employment
agreement with Mr. Morton, which will be effective upon consummation of the merger. For a description of this agreement see the section entitled "Related AgreementsGart Employment
Agreements" commencing on page 64 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Compensation and Severance Agreements and Plans    

 Change in Control Severance Agreements  

        Gart is party to a change in control severance agreement with most of its officers, including Mr. Morton and each of the other executives officers named in
the Summary Compensation Table; provided that, if the merger is consummated, Gart's severance agreement with Mr. Morton, as well as with various other executive officers, will be superceded by
employment agreements which will become effective at the effective time of the merger. For a description of these employment agreements, see the section entitled "Related AgreementsGart
Employment Agreements," commencing on page 64 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

        The
severance agreements provide that an officer is entitled to a severance payment if a transaction resulting in a change in control occurs and, within one year from the date of the
transaction, either the officer's employment is terminated, other than for cause, or the officer resigns for "good reason" (as defined in the severance agreements). The severance payments consist of:
(1) payment, in one lump sum, of an amount equal to the officer's base salary for a specified severance period (three years for Gart's president, two years for executive vice presidents, one
and one-half years for senior vice presidents, and one year for vice presidents), (2) payment of the "on plan" bonus amount for the fiscal year in which termination of employment
occurs, multiplied by the applicable 

severance period for the officer, (3) medical, dental, life and other insurance benefits for the applicable severance period and (4) any automobile that Gart provides to the officer.
After a transaction resulting in a change of control occurs, Gart's officer may resign for "good reason" and receive his or her severance payment if the officer's base salary or bonus is reduced, the
officer's responsibilities and position are reduced, or the officer is required to work at a location more than 30 miles from Gart's current executive offices. 

 Employee Benefit Plan  

        Gart maintains a non-standard 401(k) profit sharing plan for all eligible employees. The non-standard 401(k) profit sharing plan allows
eligible employees to make tax deferred contributions and provides for discretionary matching contributions by Gart as determined by Gart's board of directors. Gart currently makes a matching
contribution in an amount equal to 30% of a participant's deferral (up to 6% of
such participant's compensation). In Gart's fiscal year ended on February 1, 2003, the aggregate amount of Gart's matching contributions was approximately $522,000. 

 Deferred Compensation Plan  

        During the 1999 fiscal year, Gart began a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for some members of management. Eligible employees may contribute a portion of
their base salary or bonuses to the plan annually. The nonqualified deferred compensation plan provides for additional matching contributions by Gart, with limitations similar to those under Gart's
401(k) plan, as well as discretionary contributions, in an amount determined by Gart before the end of each plan year. Gart made no matching contributions to the deferred compensation plan during its
fiscal year ended on February 1, 2003. 

Report of the Audit Committee of Gart's Board of Directors    

        The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed Gart's consolidated financial statements with management. The Audit Committee has discussed with Deloitte &
Touche LLP the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61 (Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards, AU (S) 380). The Audit Committee has received
the written disclosures and the letter from Deloitte & Touche LLP required by Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1 (Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1,
Independence Discussions with Audit Committees) and has discussed with Deloitte & Touche LLP that firm's independence. 

        Based
upon the Audit Committee's review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended that Gart's audited consolidated financial statements be included in Gart's
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2003 for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Gart's Relationship with Independent Auditors    

Audit Fees    

        The aggregate fees billed to Gart by Deloitte & Touche LLP for professional services rendered for the audit of Gart's consolidated financial statements for
the fiscal year ended February 1, 2003 and the reviews of Gart's consolidated financial statements included in Gart's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters
ended May 4, 2002, August 3, 2002 and November 2, 2002 were $282,229. 

Financial Information Systems Design and Implementation    

        There were no fees billed to Gart by Deloitte & Touche LLP for financial information systems design and implementation for the fiscal year ended
February 1, 2003. 

All Other Fees    

        The aggregate fees billed to Gart by Deloitte & Touche LLP for services rendered, other than the services covered above under "Audit Fees" and "Financial
Information Systems Design and Implementation," for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2003 were $699,037. 

        The
Audit Committee has determined that the provision of services other than audit services to Gart by Deloitte & Touche LLP is compatible with maintaining Deloitte &
Touche LLP's independence. 

Independent Auditors for the Combined Company    

        The audit committee of the combined company will select independent auditors for the combined company following consummation of the merger. 

Performance Graph of Gart    

        The following graph shows a comparison of cumulative total returns for Gart common stock registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, the Nasdaq Composite Index, the Standard & Poor's Retail Index and a peer group of companies during the period commencing January 31, 1998 (the last trading day preceding the first
day of Gart's fifth preceding fiscal year) and ending on February 1, 2003. In reviewing this graph, you should keep in mind the possible effect that the limited trading in Gart common stock may
have had on the price of Gart common stock. 

        The
comparison assumes $100.00 was invested on January 31, 1998 and assumes the reinvestment of all dividends, if any. The peer group consists of the following publicly traded
sporting goods retailers: Sport Chalet, Inc., Hibbett Sporting Goods, Inc. and The Sports Authority, Inc. 

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance of Gart    

        Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires Gart's directors, executive officers and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class
of Gart's equity securities to file reports of initial ownership and reports of changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such directors, officers and 10% stockholders are
required to furnish Gart with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 

        Based
solely on a review of the copies of such reports furnished to Gart, Gart believes that during the 2002 fiscal year, all section 16(a) requirements applicable to its
directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders were complied with. 

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions Relating to Gart    

        Gart entered into noncancelable consulting agreements with Alvin N. Lubetkin and Marilyn Oshman, who are former Oshman's executives in connection with our
acquisition of Oshman's on June 7, 2001. Ms. Oshman is currently a director of Gart and Mr. Lubetkin was a director of Gart until his resignation effective June 27, 2002.
Pursuant to the consulting agreements, Gart agreed to pay a fee of $175,000 per year to Ms. Oshman for her services to be rendered over a period of 12 months, and Gart agreed to pay a
fee of $400,000 per year to Mr. Lubetkin for his services to be rendered over a period of 30 months. The agreement with Ms. Oshman terminated in June 2002. 

        Gart
leases properties from partnerships or trusts, the partners and trust accounts of which are affiliated with certain of its current and former directors and their family members.
Eight leases are with partnerships or trusts, the partners and trust accounts of which are affiliated with Mr. Lubetkin (a former Gart director), Ms. Oshman (a current Gart director) and
their family members. One such lease is for a store sold by a third party to an entity controlled by Mr. Lubetkin. Seven related leases are for a distribution center and Oshman's former
corporate offices in Houston, Texas, which Gart leases from Oshman family trusts, including trusts for the benefit of Ms. Oshman. For fiscal 2002, rent expense under these leases was in the
aggregate approximately $1.1 million. 

        Leonard
Green owns approximately 26% of Gart's currently outstanding common stock. Gart has entered into a management services agreement with Leonard Green, whereby Leonard Green
receives an annual retainer fee plus reasonable expenses for providing certain management, consulting and financial planning services. The management services agreement also provides that Leonard
Green may receive reasonable and customary fees and reasonable expenses from time to time for providing financial advisory and investment banking services in connection with major financial
transactions that Gart undertakes. The management services agreement terminates on April 20, 2004. The minimum management fee currently is $500,000 per year based on the current level of
ownership of Leonard Green in Gart. Gart paid a management fee to Leonard Green of $625,000 for fiscal year 2002, $4.833 million (which includes a fee of $4 million in connection with
its acquisition of Oshman's in 2001) for fiscal 2001 and $500,000 for fiscal 2000. In addition, Gart will pay Leonard Green a fee of $4.25 million, plus out-of-pocket
expenses, in connection with the merger. In 2002, Gart also paid Leonard Green's out-of-pocket expenses in connection with its sale of 3,000,000 shares of Gart common stock in
a public offering. 

Adoption of the Gart Sports Company 2003 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan    

General    

        At Gart's annual meeting, Gart stockholders will be asked to adopt the Gart Sports Company 2003 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan, a copy of which
is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex F. Gart stockholders are encouraged to review the incentive compensation plan carefully. Any description in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus of the incentive compensation plan is qualified in its entirety by a reference to Annex F. Stockholders are being asked to approve the incentive compensation plan, with the intent
of avoiding the possibility that the deductibility for federal income tax purposes of various types of awards under the plan will be limited by Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 (which, under certain circumstances, causes compensation in excess of $1 million to an employee in a year not to be deductible to the employer). 

Purpose    

        The purpose of the incentive compensation plan is to provide Gart with the flexibility to selectively use stock options and other awards as part of an overall
compensation package for key employees, which should enhance the Gart's ability to attract and retain these individuals who are important to the success and growth of the business and Gart's
subsidiaries in an intensely competitive business 

environment. Gart believes that awards under the incentive compensation plan may serve to broaden the equity participation of key employees and further link the long-term interests of
management and stockholders. Gart will consider awards pursuant to the incentive compensation plan in light of its overall compensation philosophy and competitive conditions in the marketplace. A
number of Gart's competitors utilize equity and other awards as a component of their incentive compensation programs. The use of equity-based and other compensation should more closely align executive
incentives with the long-term goals of the Gart's stockholders, in a tax-efficient manner. 

Voting    

        The proposal to adopt the incentive compensation plan will be approved if, at Gart's annual meeting, the number of shares voted in favor of this proposal exceeds
the number of shares voted against this proposal. Abstentions will count as votes against this proposal because they will be counted as present at the meeting and entitled to vote on, but not for,
this proposal. Broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast for or against this proposal and will not affect the outcome of the vote on this matter. 

        Each
proxy received will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on the proxy. If a proxy is properly completed, signed and returned but no instructions are indicated on
the proxy, then the proxy will be voted "FOR" the adoption of the incentive compensation plan. 

Gart's board of directors recommends that Gart stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the Gart Sports Company 2003 Incentive Compensation
Plan.

Description of the Gart Sports Company 2003 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan    

Administration    

        The incentive compensation plan will be administered by a committee of Gart's board of directors, consisting of two or more non-employee directors,
each of whom is intended to be, to the extent required by Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, a
non-employee director under Rule 16b-3 and an outside director under Section 162(m). If no committee exists, the functions of the committee will be exercised by
Gart's board of directors. 

        The
committee has the full authority to administer and interpret the incentive compensation plan, to authorize the granting of awards, to determine the eligibility of an employee,
director or consultant to receive an award, to determine the number of shares of common stock to be covered by each award (subject to the individual participant limitations provided in the incentive
compensation plan), to determine the terms, provisions and conditions of each award (which may not be inconsistent with the terms of the incentive compensation plan), to prescribe the form of
instruments evidencing awards and to take any other actions and make all other determinations that it deems necessary or appropriate in connection with the incentive compensation plan or the
administration or interpretation thereof. 

Eligibility and Types of Awards    

        Key employees, directors and consultants of Gart and its subsidiaries are eligible to be granted stock options, restricted stock, phantom shares, dividend
equivalent rights and other stock-based awards under the incentive compensation plan. As of the date hereof, no awards have been granted under the incentive compensation plan. Eligibility for awards
under the incentive compensation plan is determined by the committee. 

Available Shares    

        Subject to adjustment upon certain corporate transactions or events, a maximum of    % of the number of shares of Gart common stock outstanding from
time to time may be subject to stock options, shares of restricted stock, phantom shares and dividend equivalent rights under the incentive compensation plan. The maximum number of shares of Gart
common stock subject to incentive stock options granted under the incentive compensation plan may not
exceed                        . In addition, subject to adjustment upon certain corporate transactions or
events, a participant may not receive options for more than            shares of Gart common stock over the life of the incentive compensation plan. 

Awards Under the Plan    

 Stock Options  

        The terms of specific options, including whether options shall constitute "incentive stock options" for purposes of Section 422(b) of the Internal Revenue
Code, shall be determined by the committee. The exercise price of an option shall be determined by the committee and reflected in the applicable award agreement. The exercise price with respect to
incentive stock options may not be lower than 100% (110% in the case of an incentive stock option granted to a 10% stockholder of Gart) of the fair market value of Gart common stock on the date of
grant. Each option will be exercisable after the period or periods specified in the award agreement, which will generally not exceed ten years from the date of grant (or five years in the case of an
incentive stock option granted to a 10% stockholder of Gart). Options will be exercisable at such times and subject to such terms as determined by the committee at the time of grant. 

 Restricted Stock  

        Restricted stock will be subject to restrictions (including, without limitation, any limitation on the right to vote a share of restricted stock or the right to
receive any dividend or other right or property) as the committee shall determine. Except as otherwise determined by the committee, upon a termination of employment or other service for any reason
during the applicable restriction period, all shares of restricted stock still subject to restrictions shall be forfeited to Gart. 

 Phantom Shares  

        Phantom shares will vest as provided in the applicable award agreement. A phantom share represents a right to receive the fair market value of a share of Gart
common stock, or, if provided by the committee, the right to receive the fair market value of a share of Gart common stock in excess of a base value established by the committee at the time of grant.
Subject to the provisions of the applicable award agreement, upon a participant's termination of employment or other service, all phantom shares (whether or not otherwise vested) will be forfeited and
cease to be outstanding. Phantom shares may generally be settled in cash or by transfer of shares of common stock (as may be elected by the participant or the committee). The committee may, in its
discretion and under certain circumstances, permit a participant to receive as settlement of the phantom shares installments over a period not to exceed ten years. In addition, the committee may
establish a program under which distributions with respect to phantom shares may be deferred for additional periods as set forth in the preceding sentence. 

 Dividend Equivalents  

        A dividend equivalent is a right to receive (or have credited) the equivalent value (in cash or shares of common stock) of dividends declared on shares of common
stock otherwise subject to an award. The committee may provide that amounts payable with respect to dividend equivalents shall be 

converted into cash or additional shares of Gart common stock. The committee will establish all other limitations and conditions of awards of dividend equivalents. 

 Other Stock-Based Awards  

        The incentive compensation plan authorizes the granting of other awards based upon the common stock (including the grant of securities convertible into Gart
common stock and stock appreciation rights), and subject to terms and conditions established at the time of grant. 

Change in Control    

        Upon a change in control of Gart (as defined in the incentive compensation plan), the committee may make such adjustments as it, in its discretion, determines are
necessary or appropriate in light of the
change in control, but only if the committee determines that the adjustments do not have an adverse economic impact on the participants (as determined at the time of the adjustments). 

Amendment and Termination    

        Gart's board of directors may amend the incentive compensation plan as it deems advisable, except that it may not amend the incentive compensation plan in any way
that would adversely affect a participant with respect to an award previously granted unless the amendment is required in order to comply with applicable laws. In addition, Gart's board of directors
may not amend the incentive compensation plan if the amendment would cause the incentive compensation plan to fail to comply with any requirement of applicable law or regulation, unless and until such
amendment is approved by Gart's stockholders. 

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences    

 Stock Options  

        In general, neither the grant nor the exercise of an incentive stock option will result in taxable income to an option holder or a deduction for Gart. To receive
special tax treatment as an incentive stock option under the Internal Revenue Code as to shares acquired upon exercise of an incentive stock option, an option holder must neither dispose of the shares
within two years after the incentive stock option is granted nor within one year after the transfer of the shares to the option holder pursuant to exercise of the option. In addition, the option
holder must be an employee of Gart or a qualified subsidiary at all times between the date of grant and the date three months (one year in the case of disability) before exercise of the option.
(Special rules apply in the case of the death of the option holder.) Incentive stock option treatment under the Internal Revenue Code generally allows the sale of Gart common stock received upon the
exercise of an incentive stock option to result in any gain being treated as a capital gain to the option holder, but Gart will not be entitled to a tax deduction. The exercise of an incentive stock
option (if the holding period rules described in this paragraph are satisfied), however, will give rise to income includable by the option holder in his or her alternative minimum taxable income for
purposes of the alternative minimum tax in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the stock acquired on the date of the exercise of the option over the exercise price. 

        If
the holding period rules noted above are not satisfied, gain recognized on the disposition of the shares acquired upon the exercise of an incentive stock option will be characterized
as ordinary income. This gain will be equal to the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise. (Special rules may apply to disqualifying
dispositions where the amount realized is less than the value at exercise.) Gart will generally be entitled to a deduction equal to the
amount of such gain included by an option holder as ordinary income. Any excess of the amount realized upon such disposition over the fair market value at exercise will generally be
long-term or 

short-term capital gain depending on the holding period involved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if exercise of the option is permitted other than by cash payment of the exercise price,
various special tax rules may apply. 

 Non-Qualified Stock Options  

        No income will be recognized by an option holder at the time a non-qualified stock option is granted. Ordinary income will generally be recognized by
an option holder, however, at the time a non-qualified stock option is exercised in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the exercise
date over the exercise price. Gart will generally be entitled to a deduction for federal income tax purposes in the same amount as the amount included in ordinary income by the option holder with
respect to his or her non-qualified stock option. Gain or loss on a subsequent sale or other disposition of the shares acquired upon the exercise of a non-qualified stock
option will be measured by the difference between the amount realized on the disposition and the tax basis of such shares, and will generally be long-term or short-term capital
gain depending on the holding period involved. The tax basis of the shares acquired upon the exercise of any non-qualified stock option will be equal to the sum of the exercise price of
the non-qualified stock option and the amount included in income with respect to the option. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that exercise of the option is permitted other than
by cash payment of the exercise price, various special tax rules may apply. 

 Restricted Stock  

        Unless a holder of restricted stock makes an "83(b) election" (as discussed below), there generally will be no tax consequences as a result of the grant of
restricted stock until the restricted stock is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture or is transferable (free of the risk). Generally, when the restrictions are lifted, the holder will
recognize ordinary income, and Gart will be entitled to a deduction, equal to the difference between the fair market value of the stock at that time and the amount, if any, paid by the holder for the
restricted stock. Subsequently realized changes in the value of the stock generally will be treated as long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending on the length of
time the shares are held prior to disposition of the shares. In general terms, if a holder makes an 83(b) election (under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code) upon the award of
restricted stock, the holder will recognize ordinary income on the date of the award of restricted stock, and Gart will be entitled to a deduction, equal to (i) the fair market value of the
restricted stock as though the stock were (A) not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture or (B) transferable, minus (ii) the amount, if any, paid for the restricted stock. If
an 83(b) election is made, there will generally be no tax consequences to the holder upon the lifting of restrictions, and all subsequent appreciation in the restricted stock generally would be
eligible for capital gains treatment. 

 Phantom Shares  

        The phantom shares have been designed with the intention that there will be no tax consequences as a result of the granting of a phantom share until payment is
made with respect to the phantom share. When payment is made, the participant generally will recognize ordinary income, and Gart will generally be entitled to a deduction, equal to the fair market
value of the common stock and cash, as applicable, received upon payment. 

 Dividend Equivalents  

        There generally will be no tax consequences as a result of the award of a dividend equivalent. When payment is made, the holder of the dividend equivalent
generally will recognize ordinary income, and Gart will be entitled to a deduction, equal to the amount received in respect of the dividend equivalent. 

 Securities and Exchange Act of 1934  

        Additional special tax rules may apply to those award holders who are subject to the rules set forth in Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

The foregoing tax discussion is a general description of certain expected federal income tax results under current law, and all affected individuals should
consult their own advisors if they wish any further details or have special questions.

Adoption of the Gart Sports Company 2003 Performance Bonus Plan    

General    

        At Gart's annual meeting, Gart stockholders will be asked to adopt the Gart Sports Company 2003 Performance Bonus Plan, a copy of which is attached to this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as Annex G. Gart stockholders are encouraged to review the performance bonus plan carefully. Any description in this joint proxy statement/prospectus of the performance
bonus plan is qualified in its entirety by a reference to Annex G. Stockholders are being asked to approve the performance bonus plan, with the intent of avoiding the possibility that the
deductibility for federal income tax purposes of bonus compensation thereunder will be limited by Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (which, under certain circumstances, causes
compensation in excess of $1 million to an employee in a year not to be deductible to the employer). 

Purpose    

        The purpose of the performance bonus plan is to enable the compensation committee of Gart to establish performance goals for officers and key employees to
determine bonuses that will be awarded on the basis of these goals and to ensure that bonus payments are in accordance with the arrangements established by the committee. 

Voting    

        The proposal to adopt the performance bonus plan will be approved if, at Gart's annual meeting, the number of shares voted in favor of this proposal exceeds the
number of shares voted against this proposal. Abstentions will count as votes against this proposal because they will be counted as present at the meeting and entitled to vote on, but not for, this
proposal. Broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast for or against this proposal and will not affect the outcome of the vote on this matter. 

        Each
proxy received will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on the proxy. If a proxy is properly completed, signed and returned but no instructions are indicated on
the proxy, then the proxy will be voted "FOR" the adoption of the long-term incentive plan. 

Gart's board of directors recommends that Gart stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the Gart Sports Company 2003 Performance Bonus
Plan.

Description of the Gart Sports Company 2003 Performance Bonus Plan    

Authority to Establish Performance Goals and Bonuses    

        Under the performance bonus plan, Gart's compensation committee may establish for officers or key employees (as determined by the committee) a performance goal,
and bonus formula related to that performance goal. Performance goals may relate to particular fiscal years or to periods that are longer or shorter than a single fiscal year. A bonus formula may be
(1) a percentage of the consolidated pre-tax or after-tax earnings or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation or amortization, often referred to as EBITDA, of Gart
and its subsidiaries, or of the separate pre-tax or after-tax earnings or EBITDA of particular subsidiaries or divisions of Gart, (2) changes (or the 

absence of changes) in the per share or aggregate market price of Gart common stock or (3) the extent of achievement of specified levels of revenues, gross margin (rate or dollars), comparable
stores sales, earnings, costs, return on assets, return on equity, return on capital, return on investment, number of units sold or average sale prices with regard to Gart, particular subsidiaries,
divisions or other business units of Gart or particular officers or groups of employees. Performance goals may be in absolute amounts or percentages of amounts or may be relative to the performance of
other companies or of an index. A bonus formula shall be established in writing by the committee before the commencement of the period of service to which the formula relates, or not later than
90 days after the commencement of the period of service to which the formula relates (as long as the outcome is substantially uncertain at the time the committee actually establishes the
formula, and the formula is not established after 25% or more of the period of service has elapsed (determined in good faith by the committee at the time the formula is established)). Bonuses can,
however, be granted on bases other than those set forth above in the case of any bonus for which an exception from the limitations of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code is not being
sought. 

        No
officer or key employee may, however, be awarded a bonus for any fiscal year in excess of
$                        or    % of the consolidated pre-tax income of Gart in
such fiscal year. 

        Bonuses
may be payable in single lump sums, or over a period of years, with or without interest on deferred payments, and may be made forfeitable to the extent recipients do not continue
to be employed by Gart or its subsidiaries throughout the period during which the bonuses are payable. 

Review of Payment of Bonuses    

        At the end of each fiscal year, management will present to the compensation committee a list showing, by employee, the employee's performance goal or bonus
formula, the extent to which the performance goal was achieved and the bonus, if any, to which the employee is therefore entitled. No bonuses may
be paid until the compensation committee certifies that the bonus presented by management is correct based on the performance goals and bonus formula in respect of that employee. 

Administration    

        The compensation committee will administer the plan, and have full power to interpret the plan, and to change the rules and regulations for its administration.
Interpretations of the plan, performance goals, bonus formulas and bonuses by the committee will bind Gart and all employees who are affected by it. The committee will have total discretion to
determine what performance goals and bonus formulas to establish for what officers and key employees. The committee will not be required to establish similar goals and formulas for similarly situated
employees. 

No Rights to Continued Employment    

        Nothing in the performance bonus plan or its administration, and no award of any bonus payable immediately or in the future, will give any officer or employee a
right to continue as an employee or otherwise affect Gart's ability to terminate the employee at any time. 

Amendments    

        The compensation committee may, with the approval of Gart's board of directors, amend the plan at any time, except that no amendment to the plan will be effective
if it materially changes any of the criteria on which bonuses may be based, alters the amount of maximum bonus that may be paid to recipients with regard to a fiscal year or other period or otherwise
materially changes the plan unless the amendment is approved by the stockholders. 

Termination    

        The plan may be terminated at any time by the compensation committee with the approval of Gart's board of directors. Terminating the plan, however, will not
affect any previously established performance goal or bonus formula, nor the right to receive payments of a bonus earned prior to the termination. 

Submission of Proposals by Gart's Stockholders    

        In order to be eligible for inclusion in Gart's proxy statement and proxy card for the next annual meeting of Gart stockholders pursuant to
Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, stockholder proposals must be received by the secretary of Gart at its principal executive offices no later than
                        , 2004. In order for such stockholder proposals to be eligible to be brought before the Gart stockholders
at the next annual meeting of Gart stockholders, however, the Gart stockholder
submitting the proposals also must comply with the procedures, including the deadlines, required by Gart's bylaws. Stockholder nominations of directors are not stockholder proposals within the meaning
of Rule 14a-8 and are not eligible for inclusion in Gart's proxy statement. 

Other Matters Presented at the Annual Meeting of Gart's Stockholders    

        Gart does not know of any other business to be presented at the annual meeting of Gart's stockholders, and does not intend to bring any other matters before the
annual meeting. If any other matters properly come before the annual meeting, however, the persons named in the accompanying proxy are empowered, in the absence of instructions to the contrary, to
vote according to their best judgment. 

The Special Meeting of The Sports Authority's Stockholders    

General    

        This joint proxy statement/prospectus is furnished in connection with the solicitation of the enclosed proxy from holders of The Sports Authority common stock by
The Sports Authority's board of directors for use at the special meeting of The Sports Authority's stockholders to be held at The Sports Authority's corporate offices located at 3383 North State Road
7, Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33319 on                        , 2003, beginning
at                        , local time, and at any adjournment or postponement of the meeting.

Purpose of the Meeting    

        The special meeting will be held to consider and vote upon the following: 

1.
A
proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 19, 2003, by and among Gart Sports Company, Gold Acquisition Corp. and The Sports
Authority, Inc. and approve the merger of Gold Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gart, with and into The Sports Authority.

2.
Any
other business that properly comes before the meeting or any adjournments or postponements of the meeting. 

Record Date and Outstanding Shares    

        The Sports Authority's board of directors has fixed the close of business
on                        , 2003, as the record date. Only stockholders of record of The Sports
Authority common stock on the books of The Sports
Authority as of the close of business on the record date will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting and any postponements or adjournments of the meeting.
On                        ,
2003, there were            shares of The Sports Authority common stock issued and outstanding held by            stockholders of
record. The record stockholder number does not include the
number of persons whose stock is held in nominee or "street name" account through brokers. 

Quorum and Vote Required    

        A majority of all shares of The Sports Authority common stock outstanding on the record date, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum for the
transaction of business at The Sports Authority's special meeting. 

        If
a quorum is not obtained, or if fewer shares of The Sports Authority common stock are voted in favor of the matters presented for consideration and approval at The Sports Authority's
special meeting than the number of shares necessary to approve these matters, The Sports Authority expects that the special meeting will be postponed or adjourned for the purpose of allowing
additional time for obtaining additional proxies or votes. At any subsequent reconvening of The Sports Authority's special meeting, all proxies will be voted in the same manner as such proxies would
have been voted at the original convening of the special meeting, except for any proxies that have been effectively revoked or withdrawn before the subsequent special meeting. 

        Each
holder of The Sports Authority common stock will be entitled to one vote, in person or by proxy, for each share of The Sports Authority common stock registered in the holder's name
on books of The Sports Authority as of the record date on any matter submitted for the vote of The Sports Authority's stockholders. The proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger
will be approved if a majority of the outstanding shares of The Sports Authority common stock entitled to vote are voted in favor of the adoption of merger agreement and approval of the merger. 

        None
of The Sports Authority's stockholders have entered into voting agreements with Gart. As of                        , 2003, The
Sports Authority's directors and executive officers and their
affiliates, as a group, beneficially owned an aggregate of            shares of The Sports Authority common stock (excluding shares subject to options and rights to receive deferred shares
under
the Director's Stock Plan), which represented approximately    % of all outstanding shares of The Sports Authority common stock entitled to vote at The Sports Authority's special meeting.
The Sports Authority's officers and directors have informed The Sports Authority that they intend to vote their shares in favor of the merger proposals. 

How Shares Will Be Voted at the Special Meeting    

        All shares of The Sports Authority common stock represented by proxies properly executed and received by The Sports Authority before or at The Sports Authority's
special meeting will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on the proxies. If the proxy is properly completed, signed and returned but no instructions are indicated, the shares will
be voted "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the merger contemplated thereby. 

        Abstentions
and broker non-votes are included in the determination of the number of shares present and voting. However, abstentions and broker non-votes will have
the same effect as a vote against a particular proposal. A broker "non-vote" occurs on a proposal when a broker is not permitted to vote on that proposal without instruction from the
beneficial owner of the shares and no instruction is given. 

        The
Sports Authority's board of directors currently is not aware of any business to be acted upon at the special meeting other than as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
If, however, other matters are properly brought before the special meeting or any adjournments or postponements of the meeting, in the absence of instructions to the contrary, persons appointed as
proxies will have discretion to vote or act on the matters in their best judgment. 

        The
people named as proxies by a stockholder may propose and vote for one or more adjournments of the special meeting to permit further solicitations of proxies in favor of the adoption
of the merger agreement and approval of the merger; except that no proxy which is voted against the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger will be voted in favor of any such
adjournment. 

How to Revoke a Proxy    

        The presence of a stockholder of The Sports Authority at the special meeting, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, will not automatically revoke the
stockholder's proxy. However, a stockholder of The Sports Authority who is the record holder of the shares may revoke a proxy at any time prior to its exercise by: 


delivery
to The Sports Authority's secretary of a written notice of revocation prior to the special meeting (or, if the special meeting is adjourned or
postponed, prior to the time the adjourned or postponed meeting is actually held);


delivery
to The Sports Authority's secretary of a duly executed proxy bearing a later date prior to the special meeting (or, if the special meeting is
adjourned or postponed, prior to the time the adjourned or postponed meeting is actually held); or


attending
the special meeting (or, if the special meeting is adjourned or postponed, by attending the adjourned or postponed meeting) and voting in person at
the special meeting. 

        If
a stockholder's shares are held in the name of a broker or nominee, that stockholder may change its vote by submitting new voting instructions to its broker or nominee. A stockholder
whose 

shares are held in the name of a broker or nominee may not vote its shares in person at its stockholders meeting unless it obtain a signed proxy from the record holder giving it the right to vote its
shares. 

Solicitation of Proxies    

        Proxies may be solicited by mail, personal interview, telephone, facsimile and electronic mail by The Sports Authority's directors, officers and employees on a
part-time basis and for no additional compensation. The Sports Authority will bear the costs it incurs in the solicitation of proxies under this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including
amounts paid in reimbursement to banks, brokerage firms, custodians, nominees and others for their expenses in forwarding soliciting material to the beneficial owners of The Sports Authority common
stock. 

        The
Sports Authority has retained The Altman Group to assist it with the solicitation of proxies and to verify certain records related to the solicitations. The Sports Authority has
agreed to pay The Altman Group customary fees for services rendered and to indemnify The Altman Group against certain liabilities arising out of The Altman Group's engagement (except for those
resulting from The Altman Group's gross negligence or misconduct). 

Communications by The Sports Authority's Stockholders with The Sports Authority    

        Any written revocation of a proxy or other communications in connection with this joint proxy statement/prospectus and requests for additional copies of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus or the proxy card should be addressed to The Altman Group. If you have any questions or need further assistance in voting your shares, please call The Altman Group at
(800) 215-5608. 

Recommendation of The Sports Authority's Board of Directors    

        The Sports Authority's board of directors believes that the terms of the merger and the merger agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of, The Sports
Authority and its stockholders. The Sports Authority's board of directors has, by unanimous vote, approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and
unanimously recommends that The Sports Authority's stockholders vote "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. 

Dissenter's or Appraisal Rights    

        Dissenter's or appraisal rights are not available with respect to a merger or consolidation by a corporation the shares of which are either listed on a national
securities exchange or Nasdaq or held of record by more than 2,000 stockholders if such stockholders are required to receive only shares of the surviving corporation, shares of any other corporation
which are either listed on a national securities exchange or Nasdaq or held of record by more than 2,000 holders, cash in lieu of fractional shares or a combination of the foregoing. Therefore, The
Sports Authority's stockholders will not be able to exercise any dissenter's or appraisal rights in connection with this merger. 

Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial
  Owners and Management of Gart    

        The shares of Gart common stock constitute the only outstanding class of voting securities of Gart. As of March 31, 2003, there were 11,872,233 shares of

accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into

"). 

A-1

           Section 1.2
    Effective Time; Closing. 
    As promptly as practicable (and in any event within three
Business Days) after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in 

Article VIII

shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a Certificate of Merger (the "
Certificate of Merger
") with the Secretary of State of Delaware and by
making all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL in connection with the Merger, in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of,
the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware, or at such later time as the parties hereto shall agree and
shall be specified in the Certificate of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes effective, the "
Effective Time
"). On the date of such filing (the
"
Closing Date
"), a closing (the "
Closing
") shall be held at 9:00 a.m., New York Time, at the
offices of Clifford Chance US LLP, 200 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10166, or at such other time and location as the parties hereto shall otherwise agree. 

           Section 1.3
    Effect of the Merger. 
    At the Effective Time, the effects of the Merger shall be as
provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL and this Agreement. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation. 

           Section 1.4
    Conversion of Company Common Stock. 
    At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of any holder thereof: 

        (a)  Each
share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares canceled pursuant to 

Section 1.4(b)
, if any, shall automatically be canceled and
shall by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted automatically into the right to receive 0.37 of a fully paid and nonassessable share (the "
Exchange Ratio
") of Parent Common Stock
upon surrender of the certificate that formerly evidenced such share of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in 
Section 2.2
, without
interest. All references to shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to include the rights attached thereto pursuant to the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement dated as of September 11,
2001, between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company as Rights Agent, as amended as of February 19, 2003 (the "
Company Rights
Agreement
"), unless the context indicates otherwise. The consideration to be issued to holders of Company Common Stock is referred to herein as the
"
Merger Consideration
." 

        (b)  Each
share of Company Common Stock (i) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by Parent or Merger Sub or (ii) that is
owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be automatically canceled and retired and cease to exist, and no payment or distribution shall be made
with respect thereto. 

        (c)  All
shares of the Company Common Stock cancelled and converted pursuant to 
Section 1.4(a) 
shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate ("
Certificate
") which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock shall from and after the Effective Time cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with 
Section 1.4(a)
. 

        (d)  The
Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted (i) to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities exchangeable for or convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company
Common Stock occurring after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time and (ii) in the event of a 

A-2

breach of 
Sections 4.2, 5.2, 6.1(c) 
or 
6.2(c) 
of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time, to reflect
fully the effect of any differences attributable to such breach between the number of fully diluted shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock outstanding compared to the numbers set forth
in 
Sections 4.2 
or 
5.2
, respectively, so that 50% of the fully diluted shares of Parent Common Stock
outstanding immediately following the Effective Time will be held by those who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, held shares of Parent Common Stock or options, rights or convertible securities
exercisable for or convertible into shares of Parent Common Stock, and the other 50% of the fully diluted shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding immediately following the Effective Time will be
held by those who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, held shares of Company Common Stock or options, rights or convertible securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of Company
Common Stock. For purposes of this 
Section 1.4(d)
, "fully diluted" shall be computed using the "Treasury Stock Method" under generally accepted
accounting principles and assuming a trading price equal to the trading price on the date hereof. 

           Section 1.5
    Conversion of Common Stock of Merger Sub. 
    Each share of common stock, par value $.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and
become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Surviving Corporation. 

           Section 1.6
    Tax-Free Reorganization. 
    The Merger is intended to be a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and this Agreement is intended to be a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of the regulations promulgated under Section 368(a) of the Code and for the purpose of qualifying as a tax-free transaction for federal income tax
purposes. The parties hereto agree to report the Merger as a tax-free reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a). None of the parties hereto will take or cause to be
taken any action which would prevent the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368(a). 

ARTICLE II

    EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES    

        Section 2.1
    Exchange Agent. 
    Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or
trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as exchange agent hereunder for
the purpose of exchanging Certificates for the Merger Consideration (the "
Exchange Agent
"). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with
the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of the Company Common Stock, certificates representing the Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to 

Section 1.4. 
Parent shall also
deposit with the Exchange Agent from time to time, as needed, amounts sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional
shares in accordance with 
Section 2.5 
and any dividends and other distributions required to be paid upon the surrender of Certificates pursuant
to 
Section 2.3
. 

          Section 2.2
    Exchange Procedures. 
    As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and
in any event within five Business Days), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate immediately prior to the Effective Time (i) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of such Certificates in
exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
(A) a certificate representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to 

Section 1.4 
and (B) cash in lieu
of any fractional shares of applicable Parent Common Stock pursuant 

A-3

to 
Section 2.5
, and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to 
Section 2.3 
(after
giving effect to any required tax withholdings from cash payments), and in each case the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash
payable pursuant to 
Section 2.3 
or 
Section 2.5
. 

           Section 2.3
    Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. 
    No dividends or other
distributions declared or made with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such Certificate and no cash payment in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to 
Section 2.5 
until such holder shall surrender such
Certificate in accordance with 
Section 2.2
. Subject to the effect of any applicable United States federal, state or local or any applicable
foreign statute, law, rule, regulation, ordinance, code, order, judgment, decree or any other applicable requirement or rule of law (a "
Law
"), following
surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (a) promptly after the time of such
surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to 
Section 2.5  
and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date and payment date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender which would have been paid if the
whole shares of Parent Common Stock had been issued as of such record date and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. 

          Section 2.4
    No Further Ownership Rights in the Company Common Stock. 
    All shares of Parent Common
Stock issued and cash paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to 

Section 2.5 
and any dividends or other distributions made pursuant to 
Section 2.3 
upon
conversion of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this 
Article II 
shall be deemed to have been issued or paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock. 

           Section 2.5
    No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock. 

        (a)  No
certificates or scrip or shares of Parent Common Stock representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any such fractional shares and such fractional share interests will not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock. 

        (b)  Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an
amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of applicable Parent Common Stock multiplied by (ii) the per share closing price of Parent Common Stock quoted on the
National Market System ("
NMS
") on the business day prior to the Closing Date. The fractional share interests of Parent Common Stock will be aggregated
with respect to all Certificates tendered by each holder of Company Common Stock, and no holder of record of Company Common Stock will receive cash in an amount equal to or greater than the value of
one full share of Parent Common Stock. 

           Section 2.6
    No Liability. 
    If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to one year
after the Effective Time, any such Merger Consideration or dividends or distributions in
respect thereof 

A-4

shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with the provisions of this 

Article II 
shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for such Merger Consideration or dividends or distributions in
respect thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger
Consideration or any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to six years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration, any dividends or distributions
payable to the holder of such Certificate or any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this 
Article II
,
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration or dividends or distributions in respect
thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

           Section 2.7
    Lost Certificates. 
    If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with
respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this
Agreement. 

           Section 2.8
    Withholding Rights. 
    Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state,
local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation. 

           Section 2.9
    Stock Transfer Books. 
    At the close of business on the Closing Date, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of
shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby, except as otherwise provided herein or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any
reason shall be converted into the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to 
Section 2.3
. 

           Section 2.10
    Shares held by the Company Affiliates. 
    Anything to the contrary in this Agreement
notwithstanding, no shares of Parent Common Stock (or certificates therefor) shall be issued in exchange for any
certificate to any Person who may be an Affiliate of the Company (identified pursuant to 
Section 7.11
) until the Person shall have delivered to
Parent and the Company a duly executed letter as contemplated by 
Section 7.11
.
