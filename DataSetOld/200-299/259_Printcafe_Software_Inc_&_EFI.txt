     Dear Fellow Stockholder:

     I am pleased to ask you to vote at a special meeting of our stockholders to
consider the merger agreement we signed with Electronics For Imaging, Inc., or
EFI. Upon completion of the merger, Printcafe will become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of EFI.

     In the proposed merger, each share of our common stock will be converted
into $2.60 of consideration. The consideration will be paid, at your election,
in shares of EFI's common stock or cash. EFI registered 2,390,497 shares of its
common stock in connection with the merger. EFI's common stock is traded on the
Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "EFII" and its closing price on the
Nasdaq National Market was $          on           , 2003.

     A special committee of our board of directors negotiated the terms and
conditions of the proposed merger and has carefully considered the proposed
merger and unanimously recommended the approval of the merger agreement to our
board of directors. A majority of the members of our board of directors
recommends that you vote to adopt the merger agreement.

     We have scheduled a special meeting of our stockholders to be held on
               , 2003 to consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt the merger
agreement. Your vote is very important regardless of the number of shares you
own. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, please vote as soon
as possible to ensure that your shares will be represented at the special
meeting. You may vote by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed
proxy card in the enclosed prepaid envelope. If you do not vote, it will have
the same effect as voting against the merger.

     We look forward to the successful combination of Printcafe and EFI.

                                          Very truly yours,

                                          Marc D. Olin

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q:  WHAT WILL I RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?

A:  Each share of our common stock you hold will be converted, at your election,
into shares of EFI common stock or cash. If you elect to receive stock, the
number of shares of EFI common stock to be issued for each share of our common
stock is calculated by dividing $2.60 by the average of the closing sales prices
of EFI common stock over 10 trading days ending on and including the fifth
trading day before the special meeting.

     EFI will not issue fractional shares. Rather, you will receive cash
payments, without interest, in place of any fractional EFI shares you would have
otherwise received.

Q:  WHAT STEPS DO I TAKE TO CAST MY VOTE?

A:  You may vote by mailing a signed proxy card in the enclosed return envelope
as soon as possible so that your shares may be represented at the special
meeting. You may also attend the special meeting and vote in person.

Q:  CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE?

A:  Yes. You may change your vote by (1) delivering a written notice of
revocation to our corporate secretary before the beginning of the special
meeting, (2) delivering a later-dated, signed proxy card to our corporate
secretary before the special meeting or (3) by attending the special meeting and
voting in person.

Q:  IF MY BROKER HOLDS MY SHARES IN "STREET NAME," WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY SHARES
FOR ME?

A:  Your broker will vote your shares only if you provide instructions to your
broker on how to vote. You should follow the directions provided by your broker
regarding how to instruct your broker to vote your shares. Without instructions
to your broker, your shares will not be voted and will have the same effect as
if you voted against the adoption of the merger agreement.

Q:  WHAT HAPPENS IF I DO NOT VOTE?

A:  If you do not submit your proxy or instruct your broker to vote your shares
and you do not vote in person at our special meeting of stockholders, the effect
will be the same as if you voted against the adoption of the merger agreement.

Q:  IS THE MERGER TAXABLE TO ME?

A:  You will generally recognize gain or loss for United States income tax
purposes to the extent the amounts received differ from your tax basis in your
shares of our common stock.

     The material United States federal income tax consequences of the
transaction are described in more detail beginning on page   .

     The tax consequences to you will depend on the facts of your situation.
Please consult your tax advisor for a full understanding of the tax consequences
to you of the merger.

Q:  HOW DO I ELECT TO RECEIVE CASH OR SHARES OF EFI COMMON STOCK AS MERGER
CONSIDERATION?

A:  Enclosed with this document is an election form. You may elect to receive
cash or stock with respect to some or all of your shares of our common stock.
You must complete the election form and return it to American Stock Transfer &
Trust Company, EFI's exchange agent, before           , 2003. Your election will
be valid only if your election form is accompanied by the certificates
representing the shares of our common stock that you own. DO NOT SEND YOUR
ELECTION FORM OR STOCK CERTIFICATE WITH YOUR PROXY.

     If your shares are held in "street name" then you must instruct your broker
to make an election on your behalf.

                                        ii

If you do not make an election or your broker does not make an election on your
behalf, then you will receive cash consideration.

Q:  HOW SHOULD I SEND IN MY STOCK CERTIFICATES?

A:  If your shares are held in registered form and you want to elect the form of
consideration you receive in the merger, you must (1) return a completed
election form, and (2) send in your certificates representing your shares of
Printcafe common stock with your completed election form and letter of
transmittal to the exchange agent. If you do not make an election, then you must
keep your certificates until after the closing, when you will receive a letter
of transmittal describing how you may exchange your certificates for cash
consideration. If your Printcafe common stock is held in a brokerage or other
custodial account, you will receive instructions from the entity where your
shares are held, advising you of the procedures for making your election and
delivering your shares.

Q:  AM I ENTITLED TO DISSENTERS' APPRAISAL RIGHTS?

A:  You will be entitled to dissenters' appraisal rights in connection with the
merger so long as you comply with Delaware law, including, among other things,
not voting in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and not
surrendering your certificates representing shares of our common stock. The
availability of dissenters' appraisal rights is discussed in more detail on page
  .

Q:  WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO COMPLETE THE MERGER?

A:  We expect to complete the merger on or about           , 2003. Because the
merger is subject to factors beyond the parties' control, however, we cannot
predict whether or when the merger will be completed.

Q:  ARE THERE ANY SPECIAL RISKS INVOLVED WITH THIS TRANSACTION ABOUT WHICH I
SHOULD BE AWARE?

A:  Yes. All transactions involve risk, and you should be aware that an election
to receive shares of EFI common stock means that you are deciding to receive and
invest in EFI common stock. Some of the particular risks associated with the
merger are discussed in this document, beginning on page   , and risks
associated with an investment in EFI's common stock are discussed in its filings
with the SEC, see "Some Documents are 'Incorporated by Reference"' on page . You
should read and understand all of these risks before deciding whether you will
vote to adopt the merger agreement.

Q:  WHOM CAN I CALL WITH QUESTIONS?

A:  If you have any questions about the merger, or if you would like copies of
any of the documents referred to in this document, you should call MacKenzie
Partners, our proxy solicitor, at (800) 322-2885 or call collect (212) 929-5500

SPECIAL MEETING OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS (SEE PAGE   )

     Time, Date, Place and Purpose.  The special meeting will be held at our
principal executive offices, Forty 24th Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222,
on           , 2003, beginning at 9:00 a.m., local time, to consider and to vote
upon a proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

     Record Date and Votes Required.  You can vote at the special meeting if you
owned our common stock at the close of business on           , 2003. On that
date, there were           shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled
to vote, held by approximately           stockholders of record. You can cast
one vote for each share of our common stock you owned on that date. The
presence, in person or by proxy, of a majority of the outstanding shares of our
common stock is required in order for us to meet the quorum requirement under
our bylaws in order to transact business at the special meeting. Adoption of the
merger agreement requires the vote of the holders of at least a majority of the
outstanding shares of our common stock.

     Please be aware that stockholders representing approximately      % of our
total outstanding voting shares, as of the record date, entered into agreements
with EFI in which they agree to vote all of their shares in favor of adoption of
the merger agreement. Additionally, on February 13, 2003, we granted EFI an
option to acquire approximately 19.9% of the then outstanding shares of our
common stock. As of the record date EFI owned           shares of our common
stock.

     Our directors, executive officers and their affiliates beneficially own
approximately      % of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of
          , 2003. EFI's directors, executive officers and their affiliates
beneficially own approximately      % of the outstanding shares of EFI common
stock as of           , 2003.

     Proxies.  If you vote your shares of our common stock by signing a proxy,
your shares will be voted at the special meeting as you indicate on your proxy
card. If no instructions are indicated on your signed proxy card, your shares
will be voted for adoption of the merger agreement. If your shares are held in
street name, you should follow the directions provided by your broker regarding
how to instruct your broker to vote your shares.

     If you abstain from voting, do not return a proxy card or do not give your
broker authority to vote your shares, your inaction will have the same effect as
a vote against adoption of the merger agreement.

RECOMMENDATION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS (SEE PAGE   )

     On January 22, 2003, our board of directors formed a special committee
consisting entirely of non-management directors who had no financial or
employment interest in our largest stockholder, Creo Inc. The special committee
engaged its own counsel and financial advisor. The special committee negotiated
the terms and conditions of the proposed merger and recommended the approval of
the merger agreement to our board of directors. Our board of directors (with the
two members who are employees of Creo abstaining) approved the merger agreement,
declared the merger agreement advisable, fair to our stockholders and in their
best interests and recommends that you vote for the adoption of the merger
agreement.

OPINION OF UBS WARBURG LLC (SEE PAGE   )

     UBS Warburg LLC, which served as financial advisor to the special
committee, has delivered a written opinion, dated February 25, 2003, to the
special committee and the board of directors that, as of the date of the opinion
and subject to the matters set forth in the opinion, the consideration to be
received by holders of our common stock, other than EFI and its affiliates, in
the merger is fair from a financial point of view to those holders. A copy of
UBS Warburg's opinion, which includes a description of the procedures followed,
assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken,
by UBS Warburg, is attached to this document as Annex B. You are encouraged to
read UBS Warburg LLC's opinion carefully and in its entirety. UBS Warburg LLC
has been paid a fee of $500,000 and, if the merger is completed, will be
entitled to receive an additional fee of $500,000 for acting as financial
advisor to the special committee.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE   )

governing the merger, is attached to this document as Annex A. You are

before the closing. These conditions include the following:

     - The approval of the merger agreement by our stockholders;

     - no legal restraint will be in effect which prevents the completion of the
       merger, prohibits or limits our or EFI's ability to conduct our

       declared effective by the SEC;

     - the shares of EFI common stock to be issued in connection with the merger

     - no occurrence of events or conditions that have, or could reasonably be
       expected to have, a material adverse effect on us or EFI; and

     - EFI must have received "comfort letters" from our independent auditors.

     Covenants (see page   ).  The merger agreement also contains a number of
agreements by Printcafe and EFI, including the following:

     - We agreed to conduct our business in the ordinary course until the merger
       is completed;

     - except for sales under our employee stock purchase program or issuances
       of shares of our common stock upon exercise of options or warrants, we
       agreed that we will not pay dividends, engage in a stock split or a
       similar transaction, or buy or sell any of our securities, until the
       merger is completed;

     - we agreed that we will not, and that we will not permit our subsidiaries,
       officers, directors or representatives, to initiate, solicit, encourage,
       negotiate or take other actions which would lead to any proposal or offer
       from a third party to acquire our capital stock or a substantial part of
       our business or assets, subject only to an exception which allows our
       board of directors to discharge its fiduciary duties; and

     - EFI agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shares of
       EFI common stock to be issued to our stockholders in connection with the
       merger to be listed on the Nasdaq National Market.

     Termination (see page   ).  The parties can terminate the merger agreement
under the following circumstances:

     - We and EFI can mutually agree to terminate the merger agreement;

     - either party can terminate the merger agreement if the closing has not
       occurred by June 30, 2003;

     - EFI can terminate the merger agreement if we breach any of our
       representations, warranties or agreements in the merger agreement and the
       breach would permit EFI not to complete the merger;

     - we can terminate the merger agreement if EFI breaches any of its
       representations, warranties or agreements in the merger agreement and the
       breach would permit us not to complete the merger;

     - EFI can terminate the merger agreement if our board of directors fails to
       recommend approval of the merger agreement to our stockholders or
       withdraws or changes its recommendation; and

     - we may terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into an agreement
       to complete a business combination or sell our stock or assets on terms
       which our board of directors determines are superior to the terms of the
       merger.

     If the merger agreement is terminated because our board of directors
changes its recommendation to you or elects to accept a superior proposal, we
will generally be required to pay $828,000 to EFI upon termination of the merger
agreement.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT (SEE PAGE   )

     As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141,
Business Combinations, EFI will use the purchase method of accounting to account
for the merger.

     Under this method of accounting, our assets and liabilities, including all
intangible assets, will be recorded by EFI at their respective fair market
values. All intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated useful
lives with the exception of goodwill and any other intangibles with indefinite
lives. Goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized;
rather, they will be assessed for impairment on a periodic basis in the future.
Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows will be included in
EFI's financial statements prospectively as of the completion of the merger.

     The pro forma financial statements included in this document include a
preliminary allocation of EFI's costs of the acquisition. You should note that
the final allocation may be materially different from that preliminary
allocation.

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

     Other than effectiveness of the registration statement to which this
document relates, there are no material federal or state regulatory requirements
which must be complied with or approvals which must be obtained in connection
with the merger.

NASDAQ LISTING

     EFI will file an application for listing of additional shares with Nasdaq
after completion of the merger and the listing of those shares is a condition to
our obligation to complete the merger.

EFFECTS OF THE MERGER ON THE RIGHTS OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS (SEE PAGE   )

     If you elect to receive shares of EFI common stock, your rights as
stockholders will be governed by Delaware law and by EFI's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws. Currently, your rights as our stockholder are governed
by Delaware law and by our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. If you elect
to receive shares of EFI common stock, then following the merger your rights as
a stockholder of EFI will differ in some respects from the rights you currently
have.

INTERESTS OF OUR DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   )

     Our directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may
be different from, or in addition to, the interests of our other stockholders.
These interests include the right to retention bonuses, the right to
acceleration of vesting of stock options and the right to indemnification and
insurance coverage for acts or omissions occurring before the merger is
completed. These arrangements are detailed beginning on page   . The special
committee and our board of directors were aware of these arrangements when they
considered the merger.

- ---------------

(1) For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, 1999, 1998, and 1997, goodwill
    amortization was $8,161, $2,040, $57, $57, and $9, respectively, or $0.15,
    $0.04, $0.00, $0.00, and $0.00 per diluted common share, respectively. For
    the nine months ended September 30, 2002 and 2001 the goodwill amortization
    was $0 and $6,120, respectively, or $0.00 and $0.11 per diluted common
    share, respectively.

(2) Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standard No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS 142
    requires among other things, the discontinuance of goodwill amortization and
    establishes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing
    recognized intangibles to goodwill. Upon the adoption of SFAS 142, the
    Company ceased amortizing goodwill and reclassified net intangibles and
    deferred tax liabilities relating to acquired workforce totaling $0.9
    million to goodwill.

(1) For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, 1999, 1998 and 1997, goodwill
    amortization was $19,576, $16,653, $774, $0 and $0, respectively, or
    $121.30, $113.86, $6.83, $0.00, and $0.00 per diluted common share. For the
    nine months ended September 30, 2002 and 2001 the goodwill amortization was
    $0, and $14,700 respectively, or $0.00 and $90.26 per diluted common share.

(2) Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standard No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS 142
    requires among other things, the discontinuance of goodwill amortization and
    establishes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing
    recognized intangibles to goodwill. Upon the adoption of SFAS 142, the
    Company ceased amortizing goodwill.

(3) In June 2002, the Company completed its initial public offering and issued
    3,750,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $10.00 per share. The
    Company received approximately $32,950 in net proceeds and repaid
    approximately $17,800 of related party debt.

          SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     The following information has been derived from the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements set forth elsewhere in this document and
should be read in connection with that information.

     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information
illustrates the estimated effects of the merger as if the merger had occurred at
January 1, 2001 for the statement of operations information and at September 30,
2002 for the balance sheet information. The unaudited pro forma financial
information has been prepared based on the purchase method of accounting and
does not include the impact of non-recurring charges directly attributable to
the merger. The basic unaudited pro forma per share information for EFI is based
on the weighted average number of outstanding shares of EFI common stock
adjusted to include the estimated number of shares of EFI common stock that
would be issued in the merger, assuming 50% of our stockholders elect to receive
shares of EFI common stock. The diluted unaudited pro forma per share
information for EFI is based on the weighted average number of outstanding
shares of EFI common stock adjusted to include (1) the dilutive effect of EFI
employee stock options and (2) the estimated number of shares of EFI common
stock that would be issued in the merger assuming 50% of our stockholders elect
to receive shares of EFI common stock.

     The actual exchange ratio will be the average closing price of EFI's common
stock for the ten consecutive trading days ending on and including the fifth
trading day before the special meeting of our stockholders to vote on a proposal
to adopt the merger agreement. The actual percentage of our stockholders
receiving shares of EFI common stock in connection with the merger will be
determined based on the number of valid elections received by EFI before the
election deadline, which is the business day immediately before the date of the
special meeting of our stockholders.

     The following information is not indicative of future results or of the
results that would have been achieved had the merger been completed on January
1, 2001 or September 30, 2002.

                                                              SEPTEMBER 30, 2002   DECEMBER 31, 2001

COMPARATIVE PER SHARE INFORMATION

     The following table summarizes on a per share basis (1) historical
financial information and (2) unaudited pro forma and equivalent pro forma
financial information.

     The unaudited pro forma per share information for Printcafe is based on the
unaudited pro forma amounts per share for EFI multiplied by an exchange ratio of
0.1967 representing $2.60 divided by an assumed market value of EFI's common
stock of $13.22. For purposes of the pro forma information we have used the
52-week low for EFI common stock, which EFI believes approximates the maximum
potential dilution related to the merger. The information set forth below is
qualified in its entirety by reference to, and should be read in conjunction
with, EFI's and our historical consolidated financial information included or
incorporated by reference in this document and the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial statements included elsewhere in this document.

MARKET PRICE OF EFI'S AND PRINTCAFE'S COMMON STOCK

     The following table shows the closing price per share of EFI's common stock
and our common stock reported on the Nasdaq National Market on (a) February 25,
2003, which was the last trading day before the merger was publicly announced on
February 26, 2003 and (b)           , 2003, the most recent practicable date
before the printing of this document. The "Printcafe Equivalent Per Share Price"
set forth below equals the closing price of EFI's common stock on the applicable

                      RISK FACTORS RELATING TO THE MERGER

     By electing to receive EFI's common stock you will be subject to the risks
of ownership of that security. You are urged to consider carefully the following
important risk factors, as well as those other risk factors that are discussed
in various documents EFI has filed with the SEC and that are incorporated by
reference into this document.

     OUR STOCK PRICE, BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS COULD SUFFER IF THE MERGER IS NOT
COMPLETED.

     If the merger is not completed, we could be harmed in the following ways:

     - If we do not complete the merger with EFI or complete a similar
       transaction with a third party, we do not expect to have sufficient cash
       to repay the $14.2 million of our outstanding debt which becomes due and
       payable in January 2004 without securing additional debt or equity
       financing; we do not expect that debt or equity financing would be
       available;

     - Creo offered, before it withdrew from the bidding process, to acquire the
       55.6% of our common stock that it does not own for prices as low as $1.30
       per share; if we do not complete the merger, we would likely seek to
       complete a similar transaction with a third party and the consideration
       offered by that third party could be substantially less than that offered
       in the merger;

     - we will incur significant costs associated with the merger, including
       legal, accounting, financial printing and financial advisory fees; many
       of these fees must be paid regardless of whether the merger is completed;

     - we could find it difficult to recover if we lose market position or
       opportunities because of the diversion of management attention while
       negotiating the merger;

     - EFI does not have a substantial base of customers in the commercial
       printing industry; the announcement of the merger may result in our
       customers delaying their decision to license our enterprise resource
       planning software which could have a material adverse effect on us;

     - our relationships with employees, including our ability to attract and
       retain key employees, and our relationships with customers and suppliers
       may be disrupted because of the diversion of management attention while
       negotiating the merger; and

     - our stock price would decline to the extent that the price of our stock
       prior to an announcement that the merger is terminated reflects an
       assumption that the merger will, in fact, be completed.

     THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF EFI COMMON STOCK ISSUED TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH
THE MERGER, IF YOU ELECT TO RECEIVE STOCK CONSIDERATION, WILL FLUCTUATE BASED
UPON THE VALUE OF EFI'S COMMON STOCK BEFORE THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER.

     If you elect to receive shares of EFI common stock in connection with the
merger, the exact number of shares of EFI common stock into which your shares of
our common stock will be converted is determined by the average value of EFI's
common stock over a 10-day trading period ending on the fifth trading day before
our special meeting. The average value of EFI's common stock over the 10-day
trading period may be higher or lower than the price as of today's date or as of
the date of the special meeting. The price of EFI's common stock could change
for a variety of reasons, including changes in the business, operations or
prospects of EFI and its subsidiaries; the assessment of, and reaction to, the
merger by the market; general economic conditions; and other factors. There is
no guarantee that the EFI common stock that will be issued to you in exchange
for your shares of our common stock will equal or exceed the market value of
your shares of our common stock on the date on which the merger was announced,
the date of the special meeting, the date of the closing of the merger or at any
other particular time. You are urged to obtain current stock price quotations
for both the EFI common stock and our common stock.

     THE MERGER WILL NOT QUALIFY AS A TAX-FREE REORGANIZATION, AND THE MERGER
CONSIDERATION WILL BE TAXABLE TO YOU.

     The merger will not qualify as a tax-free reorganization under the Internal
Revenue Code, and the cash or the shares of EFI common stock you receive would
result in gain or loss to you to the extent amounts you receive differ from your
tax basis in your shares of our common stock. Any gain or loss will be income
reportable for United States federal income tax purposes. If the fair market
value of the shares of EFI common stock you receive in connection with the
merger exceeds your tax basis in your shares of our common stock, you would have
to report a gain for federal income tax purposes. In connection with the merger,
unless you elect to receive cash for some of your shares of our common stock,
you would not receive cash to satisfy any tax obligation you incur with respect
to that gain.

     EFI COULD EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY INTEGRATING OUR BUSINESS AND ACHIEVING THE
BENEFITS ANTICIPATED IN THE MERGER.

     There are a number of risks and challenges involved with integrating our
business and operations with EFI's businesses, each of which could be difficult
to overcome. These risks and challenges include:

     - Retaining key employees;

     - retaining our customer base; and

     - integrating EFI's and our respective products, operations, procedures and
       systems.

     Current and potential employees of ours and of the surviving corporation in
the merger may be unsure about their role following the merger. Other current or
potential employees could decide that they do not wish to work for a subsidiary
of EFI following completion of the merger. The combination of these two factors
could impair EFI's and our ability to attract and retain key employees. Because
of these and other challenges, it is possible that the merger may not achieve
the desired benefits and synergies anticipated by the parties and the market
price of EFI's common stock could decline.

     SOME OF OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS HAVE INTERESTS IN THE MERGER THAT MAY
DIFFER FROM YOUR INTERESTS IN THE MERGER. THESE DIFFERENT INTERESTS COULD
INFLUENCE OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS TO SUPPORT THE MERGER EVEN THOUGH THE
MERGER MAY NOT BE IN YOUR BEST INTERESTS.

     When you consider the recommendation of our board of directors to adopt the
merger agreement, you should remember that some of our officers and directors
participate in arrangements that provide them with interests in the merger that
are different from, or are in addition to, your interests in the merger. These
interests, which could give rise to conflicts of interest, include the right of
some of our executive officers to retention bonuses and accelerated vesting of
stock options and the right of our directors and officers to indemnification and
insurance coverage for acts or omissions occurring before the merger is
completed. These interests could make it more likely that our directors and
executive officers will support the merger. You should consider carefully
whether these interests might have influenced our directors and officers to
support and recommend the merger and decide for yourself whether the merger is
in your best interests.

     WE MAY BECOME OBLIGATED TO PAY A FEE TO EFI.

     In the merger agreement, subject to several exceptions, we agreed that we
will not pursue transactions similar to the merger, including other mergers,
sales of assets, sales of capital stock or other business combinations, with any
third party. If we rely upon one of the exceptions to this obligation and pursue
a superior proposal, we must pay EFI a termination fee of $828,000, whether or
not the alternative transaction is ultimately completed. If our stockholders do
not approve the merger and within 12 months we enter into an agreement for or
complete a similar transaction for consideration equal to or greater than that
offered by EFI, we must pay EFI a termination fee of $828,000. If the merger is
terminated, and if our board of directors seeks to engage in a similar
transaction with a different party, that party may not complete the alternative
transaction. In addition, if we enter into an agreement with another party for a

transaction similar to the merger, EFI can require us to repurchase the shares
of common stock purchased by EFI upon exercise of the option that we granted to
EFI.

     THE PRICE OF EFI'S COMMON STOCK IS AFFECTED BY FACTORS DIFFERENT FROM THE
FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

     If you elect to receive shares of EFI common stock you will become subject
to the risks of being an EFI stockholder. EFI's business is much broader than
our business. As a result, EFI's results of operations and the price of its
common stock may be affected by factors that did not affect our operations and
the trading price of our common stock. You should carefully read the documents
incorporated by reference by EFI to understand EFI's business and many of the
risks it faces. See "Some Documents Are 'Incorporated By Reference'."

                  BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER AND RELATED MATTERS

BACKGROUND AND REASONS FOR THE MERGER

  Background of the Merger.

     On November 22, 2002, our board of directors met to discuss, among other
things, our outstanding indebtedness, including balloon payments which were due
in January 2004, and our available financing alternatives. Based on that review,
our board of directors determined that we needed to attempt to refinance or
restructure our indebtedness prior to maturity. In addition, our board of
directors determined that if we were unable to restructure our indebtedness, our
board of directors would consider the strategic alternatives available to us,
including a sale of the company.

     On January 22, 2003, Creo, the holder, at that time, of 30% of the
outstanding shares of our common stock, announced that it had entered into
definitive agreements to acquire, for $1.30 in cash or shares of Creo's common
stock at the election of each stockholder, shares of our common stock from two
of our stockholders. If those transactions were consummated, Creo's ownership
interest in Printcafe would increase from 30% to approximately 55%. At the same
time, Creo delivered a proposal to our board of directors to acquire all the
remaining shares of our common stock for consideration of $1.30 per share in
shares of Creo's common stock, but subject to both a minimum and maximum number
of shares that would be issued regardless of the trading price of Creo's common
stock. On that day, during a conference call with Creo, its legal counsel and
our legal counsel, Creo indicated that it viewed its proposed acquisition of us
to be strategic and informed us that it would not sell its shares to a third
party, even if the third party offered a higher price. Prior to Creo's public
announcement, our board of directors was unaware that Creo had been attempting
to gain control of Printcafe.

     Shortly after announcement of the offer from Creo, we received a proposal
from EFI to acquire all the outstanding shares of our common stock for $2.60 per
share for either cash or shares of EFI common stock, without a collar. A collar
is a minimum and maximum limit on the number of shares of stock that would be
issued and is determined based on the then trading value of the shares. Our
board of directors met on the evening of January 22, 2003. At that meeting, a
majority of the members of our board of directors requested that Amos Michelson,
the chairman of our board of directors who is also the chief executive officer
of Creo, resign from his position as chairman of our board of directors. Our
board of directors appointed Marc Olin, our president and chief executive
officer, as the new chairman of our board of directors. In addition, our board
of directors appointed a committee of directors who were unaffiliated with Creo
to consider the offers received from Creo and EFI, as well as any other
strategic alternatives available to us. The special committee consisted of
Charles Billerbeck, Victor Cohn and Thomas Gill. Mr. Billerbeck was appointed
chairman of the special committee.

     From January 23 through January 30, 2003, the special committee met on
several occasions to consider, among other things, retaining its own financial
and legal advisors. The special committee retained Thelen Reid & Priest LLP and
Potter Anderson & Corroon LLP as legal counsel. On January 31, 2003, the special
committee retained UBS Warburg as its financial advisor.

     From February 2 through February 12, 2003, at the direction of the special
committee, UBS Warburg conducted a market test by contacting other potential
bidders for Printcafe. To that end, UBS contacted approximately 30 potential
strategic and financial buyers for Printcafe; however, no additional offers
emerged as a result of that process.

     On January 30, 2003, Creo consummated the purchase of 1,532,052 shares of
our common stock pursuant to its agreement with one of our stockholders, thereby
increasing its ownership to 44.4% of our outstanding common stock. The second
agreement was scheduled to close on February 24, 2003 and the special committee
became increasingly concerned that Creo would assume control of Printcafe by
consummating that agreement. The special committee feared that if Creo assumed
voting control of Printcafe, Creo would prevent the independent directors from
pursuing the EFI proposal or any offer for Printcafe other than Creo's offer at
$1.30 per share in Creo stock. To protect our stockholders against

being coerced into accepting Creo's $1.30 offer and to avoid losing control of
the sale process, the special committee considered the adoption of a
stockholders' rights plan.

     In assessing whether to adopt the stockholders' rights plan, the special
committee was advised that the issuance of the rights under the rights plan
could be viewed as a technical default under our existing loan agreement with an
affiliate of Creo. Unwilling to put Printcafe at risk for a claim of default,
the special committee sought to find an alternative source of credit should
Creo, through its affiliate, claim a default as a result of the adoption of the
stockholders' rights plan.

     Since no additional competing proposal had emerged as a result of the UBS
Warburg market test, the special committee approached EFI and inquired as to
whether EFI would be willing to provide us with standby credit in the event of a
claim of default. EFI agreed to provide us with the necessary credit, in
exchange for our agreement to (a) enter into exclusive negotiations for a period
of time with EFI based on its $2.60 proposal; and (b) grant EFI an option to
acquire 2,126,574 shares of our common stock in return.

     On February 13, 2003, we announced our adoption of a stockholders' rights
plan. In addition, on the same day, we and EFI executed and delivered:

     - A stock option agreement providing EFI with the right to acquire
       2,126,574 shares of our common stock at a price per share of $2.60 per
       share.

     - a letter agreement providing for the extension of credit by EFI to us;
       and

     - a letter agreement setting forth the terms upon which we could pursue
       alternate proposals to EFI's proposed business combination.

     On February 14, 2003, counsel to EFI delivered a first draft of a merger
agreement and ancillary documents to counsel for the special committee. From
February 14, 2003 through February 26, 2003, we, EFI and the special committee,
together with each party's respective representatives, negotiated the terms of
the merger.

     On February 19, 2003, Creo commenced an action in The Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County captioned Creo, Inc. v.
Printcafe Software, Inc., Electronics For Imaging, Inc., Marc D. Olin, Charles
J. Billerbeck, Victor A. Cohn and Thomas J. Gill. Creo requested a temporary
restraining order that would preclude us from (a) triggering, exercising or
otherwise giving effect to the stockholders' rights plan we adopted, (b) taking
any action "with the intent or effect of impeding the operation of market forces
in an open bidding contest for Printcafe," (c) taking any steps or actions to
enforce the fee provided for in the letter agreement we entered into with EFI,
(d) taking any steps or any actions to enforce the option we granted to EFI, (e)
taking any steps or actions to enforce the no solicitation provisions of the
standby credit letter that we entered into with EFI, (f) engaging in any
"conduct intended to cause or having the effect of causing Printcafe to forgo
the opportunity to explore and enter into economically more favorable
transactions" and (g) entering into, or purporting to enter into, a merger
agreement between EFI and us before the court finally rules on the action. On
February 21, 2003 the court denied Creo's request for a temporary restraining
order.

     On February 21, 2003, the special committee received an offer from Creo to
acquire Printcafe in a transaction in which the consideration per share of our
common stock would be $3.00 in shares of Creo common stock "subject to an
appropriate collar." The offer from Creo did not specify the nature of the
collar. Creo issued a press release announcing its offer. The special committee
and its advisors met on the evening of February 21, 2003 to discuss this offer.
At that meeting, the special committee reviewed our rights and obligations under
the exclusivity agreement with EFI and determined, based on the advice of Potter
Anderson & Corroon LLP, its legal advisor and its financial advisor, that the
$3.00 offer from Creo was reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal and
to engage in further discussions with Creo.

     On February 21 and 22, 2003, UBS Warburg contacted representatives of Creo
to discuss the terms and conditions of Creo's offer, including the parameters of
the collar referred to in its offer letter, and to clarify the timing and
procedures for continued negotiations with the special committee. The special

committee met twice telephonically on February 22, 2003 to remain apprised of
the discussions with Creo and to consider the status of its negotiations with
EFI.

     On February 23, 2003, the special committee received a revised offer from
Creo to acquire Printcafe in a transaction in which the offered consideration
for each share of our common stock was $4.00 in shares of Creo common stock,
subject to a 20% collar. Creo did not issue a press release announcing this
offer. On that same day, the special committee and its advisors met several
times telephonically to discuss the revised offer from Creo and directed its
advisors to continue negotiations with Creo under the revised terms of its
offer. Potter Anderson, counsel for the special committee and Morgan, Lewis &
Bockius LLP, our counsel, engaged in discussions with counsel for Creo regarding
the terms of a proposed merger agreement.

     On February 24, 2003, EFI sent us a letter modifying the condition to EFI's
obligation to lend us funds for working capital purposes. That letter agreement
modified a condition to EFI's obligations in the original standby credit letter
agreement by extending the date by which we and EFI must have executed and
delivered a merger agreement from February 24, 2003 to March 1, 2003.

     On February 24, 2003, Creo informed the special committee that it was
withdrawing from the bidding process and terminating its offers. The special
committee met telephonically on the evening of February 24, 2003 to discuss the
withdrawal of Creo's offers and to consider the terms of EFI's proposed
transaction at $2.60 per share.

     On February 25, 2003, the special committee met to discuss the terms of the
proposed merger with EFI. Counsel reviewed the principal terms of the merger
agreement and UBS Warburg explained the methodologies it used to arrive at its
opinion as to the fairness of the transaction from a financial point of view.
After its presentation, UBS Warburg delivered its oral opinion, subsequently
confirmed in writing and based on and subject to the matters described in its
opinion, that the merger consideration was fair, from a financial point of view,
to our stockholders, other than EFI and its affiliates. Both counsel and UBS
Warburg answered questions from the special committee. After further
deliberations, the special committee then recommended that our board of
directors accept EFI's proposed transaction as set forth in the proposed merger
agreement. In addition, subject to approval of the merger agreement by our
board, the special committee recommended amendments to our stockholders' rights
plan which would prevent the distribution of the rights as a result of the
execution of the merger agreement with EFI.

     Immediately following the meeting of the special committee, our board of
directors met. All of the directors, including those directors who are employees
of Creo, participated in the meeting. Counsel for Printcafe and counsel for the
special committee reviewed the terms of the proposed merger agreement and UBS
Warburg reiterated its earlier presentation given to the special committee. Both
counsel and UBS Warburg answered questions from members of our board of
directors. After discussion, our board of directors adopted and approved the
proposed merger with EFI, whereby each of our stockholders would receive $2.60
in cash or, at their election, in EFI stock for each share of our stock that
they own, declared the merger agreement advisable and determined that the merger
agreement and the merger were fair to and in the best interest of Printcafe and
our stockholders. The two members of our board of directors employed by Creo,
Amos Michelson and Judi Hess, each abstained from the vote on the merger and the
merger agreement.

     Early in the morning of February 26, 2003, we, EFI and a subsidiary of EFI
executed and delivered the merger agreement. Before the Nasdaq National Market
opened on February 26, 2003, we and EFI issued a press release announcing the
proposed merger.

     Our Reasons for the Merger.  In reaching its decision, our board of
directors consulted with our senior management, legal counsel and financial
advisor, reviewed a significant amount of information, received the
recommendation of the special committee that the board approve the merger,
discussed the

recommended action with the special committee and considered a number of
factors, including, among others, the following factors:

          - The possible alternatives to the merger, including the possibility
            of continuing to operate Printcafe as a stand-alone entity and the
            risks associated with that alternative as well as Creo's prior
            attempt to purchase, in private transactions, a controlling interest
            in Printcafe at $1.30 per share in cash and its offer to exchange
            all remaining outstanding shares of our common stock for shares of
            Creo common stock valued at $1.30 per share, subject to a collar;

          - the $2.60 per share to be paid as the consideration in the merger
            represents a premium of 122.2% over the trailing average closing
            sales prices for our common stock as reported on Nasdaq for the
            three months ended February 25, 2003, a premium of 28.7% over the
            trailing average closing sales prices for our common stock as
            reported on Nasdaq for the one month ended February 25, 2003, a
            premium of 14% over the trailing average closing sales prices for
            our common stock as reported on Nasdaq for the one week ended
            February 25, 2003, and a premium of 8.3% over the closing sale price
            for our common stock as reported on Nasdaq on February 25, 2003, the
            trading day before the board's approval of the merger agreement;

          - the financial presentations made by UBS Warburg and the written
            opinion of UBS Warburg to the special committee and our board of
            directors to the effect that, as of February 25, 2003, and based on
            and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in the written
            opinion, the consideration to be received by holders of our common
            stock, other than EFI and its affiliates, pursuant to the merger
            agreement is fair from a financial point of view to those holders;

          - the ability of our stockholders to elect to receive shares of EFI
            common stock in the merger, thereby giving them the opportunity to
            continue as equity owners of the combined company after the merger;

          - the results of UBS Warburg's market check and the letter received
            from Creo on February 24, 2003 indicating that it was no longer
            interested in the bidding process and was terminating its prior
            offers and UBS Warburg's advice, based on those factors, as to the
            relatively low likelihood of completing an alternative transaction;

          - our then current and historical financial condition, including the
            timing of the repayment obligations on our existing indebtedness and
            the prospects for refinancing that indebtedness, our results of
            operations as a stand-alone company, our prospects and strategic
            objectives, the risks involved in achieving those prospects and
            objectives, conditions in our industry as a whole, and the current
            economic environment;

          - then current financial market conditions, and historical market
            prices, volatility and trading information with respect to our
            common stock;

          - other historical information concerning our business, prospects,
            financial performance and condition, operations, technology,
            management and competitive position;

          - the fact that pursuant to the merger agreement, we are not
            prohibited from responding (at any time prior to our stockholders'
            adoption of the merger agreement) in the manner provided in the
            merger agreement to takeover proposals that our board of directors
            determine in good faith constitute a superior offer, and, upon
            payment of a termination fee of $828,000 and compliance with the
            terms of the merger agreement, we may terminate the merger agreement
            to enter into an agreement for a superior transaction;

          - the terms of the merger agreement and related documents, including
            the parties' representations, warranties and covenants, and the
            conditions to their respective obligations;

          - the risks and contingencies related to the announcement and pendency
            of the merger, the possibility that the merger will not be
            consummated and the potential negative effect of public

         announcement of the merger in that event on our sales, operating
         results and stock price and our ability to retain key management and
         personnel; and

          - the conditions to EFI's obligation to complete the merger and the
            limited right of EFI to terminate the merger agreement.

     This list is not exhaustive but includes the material factors considered by
the special committee or our board of directors. Individual members of the
special committee or our board of directors may have considered other factors
not included in this list.

     In view of the variety of factors considered in connection with its
evaluation of the merger, neither the special committee nor our board of
directors quantified or assigned relative weights to the specific factors
considered in reaching their recommendations. Instead, the special committee and
our board of directors made their recommendations based on the totality of the
information presented to and considered by them.

     The special committee and our board of directors also took into
consideration potential risks associated with the merger and an investment in
shares of EFI's common stock, and concluded that the potential benefits of the
merger outweighed these factors. These factors include the risk that
circumstances may arise that provide EFI the right not to consummate the merger
and that an investment in EFI stock is likely to be affected by the markets in
which it competes. There can be no assurance that the shares of EFI stock you
receive in the merger, should you elect to receive stock, will not decline in
value. See "Risk Factors Relating to the Merger," beginning on page .

     EFI's Reasons for the Merger.  The merger is part of EFI's strategy of
expanding its software offerings for the professional printing market. With the
convergence of traditional and digital printing, the combination of EFI's
imaging and workflow solutions with Printcafe's enterprise management software
is intended to accelerate the adoption of digital printing management throughout
the process from procurement through production.

RECOMMENDATION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     After careful consideration, the special committee and our board of
directors, on February 26, 2003 (with Mr. Michelson and Ms. Hess, who are
employees of Creo, abstaining) determined that the terms of the merger agreement
and the merger were fair to, and in the best interest of, Printcafe and our
stockholders and approved the merger agreement and the merger. In reaching their
decisions, the special committee and our board of directors consulted with our
management team and advisors and independently considered the proposed merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The
committee unanimously recommended to our board of directors that it approve the
merger agreement and our board of directors (with Mr. Michelson and Ms. Hess
abstaining) has declared the merger agreement advisable and fair to Printcafe
and our stockholders and recommends that you vote to adopt the merger agreement.

     In considering the recommendation of the committee and our board of
directors with respect to the merger agreement, you should be aware that our
directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are
different from, or are in addition to, the interests of our other stockholders.

OPINION OF UBS WARBURG LLC

     Under the terms of an engagement letter, dated January 31, 2003, the
special committee retained UBS Warburg LLC to provide financial advisory
services and a financial fairness opinion to the special committee and to our
board of directors in connection with a possible business combination
transaction involving Printcafe. At the meeting of the special committee and the
subsequent meeting of our board of directors, in each case held on February 25,
2003, UBS Warburg delivered its oral opinion to the effect that, as of the date
of the opinion and based on and subject to the matters described in the opinion,
the consideration to be received by holders of our common stock, other than EFI
and its affiliates, in the

merger is fair from a financial point of view to such holders. The opinion was
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated February 25, 2003.

     The following summary of the UBS Warburg opinion is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. The full text of the
opinion sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered
and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken, by UBS Warburg and is
attached as Annex B to this document and incorporated in this document by
reference. You are encouraged to read carefully the UBS Warburg opinion in its
entirety.

     UBS Warburg's opinion:

     - Is directed solely to the special committee and the board of directors;

     - relates only to the fairness from a financial point of view of the
       consideration to be received by holders of our common stock, other than
       EFI and its affiliates, in the merger;

     - addresses the aggregate value to be received by holders of our common
       stock as a whole, without regard to the individual's size of holdings,
       and does not in any respect constitute an opinion on the particular
       situations of specific stockholders, including Creo and its affiliates
       and those stockholders distinguished by size of position or other
       factors;

     - does not address our underlying business decision to effect the merger;

     - does not constitute a recommendation to you about how to vote with
       respect to the merger agreement or any other matter; and

     - is necessarily based upon economic, monetary, market and other conditions
       as in effect on, and the information made available to UBS Warburg as of,
       the date of the opinion.

     In arriving at its opinion, UBS Warburg, among other things:

     - Reviewed selected publicly available business and historical financial
       information relating to Printcafe and EFI;

     - reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for our common stock
       and EFI's common stock;

     - reviewed selected internal financial information and other data relating
       to our business and financial prospects, including estimates and
       financial forecasts for fiscal 2003 prepared by our management, which
       were provided to UBS Warburg and not publicly available;

     - reviewed selected publicly available research analysts' estimates of
       EFI's future financial performance;

     - conducted discussions with members of our senior management;

     - reviewed publicly available financial and stock market data with respect
       to selected other companies in lines of business UBS Warburg believed to
       be generally comparable to those of Printcafe and EFI;

     - reviewed publicly available financial data with respect to selected other
       transactions involving companies in lines of business UBS Warburg
       believed to be generally comparable to those of Printcafe;

     - reviewed drafts of the merger agreement; and

     - conducted other financial studies, analyses and investigations and
       considered other information as UBS Warburg deemed necessary or
       appropriate.

     In connection with its review, with the consent of the special committee
and the board of directors or at the direction of the special committee and the
board of directors, as applicable, UBS Warburg:

     - Assumed that the final executed form of the merger agreement did not
       differ in any material respect from the draft that UBS Warburg examined,
       and that we, EFI and its subsidiary will comply with all material terms
       of the merger agreement;

     - assumed that the financial forecasts and estimates for fiscal 2003
       referred to above had been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the
       best currently available estimates and judgments of our management as to
       our future performance;

     - did not assume any responsibility for independent verification of any of
       the information referred to above and relied on it as being complete and
       accurate in all material respects; and

     - did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets
       or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Printcafe or EFI, nor was UBS
       Warburg furnished with an evaluation or appraisal.

     UBS Warburg was not asked to, and did not, recommend the specific
consideration payable in the merger, which was determined through negotiations
between EFI and the special committee. In addition, UBS Warburg was not asked
to, and did not offer any opinion as to the material terms of the merger
agreement or the form of the transactions contemplated thereby, and expressed no
opinion as to what the actual value of EFI common stock will be when issued
pursuant to the merger or the prices at which EFI common stock will trade in the
future. UBS Warburg also did not express any opinion as to whether holders of
significant numbers of shares of our common stock could sell such shares for
more consideration per share than the consideration being paid in the merger in
privately negotiated transactions.

     At the request of the special committee, UBS Warburg contacted third
parties to solicit indications of interest with respect to a possible business
combination with Printcafe and held discussions with a number of these parties
before the date of UBS Warburg's written opinion.

     The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytical process
involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods
of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular
circumstances and, therefore, is not susceptible to partial analysis or summary
descriptions. In arriving at its opinion, UBS Warburg made qualitative judgments
as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor considered by
it, and based on the results of all the analyses undertaken by it and assessed
as a whole. UBS Warburg did not draw conclusions, in isolation, from or with
regard to any one factor or method of analysis. Accordingly, UBS Warburg
believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting
portions of its analyses and the factors considered by it, without considering
all analyses and factors, could create an incomplete view of the processes
underlying the analyses set forth in its opinion.

     In performing its analyses, UBS Warburg made many assumptions with respect
to industry performance, general business, financial, market and economic
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond our or EFI's control. No
company, transaction or business used in those analyses as a comparison is
identical to Printcafe or EFI or their respective businesses or the merger, nor
is an evaluation of the results entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses
involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating
characteristics and other factors that could affect the operating results,
public trading or other values of the companies or transactions being analyzed.

     The estimates contained in the analyses performed by UBS Warburg and the
ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily
indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may
be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. In
addition, analyses relating to the value of securities do not purport to be
appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a business might actually be sold
or the prices at which any securities may trade at the present time or at any
time in the future.

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by UBS
Warburg in connection with the rendering of its opinion. The financial analyses
summarized below include information presented

in tabular format. In order to understand the financial analyses fully, the
tables must be read together with the text of each summary. Considering the data
set forth below without considering the full narrative description of the
financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the
analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial
analyses.

  PRINTCAFE ANALYSES

     Historical Stock Performance.  UBS Warburg reviewed historical trading
prices for our common stock. This stock price performance review indicated that,
for the period beginning June 19, 2002, the first trading day following our
initial public offering, through and including February 24, 2003, the low and
high closing prices for our common stock were $0.92 and $8.00, respectively.
This review further indicated that the closing price for our common stock was
$1.10 on January 20, 2003, which was prior to Creo's $1.30 per share offer being
made public. UBS Warburg referred to the $1.10 closing stock price on January
20, 2003 as the Unaffected Price. UBS Warburg also reviewed the average closing
prices over periods prior to February 24, 2003 as set forth in the following
table:

SELECTED STATISTICS(1)                                         CLOSING PRICE
- ----------------------                                         -------------

February 24, 2003...........................................       $3.24
5 Day Average...............................................       $2.56
10 Day Average..............................................       $2.39
20 Day Average..............................................       $2.29
60 Day Average..............................................       $1.56
90 Day Average..............................................       $1.47
180 Day Average.............................................       $2.34

     Selected Comparable Public Company Analysis.  UBS Warburg compared selected
financial information, ratios and public market multiples for Printcafe to the
corresponding data for the following six publicly-traded companies:

     - i2 Technologies, Inc.

     - Retek Inc.

     - Manugistics Group, Inc.

     - Descartes Systems Group, Inc.

     - Aspen Technology, Inc.

     - QRS Corporation

     UBS Warburg chose the selected companies because they were publicly-traded
companies that, for purposes of the analysis, UBS Warburg considered reasonably
similar to Printcafe in that these companies are relatively smaller, independent
companies that operate in the computer software industry selling supply chain
management products. The selected public companies may significantly differ from
Printcafe based on, among other things, the size of the companies, the
geographic coverage of the companies' operations and the particular business
segments in which the companies focus.

     UBS Warburg reviewed, among other information, the comparable companies'
multiples of enterprise value, which consists of the market value of the
particular company's common equity plus the market value (when available) of the
company's total debt, preferred stock and minority interests, minus cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities to:

     - Estimated calendar 2002 revenue, referred to as CY 2002E revenue, and

     - estimated calendar 2003 revenue, referred to as CY 2003E revenue.

     The Printcafe comparable companies analysis resulted in the following
ranges of implied multiples as of February 21, 2003:

     Selected Comparable Transaction Analysis.  UBS Warburg reviewed publicly
available financial information relating to the following selected transactions
in the software industry since January 2002:

ACQUIROR                                                              TARGET

SunGard Data Systems, Inc.                                  Caminus Corporation
SSA Global Technologies, Inc.                               Infinium Software Inc.
Novell, Inc.                                                SilverStream Software, Inc.
MSC Software Corp.                                          Mechanical Dynamics, Inc.
TIBCO Software Inc.                                         Talarian Corporation

     UBS Warburg chose the selected transactions because they were business
combinations that, for the purposes of the analysis, UBS Warburg considered to
be reasonably similar to the merger in that these transactions involved
companies in the computer software industry. The selected transactions may
differ significantly from the merger based on, among other things, the size of
the transactions, the structure of the transactions and the dates that the
transactions were announced and consummated.

     UBS Warburg reviewed, among other things, the enterprise values, which
consist of the market value of the particular company's common equity plus the
market value (when available) of the company's total debt, preferred stock and
minority interests, minus cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities,
implied in the relevant transactions as a multiple of the company's last twelve
months revenue, and the company's estimated next twelve months revenue.

     The analysis indicated the following implied multiples for the selected
transactions and for the merger:

                                  AT ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE TRANSACTION    AT CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION    PRINTCAFE IMPLIED

     All multiples for Printcafe and the selected transactions were based on
relevant SEC filings, press releases and publicly available research analysts'
estimates.

     Premiums Paid Analysis.  UBS Warburg reviewed selected purchase price per
share premiums paid or to be paid in acquisitions of publicly-traded, domestic
software companies, excluding "merger of equals" transactions, announced from
January 1, 2002 through the end of January 2003, with deal sizes in excess of
$25 million. This analysis indicated mean and median and high and low premiums
to the targets' closing stock prices on dates, and the targets' average closing
stock prices for periods, prior to the announcement of the applicable
transaction as set forth in the following table. The premiums for Printcafe were
calculated based on our closing stock prices on dates, and our average closing
stock prices for

periods, prior to January 21, 2003, the day before Creo's $1.30 per share offer
was made public, and February 24, 2003.

                                                                                         PREMIUM (%) TO AVERAGE STOCK

  EFI ANALYSIS

     Selected Comparable Public Company Analysis.  UBS Warburg compared selected
financial information, ratios and public market multiples for EFI to the
corresponding data for the following eight publicly-traded companies:

     - Eastman Kodak Company

     - Lexmark International, Inc.

     - Pitney Bowes Inc.

     - Adobe Systems Incorporated

     - Xerox Corporation

     - IKON Office Solutions, Inc.

     - Creo Inc.

     - Oak Technology, Inc.

     UBS Warburg chose the selected companies because they were publicly-traded
companies that, for purposes of the analysis, UBS Warburg considered reasonably
similar to EFI in that these companies operate in the document management
industry. The selected public companies may differ significantly from EFI based
on, among other things, the size of the companies, the geographic coverage of
the companies' operations and the particular business segments in which the
companies focus.

     UBS Warburg reviewed, among other information, the comparable companies'
multiples of enterprise value, which consists of the market value of the
particular company's common equity plus the market value (when available) of the
company's total debt, preferred stock and minority interest, minus cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities, to:

     - CY 2002E revenue;

     - CY 2003E revenue;

     - estimated calendar year 2002 earnings before interest, taxes,
       depreciation and amortization, referred to as CY 2002E EBITDA; and

     - estimated calendar year 2003 earnings before interest, taxes,
       depreciation and amortization, referred to as CY 2003E EBITDA.

     UBS Warburg also reviewed, among other information, the comparable
companies' projected price/earnings multiples, based on SEC filings and publicly
available research analysts' estimates, for calendar year 2002 and 2003.

     The EFI comparable companies analysis resulted in the following ranges of
implied multiples as of February 24, 2003:

                                                 MULTIPLE RANGE   MEAN    MEDIAN   EFI(1)

- ---------------

(1) Based on EFI's closing stock price on February 24, 2003.

     Estimated data for EFI and the selected companies were based on the
respective companies' relevant SEC filings as well as publicly available
research analysts' estimates.

     Other Factors.  In rendering its opinion, UBS Warburg considered other
factors, for informational purposes, including:

     - Selected published analysts' reports on Printcafe and EFI;

     - recent stock price/volume performance for Printcafe and EFI; and

     - potential pro forma financial effects of the merger on EFI's estimated
       2003 earning per share, based on publicly available research analysts'
       estimates for EFI and internal estimates of our management for Printcafe.

     Fee Arrangement.  Pursuant to the engagement letter, dated January 31,
2003, among UBS Warburg, Printcafe and the special committee, UBS Warburg earned
a fee of $500,000 by Printcafe for rendering its financial fairness opinion,
which was independent of the result of the opinion, and will receive a fee equal
to an additional $500,000 upon the consummation of the merger. We also agreed to
reimburse UBS Warburg for its expenses incurred in performing its services. UBS
Warburg will not be entitled to any additional fees or compensation with respect
to the merger. In addition, we agreed to indemnify UBS Warburg and its
affiliates, their respective directors, officers, agents and employees and each
person, if any, controlling UBS Warburg or any of its affiliates against
liabilities and expenses related to or arising out of UBS Warburg's engagement
and any related transactions.

     The special committee selected UBS Warburg based on its experience,
expertise and reputation. UBS Warburg is an internationally recognized
investment banking firm that regularly engages in the valuation of securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive
bids, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private
placements and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. Prior to
this engagement, UBS Warburg and its predecessors have provided us with
investment banking and other financial services, including acting as lead
manager for our initial public offering in June 2002, and received customary
compensation for rendering those services. In the ordinary course of business,
UBS Warburg, its successors and affiliates may trade or have traded securities
of Printcafe, EFI and/or Creo for their own accounts and, accordingly, may at
any time hold a long or short position in those securities.

                                   THE MERGER

UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

     This discussion is based on currently existing provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code, existing and proposed United States Treasury Regulations
thereunder and current administrative rulings and court decisions, all of which
are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Any change could alter
the tax consequences to you as described in this document.

     You should be aware that this discussion does not deal with all federal
income tax considerations that may be relevant to particular stockholders in
light of their particular circumstances, like stockholders who:

     - Are financial institutions, dealers in securities, tax-exempt
       organizations or insurance companies;

     - are foreign persons;

     - do not hold their shares of our common stock as a capital asset;

     - acquired their shares in connection with stock option or stock purchase
       plans or in other compensatory transactions; or

     - acquired their shares as part of an integrated investment, such as a
       hedge, straddle or other risk-reduction transaction.

     In addition, the following discussion does not address the tax consequences
of the merger under foreign, state or local tax laws, the tax consequences of
transactions effectuated prior or subsequent to, or concurrently with, the
merger, whether or not the referenced transactions are undertaken in connection
with the merger, including any transaction in which shares of our common stock
are acquired or shares of EFI common stock are disposed of, or the tax
consequences of the exercise, cancellation or termination of our stock options.
Accordingly, you are urged to consult your own tax advisors as to the specific
tax consequences to you of the merger, including the applicable federal, state,
local and foreign tax consequences.

     The merger will be a fully taxable transaction to our stockholders and will
not constitute a "reorganization" for tax purposes.

     - You will recognize taxable gain or loss upon the merger equal to the
       difference, if any, between (a) the cash or the fair market value of the
       shares of EFI common stock received as merger consideration and (b) your
       adjusted tax basis in our common stock.

     - This taxable gain or loss should be capital gain or loss if you hold your
       shares of our common stock as a capital asset at the effective time of
       the merger and will be classified as long term capital gain or loss to
       the extent you have held those shares for more than one year.

     In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments made
in connection with the merger. Backup withholding at a rate of 30% will apply to
payments you receive in respect of our common stock if you fail to provide an
accurate taxpayer identification number or you are notified by the IRS that you
have failed to report all interest and dividends required to be shown on your
United States federal income tax returns. You should consult your tax advisor
concerning the application of information reporting and backup withholding
requirements to your particular circumstances.

     Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as
a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability if
the required information is furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.

ANTICIPATED ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141,
Business Combinations, EFI will use the purchase method of accounting for a
business combination to account for the merger, as well

as the accounting and reporting regulations for goodwill and other intangibles.
Under this method of accounting:

     - Our assets and liabilities, including all intangible assets, will be
       recorded at their respective fair market values;

     - all intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated useful lives
       with the exception of goodwill and any other intangibles with indefinite
       lives;

     - goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized;
       rather, they will be assessed for impairment on a periodic basis in the
       future; and

     - our financial position, results of operations and cash flows will be
       included in EFI's financial statements prospectively as of the completion
       of the merger.

DISSENTERS' APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Under Delaware law, you are entitled to dissenters' appraisal rights in
connection with the merger. Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
will govern the exercise of those appraisal rights. The full text of Section 262
is attached as Annex C to this document for your review. The following summary
of the provisions of Section 262 is not intended to be a complete statement of
its provisions and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of
Annex C, which is incorporated by reference.

     If you:

     - File written notice with our corporate secretary of an intention to
       exercise rights to appraisal of shares prior to the special meeting;

     - do not make an election or surrender your certificates;

     - do not vote in favor of the merger; and

     - follow the procedures set forth in Section 262

you will be entitled to be paid the fair value of the shares of our common stock
as to which appraisal rights have been perfected. The fair value of shares of
our common stock will be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, exclusive
of any element of value arising from the merger. The shares of our common stock
with respect to which holders have perfected their appraisal rights in
accordance with Section 262 and have not effectively withdrawn or lost their
appraisal rights are referred to in this document as the "dissenting shares."

     Appraisal rights are available only to the record holder of shares. If you
wish to exercise appraisal rights but have a beneficial interest in shares which
are held of record by or in the name of another person, such as a broker or
nominee, you should act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the
procedures set forth in Section 262 to perfect your appraisal rights.

     A demand for appraisal should be signed by or on behalf of the stockholder
exactly as the stockholder's name appears on the stockholder's stock
certificates. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity such as
by a trustee, guardian or custodian, the demand should be executed in that
capacity, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a
joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on
behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including one or more joint
owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a record holder;
however, in the demand the agent must identify the record owner or owners and
expressly disclose that the agent is executing the demand as an agent or the
record owner or owners. A record holder such as a broker who holds shares as
nominee for several beneficial owners may exercise appraisal rights with respect
to the shares held for one or more beneficial owners and not exercise rights
with respect to the shares held for other beneficial owners. In that case, the
written demand should state the number of shares for which appraisal rights are
being demanded. When no number of shares is stated, the demand will be presumed
to cover all shares held of record by the broker or nominee.

     If you demand appraisal of your shares under Section 262 and you fail to
perfect, or effectively withdraw or lose, your right to appraisal, your shares
will be converted into a right to receive the merger consideration in accordance
with the terms of the merger agreement if the merger is completed. Dissenting
shares lose their status as dissenting shares if:

     - The merger is abandoned;

     - the dissenting stockholder fails to make a timely written demand for
       appraisal;

     - the dissenting shares are voted in favor of adoption of the merger
       agreement;

     - neither we nor the dissenting stockholder files a complaint or intervenes
       in a pending action within 120 days after the effective date of the
       merger; or

     - the dissenting stockholder delivers to us within 60 days of the effective
       date of the merger, or thereafter with our approval, a written withdrawal
       of the stockholder's demand for appraisal of the dissenting shares,
       although no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery may be
       dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the court.

     Within 10 days after the effective date of the merger, we must mail a
notice to all stockholders who have complied with the procedures described
above, notifying stockholders of the effective date of the merger, but that
notice will not set forth the deadline for taking action to perfect your right
to appraisal. Within 120 days after the effective date, holders of our common
stock may file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery for the appraisal of
their shares, although they may, within 60 days of the effective date, withdraw
their demand for appraisal. Within 120 days of the effective date, the holders
of dissenting shares may also, upon written request, receive from us a statement
setting forth the aggregate number of shares with respect to which demands for
appraisals have been received.

     Failure to follow the steps required by Section 262 for perfecting
appraisal rights may result in the loss of your appraisal rights, in which event
you will be entitled to receive the merger consideration with respect to the
dissenting shares in accordance with the merger agreement. In view of the
complexity of the provisions of Section 262, you should consult your own legal
advisor.

RESALE OF EFI COMMON STOCK ISSUED IN THE MERGER

     Shares of EFI common stock issued to our stockholders in connection with
the merger are freely transferable, except for shares issued to any person who,
at the time of the special meeting, is one of our "affiliates," as that term is
defined under the Securities Act. In general, our affiliates include:

     - Our executive officers;

     - our board of directors; and

     - other persons or entities that control, are controlled by or are under
       common control with Printcafe.

     The rules adopted under the Securities Act impose restrictions upon the
resale of securities received by affiliates in connection with
reclassifications, mergers, consolidations or asset transfers. EFI common stock
received by our affiliates in the merger will be subject to these resale
limitations, and we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to
deliver to EFI agreements signed by all of our affiliates regarding those resale
limitations.

RELATED AGREEMENTS

     The Stockholders Agreements.  EFI entered into stockholders agreements with
each of Marc Olin, our chairman and chief executive officer, Joseph Whang, our
chief financial officer and chief operating officer, Ronald Hyland, our senior
vice president and chief technical officer, and Mellon Ventures II, L.P. These
four stockholders owned          shares of our common stock on the record date,
or approximately      % of our then outstanding shares.

     Each stockholder that signed a stockholder agreement is obligated to vote
the shares of our common stock that he or it beneficially owns:

     - In favor of (1) the adoption of the merger agreement, (2) the approval of
       the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and (3) approval of
       the merger;

     - in favor of waiving any notice that may be required in connection with
       any reorganization of Printcafe, any reclassification or recapitalization
       of our capital stock, any sale of assets, change of control or
       acquisition of Printcafe by person, or any merger, consolidation or
       business combination of Printcafe with or into any person to the extent
       the transaction is undertaken in connection with the merger;

     - in favor of any matter that could reasonably be expected to facilitate
       the merger;

     - against approval of any takeover proposal made in opposition to, or in
       competition with the merger;

     - against any of the following actions: (1) any merger, consolidation,
       business combination, sale of assets, reorganization or recapitalization
       of Printcafe with any person or entity other than EFI, (2) any sale,
       lease or transfer of any material part of our assets, (3) any
       reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or winding up
       of Printcafe, (4) any change in our capitalization or its corporate
       structure or (5) any other action that is intended, or could reasonably
       be expected, to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or
       adversely affect the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
       by the merger agreement.

     The stockholders that signed stockholders agreements each granted EFI an
irrevocable proxy limited to voting on the foregoing matters.

     The stockholders agreements also apply to shares of our common stock
acquired by each stockholder that is a party to those agreements between
February 26, 2003 and the termination of that stockholder's stockholders
agreement. Each stockholders agreement will terminate on the first to occur of
(a) the completion of the merger, (b) the termination of the merger agreement in
accordance with its terms, (c) a date that the stockholder and EFI mutually
agree in writing to terminate the stockholder agreement or (d) June 30, 2003.

     The stockholders agreements restrict the disposition of the shares of our
common stock beneficially owned by the stockholders that signed stockholders
agreements. The stockholders agreements do not restrict the fulfillment by our
directors and officers of their duties in those capacities.

     The Stock Option.  On February 13, 2003, we entered into a stock option
agreement with EFI. The stock option agreement grants EFI the right, but EFI is
not obligated, to purchase up to 2,126,574 shares of our common stock at a
purchase price equal to $2.60 per share. If EFI is not in breach of its
obligations under the standby credit agreement described below, EFI may exercise
the option at any time, in whole or in part, subject to our right to suspend
EFI's ability to exercise the option for seven days if we have notified EFI that
we intend to enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal. The
option will terminate on December 31, 2007.

     We must purchase any option shares, at the request of EFI, at a price equal
to the aggregate purchase price paid for the shares by EFI, if:

     - There is an event of a default under the standby credit agreement;

     - any person (other than EFI, any subsidiary of EFI or Creo) acquires
       beneficial ownership of, or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of,
       or any group shall have been formed that beneficially owns or has the
       right to acquire beneficial ownership of, 50% or more of the then
       outstanding shares of our common stock; or

     - we enter into an agreement to: (1) consolidate with or merge into any
       person, other than EFI or one of its subsidiaries, where we are not the
       continuing or surviving corporation of the consolidation or merger, (2)
       consolidate or merge with any person, other than EFI or one of its
       subsidiaries,

       where the other person is merged into Printcafe and Printcafe is the
       continuing or surviving corporation, but, in connection with the merger,
       the then outstanding shares of our common stock are changed into or
       exchanged for stock or other securities of Printcafe or any other person
       or cash or any other property or (3) sell or otherwise transfer all or
       substantially all of our assets to any person, other than EFI or one of
       its subsidiaries.

     All of the foregoing events are collectively referred to as "repurchase
events." Additionally, we have the right to purchase the option shares and
terminate the option following a repurchase event.

     In the option agreement, we granted EFI registration rights, which are
subordinate to existing registration rights that we have granted.

     The Standby Credit.  On February 13, 2003, we and EFI entered into a letter
agreement which would allow us to borrow money from EFI. EFI is obligated under
the standby credit agreement to disburse to us up to $11.0 million within three
business days after receiving notice from us that Iris Graphics, Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary of Creo, declared any amounts owed under our existing credit
facility with Iris due and payable as a result of any action we took in
furtherance of the proposed business combination with EFI.

     We are obligated to pay EFI interest at the simple rate of 8% per annum on
any loans made by EFI to us in connection with Iris accelerating the maturity of
our loan because of action we took in furtherance of the business combination
with EFI. All loans made under the standby credit agreement mature on January 2,
2004.

     EFI also provided us with a working capital facility in an aggregate amount
of $3.0 million. Funds will be disbursed to us if the merger agreement has not
been terminated in accordance with its terms, and our cash balance as of the
close of business on the date we give EFI notice of our proposed borrowing is
less than $1.0 million. Within three business days of receiving our notice of a
valid request for a working capital disbursement, EFI must disburse $1.0 million
to us. Before our special meeting, any working capital disbursement will be
subject to our obligation to have managed our cash position in accordance with
its past practices. Any loans made under the working capital facility bear
interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate of interest as published,
from time to time, by Citibank, plus two percent. Principal and interest are
payable on January 2, 2004 or sooner upon the termination of the standby credit
agreement in accordance with its terms.

     An event of default under the standby credit agreement will occur if a
business combination with EFI is not consummated on or before June 30, 2003
unless the failure to consummate a business combination with EFI resulted from
EFI's material breach of its obligations under the merger agreement. The
occurrence of an event of default under the standby letter agreement would
accelerate the maturity of all amounts due and if those amounts were unpaid,
would give EFI the right to exercise its remedies at law, including foreclosing
on any collateral that may secure its loans.

     The standby credit agreement also provides that we must use any proceeds we
receive from the exercise of the stock option we granted to EFI to pay down
outstanding amounts under the standby facility and the working capital facility.

     On March 13, 2003, EFI amended the credit agreement to also give us the
right to borrow funds under the standby credit agreement if Creo's subsidiary
declares a technical default under its credit facility.

     There are no amounts outstanding under the credit facility as of the date
of this document.

STOCK PURCHASE PROGRAM

     Following completion of the merger, EFI intends to purchase approximately
the same number of shares of its common stock as are issued in connection with
the merger. These purchases may be effected through open market purchases,
negotiated transactions, block trades or otherwise. EFI currently has no

arrangements or understandings with any person with respect to those
transactions. EFI may decide not to pursue or delay the stock purchase program,
in whole or in part, without notice.

INTERESTS OF OUR DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE MERGER

     In considering the recommendation of our board of directors that you vote
for the adoption of the merger agreement, you should be aware that members of
our board of directors and our executive officers have agreements or
arrangements that provide them with interests in the merger that may differ
from, or be in addition to, the interests of our other stockholders. Our board
of directors was aware of these agreements and arrangements during its
deliberations of the merits of the merger and in determining to recommend that
you vote to adopt the merger agreement.

     Retention Bonus Agreements.  In February 2003, the compensation committee
of our board of directors approved retention bonus agreements with some of our
officers and executive officers. These agreements provide for the payment of a
retention bonus upon the completion of a transaction that results in a change of
control. If the merger is completed, Marc Olin, our chairman, chief executive
officer and president, will receive a retention bonus of $200,000 and Joseph
Whang, our chief financial officer and chief operating officer, will receive a
retention bonus of $150,000.

     Accelerated Vesting of Stock Options.  Some of our executive officers have
provisions in their employment agreements that accelerate the vesting of their
stock options upon a change of control. In January 2002, we granted options to
purchase 170,340 shares of our common stock to Mr. Olin, 137,975 shares of our
common stock to Mr. Whang and 45,991 shares of our common stock to Ronald
Hyland, our senior vice president and chief technology officer, each with an
exercise price of $4.21 per share. These options generally vest ratably over a
48-month period. If the merger is completed, the vesting of these options will
accelerate by six months.

     Indemnification and Insurance.  The merger agreement provides that, upon
completion of the merger, EFI will indemnify and hold harmless, and provide
advancement of expenses to, all of our past and present directors, officers and
employees in all of their capacities, for acts or omissions occurring at or
before the completion of the merger to the same extent they were indemnified or
had the right to advancement of expenses as of February 26, 2003, which is the
date of the merger agreement, pursuant to our certificate of incorporation,
bylaws and indemnification agreements with any of our, or our subsidiaries',
directors, officers and employees. The merger agreement also provides that, upon
completion of the merger, EFI will provide director and officer liability
insurance policies with the current coverage of our policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance to be effective for six years following the
completion of the merger or until the premium cost exceeds $1.2 million,
whichever occurs earlier.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The following discussion describes the merger agreement. This summary may
not contain all of the information that is important to you. You are urged to
carefully read the entire merger agreement, which is an exhibit to the
registration statement to which this document relates and is incorporated by
reference into this document.

GENERAL

     The Merger.  Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, a
wholly owned subsidiary of EFI will merge with and into Printcafe. After the
merger, we will continue as the surviving corporation. EFI's subsidiary will no
longer be a separate corporation and we will, as a result of the merger, become
a wholly-owned subsidiary of EFI.

     Effective Time.  We, EFI and its subsidiary will complete the merger by
filing a certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State. The
certificate of merger will be filed upon the closing of the merger, which is
scheduled to occur on the first business day practicable after the satisfaction
or waiver of the various conditions to the merger which are set forth in the
merger agreement and described below. The effective time of the merger will be
the date and time the certificate of merger is filed with the Delaware Secretary
of State, or a later time as specified in the certificate of merger.

EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK, OPTIONS, WARRANTS AND PURCHASE RIGHTS

     Merger Consideration.  In connection with the merger, you have the right to
elect, with respect to each share of our common stock that you own, whether to
receive:

     - $2.60 in cash, without interest and net of any required tax withholding;
       or

     - a number of shares of EFI common stock equal to $2.60 divided by the
       average closing price of EFI's common stock for the ten consecutive
       trading days ending on and including the fifth trading day before the
       date of our special meeting of stockholders.

     In order to make an election, you must comply with the procedures described
under "-- Exchange of Certificates in the Merger." If you do not make an
election, you will receive $2.60 in cash, without interest and net of any
required tax withholding, for each share of our common stock that you own.

     If EFI issues any stock dividends, recapitalizes, engages in a stock split
or a similar transaction which affects the outstanding shares of EFI common
stock between the date of the merger agreement and the effective time of the
merger, the number of shares of EFI common stock to be issued in exchange for
our common stock will be adjusted appropriately.

     No interest is payable on any merger consideration, whether in the form of
EFI common stock or cash.

     After the merger is effective, our common stock will automatically cease to
exist and, unless you have properly perfected your appraisal rights, you will
only have the right to receive the merger consideration, consisting of EFI
common stock or cash, as described above and in the merger agreement.

     Outstanding Stock Options.  Each outstanding option to purchase shares of
our common stock will be converted into an option to purchase shares of EFI
common stock. The number of shares subject to, and the exercise price of, each
converted option will be adjusted on the basis of the exchange ratio applicable
to the shares of our common stock exchanged for shares of EFI common stock in
the merger.

     Outstanding Warrants.  Each outstanding warrant to purchase shares of our
common stock will be converted into the right to receive, upon exercise of the
warrant, $2.60 in cash for each underlying share of our common stock, unless the
warrant expressly provides that stock consideration must be issued.

     Outstanding Purchase Rights.  We have an employee stock purchase plan under
which some of our employees have the right to purchase shares of our common
stock. All of the purchase rights that are

outstanding prior to the merger will have been exercised in accordance with the
provisions of that plan immediately prior to the merger. The shares of our
common stock which are purchased by employees under our employee stock purchase
plan will be exchanged in the merger on the same terms as all other shares of
our common stock.

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES IN THE MERGER

     Exchange Agent and Exchange Fund.  EFI has designated American Stock
Transfer & Trust Company to serve as its exchange agent in connection with the
merger. On or before the closing date of the merger, EFI will deposit with the
exchange agent (a) certificates representing all of the shares of EFI common
stock to be issued in exchange for our common stock pursuant to the merger,
together with cash representing amounts payable in lieu of issuing fractional
shares of EFI common stock for our stockholders that elect to receive the merger
consideration and stock, and (b) funds representing the aggregate merger
consideration for our stockholders that elect to receive the merger
consideration in cash or do not make an effective election before the date of
our special meeting of stockholders.

     Election Procedures.  We are mailing an election form to you with this
document. If you wish to receive cash consideration for all of your shares of
our common stock, you do not need to return the election form. Copies of the
election form are available from MacKenzie Partners.

     If you wish to receive stock consideration for some or all of your shares
of our common stock, you must:

     - Return your properly completed election form so that it is received not
       later than the close of business on the day before our special meeting of
       stockholders; and

     - return your stock certificates representing your shares of our common
       stock or a guarantee of delivery of your shares with your properly
       completed election form.

     A guarantee of delivery is a document signed by a broker-dealer, bank or
trust company promising to EFI that it will deliver, to EFI's exchange agent,
within three trading days, certificates representing the number of shares for
which you are making an election. If the broker-dealer, bank or trust company
does not deliver certificates representing a sufficient number of shares to
EFI's exchange agent within three trading days, then your election will be
invalid. Copies of the guarantee of delivery are available from MacKenzie
Partners.

     You may change your election, at any time before the close of business on
the day before our special meeting of stockholders, by submitting a later dated
properly completed election form. You may also revoke your election by
submitting a written revocation to EFI's exchange agent before the close of
business on the day before the special meeting of our stockholders. All
determinations with respect to the validity of elections will be made by EFI and
EFI will have no liability to any of our stockholders for determinations made in
good faith.

     Exchange Procedures.  As soon as reasonably practicable after the
completion of the merger, EFI's exchange agent will mail to each stockholder of
record of our common stock that did not make a valid election a letter of
transmittal containing instructions for the surrender of certificates
representing our common stock in exchange for cash merger consideration.

     No Fractional Shares.  If you elect to receive any portion of your merger
consideration in shares of EFI common stock, no fractional shares will be
issued. Instead of issuing fractional shares of EFI common stock, the exchange
agent will pay cash, without interest, payable by check, in lieu of any
fractional share, based on the average closing sales price of EFI's common stock
on the Nasdaq National Market for the 10 trading day period ending on the fifth
trading day prior to the special meeting of our stockholders.

     Dividends and Distributions.  If you elect to receive your merger
consideration in shares of EFI common stock, no dividends or other distributions
that are made after the effective time of the merger with respect to shares of
EFI common stock will be paid to any holder of a certificate representing shares
of our common stock until that certificate is surrendered for cancellation.
However, if you elect to receive

your merger consideration in shares of EFI common stock, you will be paid,
without interest, upon surrender of your certificate, any dividends or
distributions with a record date after the effective time of the merger but a
payment date between the effective time of the merger and the time of surrender.

     No Further Ownership Rights.  No transfers or registrations of shares of
our common stock will be made after the effective time of the merger. If, after
the effective time of the merger, certificates representing shares of our common
stock are presented to us or our transfer agent for any reason, those
certificates will be cancelled and exchanged for the merger consideration as
provided in the merger agreement.

     Termination of Exchange Fund.  If, six months following the effective time
of the merger, you have not surrendered your certificates representing shares of
our common stock to the exchange agent, you may thereafter look only to EFI to
receive the merger consideration. None of EFI, Printcafe or the exchange agent
will have any liability to any holder of a certificate formerly representing
shares of our common stock, for the merger consideration, for cash in lieu of
fractional shares, or for any unpaid dividends or distributions which are
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property or
similar law.

RESTRICTIONS ON OUR SOLICITATION OF TAKEOVER PROPOSALS

     We agreed that we will not, among other things, solicit any takeover
proposal, participate in any discussions or negotiate regarding any takeover
proposal, or enter into any merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option or
similar agreement with a third party. Our board of directors is not precluded
from participating in discussions or negotiations with a suitor regarding a
proposal if the value offered per share of our common stock is greater than
$2.60 and if our board of directors, or the special committee, determines that
the failure to participate in discussions or negotiations with the suitor would
likely result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to our stockholders under
applicable law.

     Our board of directors agreed not to:

     - Withdraw, modify or supplement its recommendation of the merger agreement
       in a manner adverse to EFI;

     - approve or recommend a takeover proposal from a party other than EFI; or

     - approve or recommend any acquisition agreement; but

     on the fifth business day after we have notified EFI that our board of
directors is prepared to recommend a superior proposal, we may terminate the
merger agreement and we may enter into an acquisition agreement for a superior
proposal. A superior proposal includes any proposal made by a third party to
acquire Printcafe for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities that
our board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with a
financial advisor of national reputation, to be superior, from a financial point
of view, to the merger and for which financing, to the extent required, is then
committed or which, in the good faith judgment of our board of directors, is
reasonably capable of being obtained by the third party.

     We agreed to keep EFI informed of any takeover proposals we receive and any
developments with respect to those proposals. Our board retained the right to
make any disclosures that, in its good faith

judgment, after consultation with outside counsel, the failure to so disclose
would constitute a breach of its obligations under applicable law.

COVENANTS

     We and EFI made a number of agreements with each other in the merger
agreement, including:

     - We agreed to conduct our business in the ordinary course consistent with
       past practices and to use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve
       intact our business to the end that our goodwill and ongoing business
       will not be impaired in any material respect as of the completion of the
       merger;

     - we and EFI agreed to provide notice to the other party if we or EFI have
       knowledge of any breach of any representation or warranty in the merger
       agreement, any failure to comply in a material respect with obligations
       under the agreement or any change or event that causes, or is reasonably
       likely to cause, the conditions to the closing of the merger not to be
       satisfied;

     - we and EFI agreed to cooperate in the preparation of this document and
       the registration statement to which it relates;

     - we agreed to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold our special
       meeting of stockholders and except as described under "Restrictions on
       Our Solicitation of Takeover Proposals," to have our board of directors
       recommend that you vote to adopt the merger agreement;

     - we agreed to have our independent auditors prepare "comfort letters" for
       EFI;

     - we agreed to provide EFI with access to our facilities, employees and
       agents and to give EFI copies of reports and other information that it
       may reasonably request from us;

     - we and EFI each agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete
       the merger, but EFI will not be required to divest or hold separate any
       of its assets in order to complete the merger;

     - EFI agreed to give our employees credit for service with us, and our
       predecessor companies, and to treat our employees the same as similarly
       situated EFI employees when our employees become eligible to receive
       benefits under EFI's employee benefit plans;

     - EFI agreed to honor our existing director and officer indemnification
       obligations for a period of six years following the completion of the
       merger and to expend up to $1.2 million to provide insurance covering our
       directors and officers;

     - we and EFI agreed to consult with each other concerning any public
       announcements with respect to the merger;

     - we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to have our affiliates
       sign agreements with EFI acknowledging their obligations under the
       Securities Act and we agreed to place an appropriate legend on the shares
       of our common stock that are subject to the restrictions in the
       stockholders agreements;

     - EFI agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to have the shares of
       its common stock issuable in connection with the merger listed on the
       Nasdaq National Market;

     - we agreed to provide EFI with the opportunity to participate in any
       litigation related to the merger agreement or the transactions
       contemplated by the merger agreement; and

     - EFI agreed to vote all shares of our common stock that it owns as of the
       record date for the special meeting of our stockholders in favor of
       adoption of the merger agreement and to cause its subsidiary that will
       effect the merger to comply with its obligations under the merger
       agreement.

CONDITIONS TO COMPLETION OF THE MERGER

     The merger will be completed only if the conditions set forth in the merger
agreement are satisfied or waived at or before the closing. These conditions
include the following:

     - The approval of the merger agreement by our stockholders;

     - no legal restraint will be in effect which prevents the completion of the
       merger, prohibits or limits our or EFI's ability to conduct our
       respective businesses, requires us or EFI to divest any of our respective
       assets or which otherwise would reasonably be expected to have a material
       adverse effect on us or EFI;

     - the registration statement to which this document relates must have been
       declared effective by the SEC;

     - the shares of EFI common stock to be issued in connection with the merger

       agreement;

     - no occurrence of events or conditions that have, or could reasonably be
       expected to have, a material adverse effect on us or EFI; and

     - EFI must have received "comfort letters" from our independent auditors.

     "Material adverse effect" means any change, effect, event, occurrence,
condition or development or state of facts that:

     - Is or would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the
       business, assets or results of operations or condition (financial or
       other) of a party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or

     - prevents or materially delays the consummation of the merger or any other
       transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,

in each case, other than any change, effect, event, occurrence, condition or
development or state of facts:

     - Relating to the U.S. economy in general,

     - relating to the industry in which the applicable party operates in
       general (and not having a materially disproportionate effect on the
       applicable party relative to most other industry participants),

     - resulting from the announcement or pendency of the transactions
       contemplated by the merger agreement or

     - in respect of decreases in a party's stock price,

but any effect described in the first three bullets above must be direct and
that the party claiming the effect will have the burden of proving the direct
effect; but:

     - In our case, none of (1) the acceleration of the maturity date of any of
       our existing indebtedness, (2) the delisting of our common stock from the
       Nasdaq National Market or (3) the inclusion of a "going concern" or
       similar qualification in the audit opinion delivered by our auditors in
       connection with their report on our financial statements for the year
       ended December 31, 2002 will be a material adverse effect.

TERMINATION

     The parties can terminate the merger agreement under the following
circumstances:

     - We and EFI can mutually agree to terminate the merger agreement;

     - either party can terminate the merger agreement if the closing has not
       occurred by June 30, 2003, our stockholders do not adopt this agreement
       at the special meeting of our stockholders or if there is a legal
       restraint that prohibits completion of the merger;

     - either party can generally terminate the merger agreement if there is a
       breach of a representation, warranty or agreement in the merger agreement
       by the other party which would result in any condition to its obligations
       becoming impossible to be satisfied and, if the breach may be remedied,
       30 calendar days must have elapsed since the non-breaching party gave
       notice of the breach to the breaching party;

     - EFI can terminate the merger agreement if we breach our agreements with
       respect to not soliciting takeover proposals and that breach leads to a
       superior proposal or our board of directors fails to recommend approval
       of the merger agreement to our stockholders, withdraws or changes its
       recommendation; if EFI so terminates the merger agreement we must pay EFI
       $828,000;

     - we may terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into an agreement
       to enter into a business combination or sell our stock or assets on terms
       which our board of directors determines are superior to the terms of the
       merger; if we so terminate the merger agreement we must pay EFI $828,000;
       and

     - we may terminate the merger agreement within five business days after the
       record date if EFI has not exercised the stock option in full before the
       record date.

     If our stockholders do not adopt the merger agreement and we enter into an
agreement for a takeover proposal for consideration of greater than or equal to
$2.60 within twelve months of termination, we must pay EFI $828,000.

GENERAL INFORMATION; PURPOSE OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

     The special meeting will be held at our principal executive offices, Forty
24th Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222, on           , 2003, beginning at
9:00 a.m., local time, to consider and to vote upon the adoption of the merger
agreement. Our board of directors is soliciting your proxy to be voted at that
special meeting.

RECORD DATE; SHARES ENTITLED TO VOTE

     Only our stockholders of record at the close of business on           ,
2003, the "record date" for the special meeting, will be entitled to notice of,
and to vote at, the special meeting. On the record date, there were shares of
our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Each
holder of shares of our common stock outstanding on the record date is entitled
to one vote for each share held, exercisable in person or by properly executed
and delivered proxy, at the special meeting. The presence of the holders of at
least a majority of our common stock outstanding on the record date, whether
present in person or by properly executed and delivered proxy, will constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business at the special meeting.

VOTE REQUIRED

     The affirmative vote of the holders of record of at least a majority of the
shares of our common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting is necessary
to adopt the merger agreement. Pursuant to the stockholders agreements entered
into concurrently with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement,
stockholders that collectively own approximately      % of our outstanding
common stock, executed the stockholders agreements, which, among other things,
require them to vote all shares of our common stock which they are entitled to
vote, directly or indirectly, in favor of adoption of the merger agreement.

     Abstentions cast in person at the special meeting will be tallied as votes
having been made and will not be treated as affirmative votes. Brokers who hold
shares for customers that have not given the broker instructions as to how to
vote at the special meeting will not vote those shares at the special meeting.
Abstentions and broker non-votes have the effect of a vote against the proposal
to adopt the merger agreement but will be counted for the purpose of determining
whether a quorum is present at the special meeting.

VOTING AND REVOCATION OF PROXIES

     You are requested to complete and sign the accompanying form of proxy and
return it promptly to us in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. When the
accompanying form of proxy is returned properly executed, the shares of our
common stock represented by it will be voted at the special meeting in
accordance with the instructions contained in the proxy. If a proxy is executed
and returned without an indication as to how the shares of our common stock
represented are to be voted, the shares of our common stock it represents will
be voted for adoption of the merger agreement. Unless you check the box on your
proxy withholding discretionary authority, the proxy holders may use their
discretion to vote on other matters relating to the special meeting, like
adjourning for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. If you vote against
the proposal to adopt the merger agreement but do not check the box withholding
discretionary authority, the proxies could vote your shares for an adjournment
or postponement which is intended to allow additional votes to be solicited for
adoption of the merger agreement.

     You have the power to revoke any proxy you have given at any time before it
is voted at the special meeting. A later-dated proxy or written notice of
revocation given to our corporate secretary before the vote at the special
meeting will serve to revoke a proxy. Also, a stockholder who attends the
special meeting in person may vote by ballot at the special meeting, thereby
canceling any proxy previously given. Mere presence at the special meeting will
not revoke any proxy previously given.

OTHER MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED

     Our board of directors is unaware of any other matter that will be brought
before the special meeting. If, however, other matters are presented that relate
to the merger, proxies will be voted in accordance with the discretion of the
holders of the proxies. If you wish to withhold this discretionary authority
from the proxy holders, you must check the applicable box on the proxy card.
Pursuant to our bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law, only business
within the purposes described in the notice of special meeting in this document
may be conducted at the special meeting.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

     We will bear the cost of soliciting proxies from holders of our common
stock. We have retained MacKenzie Partners, Inc. to assist us in the
solicitation of proxies. We have agreed to pay MacKenzie Partners up to $50,000
and to reimburse its expenses and to indemnify it from liabilities under federal
securities laws. In addition to the use of the mails, persons regularly employed
by us, EFI and MacKenzie Partners may solicit proxies by personal interview,
telephone and other telecommunication devices. Persons soliciting proxies will
receive no additional compensation for their services, but we will reimburse
them for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with their
services. Arrangements may also be made with custodians, nominees and
fiduciaries for the forwarding of solicitation materials to the beneficial
owners of shares of our common stock held of record by custodians, nominees or
fiduciaries, and we may reimburse custodians, nominees or fiduciaries for their
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in forwarding proxies.

BUSINESS

  OVERVIEW

     We are a leading provider of software solutions designed specifically for
the printing industry supply chain. Our enterprise resource planning and
collaborative supply chain software solutions enable printers and print buyers
to lower costs and improve productivity. Our procurement applications, which are
designed for print buyers, facilitate collaboration between printers and print
buyers over the Web. Our software solutions have been installed by more than
4,000 customers in over 8,000 facilities worldwide, including 24 of the 25
largest printing companies in North America and over 50 businesses in the
Fortune 1000.

  INDUSTRY BACKGROUND

     Based on U.S. Department of Commerce data and other industry sources, we
estimate that the printing industry supply chain is at least a $240 billion
market in the United States. We use the term printing industry supply chain to
describe the supply chain consisting of printers, print buyers, who buy products
and services offered by printers, and print industry raw material suppliers, who
supply the raw materials used by printers in the printing process.

     Based on industry sources, we believe that there are an estimated 50,000
printing facilities in the United States. Printers can be divided into three
principal market segments -- commercial printers, publication printers, and
retail printers -- based on the type of their equipment, the size and complexity
of their print jobs, and the nature of their customers. Commercial printing
includes the printing of brochures, direct mail materials, posters, promotional
materials, business forms, customized packaging and labels. Publication printing
involves the printing of larger quantities of more complex materials, such as
newspapers, catalogs, magazines, books, and retail inserts. Retail printers
offer customers many of the same products as a small commercial printer offers
its customers but typically also offer "walk up" service where a customer may
have a job produced on demand.

     Print buyers in nearly all markets require a wide variety of printed
materials and typically place customized orders with short lead times and
frequently request last minute changes. As a result, printers face unpredictable
demand, making it difficult to sustain high equipment utilization. The
unforeseen customer requirements placed on printers by customers also make it
difficult for print industry raw material suppliers to respond to printers'
needs. These characteristics of the printing industry lead to production
inefficiencies throughout the printing industry supply chain.

     The competitive environment in the printing industry requires printers and
print industry raw material suppliers to differentiate themselves by offering
superior quality, price, and customer service. Printers and print industry raw
material suppliers need solutions that increase revenues, reduce operating
costs, improve productivity, and increase customer satisfaction and loyalty.
Print buyers also seek to interact efficiently with printers in order to reduce
printing costs, improve productivity, and shorten production times.

  THE TRADITIONAL PRINT PRODUCTION PROCESS

     The production of printed material is complex and requires collaboration
among multiple parties throughout the process to ensure that the final product
accurately reflects the print buyer's design and meets its quality, cost, and
delivery expectations. Printing jobs are often highly customized, requiring
numerous interactions among print buyers, printers, and print industry raw
material suppliers. The production process itself can be divided into three
separate stages: design and specification; purchasing; and manufacturing and
distribution.

     Design and specification.  A print buyer designs printed material through a
collaborative process involving a print buyer's in-house and external design,
purchasing, sales, marketing, and creative personnel. The print buyer must then
communicate the print job specifications to the printer, using industry-specific

terminology, so that the printer can evaluate the specifications. Typically, the
print buyer specifies the print job manually and communicates it by telephone,
facsimile, or e-mail. The traditional design and specification process is
inherently inefficient. These inefficiencies result from the manual process of
data communication, input, and retrieval, the lack of appropriate error-checking
mechanisms, and the need for print buyers to understand the intricacies of the
print process and its industry-specific terminology in order to submit an
accurate request for a quote.

     Purchasing.  Purchasing a print job begins with the transmission of the
specifications to one or more printers to obtain and evaluate quotes that
estimate the cost, timing, and other elements of the project. A printer cannot
estimate the cost of a print job until the print buyer has completed the
specification phase, by defining paper, content, configuration, binding, and
distribution requirements. After evaluating the specification details, the
printer will determine its selling price, either manually or by a computer-based
process, and prepare a quote for the job. Once the printer provides a quote, the
print buyer then uses this information to modify job designs and specifications
and to select a printer. Without a consistent means of specifying a print job,
printers may misinterpret and inaccurately reply to quote requests, and print
buyers may not adhere to internal corporate policies and spending limits. In
addition, depending on a number of factors, such as the equipment available to
produce the print job, the cost of producing the same print job can vary
significantly from printer to printer. These miscommunications and
inefficiencies often lead to higher costs, delays, and customer dissatisfaction.

     Manufacturing and distribution.  This stage encompasses management of the
entire supply chain and production process, from purchasing and inventory of raw
materials through order management, preparation, printing, binding, finishing,
distribution, invoicing, and payment processing. The manufacturing and
distribution process has traditionally required manual preparation of job
instructions, which can result in inconsistent and inaccurate print
specifications, errors in the production process, delays in project completion,
and an inability to track the current status of inventories and jobs, leading to
high costs, production errors, delays, and customer dissatisfaction. In
addition, the difficulty associated with implementing customer change orders,
and a lack of integration between the systems that are used to plan and design
print projects, lead to further complications, inefficiencies, and errors in the
manufacturing and distribution processes.

  THE IMPACT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES ON THE PRINTING INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN

     The Web and other new technologies provide opportunities for businesses
across all industries to improve efficiency by extending their enterprise
software applications to include customers, partners, and suppliers. Businesses
seek software solutions that incorporate industry best practices, standard
processes, industry-specific terminology, and other functionality that has been
designed for their particular industry. Most enterprise software applications,
however, are not designed for the needs of a particular industry. We believe
that industry-specific software solutions can be easier to implement and
facilitate deeper collaboration among supply chain participants. These software
solutions are particularly in demand in industries, such as printing, with a
complex production process and rapidly changing job specifications.

     The printing process involves a high degree of customization to meet the
needs of participants in the printing industry supply chain, causing them to
utilize industry-specific enterprise resource planning systems to maximize
process efficiency. Some businesses have turned to in-house solutions to address
these needs. More recently, vendors have developed a variety of software
applications designed for use in many industries, including procurement and
enterprise resource planning systems. We believe that these applications, which
are often designed for a standard assembly process, utilizing catalog-derived
parts, do not meet the complex needs of the printing industry with its
job-specific custom requirements. The complexities and inefficiencies inherent
in the traditional print process create an opportunity for an integrated
software solution specific to the printing industry supply chain that eliminates
redundant and manual processes and enhances communication and collaboration.

  THE PRINTCAFE SOLUTION

     We believe that we offer the only integrated software solutions that enable
printers and print buyers to increase efficiency in each stage of the printing

fee and are typically priced as a percentage of product license fees. Customers
under maintenance service contracts receive technical product support and
product upgrades as they are released throughout the life of the maintenance
contracts.

  TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT ARCHITECTURE

     We design software solutions for participants in the global printing
industry supply chain. Our products are designed to be easily adaptable, secure,
and scalable for global businesses, as well as capable of handling multiple data
sources and a large number of transactions. Our products are implemented through
two technology platforms: client/server software applications and hosted Web-
based products. With our modular, object-oriented development approach, we have
developed client/server-based enterprise resource planning systems and supply
chain planning and execution software that work with a variety of databases and
operating systems. Our Web-based products are developed using readily-available
Web development tools and are deployed on an Oracle database. If we are unable
to maintain our licenses with Oracle, we could be required to obtain substitute
technology of lower quality or performance standards, or at additional cost, and
our business could be harmed. We continually refine our client/server software
applications and our Web-based products in order to improve their
interoperability and to extend the reach of our products throughout the printing
industry supply chain.

     Our product architecture is designed to support today's rapidly changing
technology standards by providing the following features:

     Layered architecture.  Our client/server software applications are written
using an object-oriented architecture, which enables our developers to construct
and modify discrete applications efficiently and cost-effectively. Our hosted
Web-based software applications are developed using multi-tier architecture,
which provides for ease of deployment, application management, support, and
scalability.

     Flexible, open systems architecture.  Our open architecture benefits both
our internal software development process and the customers who use our
solutions. Our developers are able to pre-configure software to address in
separate solutions the specialized needs of the different types of participants
in the printing industry supply chain, which simplifies and accelerates the
software development process. We are able to offer products which are
appropriate for customers ranging from small, single-facility print shops to
large, enterprise-wide implementations. In addition, our architecture supports a
number of different operating systems, such as Windows, Macintosh, AS/400, and
UNIX.

     Scalability.  We use a distributed application framework, which leverages
separate applications working together, rather than a single, complex system, to
minimize product complexity and facilitate product updates and maintenance. We
ensure optimal scalability in our Web-based products by managing application
replication software on multiple servers, coupled with load management software
and hardware,

which provides redundancy and additional peak use capacity. Our multi-tier
architecture allows for rapid response to demands for increased capacity
resulting in an environment that is highly scalable.

     Security.  Our Web-based products are protected from intrusion and
compromise through multiple industry-standard security measures. Our multi-tier
architecture isolates the major components of the system from one another -- the
publicly-accessible tiers include user interface components and business logic
modules, while the data layer resides in a separate, secure, private tier. By
segregating data from the interface and business logic, we protect the data
repository from infiltration over the public Web. We also rely upon
industry-standard security protocols, such as secure socket layer connections,
digital signatures, and encryption, to protect essential customer data from
exposure and corruption.

  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

     We rely primarily on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret,
and patent laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects
of our technology. These legal protections afford only limited protection for
our technology. We seek to protect the source code for our software,
documentation, and other written materials under trade secret and copyright
laws. We license our software pursuant to license agreements, which impose
restrictions on the licensee's ability to utilize the software. We also require
employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute
confidentiality agreements. We have obtained eight patents in the United States
on aspects of our technology and business processes. Four of these patents are
scheduled to expire within the next two years and the remaining four patents
expire at different times between 2005 and 2017. We do not view the expiration
of these patents to be material. We have also filed applications for additional
patents. We expect that, if granted, the duration of these patents will be 20
years from the date of filing the application. We own various trademarks that
are used in connection with our business, some of which have been registered
with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The duration of those
trademarks is unlimited, subject to continuous use.

     We license several patents for our Web-based solutions from the owners of
the respective patents. The license agreements grant us a non-exclusive license
to use in our products the process covered by U.S. Patent No. 4,839,829, No.
6,353,483, No. 6,362,895, and No. 6,429,947. The licenses remain in effect until
the expiration of the respective patents. We also license technology owned by
Creo Inc. for use in the Web-based solutions which we offer to printers. Creo
can terminate this license agreement if a third party purchases more than fifty
percent of our outstanding stock or our strategic alliance agreement with Creo
is terminated.

     Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties
may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information
that we regard as proprietary. In addition, the laws of many countries do not
protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the
United States. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our
intellectual property rights and to determine the validity and scope of the
proprietary rights of others. Our failure to adequately protect our intellectual
property could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating
results.

     Competition.  Traditionally, both printers and print buyers would
internally create their own methodologies to manage their printing industry
supply chain needs, often using manual processes. In the absence of
commercially-available printing industry supply chain software, some companies
developed software for their own internal use. The market for software focused
specifically on the printing industry supply chain is relatively new and is
evolving rapidly.

     In this market, we encounter competition from software application vendors
that specifically target the printing industry, which are typically small,
privately-owned companies, and from larger vendors who currently offer or are
seeking to develop printer-focused enterprise resource planning products, such
as Heidelberg and SAP. We are unaware of any competing integrated suite of
software products focused specifically on the print industry supply chain
similar to our comprehensive software solutions. In the future, we could
potentially face competition from other software vendors with related
functionality in enterprise resource planning, supply chain management, and
procurement who decide to target the printing

industry, including Ariba, i2, Manugistics, Microsoft, Oracle, and PeopleSoft,
and other software vendors focused on specific aspects of supply chain planning
and execution, such as Manhattan Associates, Retek, and Vastera. We believe that
the principal competitive factors affecting our market include adoption by a
significant number of print buyers and printers, product quality and
performance, customer service, core technology, product features, price, and the
value of services.

     Employees.  As of December 31, 2002, we had 330 full-time employees. Of
these employees, 56 were in sales and marketing, 108 were in research and
development, 126 were in customer support, and 40 were in general and
administrative services and operations. Our employees are not represented by a
labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good.

     Facilities.  Our headquarters are located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
where we lease approximately 25,000 square feet of office space. The lease
expires in November 2003, unless we elect to extend the term for up to an
additional two years. These facilities are used for executive office space,
including sales and marketing, finance and administration, research and design,
Web hosting, and customer support. In addition, we have offices in Arizona,
California, Connecticut, Illinois, Minnesota, and New Hampshire in the United
States, and New Windsor in the United Kingdom.

     Legal Proceedings.  On February 19, 2003, Creo commenced an action in The
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County
captioned Creo, Inc. v. Printcafe Software, Inc., Electronics For Imaging, Inc.,
Marc D. Olin, Charles J. Billerbeck, Victor A. Cohn and Thomas J. Gill. Creo
requested a temporary restraining order with respect to (a) triggering,
exercising or otherwise giving effect to the stockholders' rights plan we
adopted, (b) enforcing any action taken or to be taken by us "with the intent or
effect of impeding the operation of market forces in an open bidding contest for
Printcafe," (c) taking any steps or actions to enforce the fee provided for in
the letter agreement we entered into with EFI, (d) taking any steps or any
actions to enforce the option we granted to EFI, (e) taking any steps or actions
to enforce the no solicitation provisions of the standby credit letter that we
entered into with EFI, (f) engaging in any "conduct intended to cause or having
the effect of causing Printcafe to forgo the opportunity to explore and enter
into economically more favorable transactions" and (g) entering into, or
purporting to enter into, a merger agreement between EFI and us before the court
finally rules on the action. On February 21, 2003 the court denied Creo's
request for a temporary restraining order. The matter is still pending in the
Delaware Chancery Court with respect to the other relief sought by Creo. We
intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this matter. If this lawsuit is
resolved unfavorably to us, our business and financial condition could be
adversely affected and we may not be able to complete the merger.

     From time to time, we may be involved in various lawsuits and legal
proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including claims from
third parties alleging that our products infringe their proprietary rights.
These claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and costly, divert
management's attention, cause product shipment delays, require us to develop
non-infringing technology, or enter into royalty or licensing agreements.
Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on acceptable
terms, if at all. Based on our investigation to date, we do not believe that the
ultimate outcome of any of these claims would have a material adverse effect on
our business. However, if any of these disputes are resolved unfavorably to us,
our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.

(1) For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, 2000, 1999, and 1998, goodwill
    amortization was $0, $19,576, $16,653, $774 and $0, respectively, or $0.00,
    $121.30, $113.86, $6.83, and $0.00 per diluted common share, respectively.

(2) Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standard No. 142, Goodwill and other Intangible Assets. SFAS 142
    requires among other things, the discontinuance of goodwill amortization and
    provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized
    intangibles as goodwill. Upon the adoption of SFAS 142, the Company ceased
    amortizing goodwill.

  OVERVIEW

     General.  We have focused on developing software solutions designed
specifically for the printing industry supply chain since our inception in 1987.
In February 2000, Prograph Systems, our predecessor company, changed its name to
printCafe, Inc., and we launched our Web-based products to complement our
enterprise resource planning software. From February through April 2000, we
acquired five complementary businesses for an aggregate purchase price of $137.3
million. We have also committed significant resources to develop, integrate, and
market our products, expand our management team, and hire additional personnel.
On June 18, 2002, we completed our initial public offering by issuing 3,750,000
shares of our common stock at a price of $10.00 per share. We incurred a net
loss of $95.7 million, $70.0 million and $40.8 million in 2000, 2001 and 2002
respectively and had an accumulated deficit of $234.7 million as of December 31,
2002.

     The acquisitions we completed in early 2000 generated goodwill of $57.7
million, of which $22.5 million remained unamortized as of December 31, 2002,
and other intangible assets of $86.4 million, of which $5.5 million remained
unamortized as of December 31, 2002. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we have
performed the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets as of January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2002, and have
determined that no impairment loss is required to be

recognized. The other intangible assets are being amortized over a three-year
period, Any future write-off of goodwill or other intangible assets as a
non-cash charge could be significant and would likely harm our operating
results. In addition, any future impairment loss recognition may adversely
affect our ability to comply with the financial covenants in our installment
note with National City Bank. As of December 31, 2002, we were not in compliance
with the debt service coverage covenant of the installment note. We have
received a waiver with respect to this default from National City Bank, which
expires on January 1, 2004. As of December 31, 2002, the outstanding principal
balance of this note was $0.3 million.

     We acquired substantially all the assets and intellectual property of
printChannel, Inc. in October 2002. This transaction did not have a material
impact on fourth quarter financial results or our financial position as of
December 31, 2002.

     Sources of Revenue.  Our revenue is derived principally from licenses and
subscriptions of our products, maintenance contracts, and professional and other
services, including implementation, consulting, and training. Our products are
typically purchased under either a perpetual license or a time-based or
usage-based subscription. We offer our enterprise resource planning and other
client/server software to printers and print buyers under license agreements. We
offer our Web-based products to printers and print buyers under subscription
agreements, which typically have a term of three years. Our print buyer
customers pay a subscription fee for our Web-based products based on the number
of users of the website. Our printer customers can purchase either an unlimited
subscription or a limited subscription for our Web-based products. The fee for
the limited subscription is based on the value of print orders processed through
the customer's website. Maintenance contracts are sold to customers, usually at
the time of sale of a software license, under annual agreements that provide for
automatic renewal, unless the customer cancels. We also provide professional
services, which are offered at an hourly rate.

     We have derived most of our revenue from licenses of our software and the
sale of related maintenance to printers. In the first quarter of 2001, we began
to recognize revenue from the sale of our Web-based products to printers and
began to market our Web-based solutions for print buyers.

     For the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, revenues from foreign
customers approximated 5%, 11% and 15% respectively, of our total revenues.

  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     Our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of
operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management
to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets,
liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities. Our actual results may differ from those estimates.

     The following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments
and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements.

     Revenue Recognition.  We recognize revenue on our software products in
accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition,
which provides for recognition of revenue when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery of the product has occurred, no significant
obligations remain on our part with regard to implementation, the fee is fixed
and determinable, and collectibility is probable. SOP 97-2 generally requires
revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be
allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element.
Revenue recognized from multiple-element arrangements is allocated to
undelivered elements of the arrangement, such as maintenance and professional
services, based on the relative fair value of each element. Our determination of
fair value of each element in multi-element arrangements is based on
vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE). We limit our assessment of VSOE for
each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold
separately or the price established by management for an element not yet sold
separately. We have VSOE for maintenance services and professional services.

     If evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence
does not exist for one or more delivered elements, then revenue is recognized
using the residual method. Under the residual method, the fair value of the
undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the total fee is
recognized as revenue. We generally recognize license revenue under the residual
method upon delivery of our software to the customer, provided collection is
probable. Revenue allocated to maintenance is recognized ratably over the
maintenance term and revenue allocated to training and other service elements is
recognized as the services are performed. Revenue from Web-based products is
recognized ratably over the term of the subscription for unlimited subscriptions
and is recognized based on usage, subject to a fixed term, for limited
subscriptions. Many of our agreements include warranty provisions. Historically,
these provisions have not had a significant impact on our revenue recognition.
In those instances where customer acceptance may be in question, all revenue
relating to that arrangement is deferred until the warranty period has expired.

     Contingencies.  We are involved in disputes and litigation in the normal
course of business. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse
judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable
losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these
contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue. The
required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each
matter or changes in insurance coverage or our approach, such as a change in
settlement strategy.

     Stock Based Compensation.  We have elected to follow Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
interpretations for our employee stock options because the alternative fair
value accounting provided under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation (SFAS 123), requires use of valuation models that were not
developed for use in valuing employee stock options.

     In the first quarter of 2002, we granted options to purchase 766,520 shares
of common stock, with an exercise price of $4.21 per share, to employees and
directors. As a result, we recorded approximately $4.4 million of deferred
compensation. This amount represents the difference between the exercise price
and the fair market value of our common stock on the date we granted these stock
options. We will record stock-based compensation expense of approximately $1.1
million annually over the vesting period of these options, which is generally
four years. As described in "The Merger -- Interests of Our Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger" if the merger is completed, the vesting of
these options will be accelerated by six months.

     In April 2002, we granted options to purchase 381,603 shares of common
stock, with an exercise price of $15.54 per share, to employees. We did not
record any stock-based compensation expense related to these options as the
exercise price was above the then current fair market value. We also granted
options to purchase 92,910 shares of common stock to employees in June 2002,
with an exercise price of $2.00 per share. As a result, we will record
approximately $0.2 million of stock-based compensation expense annually over the
vesting period of these options, which is three years.

     For the year ended 2000, 2001 and 2002, we recorded $5.1 million, $1.1
million and $1.4 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense.

     Warrants.  We account for equity instruments issued to nonemployees and
pursuant to strategic alliance agreements in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS 123, Emerging Issues Task Force No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity
Instruments that are Issued to Other than Employees for Acquiring or in
Conjunction with Selling Goods or Services, and Emerging Issues Task Force No.
01-9, Accounting for Consideration Given by Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller
of the Vendor's Product. Warrant expense represents charges associated with the
issuance of warrants to purchase our common stock. To the extent that we derive
revenue from agreements entered into in connection with the issuance of
warrants, we offset this revenue by the expense associated with these warrants.
Any amount of expense that exceeds revenue is recorded in sales and marketing,
general and administrative, or interest expense, based upon the nature of the
agreement. The amount of expense is equal to the fair value of vested warrants
determined using Black-Scholes pricing models. The following table sets forth
the amount of expense and reduction to

revenue associated with the issuance of these warrants for the year ended
December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively (in thousands):

                                                               2000     2001    2002
                                                              ------   ------   ----

of common stock, which have exercise prices ranging from $266.40 to $592.07 and
vest upon attainment of performance criteria. Upon the vesting of warrants to
purchase 13,119 of these shares of common stock, we will record warrant expense
based upon fair value for each warrant, and upon the vesting of warrants to
purchase 30,780 of these shares of common stock, we will reduce revenue
generated from the warrant holder during the period when vesting occurs. We
cannot predict the timing or amount of this reduction in revenue and increase in
expense because the amount is calculated using the fair market value at the time
of vesting.

     Income Taxes.  Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary
differences between tax and financial bases of our assets and liabilities, using
the tax laws and statutory rates applicable to the periods in which the
differences are expected to affect taxable income. As of December 31, 2002, we
had significant net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future
taxable income. The net operating loss carryforwards will expire beginning 2015
through 2021. Federal and state tax rules impose substantial restrictions on the
utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in situations
where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company. Utilization of our
carryforwards is limited because of past ownership changes. In the event that we
have a future change in ownership, utilization of these carryforwards could be
further limited.

     We have established a 100% valuation allowance against deferred tax assets
due to the uncertainty that future tax benefits can be realized from our net
operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets.

     Identified Intangible Assets, Purchased Technology and Goodwill.  Our
identified intangible assets, purchased technology and goodwill are related
mainly to our business acquisitions. We amortize identified intangible assets
and purchased technology on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives (generally three years) of the remaining assets. Goodwill represents the
excess of cost over the fair value of net intangible and identifiable intangible
assets of acquired businesses. Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
Before we adopted SFAS No. 142, we amortized goodwill over its estimated useful
life of three years. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, we performed an initial
impairment analysis. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer amortized to
expense, but is instead subjected to a periodic impairment test at least
annually. The impairment test is a two-step process, which analyzes whether or
not goodwill has been impaired. Step one requires that the fair value be
compared to book value. If the fair value is higher than the book value, no
impairment is indicated and there is no need to perform the second step of the
process. If the fair value is lower than the book value, step two must be
evaluated. Step two requires the fair value to be allocated to assets and
liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in order to
determine the implied fair value of the goodwill. This implied fair value is
then compared with the carrying amount, and if it were less, we would then
recognize an impairment loss. We test goodwill for impairment annually in the
fourth quarter.

     Impairment of Long-lived Assets.  Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted
SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.
SFAS No. 144 supersedes or amends existing accounting literature related to the
impairment and disposal of long-lived assets.

     Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, we review our long-lived
assets for impairment by first comparing the carrying

value of the assets to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result
from the use and eventual disposition of the assets. If the carrying value
exceeds the sum of the assets' undiscounted cash flows, we estimate an
impairment loss by taking the difference between the carrying value and fair
value of the assets. No impairment charge has been recorded in any of the
periods presented.

  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     Debt extinguishment costs.  In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145,
Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 62, Amendment of FASB Statement No.
13 and Technical Corrections. SFAS No. 145, which becomes effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002 and
requires gains and losses on extinguishment of debt to be classified as income
or loss from continuing operations rather than as extraordinary items as
previously required under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations -- Reporting the Effects of Disposal
of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently
Occurring Events and Transactions. As of December 31, 2002, we early adopted
SFAS No. 145 and reclassified an extraordinary loss of $1.1 million recognized
in the second quarter of 2002 to other expense.

     Exit and disposal activities.  In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146,
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146,
which became effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after
December 31, 2002, addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs
associated with exit or disposal activities and requires that a liability for a
cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized at fair value
when the liability is incurred, rather than at the date of an entity's
commitment to an exit plan. We do not believe that SFAS No. 146 will have a
material impact on its financial position and results of operations.

     Stock-based compensation.  In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation -- Transition and Disclosure. SFAS No. 148 amends Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair
value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition,
SFAS No. 148 amends the prior disclosure guidance and requires prominent
disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method
used on reported results. For entities that voluntarily change to the fair value
based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation, the transition
provisions are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. For
all other companies, the disclosure provisions are effective for interim and
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2002.

     Guarantees.  In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45,
Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 clarifies and expands on
existing disclosure requirements for guarantees, including loan guarantees. It
also would require that, at the inception of a guarantee, we may need to
recognize a liability for the fair value, of the obligation under that
guarantee. The initial fair value recognition and measurement provisions will be
applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December
31, 2002. The disclosure provisions are effective for financial statements of
periods ending after December 15, 2002. The adoption of FIN 45 did not impact
our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

  RESTRUCTURING

     In September 2000, we initiated a restructuring plan that was designed to
reduce our cost structure and eliminate redundant job tasks that existed as a
result of the acquisitions made in early 2000. As part of this plan, we reduced
our workforce by 78 employees through the elimination of some positions and the
consolidation of other redundant job tasks. The restructuring resulted in a
charge for the year ended December 31, 2000 of $1.2 million, which consisted
primarily of severance and other benefits related to the discharged employees.
Our cash flow from operations was adversely impacted by those costs during the
fourth quarter of 2000 and the first six months of 2001.

     In May 2001, we announced a restructuring that primarily related to the
consolidation of client support operations into existing facilities, resulting
in a restructuring charge of $2.1 million. The plan included terminations of 45
employees and the reduction of leased office space. As of December 31, 2002,
less than $0.1 million remained in the reserve related to lease obligations. All
remaining cash expenditures relating to these lease obligations will have been
made by March 31, 2003.

     In August 2002, we announced a restructuring effecting an organizational
realignment of the product management and customer service and support
operations. This resulted in a restructuring charge of $0.5 million in the
quarter ended September 30, 2002. This charge consisted primarily of severance
and benefits including involuntary termination and COBRA benefits, outplacement
costs, and payroll taxes for the approximately 40 employees impacted by this
restructuring. As of December 31, 2002, we had expended substantially all
amounts relating to this restructuring.

     These restructuring plans focused on reducing our cost structure and
improving the efficiency of our operations to respond to changing market
conditions and to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions made in
early 2000. We believe that these actions will not adversely impact our
operations in the future because we have undertaken initiatives to manage and
monitor our client and employee relations during the execution of these plans
and subsequent to their completion.

  COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND DECEMBER 31, 2002

     Total revenue.  Total revenue increased from $41.9 million in 2001 to $46.5
million in 2002, an increase of 11%. The increase in license and subscription
revenue was primarily due to increased sales of licenses of our enterprise
resource planning products, which represented 32% of our total revenue for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2002, resulting from an increase in sales and
marketing initiatives focusing on these products. These sales and marketing
initiatives also led to additional maintenance contracts associated with these
new license sales and additional training and consulting services. An increase
in subscription and transaction fees generated by our Web-based products
resulting from contract renewals and an increase in transactional volume
processed through these products also contributed to the increase in revenue.

     Total cost of revenue.  Cost of revenue includes direct labor and other
direct costs relating to the delivery of our products and services. The cost of
license and subscription revenue is primarily related to third party licenses
that we resell with licenses and subscriptions of our products, as well as any
hosting and communication costs. Cost of revenue decreased from $11.6 million in
2001 to $10.4 million in 2002, a decrease of 11%. This decrease was the result
of lower third party license costs and a reduction in the number of employees in
our client and professional services area resulting from the restructuring of
operations in the second quarter of 2001 and the third quarter of 2002. Cost of
revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased from 28% in 2001 to 22% in 2002,
resulting from the increase in revenue and the reduction in costs.

     Operating expenses.  We classify our operating expenses into six general
categories, based on the nature of the expenditure: sales and marketing,
research and development, general and administrative, depreciation,
amortization, and stock-based compensation and warrants. We allocate our total
costs for overhead and facilities to each of the functional areas of our
business that use these services based upon estimated usage. These allocated
charges include general overhead items such as administrative salaries,
professional fees, building rent, equipment leasing costs, and telecommunication
charges.

     Sales and marketing.  Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of
costs related to sales and marketing, employee compensation, travel, public
relations, trade shows, and advertising. Sales and marketing expenses decreased
from $19.1 million in 2001 to $17.0 million in 2002, a decrease of 11%. Sales
and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 46% in 2001 to
37% in 2002. The decrease in absolute dollars was primarily due to a reduction
in the number of sales and marketing employees resulting from the restructuring
of operations in the second quarter of 2001 and reductions in travel,
advertising, promotion, public relations, and general marketing expenses related
to initiatives that were focused on reducing expenses.

     Research and development.  Research and development expenses consist
primarily of expenses related to the development and upgrade of our existing
proprietary software and expenses related to research and development for new
product offerings. These expenses include employee compensation for research and
development expenses and third-party contract development costs. Research and
development expenses decreased from $12.2 million in 2001 to $12.0 million in
2002, a decrease of 2%. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in outside
consulting expenses. Research and development expenses as a percentage of
revenue decreased from 29% in 2001 to 26% in 2002.

     General and administrative.  General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of compensation for executive and administrative personnel, travel
expenses, professional advisory fees, and general overhead expenses that are not
allocated to cost of revenue, product development, or sales and marketing.
General and administrative expenses decreased from $7.6 million in 2001 to $6.2
million in 2002, a decrease of 19%. General and administrative expenses as a
percentage of revenue decreased from 18% in 2001 to 13% in 2002. The decrease
was primarily due to a reduction in general and administrative employees.

     Depreciation.  Depreciation expense consists primarily of the depreciation
of equipment, furniture, fixtures, and leasehold improvements that are not
directly related to the generation of revenue. Depreciation expense decreased
from $3.8 million in 2001 to $2.9 million in 2002, a decrease of 24%. The
decrease is primarily attributable to computer equipment becoming fully
depreciated and new equipment being purchased at a slower rate compared to prior
periods.

     Amortization.  Amortization expense consists of the amortization of
intangible assets such as goodwill, purchased technology, customer lists, and
patents. Amortization expense decreased from $49.1 in 2001 to $29.5 million in
2002, a decrease of 40%. The decrease was primarily the result of the adoption
of SFAS No. 142, effective January 1, 2002. We have performed the required
impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of
January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2002, and determined that no impairment loss
was required to be recognized.

     Stock-based compensation and warrants.  Stock-based compensation expense
relates to grants of employee stock options and issuances of stock with exercise
prices lower than the deemed fair value of the underlying shares at the time of
grant or issuance and issuance of stock in consideration of salary. Stock-based
compensation and warrants expense increased from $1.1 million in 2001 to $1.4
million in 2002. The increase was primarily the result of stock-based
compensation expense related to options to purchase 766,520 shares of common
stock at an exercise price of $4.21 that were issued during the first quarter of
2002 to employees and directors.

     Other income (expense).  Other income (expense) consists primarily of
interest expense related to our borrowings and amortization of debt origination
costs, offset by interest income received from the investment of proceeds from
our financing activities. Interest expense decreased from $5.3 million in 2001
to $3.6 million in 2002, a decrease of 31%. The decrease is primarily due to the
repayment of $17.8 million of indebtedness upon the completion of our initial
public offering, offset by a higher weighted average interest rate on
outstanding indebtedness during the first two quarters of 2002 as compared to
the same periods of 2001. During 2002, amortization of debt origination fees of
$3.3 million was recorded as a result of the restructuring of debt during the
second quarter and the write-off of $1.1 million of debt origination fees
associated with a warrant issued to a lender. Amortization expense related to
debt origination fees will be approximately $0.9 million per quarter through
December 31, 2003. Other income (expense) for the twelve months ended December
31, 2002 also includes a fair value adjustment to reflect a decline in the value
of the collateral for notes receivable from our stockholders.

     Income taxes.  During the twelve months ended December 31, 2001 and 2002,
we incurred net losses for federal and state tax purposes and have not
recognized any tax provision or benefits. At December 31, 2002, we had
significant accumulated net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state
tax purposes. The federal tax carryforwards expire in various years beginning in
2015 through 2021. Utilization of net operating loss carryforwards is subject to
limitations. Events which cause limitations on the amount of net operating
losses that we may use in any one year include, but are not limited to, a
cumulative ownership change of more than 50% over a three-year period.

 COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND DECEMBER 31, 2001

     The inclusion for the year 2001 of the results of the companies we acquired
in early 2000 had an incremental effect on our results of operations. The more
significant reasons for the changes year over year are described below.

     Total revenue.  Total revenue increased from $25.3 million in 2000 to $41.9
million in 2001, an increase of 65%. The increase in license and subscription
revenue was primarily due to increased sales of licenses of our enterprise
resource planning products, which represented 32% of our total revenue in 2001,
resulting from an increase in sales and marketing initiatives focusing on these
products. These sales and marketing initiatives also led to additional
maintenance contracts associated with these new license sales and additional
training and consulting services. To a lesser extent, revenue also increased
because we began to recognize revenue from subscriptions for our Web-based
products for printers in the first quarter of 2001.

     Total cost of revenue.  Cost of revenue increased from $10.7 million in
2000 to $11.6 million in 2001, an increase of 9%. Cost of revenue as a
percentage of revenue decreased from 42% in 2000 to 28% in 2001. The decrease as
a percentage of revenue primarily resulted from an increase in revenue and a
decrease in the number of customer and professional service employees as a
result of the restructurings of operations in the third quarter of 2000 and the
second quarter of 2001.

     Sales and marketing.  Sales and marketing expenses decreased from $20.5
million in 2000 to $19.1 million in 2001, a decrease of 7%. Sales and marketing
expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 81% in 2000 to 46% in 2001.
The decrease in absolute dollars was primarily due to a reduction in the number
of sales and marketing employees resulting from restructurings of operations in
the third quarter of 2000 and the second quarter of 2001 and reductions in
travel, advertising, promotion, public relations, and general marketing expenses
related to initiatives that were focused on reducing expenses.

     Research and development.  Research and development expenses increased from
$11.3 million in 2000 to $12.2 million in 2001, an increase of 8%. The increase
was primarily due to continued investment in the development of our software and
Web-based products. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue
decreased from 45% in 2000 to 29% in 2001.

     General and administrative.  General and administrative expenses decreased
from $24.5 million in 2000 to $7.6 million in 2001, a decrease of 69%. General
and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 97% in
2000 to 18% in 2001. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in general and
administrative employees and the consolidation of facilities as a result of
restructurings of operations in the third quarter of 2000 and the second quarter
of 2001. Also contributing to the decrease were expense reductions in travel and
professional fees as a result of initiatives that were focused on reducing
expenses.

     Depreciation.  Depreciation expense increased from $2.1 million in 2000 to
$3.8 million in 2001. The increase is primarily due to the purchase of
additional computer equipment and software related to the development of our
Web-based products.

     Amortization.  Amortization expense increased from $39.5 million in 2000 to
$49.1 million in 2001, an increase of 24%, reflecting a full year of
amortization in 2001.

     Stock-based compensation and warrants.  Stock-based compensation and
warrants expense was $5.1 million in 2000 and $1.1 million in 2001. This
decrease is the result of a decrease in warrant expense and, to a lesser extent,
a reduction in the number of stock options being granted in 2001 at exercise
prices below their deemed fair value.

     Other expense net.  Other expense decreased from $6.2 million in 2000 to
$5.3 million in 2001, a decrease of 14%. The decrease is the result of a
reduction in outstanding indebtedness as well as a decrease in interest rates.

     Income taxes.  During 2001, we incurred net losses for federal and state
tax purposes and have not recognized any tax provisions or benefits.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     As of December 31, 2002, we had $8.8 million in cash and cash equivalents,
compared to $8.6 million as of December 31, 2001. This change was primarily
attributable to our receipt of $33.0 million in net proceeds from our initial
public offering in June 2002 offset by debt repayments of $17.8 million,
principal prepayment fees of $3.7 million and cash used by operations during the
period.

     Net cash used by operating activities totaled $10.6 million for 2002,
compared to $17.9 million of net cash used by operating activities for 2001. Net
cash used in operating activities for 2002 is primarily attributable to the net
loss for the period (less non-cash expenses) in addition to an increase in
accounts receivable as well as decreases in accounts payable, accrued
liabilities and the restructuring reserve. The increase in accounts receivable
is principally due to extended payment terms in agreements with significant
customers.

     Net cash used by investing activities totaled $1.0 million for 2002,
compared to $2.0 million of net cash used by investing activities for 2001. Cash
used by investing activities during 2002 was primarily the result of the
purchase of computer equipment and software licenses associated with the
implementation of a new customer relationship management system and the
acquisition of substantially all of the assets and intellectual property of
printChannel, Inc. Cash used by investing activities in 2001 included payment
for the license of a patent acquired in 2000, purchase of computer equipment and
software, and the acquisition of technology-related assets of another business.

     Net cash provided by financing activities was $11.8 million for 2002,
compared to $13.3 million of net cash provided by financing activities for 2001.
Cash from financing activities during 2002 was primarily attributable to our
receipt of $33.0 million in net proceeds from our initial public offering in
June 2002 offset, in part, by debt repayments of $17.8 million and principal
prepayment fees of $3.7 million. Cash from financing activities in 2001 was
primarily attributable to the issuance of shares of our preferred stock, offset,
in part, by the repayment of indebtedness.

     We have a $2.0 million demand line of credit with National City Bank, all
of which was drawn as of December 31, 2002. Borrowings under the facility bear
interest, which is payable monthly, at the prime rate. We also have entered into
a $0.9 million commercial installment note with National City Bank, which is
payable monthly and matures on July 1, 2004. Borrowings under the installment
note bear interest, which is payable monthly, at the annual rate of 7.62%. As of
December 31, 2002, the outstanding principal balance of this note was $0.3
million. The installment note contains restrictive covenants, including a
limitation on our ability to incur additional indebtedness or grant security
interests in our assets, as well as requirements that we satisfy various
financial conditions, including minimum tangible net worth and debt service
coverage. As of December 31, we were not in compliance with the debt service
coverage covenant of the installment note. We have received a waiver with
respect to this default from National City Bank, which expires January 1, 2004.
If we violate any of these financial covenants and are unable to obtain a waiver
from National City Bank, then National City Bank could declare all amounts
outstanding, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable.
Obligations under the installment note and line of credit are secured by all of
our tangible and intangible personal property.

     On May 31, 2002 and June 10, 2002, we executed agreements with a number of
our debt holders to modify the terms of related-party debt, effective upon the
completion of our initial public offering. An amendment to the promissory note
issued to the former shareholders of M Data, Inc. dated as of May 31, 2002,
provided for an increase in the principal amount of the note to $4.2 million
from $4.0 million in return for a reduction in the annual interest rate to 8.0%
from 12.0%. Principal payments are due in 24 equal monthly installments
commencing January 2003. Interest is payable monthly and commenced in June 2002.
Obligations under the note are secured by all of the intellectual property of
our subsidiary, M Data, Inc.

     An amendment to the credit agreement with Iris Graphics, dated as of June
10, 2002: (i) reduced the annual interest rate to a fixed rate of 4.0%; (ii)
provided for the payment of a total of $11.8 million of the outstanding
principal balance of $23.6 million at March 31, 2002 and all accrued and
deferred interest

upon the completion of our initial public offering; and (iii) eliminated the
financial covenants. In return, we paid a $3.7 million restructuring fee upon
completion of the initial public offering. The $11.8 million remaining principal
balance is due in one installment on January 2, 2004. Interest is payable
quarterly and commenced in June 2002. The agreement includes restrictive
covenants customary for agreements of this type. If we fail to comply with these
restrictive covenants, then the lender could declare all outstanding amounts,
together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. Obligations
under this agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets.

     Under an amendment to the loan agreement with the former shareholders of
Hagen Systems, dated as of June 10, 2002, we were not required to prepay $2.0
million of the $8.0 million otherwise due upon an initial public offering and
the annual interest rate was reduced to 8.0%, in return for an increase of $0.4
million to the remaining principal balance of the loan. The remaining principal
amount due under the restructured agreement is $2.4 million, which is due on
January 2, 2004. Interest at an annual rate of 8.0% is payable monthly and
commenced in June 2002. The agreement includes restrictive covenants customary
for agreements of this type. If we fail to comply with these restrictive
covenants, then the lender could declare all outstanding amounts, together with
accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. Obligations under this
agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets.

     We believe that, based on current levels of operations and anticipated
growth, our cash from operations, together with cash currently available, will
suffice to fund our operations for the next 12 months. Poor financial results,
unanticipated expenses or unanticipated opportunities that require financial
commitments could give rise to additional financing requirements sooner than we
expect. If we do not complete the merger or complete a similar transaction with
a third party, we do not expect to have sufficient cash to repay the $14.2
million of our outstanding debt that becomes due and payable in January 2004
without securing additional debt or equity financing; we do not expect that
additional debt or equity financing would be available to us. If we are unable
to pay these amounts when due, the lenders could proceed against the collateral.

 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

     For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, revenue from foreign
customers approximated 15% of our total revenue. We have not had any material
exposure to factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates in
foreign markets. However, in future periods, we expect to increase sales in
foreign markets, including Canada and Europe. As our sales are made in U.S.
dollars, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar could cause our products to be less
attractive in foreign markets. At December 31, 2002, a total of $2.0 million of
outstanding debt accrues interest based on the prime rate. Most of our cash
equivalents, short-term investments, and capital lease obligations are at fixed
interest rates. Therefore, the fair value of these investments is affected by
changes in the market interest rates. However, because our investment portfolio
is primarily composed of investments in money market funds and high-grade
commercial paper with short maturities, we do not believe an immediate 10%
change in market interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market
value of our portfolio. Therefore, we would not expect our operating results or
cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden
change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio.

PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS

     The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial
ownership of our common stock as of February 28, 2003 by:

     - Each of our directors and executive officers;

     - all directors and executive officers as a group; and

     - each person who is known by us to own beneficially more than 5% of our
       common stock.

     We have determined beneficial ownership in the table in accordance with the
rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. To our knowledge, except as set
forth in the footnotes below, each stockholder

identified in the table possesses sole voting and investment power with respect
to all shares of common stock shown as beneficially owned by such stockholder.

     Percentage ownership calculations are based upon 10,632,877 shares of our
common stock outstanding on February 28, 2003. In computing the number of shares
beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we
have deemed shares of common stock subject to options or warrants held by that
person that are currently exercisable or will become exercisable within 60 days
of February 28, 2003 to be outstanding, but we have not deemed these shares to
be outstanding for computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

     Except as otherwise noted, the address of each person listed in the table
is c/o Printcafe Software, Inc., Forty 24th Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
15222.

          COMPARATIVE RIGHTS OF EFI STOCKHOLDERS AND OUR STOCKHOLDERS

     We and EFI are both organized under the laws of the State of Delaware. Any
differences in the rights of holders of our capital stock and holders of EFI
capital stock arise primarily from differences between the companies' restated
certificates of incorporation and bylaws. Upon completion of the merger, holders
of our common stock that elect to receive their merger consideration in stock
will become holders of EFI common stock and their rights will be governed by
Delaware law, EFI's certificate of incorporation and EFI's bylaws.

     This section does not include a complete description of all differences
between the rights of these stockholders, nor does it include a complete
description of the specific rights of these stockholders. In addition, the
identification of some of the differences in the rights of these stockholders as
material is not intended to indicate that other differences that are equally
important do not exist. You are urged to read carefully the relevant provisions
of Delaware law, as well as our and EFI's certificates of incorporation and
bylaws. Copies of the forms of our and EFI's certificate of incorporation and
bylaws are on file with the SEC. Copies of those documents will be sent to you
upon request. See "Where You Can Find More Information." The following table
summarizes the differences between our and EFI's organizational documents.

                      SUBMISSION OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

     We have scheduled our annual stockholders meeting for May 2003. In order to

the 2003 annual meeting, we must have received the proposal no later than
November 23, 2002. In addition, the proxy solicited by our board of directors
for our 2003 annual meeting of stockholders will confer discretionary authority

proposals must be submitted in writing and must conform to SEC regulations and
our bylaws. Stockholders submitting proposals were required to direct them to

                         WHERE TO FIND MORE INFORMATION

     EFI has filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 to register
the shares of EFI's common stock to be offered and sold in connection with the
merger. This document is a part of that registration statement. As permitted by
the SEC this document is EFI's prospectus with respect to the offer and sale of
shares of its common stock and our proxy statement with respect to the
solicitation by our board of directors to be used at a special meeting of our
stockholders to consider adoption of the merger agreement. As also permitted by
the SEC, this document does not contain all of the information that is included
in the registration statement or its exhibits.

     We and EFI both file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy
statements and other information with the SEC. You may read and copy any
reports, statements or other information filed by either company, including
EFI's registration statement related to the shares of common stock to be issued
in connection with the merger, at the SEC's public reference room at 450 Fifth
Street N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. You can obtain information about the SEC
public reference room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also
maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information
statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with
the SEC at www.sec.gov. You can obtain more information about EFI and the shares
of its common stock to be issued in connection with the merger by reviewing the
registration statement, along with exhibits and schedules. Statements in this
document regarding the contents of any contract or other document are not
necessarily complete and you should refer to the copies of those contracts or
documents filed as exhibits to the registration statement. All statements in
this document are qualified in all respects by reference to the complete text of
those contracts and documents.

     All information concerning EFI contained or incorporated by reference in
this document has been furnished by EFI and we have furnished all information

stockholders nor the issuance of shares of EFI common stock in connection with
the merger will create any other implication.

                 SOME DOCUMENTS ARE "INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE"

     The SEC allows EFI to "incorporate by reference" information into this

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Printcafe Software, Inc.

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Printcafe
Software, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2002 and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' (deficit) equity,
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2002. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Printcafe
Software, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2001 and 2002 and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

     As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2002,
the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other intangible
assets.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

  NATURE OF BUSINESS

     Printcafe Software, Inc. (the Company) provides software solutions designed
specifically for the printing industry supply chain. The Company's procurement
applications, which are designed for print buyers, integrate with its software
solutions designed for printers, and facilitate collaboration between printers
and print buyers over the Web. The Company's enterprise resource planning and
collaborative supply chain software solutions are designed to enable printers
and print buyers to lower costs and improve productivity.

  BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries after the elimination of all significant
intercompany balances and transactions. Amounts within the financial statements
and footnote disclosures have been recorded in thousands except for the share
and per share data.

  REVENUE RECOGNITION

     The Company's revenue recognition policy is governed by Statement of
Position (SOP) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, issued by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). The Company derives its
revenues from licenses and subscriptions for its products as well as from the
provision of related services, including installation and training, consulting,
customer support, and maintenance contracts. Revenues are recognized only if
persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, delivery has occurred, all
significant vendor obligations are satisfied, the fee is fixed, determinable,
and collectible and there is vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) to
support the allocation of the total fee to a multi-element arrangement. The
Company does not have VSOE for the license component or the fixed price
installation component and these have historically been sold bundled together
with post-contract support. Therefore, the Company follows the residual method
as outlined in SOP 98-9, Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition
with Respect to Certain Transactions, under which revenue is allocated to the
undelivered elements and the residual amounts of revenue are allocated to the
delivered elements. Many of the Company's agreements include warranty
provisions. Historically, these provisions have not had a significant impact on
the Company's revenue recognition. In those instances where customer acceptance
may be in question, all revenue relating to that arrangement is deferred until
the warranty period has expired. Additional revenue recognition criteria by
revenue type are listed below.

  License and subscription revenue

     License and subscription revenue includes fees for perpetual licenses and
periodic subscriptions. The Company recognizes revenues on license fees after a
license agreement has been signed, the product has been delivered, the fee is
fixed, determinable and collectible, and there is VSOE to support the allocation
of the total fee to a multielement arrangement (if applicable). If VSOE cannot
be obtained for certain elements of the contract, the Company recognizes revenue
using the residual method under which revenue is allocated to the undelivered
elements and the residual amounts of revenue are allocated to the delivered
elements. The Company recognizes revenues on periodic subscriptions over the
subscription term for unlimited subscriptions and based on the value of orders
processed for its customers through the system for limited subscriptions.
Revenue is recognized for subscription orders processed through resellers over
the subscription term of the underlying agreement, beginning upon installation.

  Maintenance revenue

     Maintenance revenue is derived from the sale of maintenance and support
contracts, which provide customers with the right to receive maintenance
releases of the licensed products and access to customer
                                       F-9

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

support staff. Maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over
the term of the contract, which is typically one year. Payments for maintenance
revenue are normally received in advance and are nonrefundable.

  Professional services and other revenue

     Professional services and other revenue is derived from variable fees for
installation, training, and consulting. Revenue for professional services such
as installation and training, system integration projects, and consulting is
primarily recognized as the services are performed. If these services are part
of a multielement contract under which VSOE cannot be obtained for certain
elements, they may be deferred either until acceptance of any related software
or over the license period.

  SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS

     Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and are included in
license and subscription cost of revenue.

  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

     Cash and cash equivalents include cash and interest-bearing money market
deposits with financial institutions having original maturities of 90 days or
less. The balance at December 31, 2001 included approximately $7,200 of cash
received on January 2, 2002 in connection with the issuance of Series F
preferred stock (Note 12). Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which
approximates market value. The amounts held by major financial institutions may
exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. These deposits may
generally be redeemed upon demand and, therefore, are subject to minimal risk.

  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     For certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities, recorded amounts
approximate fair value due to the relative short maturity period. On May 31,
2002 and June 10, 2002, the Company entered into new agreements for its related
party debt (Note 9). As a result, the carrying amount of this debt approximates
market value as of fiscal year end 2002. The carrying amount of the line of
credit approximates market value because it has an interest rate that varies
with market interest rates. The fair values of the obligations under capital
leases are estimated based on current interest rates available to the Company
for debt instruments with similar terms, degrees of risk, and remaining
maturities. The carrying values of these obligations approximate their
respective fair values. The estimated fair values may not be representative of
the actual values of these financial instruments that could have been realized
as of the period end or that will be realized in the future.

  PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

     Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using
the straight-line and accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of the
related assets (generally three to five years). Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the lesser of their useful lives or the remaining term of the
lease. Amortization of assets recorded under capital leases is included in
depreciation expense. Upon disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation
are removed from the Company's accounts and the resulting gains or losses are
reflected in the statement of operations.

  IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, PURCHASED TECHNOLOGY AND GOODWILL

     Identified intangible assets, purchased technology and goodwill are related
mainly to the business acquisitions discussed in Note 3. Amortization of
identified intangible assets and purchased technology is recorded on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives (generally three years) of
the remaining assets. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value
of net intangible and identifiable intangible assets of
                                       F-10

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

acquired businesses. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
(SFAS No. 142). Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company amortized
goodwill over its estimated useful life of three years. Upon adoption of SFAS
No. 142, the Company performed an initial impairment analysis. Under SFAS No.
142, goodwill is no longer amortized to expense, but is instead subjected to a
periodic impairment test at least annually. The impairment test is a two-step
process, which analyzes whether or not goodwill has been impaired. Step one
requires that the fair value be compared to book value. If the fair value is
higher than the book value, no impairment is indicated and there is no need to
perform the second step of the process. If the fair value is lower than the book
value, step two must be evaluated. Step two requires the fair value to be
allocated to its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price
allocation in order to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill. This
implied fair value is then compared with the carrying amount, and if it were
less, the Company would then recognize an impairment loss. Annually, the
goodwill is tested for impairment in the fourth quarter.

  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

     Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 144, Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (SFAS No. 144). This Statement
supercedes or amends existing accounting literature related to the impairment
and disposal of long-lived assets.

     In accordance with SFAS No. 144, whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be
recoverable, the Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment by first
comparing the carrying value of the assets to the sum of the undiscounted cash
flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets. If
the carrying value exceeds the sum of the assets' undiscounted cash flows, the
Company estimates an impairment loss by taking the difference between the
carrying value and fair value of the assets. No impairment charge has been
recorded in any of the periods presented.

  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND WARRANTS

     The Company has adopted SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation--Transition and Disclosure (SFAS No. 148) and the disclosure-only
provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS No.
123). SFAS No. 123 permits the Company to continue accounting for stock-based
compensation as set forth in APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, provided the Company discloses the pro forma effect on net income and
earnings per share of adopting the full provisions of SFAS No. 123. Accordingly,
the Company continues to account for stock-based compensation under APB Opinion
No. 25 and has provided the required pro forma disclosures. The Company accounts
for equity instruments issued to nonemployees and pursuant to strategic alliance
arrangements in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, Emerging Issues
Task Force (EITF) No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued
to Other than Employees for Acquiring or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or
Services, and Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 01-9, Accounting for
Consideration Given by Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendor's
Product.

  SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS

     Costs for the development of new software products and substantial
enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until
technological feasibility has been established, at which time any additional
costs would be capitalized in accordance with SFAS No. 86, Computer Software to
be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed. Because the Company believes its current
process for developing software is essentially completed concurrently with the
establishment of technological feasibility, no costs have been capitalized to
date, with the exception of the technology acquired from acquisitions (Note 3).
The value of the purchased technology was capitalized and is being amortized on
a straight-line basis over three years (its estimated useful life).

  INCOME TAXES

     The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes
pursuant to SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes.

     Under SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined
based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax laws and rates applicable to
the periods in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company
provides for a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to their
estimated realizable value.

  CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

     For the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001, and 2002, revenues from
foreign customers approximated 5%, 11%, and 15%, respectively, of the Company's
total revenues.

     The Company does not require collateral from its customers. Credit losses
related to such customers historically have been minimal and within management's
expectations.

  ADVERTISING

     Advertising and promotion costs are expensed as incurred and totaled
approximately $1,829, $1,437, and $1,146 for the years ended December 31, 2000,
2001, and 2002, respectively.

  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

     The functional currency of the Company's foreign subsidiaries is the local
currency. The Company translates all assets and liabilities to U.S. dollars at
the current exchange rates as of the applicable balance

                                       F-12

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average of the beginning
and ending exchange rate prevailing during the period. Gains and losses
resulting from the translation of the foreign subsidiaries' financial statements
are reported as a separate component of total other comprehensive loss in
stockholder's equity. Net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange
transactions, which are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations,
were not significant during any of the periods presented.

  COMPREHENSIVE LOSS

     The Company reports comprehensive income or loss in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. Comprehensive income
or loss, as defined, includes all changes in equity (net assets) during a period
from nonowner sources. Tax effects of other comprehensive income or loss are not
considered material for any period.

  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

  Debt extinguishment costs

     In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements
No. 4, 44 and 62, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections
(SFAS No. 145). SFAS No. 145, which becomes effective for financial statements
issued for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002 and requires gains and
losses on extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from
continuing operations rather than as extraordinary items as previously required
under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, Reporting
the Results of Operations -- Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a
Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and
Transactions. As of December 31, 2002, the Company early adopted SFAS No. 145
and reclassified an extraordinary loss of $1,143 recognized in the second
quarter of 2002 to other expense.

  Exit and disposal activities

     In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities (SFAS No. 146), which becomes effective for
exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. SFAS No.
146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit
or disposal activities and requires that a liability for a cost associated with
an exit or disposal activity be recognized at fair value when the liability is
incurred, rather than at the date of an entity's commitment to an exit plan. The
Company does not believe that SFAS No. 146 will have a material impact on its
financial position and results of operations.

  Stock-Based Compensation

     In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation -- Transition and
Disclosure (SFAS No. 148). SFAS No. 148 amends FASB Statement No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of
transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the prior
disclosure guidance and requires prominent disclosures in both annual and
interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. For
entities that voluntarily change to the fair value based method of accounting
for stock-based employee compensation, the transition provisions are effective
for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. For all other companies, the
disclosure provisions are effective for interim and annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2002. The Company has complied with the disclosure provisions
of this standard in the consolidated financial statements.

                                       F-13

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

  Guarantees

     In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor's
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN No. 45). FIN No. 45 clarifies and
expands on existing disclosure requirements for guarantees, including loan
guarantees. It also would require that, at the inception of a guarantee, the
Company may need to recognize a liability for the fair value, of its obligation
under that guarantee. The initial fair value recognition and measurement
provisions will be applied on a prospective basis to certain guarantees issued
or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure provisions are effective for
financial statements of periods ending after December 15, 2002. The adoption of
FIN No. 45 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

  LOSS PER SHARE

     Basic and diluted loss per share have been computed using the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Potential common shares from conversion of convertible preferred stock and
exercise of stock options and warrants are excluded from historical diluted net
loss per share because they would be antidilutive. The total number of shares
excluded from diluted net loss per share relating to these securities was
5,037,288, 6,892,403, and 2,125,833 shares for the years ended December 31,
2000, 2001, and 2002, respectively.

  USE OF ESTIMATES

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

2. INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING

     In June 2002, the Company issued 3,750,000 shares of its common stock at a
price of $10.00 per share in its initial public offering. The company received
approximately $32,950 in proceeds, net of underwriting discounts, commissions,
and offering expenses. Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public
offering, each outstanding share of preferred stock was automatically converted
into common stock based upon the applicable conversion ratio (see Note 12). In
connection with the offering, the Company repaid approximately $17,800 of
related party debt (see Note 9)

3. ACQUISITIONS

     The number of shares of common stock and the valuations thereof, included
in the acquisition information presented below, has been adjusted to reflect the
one-for-thirty reverse split and the 1-for-2.22 reverse split that occurred in
January 2002 and May 2002, respectively, and certain share calculations have
been rounded.

  Programmed Solutions, Inc.

     On February 9, 2000, the Company acquired the outstanding common stock of
Programmed Solutions, Inc. (PSI), a provider of software for the printing
industry. The aggregate purchase price of $25,130 (including transaction costs
of $130) consisted of 25,887 shares of common stock valued at $386.28 per share
and $15,000 in cash. This transaction was accounted for as a purchase in
accordance with APB 16. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of $6,309 is
classified as goodwill.

  A.H.P. Systems, Inc.

     On March 8, 2000, the Company acquired the outstanding common stock of

The aggregate purchase price of $4,446 (including transaction costs of $144)
consisted of 5,954 shares of common stock valued at $588.08 per share and $800

     The note payable to the bank includes various restrictive covenants, which
among other things require the Company to maintain a certain debt service
coverage ratio. At December 31, 2001 and 2002, the Company was not in compliance
with this covenant. The bank waived compliance with this covenant through
January 1, 2004.

     During 2001, the Company received bridge loans in the amount of $4,500 from
certain Series B, C, D, and E-1 preferred stockholders. The bridge loans bore
interest at 12% and converted into $2,250 of long-term stockholder debt and
562,500 shares of Series F preferred stock at $4.00 per share on December 31,
2001. The Company issued warrants to purchase 9,382 shares of common stock and
75,000 shares of Series E-1 preferred stock shares in conjunction with these
bridge loans which were valued at $1,161, using the Black-Scholes valuation
model with the following assumptions: volatility of 1.0; no expected dividend
yield; risk-free interest rate of 5.09%; and an estimated life of ten years
(Note 14). The estimated fair value of these warrants was recorded as interest
expense in 2001.

with the acquisition of Hagen. In addition, new agreements were entered into
with the former stockholders of Hagen and M Data. Accordingly, new payment
periods and interest rates related to the remaining $8,000 of debt for Hagen and
$4,000 of debt for M Data were established as disclosed above. Funds used for
the repayments were obtained from a $23,600 note payable issued to Iris
Graphics, a subsidiary of one of the Company's stockholders, and the issuance of
3,722,096 shares of Series F preferred stock at $4 per share (Note 12). The
financial statements reflect these transactions as of December 31, 2001, in
accordance with the terms of the agreements described above. The related cash
transfers occurred on January 2, 2002. The Iris Graphics note included financial
covenants based on cash flows and revenues. At December 31, 2001, the Company
was not in compliance with the quarterly cash flow covenant, which would have
resulted in an additional 3% of interest until the default was cured. Iris
Graphics waived compliance with this covenant through March 31, 2002. In
conjunction with incurrence of the debt, Iris Graphics was also issued a warrant
to purchase 570,874 shares of Series F preferred stock at an exercise price of
$.01 per share. The estimated fair value of this warrant of $2,283 will be
recorded to interest expense over the term of the related debt (Note 14).

     On May 31, 2002 and June 10, 2002, the Company executed agreements with
certain of its debt holders to modify the terms of certain related-party debt,
effective upon the completion of the Company's initial public offering. An
amendment to the promissory note issued to the former shareholders of M Data,
dated as of May 31, 2002, provided for an increase in the principal amount of
the note to $4,200 from $4,000 in return for a reduction in the annual interest
rate to 8.0% from 12.0%. Principal payments are due in 24 equal installments
commencing January 2003. Interest is payable monthly beginning June 2002. The
$200 increase in principal was accounted for as deferred interest and will be
amortized as interest expense in addition to the 8.0% stated rate over the
remaining term of the loan (resulting in an effective annual interest rate of
approximately 11.1%).

     An amendment to the credit agreement with Iris Graphics, dated as of June
10, 2002: (i) reduced the annual interest rate to a fixed rate of 4.0%; (ii)
provided for the payment of a total of $11,800 of the outstanding principal
balance of $23,600 at December 31, 2001 and all accrued and deferred interest
upon the completion of the Company's initial public offering; and (iii)
eliminated the financial condition covenants associated with the original loan.
In return, the Company agreed to pay a $3,700 restructuring fee upon completion
of the Company's initial public offering. The restructuring fee was accounted
for as deferred interest and will be amortized as interest expense in addition
to the stated 4.0% rate over the remaining term of the loan (resulting in an
effective annual interest rate of approximately 23.8%). The $11,800 remaining
principal balance is due in one installment on January 2, 2004. Interest is
payable quarterly beginning in June 2002. The covenants under the amended
agreement provide certain limitations on the Company's product development and
capital expenditures, future investments and certain other financial criteria.

     In connection with this amendment and subsequent repayment, the Company
wrote off approximately $1,143 of debt origination fees associated with the fair
value of the Iris Graphic warrant. This write-off has been included in other
expense.

     Additionally, under an amendment to the loan agreement with the former
shareholders of Hagen Systems, dated as of June 10, 2002, the Company was not
required to prepay $2,000 of the $8,000 otherwise due upon an initial public
offering and the annual interest rate was reduced to 8.0%, in return for an
increase of $350 to the remaining principal balance of the loan. The remaining
principal amount due under the restructured agreement, after the prepayment of
$6,000, is $2,350, which is due on January 2, 2004. Interest at an annual rate
of 8.0% is payable monthly beginning in June 2002. The $350 increase in
principal was accounted for as deferred interest and will be amortized as
interest expense in addition to the stated 8.0% rate over the remaining term of
the loan (resulting in an effective annual interest rate of approximately
17.4%).

  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     The Company is involved in disputes and litigation in the normal course of
business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these
matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's
business, financial condition, or results of operations. The Company has accrued
for estimated losses in the accompanying financial statements for those matters
where it believes that the likelihood that a loss has occurred is probable and
the amount of loss is reasonably estimable. Although management currently
believes the outcome of other outstanding legal proceedings, claims, and
litigation involving the Company will not have a material adverse effect on its
business, financial condition, or results of operations, litigation is
inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that existing or future
litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

13.  STOCK OPTION PLANS

  1999 STOCK OPTION PLAN

     During 1999, the Company adopted a stock option plan (the 1999 Plan), which
provides for the issuance of stock options for officers, directors, employees,
and consultants. A total of 9,831 options to purchase the Company's common stock
have been granted pursuant to the 1999 Plan at an exercise price equal to the
estimated grant date fair value, as determined by the board of directors.
Options under the 1999 Plan will generally expire ten years from the date of
grant. Options granted under the plan vested immediately in March 2000 upon the
Company's filing of a registration statement on Form S-1. A new measurement date
did not occur since the accelerated vesting was included in the original grant
agreement. As of December 31, 2002, the weighted average remaining contractual
life on the 1999 Plan options outstanding was 6.73 years.

  STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS

     Effective February 10, 2000, the Company adopted the 2000 stock incentive
plan (the 2000 Plan), which provides for the issuance of stock options for
officers, directors, employees, and consultants. A total of 112,526 shares of
common stock may be issued pursuant to the 2000 Plan. Options generally vest
over a four-year period in equal annual amounts, or over such other period as
the board of directors determines, and may be accelerated in the event of
certain transactions such as a merger or a sale of the Company. These options
generally expire ten years after the date of grant. As of December 31, 2002, no
additional shares have been granted pursuant to this Plan. The weighted average
remaining contractual life on the 2000 Plan options outstanding at December 31,
2002 was 7.84 years.

     During 2000, the Company granted stock options to certain employees below
fair value and to nonemployees for professional services, which resulted in the
recognition of $1,016 of deferred stock-based

                                       F-25

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

compensation. The deferred stock-based compensation is being amortized over the
remaining vesting period. The employee grants were determined utilizing the
intrinsic value method under APB Opinion No. 25. The nonemployee grants were for
professional services at exercise prices that approximated fair value at the
date of grant. The average fair value of these options was estimated at $6.66
per share on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the following assumptions: volatility of 1.00, dividend yield of 0.0%, risk-free
interest rate of 6.0%, and an expected life of four years. During 2000, 2001 and
2002, the Company recognized compensation expense of approximately $866, $49 and
$32, respectively, related to these grants.

     Effective February 5, 2002, the Company adopted the 2002 key executive
stock incentive plan (the 2002 Executive Plan) under which 766,520 shares of
common stock were reserved for grants to senior management, officers, and
directors. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had granted options to purchase
766,520 shares of common stock, with an exercise price of $4.21 per share.
Options to purchase 10,307 and 756,213 shares vest over one- and four-year
periods, respectively. As these options were granted below fair market value,
$4,433 of deferred stock-based compensation was recorded. For the year ended
December 31, 2002, $1,148 of stock-based compensation expense was recognized
with respect to these options. As of December 31, 2002, the weighted average
remaining contractual life on the 2002 Executive Plan options outstanding was
9.1 years.

     Effective March 5, 2002, the Company adopted the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan
(the 2002 Plan), which provides for the issuance of stock options for officers,
directors, employees, and consultants. The Company has reserved 765,765 shares
of common stock for grants under the plan. The options generally vest over a
four-year period in equal annual amounts, or over such other period as the board
of directors determines, and may be accelerated in the event of certain
transactions such as a merger or a sale of the Company. These options generally
expire ten years after the date of grant. During 2002, the Company granted
92,910 options to employees below fair value at the date of grant. The
transaction resulted in $743 and $179 of deferred stock-based compensation and
compensation expense, respectively. The deferred stock-based compensation is
being amortized over the remaining vesting period. As of December 31, 2002, the
weighted average remaining contractual life on the 2002 Plan options outstanding
was 9.34 years.

     The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option plans.
Had compensation cost for the Company's stock option plans been determined based
upon the fair value at the grant date for awards under these plans consistent
with the methodology prescribed under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, the Company's net loss and net loss per share would have been
increased by approximately $2,201, $4,508, and $4,406 or $15.05, $27.93 and $.76
per share, in 2000, 2001, and 2002, respectively. The following weighted average
assumptions were used in the Black-Scholes pricing model: volatility of 1.58,
1.0 and 1.17, dividend yield of 0.0%, an expected life of three and four years,
and average risk-free interest rates of 6.50%, 4.05% and 3.63% for 2000, 2001,
and 2002, respectively. The effects of applying SFAS No. 123 in this pro forma
disclosure are not likely to be representative of the effects on reported net
income for future years.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

  EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

     Effective March 5, 2002, the Company adopted the 2002 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, which became effective upon the Company's initial public
offering. The Company has reserved 337,837 shares of common stock for issuance
under the plan. Under the Plan, employees participating in the Plan may purchase
shares of common stock at the lower of (i) 85% of the price of a share of common
stock at the beginning of an offering period and (ii) 85% of the price of a
share of common stock on the purchase date. An offering period is defined as a
two-year period consisting of four (4) purchase dates, April 30 and October 31
of each year. Employees are eligible to join the plan and begin their offering
period on May 1 and November 1 of each calendar year. On October 31, 2002,
employees purchased 38,986 shares for $.99 (85% of $1.16 on October 31, 2002)
resulting in cash proceeds of approximately $38.

14. WARRANTS

  STRATEGIC

     In early 2000, the Company entered into two agreements pursuant to which
the Company develops private label Web sites. The Company is permitted to
disclose these agreements in sales and marketing publications. The Company
generates no revenues under these agreements. In return for certain marketing
related services during 2000, the Company issued warrants to purchase 29,603
shares of common stock with exercise prices ranging from $386.28 to $592.07.
Warrants to purchase 6,723 shares of common stock vested immediately and the
remaining warrants vest dependent upon various installation and usage
milestones, which vary by agreement. During 2000 and 2001, the Company recorded
$2,903 and $324, respectively, as warrant expense related to the warrants that
vested. The remaining warrants to purchase 22,880 shares, which vest dependent
upon installation and usage milestones, will be recorded as warrant expense at
the fair value on the dates the milestones are achieved in accordance with EITF
No. 96-18.

  CUSTOMERS AND RESELLERS

     During March 2000, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 1,501 shares of
common stock at an exercise price of $386.28 per share to a customer. This
warrant was immediately exercisable and expires four years from the date of
grant. It is exercisable for a period of four years. The fair value of this
warrant of $437 has been recorded as warrant expense in 2000 in accordance with
EITF No. 96-18, because no revenue was generated from the related customer. In
March 2000, the Company also granted a warrant to purchase 3,753 shares of
common stock to a potential customer at an exercise price of $999. The warrant
is exercisable upon entering into a private label site agreement. The warrant is
not currently exercisable.

     In January 2001, the Company granted a warrant to purchase 37,537 shares of
common stock to a reseller of the Company's products. This warrant is
exercisable until the earlier of 12 months after termination of the agreement
with the reseller or the closing date of a merger or consolidation of the
Company with or into any other entity. The warrant was exercisable for 3,753
shares as of the date of grant. The Company has recorded $647 as warrant expense
related to this warrant. The remaining 33,784 shares of common stock are to vest
based on performance targets. As of December 31, 2001, warrants to purchase
3,002 of the remaining shares had vested, resulting in a $47 reduction in
revenue and $83 of warrant expense. To the extent the Company generates revenue
under the agreement with this reseller, the fair value of the warrant as it
vests will continue to be recorded as a reduction of revenue. These warrants
will be recorded at fair value on the date the performance targets are met.

  DEBT

     In conjunction with certain bridge loans issued in July and August of 2000,
the Company issued warrants to purchase 11,257 shares of common stock at an
exercise price of $266.40 per share. The fair value of these warrants of $1,942
was initially recorded as a debt discount and then amortized as interest expense
upon the conversion of the notes to equity in October 2000.
                                       F-28

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     In conjunction with the bridge loans issued in September and November of
2001 (Note 6), the Company issued warrants to purchase 9,382 shares of common
stock and 75,000 shares of Series E-1 preferred stock at exercise prices of
$39.96 per share and $4.00 per share, respectively. The fair value of these
warrants of $1,161 was initially recorded as a debt discount and then amortized
as interest expense upon the conversion of the notes to equity in December 2001.

     On December 31, 2001, the Company issued warrants to purchase 570,874
shares of Series F preferred stock to Iris Graphics in connection with a note
payable (Note 8). The fair value of these warrants of $2,283 has been recorded
as a debt discount and will be amortized as interest expense over the repayment
term using the interest method.

  OTHER

     In March 2000, the Company issued warrants to purchase 1,250 shares and
1,501 shares of common stock to an advertising agency and a law firm,
respectively, for services. These warrants vested immediately at exercise prices
of $999 and $386.28, respectively. They are exercisable for a period of four
years. In accordance with EITF No. 96-18, the fair values of these warrants of
$501 and $437 were recorded to sales and marketing expense and general and
administrative expense, respectively, in 2000.

     In April 2000, the Company also issued warrants to purchase 375 shares of
common stock to an equipment manufacturer in return for equipment discounts and
a comarketing agreement. These warrants became exercisable upon the initial
public offering (Note 2) of the Company's stock at the initial public offering
price per share. The Company recognized $1 of sales and marketing expense
associated with this transaction.

     In March 2001, the Company granted warrants to purchase 50,000 shares of
Series E-1 preferred stock to a broker in connection with the issuance of Series
E-1 preferred stock. The fair value of these warrants of $168 has been recorded
as stock issuance cost.

     On February 5, 2002, the Company granted a warrant to purchase 3,378 shares
of common stock to a software provider. The warrant became exercisable upon the
initial public offering of the Company's common stock at the initial public
offering price per share. The Company recognized $25 of sales and marketing
expense associated with this transaction.

  FAIR VALUE

     The fair values of all the warrants described above were estimated using
the Black-Scholes valuation model with the following assumptions: volatility of
1.0, no expected dividend yield, risk-free interest rates of 3.22% to 5.09%, and
an estimated life of three to ten years.

preferred stock warrants were exercised during 2001. In association with the
initial public offering (Note 2), the 125,000 Series E-1 warrants were converted
into 33,817 common shares.

15.  DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

     The Company has a 401(k) Retirement Plan (the Plan) which covers
substantially all eligible employees. The Plan is a defined contribution profit
sharing plan in which all eligible participants may elect to have a percentage
of their compensation contributed to the Plan, subject to certain guidelines
issued by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company may contribute to the Plan
at the discretion of the Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2000 and 2001,
the Plan held 83,385 shares and 83,294 shares, respectively, of the Company's
Series A-1 preferred stock. The holder of the stock under the Plan had an option
to put the stock to the Company at the then current fair value during August and
February of each year. However, the Company reserves the right not to purchase
any shares of Series A-1 preferred stock if the purchase, in the reasonable
discretion of the Company, could have an adverse affect on the Company's
financial position. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had recorded a stock
purchase plan liability of $125, equal to the fair value of the stock held by
the Plan. In association with the initial public offering (Note 2), the
outstanding shares of Series A-1 preferred stock were converted into common
stock. During 2002, the Company purchased 1,222 shares for a total purchase
price of $122. As of December 31, 2002, the Plan held 29 shares of the Company's
common stock. As of December 31, 2002, the remaining liability related to shares
in the Plan is immaterial. To date, the Company has not made any cash
contributions to the Plan.

16.  RESTRUCTURING CHARGE

     In September 2000, the Company announced a strategic restructuring to
consolidate certain redundant tasks related to the acquisitions completed during
2000. The plan of restructuring approved by the board of directors resulted in a
restructuring charge of $1,185. This restructuring charge consisted primarily of
severance benefits and costs related to the termination of 78 employees during
the period from September through December 2000.

     In May 2001, the Company announced a restructuring that primarily related
to the consolidation of certain client support operations into existing
facilities, resulting in a restructuring charge of $2,098. The plan included
terminations of 45 employees and the reduction of leased office space.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     In August 2002, the Company announced a restructuring effecting an
organizational realignment of its product management customer service and
support operations. This resulted in a restructuring charge of $525 in the
quarter ended September 30, 2002. This charge consisted primarily of severance

17.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     On November 8, 1999 and December 22, 1999, promissory notes in the amount
of $1,714 were received by the Company in conjunction with the sale of 58,678
shares of common stock. The notes bear interest at the annual rate of 6% and are
due on November 7, 2004. In the event the value of the stock is insufficient to
pay the full amount due under the notes, the Company may seek reimbursement from
the borrower for any deficiency up to 30% of the original balance of the note
plus accrued interest. The notes receivable are included in stockholders' equity
on the accompanying balance sheet. During 2000, $335 (including interest of $86)
was repaid in exchange for cash of $61 and a note payable of $274. During 2001,
$1,112 (including interest of $63) was repaid by a Company executive utilizing
proceeds he received from the sale of his common stock to certain preferred
stockholders. Additionally, during 2000, 2001 and 2002, approximately $86, $90
and 18, respectively, was recorded as interest income. As of December 31, 2002,
the Company recorded a valuation adjustment of approximately $393 to adjust the
fair value of the non-recourse portion of the notes receivable balance.

     On April 26, 2001, the Company entered into a secured promissory note with
a Company executive for $642 plus interest at the annual rate of 4.58%. The note
matured October 5, 2001 and was secured by 6,422 shares of common stock owned by
the executive. During 2001, the Company took possession of these shares in
satisfaction of this note. The fair value of the shares on the date that the
loan was provided and the date that the loan matured was approximately $642. In
addition, the Company repaid an unsecured promissory note issued to the same
executive in April 2001 in the original principal amount of $99.

     The Company has also issued notes to related parties (Note 9) and entered
into various leases with related parties (Note 10).

     In February 2000, the Company entered into a strategic alliance agreement,
which was restated in December 2001, with Creo, Inc (Creo), a stockholder. As
part of the alliance, the Company signed a

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

comprehensive services agreement. During 2001 and 2002, $61 and $1,
respectively, were paid as commissions under the agreement.

18.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     On January 21, 2003, the Company received notification from Creo, one of
its stockholders, that Creo had entered into private, binding agreements to
acquire an additional 2.6 million shares of the Company's outstanding common
stock ("Common Stock") for $1.30 per share increasing its ownership from
approximately 30% to approximately 55% of the outstanding Common Stock. In
connection with these transactions, Creo presented the Company an unsolicited
offer to purchase all of the remaining outstanding shares of Common Stock for
$1.30 per share.

     On January 22, 2003, the Company received an unsolicited offer from
Electronics for Imaging, Inc. ("EFI"), an unrelated party, to purchase all of
the outstanding shares of Common Stock for $2.60 per share.

     Also, on January 22, 2003, the Company's Board of Directors ("Board")
appointed a Special Committee ("Special Committee") of the Board to consider its
strategic alternatives, including the two outstanding offers for the acquisition
of the Company. On January 31, 2003, the Special Committee announced it had
selected a financial advisor to assist in their review of the various
alternatives.

     On February 13, 2003, the Special Committee adopted a Stockholders Rights
Agreement (the "Rights Agreement") pursuant to which dividend distribution of
one Right on each outstanding share of Common Stock was declared. The Rights
become exercisable if a person or group of affiliated or associated persons
acquires beneficial ownership of 30% or more of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock and other voting securities (the "Voting Securities") of the Company or
announces a tender offer or exchange offer for 15 percent or more of the
outstanding Voting Securities. The Board of Directors is entitled to redeem the
Rights at $.001 per Right at any time before any such person or affiliated group
thereafter acquires beneficial ownership of 30% or more of the outstanding
Voting Securities. If a person or affiliated group hereafter acquires beneficial
ownership of 30% or more of the outstanding Voting Securities of the Company (an
"Acquiring Person"), each Right will entitle its holder, except any such
Acquiring Person whose Rights shall become null and void, to purchase, at an
exercise price of $6.80 per share (subject to adjustment in certain events), a
number of shares of Common Stock having a market value at that time of twice the
Right's exercise price. Subject to certain exceptions, existing stockholders
that would otherwise become Acquiring Persons upon adoption of the Rights
Agreement are considered "Grandfathered Stockholders" and are not Acquiring
Persons, unless after such date they acquire beneficial ownership of additional
Voting Securities or exercise a contractual right to acquire Voting Securities
or enter into a new agreement to acquire or vote Voting Securities beneficially
owned by them. Before any such Acquiring Person shall become the beneficial
owner of 75% or more of the total voting power of the aggregate of all shares of
Voting Securities then outstanding, the Board may exchange each Right (other
than Rights that previously have become void as described above) in whole or in
part, at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock per Right (subject to
adjustment in certain events). If the Company is acquired in a merger or other
business combination transaction after a Person or group of affiliated or
associated Persons acquires beneficial ownership of 30% or more of the Company's
outstanding Voting Securities, each Right (except Rights that previously have
been voided as described above) will entitle its holder to purchase, at the
Right's then-current exercise price, a number of shares of the common stock or
other equity interest of the ultimate parent of such acquiring entity having a
market value at that time of twice the Right's exercise price.

     The dividend distribution is payable to stockholders of record on February
14, 2003. The Rights will expire in ten years.

     On February 13, 2003, the Company entered into the following three
agreements with EFI: a letter agreement that places certain restrictions on the
Company's ability to take actions in order to facilitate a business combination
with an entity other than EFI; a stock option agreement granting EFI an option
to purchase up to 2,126,574 shares of Common Stock at a purchase price equal to
$2.60 per share; and a standby
                                       F-32

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

credit facility in the amount of $11,000 plus a working capital facility which
will provide up to an additional $3,000 under certain circumstances.

     Printcafe entered into the EFI letter agreement and the option agreement in
order to induce EFI to provide Printcafe with the standby credit facility.
Subject to certain conditions, the Company has agreed under the terms of the EFI
agreement not to, among other things, solicit any takeover proposal, participate
in any discussions or negotiate regarding any takeover proposal, or enter into
any merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option or similar agreement with a
third party. The agreement specifies that the Company cannot solicit other
offers but may respond to a bona fide written offer that is superior to the EFI
proposal.

     The Company has also granted to EFI an option to purchase up to 2,126,574
shares of Common Stock at a purchase price equal to $2.60 per share. Provided
that EFI is not in breach of its obligations under the standby credit agreement,
EFI may exercise the option at any time, in whole or in part. The option will
terminate on December 31, 2007. Subject to certain conditions, the option shares
must be repurchased by the Company, at the request of EFI, at a price equal to
the aggregate purchase price paid for such shares by EFI. In addition, subject
to certain conditions, the Company may repurchase from EFI the option shares at
a price equal to the price paid by EFI for those shares.

     Under the terms of the standby credit facility, EFI is obligated to
disburse up to $11,000 to the Company in the event that certain amounts under
the Company's existing credit facilities become due and payable as a result of
any action taken by the Company in order to facilitate the proposed business
combination with EFI or certain other criteria. All loans made under this
facility bear interest at the rate of 8% per annum payable on January 2, 2004.
With a certain exception, the maturity date would be accelerated if a business
combination with EFI is not consummated on or before June 30, 2003 or upon the
termination of the agreement. Subject to certain conditions, the credit facility
also provides the Company with a working capital facility up to an aggregate
amount of $3,000 to be disbursed in the event that, among other things, the
Company's cash balance as of the close of business on the date notice is given
by the Company is less than $1,000. The Company is obligated to use the proceeds
of any exercise of the option agreement to pay down outstanding amounts under
the standby credit facility. All loans under the working capital facility bear
interest at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate as published, from time to
time, by Citibank, plus two percent payable on the maturity date of the loans.

     On February 19, 2003 Creo initiated legal action in the State of Delaware
against the Special Committee and certain members of the Company's Board of
Directors. Creo initially sought a temporary restraining order with respect to
the Rights Agreement and the three Agreements with EFI. On February 21, 2003,
the temporary restraining order was denied by the Delaware court. This
litigation is still pending and the Company cannot predict the eventual outcome
at this time.

     On February 26, 2003 the Company and EFI entered into a merger agreement
providing for EFI's acquisition of the Company for $2.60 per share for each
outstanding share of the Company's stock. The merger is subject to regulatory
review and stockholder approval by the Company's stockholders.

             INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED
                         COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements
are presented to illustrate the effects of the merger on the historical
financial position and operating results of EFI. The unaudited pro forma
condensed combined balance sheet gives effect to the merger as if it was
completed on September 30, 2002. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined
statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 and for
the year ended December 31, 2001 give effect to the merger as if it was
completed on January 1, 2001.

     The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements
were derived from (a) EFI's audited statement of income for the year ended
December 31, 2001, its unaudited statement of income for the nine months ended
September 30, 2002 and its unaudited balance sheet as of September 30, 2002,
each of which is incorporated by reference into this document; and (b)
Printcafe's audited statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2001
included in this document, and Printcafe's unaudited statement of operations for
the nine months ended September 30, 2002, which is not included in this
document, and Printcafe's unaudited balance sheet as of September 30, 2002,
which is not included in this document. Printcafe's unaudited financial
statements were, however, included in its quarterly report for the quarter ended
September 30, 2002, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
See "Where to Find More Information on page   ."

     The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements
are not necessarily indicative of EFI's financial position or results of
operations if the merger had been completed as of the dates indicated.
Additionally, the following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements are not necessarily indicative of EFI's future financial condition or
operating results.

     The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements
are based on estimates and assumptions set forth in the notes to these
statements. These estimates and assumptions are preliminary and have been made
solely for the purpose of developing these unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial statements. EFI intends to obtain an independent valuation to
be used as a basis to evaluate Printcafe's intangible assets in order to make
its final allocation of the purchase price for Printcafe. Those final
allocations may be materially different than the amounts shown in the following
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements.

NOTE 1  DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     On February 26, 2003, EFI and Printcafe signed a merger agreement providing
for the acquisition of Printcafe for $2.60 per share for each outstanding
Printcafe share of common stock. The merger agreement provides each Printcafe
stockholder with the right to elect whether to receive the merger consideration
in cash or shares of EFI's common stock. Following completion of the merger, EFI
currently plans to buy back approximately the same number of shares of its
common stock issued in connection with the merger. The merger agreement contains
customary conditions to closing and may be terminated by each party under
certain conditions, including a superior proposal for Printcafe. The transaction
must be approved by Printcafe's stockholders and is expected to close in the
second calendar quarter of 2003.

NOTE 2  PURCHASE PRICE

     Printcafe's stockholders may elect to receive cash or shares of EFI common
stock in the merger. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements were prepared assuming that approximately 50% of Printcafe's
stockholders will elect to receive shares of EFI common stock in connection with
the merger. The earnings per share amounts in the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial statements were prepared using an exchange ratio of 0.1967
shares of EFI common stock for each share of Printcafe common stock. The
exchange ratio was derived as follows:

(A)  Consideration per share of Printcafe common stock...........   $  2.60
(B)  52-week low price of EFI's common stock.....................   $ 13.22
(C)  Assumed exchange ratio (A / B)..............................    0.1967
(D)  5,300 Printcafe shares of common stock outstanding as of
     September 30, 2002 multiplied by the assumed exchange of
     0.1967 multiplied by stock price of $13.22..................   $13,780

     The actual exchange ratio will be the average closing price of EFI's common
stock for the ten consecutive trading days ending on and including the fifth
trading day before the special meeting of Printcafe's stockholders to vote on a
proposal to adopt the merger agreement. The actual percentage of Printcafe's
stockholders receiving shares of EFI common stock in connection with the merger
will be determined based on the number of valid elections received by EFI before
the election deadline, which is the business day immediately before the date of
the special meeting of Printcafe's stockholders. If 100% of Printcafe's common
stockholders elect to take cash consideration for their Printcafe common stock,
the total cash consideration would increase to approximately $27,560 from the
$13,780 amount used in the preparation of the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial statements.

     If 100% of Printcafe's common stockholders elect to take EFI common stock
as consideration for their Printcafe common stock, the total EFI shares issued
in conjunction with the merger would increase to approximately 2,084 from the
1,042 amount used in the preparation of the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial statements. EFI intends to initiate a stock repurchase
program to offset any dilution associated with the merger.

NOTE 3  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT CLASSIFICATION

     Upon completion of the merger, EFI and Printcafe will review their

review, it may become necessary to make certain reclassifications to the
combined company's financial statements to conform to those accounting policies
and classifications.

NOTE 4  PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

amortization for EFI through December 31, 2001. Effective January 1, 2002, the

NOTE 5

     On February 13, 2003, EFI and Printcafe entered into the following three
agreements:

     1) A standby credit facility in the amount of $11,000 plus a working
        capital facility which will provide up to an additional $3,000 under
        certain circumstances. EFI is obligated under the standby credit
        facility to disburse to Printcafe up to $11,000 in the event that
        certain amounts under Printcafe's existing credit facilities become due
        and payable as a result of any action taken by Printcafe in order to
        facilitate the proposed business combination with EFI. All loans made
        under this facility bear interest at the rate of 8% per annum payable on
        January 2, 2004 or sooner upon the termination of this agreement. With a
        certain exception, the maturity date would be accelerated if a business
        combination with EFI is not consummated on or before June 30, 2003.
        Subject to certain conditions, the credit facility also provides
        Printcafe with a working capital facility up to an aggregate amount of
        $3,000 to be disbursed to Printcafe in the event that, among other
        things, Printcafe's cash balance (as of the close of business on the
        date notice is given by Printcafe) is less than $1,000. Printcafe is
        obligated to use the proceeds of any exercise of the option agreement to
        pay down outstanding amounts under the standby credit facility. All
        loans under the working capital facility bear interest at a rate per
        annum equal to the prime rate as published, from time to time, by
        Citibank, plus two percent payable and are on January 2, 2004 or sooner
        upon the termination of the credit agreement. There are currently no
        borrowings under this credit agreement.

     2) Printcafe granted to EFI an option to purchase up to approximately 2,127
        shares of Printcafe common stock at a purchase price equal to $2.60 per
        share. Provided that EFI is not in breach of its obligations under the
        standby credit agreement, EFI may exercise the option at any time, in
        whole or in part. The option will terminate on December 31, 2007.
        Subject to certain conditions, the option shares must be repurchased by
        Printcafe, at the request of EFI, at a price equal to the aggregate
        purchase price paid for such shares by EFI. In addition, subject to
        certain conditions, Printcafe may repurchase from EFI the option shares
        at a price equal to the price paid by EFI for those shares. To date EFI
        has not exercised this option, but may do so in the future.

     3) A letter agreement that places certain restrictions on Printcafe's
        ability to take actions in order to facilitate a business combination
        with a party other than EFI. Printcafe's obligations under this
        agreement were superceded by the merger agreement.

The agreements were entered into in connection with EFI's proposal to acquire
all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Printcafe at a purchase price
equal to $2.60 per share, payable in cash or EFI stock.
