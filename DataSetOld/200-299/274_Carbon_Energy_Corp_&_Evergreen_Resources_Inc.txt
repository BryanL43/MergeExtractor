Special Meeting of Shareholders    

    MERGER PROPOSALYOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT    

        The Board of Directors of Carbon Energy Corporation has unanimously approved a merger in which Carbon will become a subsidiary of Evergreen Resources, Inc. 

In the merger, you will receive 0.275 shares of Evergreen common stock for each share of Carbon common stock that you own plus cash instead of any fractional
share.

        Evergreen
common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "EVG." On March 28, 2003, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the merger, the
closing price of Evergreen common stock was $45.40. On                        , 2003, the latest practicable date prior to the
printing of this document, the closing price of Evergreen common stock was
$            . Based on the 0.275 exchange ratio and the closing price of Evergreen common stock on March 28, the implied value of the merger consideration was approximately $12.485 per
share, and the implied transaction value was approximately $84,300,000 based on the implied value of the merger consideration and the number of shares of Carbon common stock outstanding on that date.
Based on the 0.275 exchange ratio and the closing price of Evergreen common stock on                        , the implied dollar
value of the merger consideration was approximately $            per share,
and the implied transaction value was approximately $            based on that value and the number of shares of Carbon common stock outstanding on that date. Evergreen expects to issue
approximately 1,691,339 shares of common stock in the merger, which will represent approximately 8% of the outstanding Evergreen common stock immediately after the merger. 

        The
price of Evergreen common stock will fluctuate prior to completion of the merger. As explained in more detail in this proxy statement/prospectus, the merger does not include a
price-based termination right or other protection against declines in the market price of Evergreen common stock, and Carbon has not obtained an updated fairness opinion from its financial advisor.
Carbon shareholders do not have the right to seek an appraisal of the value of their Carbon shares in the merger. 

You generally will not recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes on your receipt of the Evergreen common stock. However, Evergreen will pay cash
instead of issuing fractional shares of common stock in the merger, and you generally will recognize gain or loss on any cash you receive instead of a fractional share.  

        At the meeting, you will consider and vote on the merger. 
The merger cannot be completed unless holders of at least a majority of the
shares of Carbon common stock entitled to vote, voting as a single class, approve the merger. Carbon's Board of Directors believes the merger is in the best interests of Carbon's shareholders and
recommends that the shareholders vote to approve it.
 No vote of Evergreen shareholders is required to approve the merger. 

        Yorktown
Energy Partners III, L.P. and I have agreed to vote our shares of Carbon's common stock for approval of the merger. Yorktown and I own 73.2% and 3.8%, respectively, of Carbon's
outstanding common stock. 

The special meeting will be held at                    .m., Mountain Daylight Time,
on                        , 2003
at                        .

        This proxy statement/prospectus provides you with detailed information about the proposed merger. We encourage you to read this entire document carefully. 

        YOU
SHOULD CAREFULLY READ THE "RISK FACTORS" SECTION BEGINNING ON PAGE     . 

        Your vote is very important.
    Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting, please take the time to vote by completing and
mailing the enclosed proxy card to us. 
If you fail to return your proxy card and fail to vote in person, the effect will be the same as a vote against the
merger.

On behalf of the Board of Directors of Carbon, I urge you to vote "FOR" approval of the merger.

Patrick
R. McDonald

President and Chief Executive Officer

SUMMARY    

        This summary highlights selected information from this proxy statement/prospectus and may not contain all of the information that is important to you. To
understand the merger fully and for a more complete description of the legal terms of the merger, you should read carefully this entire document and the documents to which we refer you. See "Where You
Can Find More Information" on page     . 

You Will Receive 0.275 Shares of Evergreen Stock for Each Share of Carbon Stock    

        If the merger is completed, you will receive 0.275 shares of Evergreen common stock for each outstanding share of Carbon common stock you own plus cash instead of
any fractional share of Evergreen common stock that would otherwise be issued. 

        Please
do not send your Carbon common stock certificate until after receipt of written instructions following completion of the merger. See "What You Need to Do Now." 

        The
table below shows the closing prices of Evergreen common stock and Carbon common stock and the implied dollar value of the merger consideration on March 26, 2003 (the last
date on which Carbon common stock was traded on the American Stock Exchange before public announcement of the merger), March 28, 2003 (the last full trading day on the New York Stock Exchange
before public announcement of the merger) and on                        , 2003. The implied dollar value of the merger
consideration is calculated by multiplying Evergreen's per share closing price on the
applicable date by the exchange ratio of 0.275, which is the number of shares of Evergreen common stock that you would receive in the merger for each share of Carbon common stock you own.

        Because
the 0.275 exchange ratio is fixed but the market price of Evergreen will fluctuate prior to the merger, the pro forma equivalent price for Carbon common stock will also fluctuate
prior to the merger, and you will not know the final implied dollar value of the merger consideration when you vote upon on the merger. Evergreen common stock is trade on the New York Stock Exchange
under the symbol "EVG." Carbon common stock is traded on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol "CRB." You should obtain current stock price quotations from a newspaper, the Internet or your
broker. We urge you to obtain information on the market value of Evergreen and Carbon common stock that is more recent than that provided in this proxy statement/prospectus. 

You Will Not Be Subject to Federal Income Tax on Shares Received in the Merger (Page     )    

        Neither company is required to complete the merger unless it receives a legal opinion from Evergreen's legal counsel, dated as of the closing date, to the effect
that, based on specified facts, representations and assumptions, the merger will be treated as a "reorganization" for federal income tax purposes. Therefore, it is expected that, for federal income
tax purposes, you generally will not recognize any gain or loss on the conversion of shares of Carbon common stock into shares of Evergreen common stock. You will be taxed, however, if you receive any
cash instead of any fractional share of Evergreen common stock that would otherwise be issued. 
Tax matters are complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger may vary
among shareholders.
 We urge you to contact your own tax advisor to understand fully how the merger will affect you. 

Evergreen Does Not Expect to Pay Dividends Following the Merger    

        Evergreen has not declared or paid and does not anticipate declaring or paying any dividends on its common stock in the near future. Any future determination as
to the declaration and payment of dividends will be at the discretion of Evergreen's Board of Directors and will depend on then existing conditions, including Evergreen's financial condition, results
of operations, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and such other factors as the Board deems relevant. 

Carbon's Board of Directors Unanimously Recommends Shareholder Approval (Page     )    

        The Carbon Board of Directors believes that the merger is in the best interests of Carbon shareholders and unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" approval of
the merger agreement and the related plan of merger. The Carbon Board believes that, as a result of the merger, you will be able to achieve greater value on a long term basis than you would if Carbon
remained independent. 

        Yorktown
Energy Partners III, L.P., which owns 73.2% of Carbon's outstanding common stock, and Patrick R. McDonald, who owns directly or indirectly 3.8% of Carbon's outstanding common
stock, have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the merger. 

Carbon's Board Received a Fairness Opinion from RBC Dain Rauscher Inc. (Page     )    

        Carbon's financial advisor, RBC Dain Rauscher Inc., or RBC, has given an opinion to the Carbon Board that, as of March 31, 2003 (the date the merger
agreement was executed), the exchange ratio in the merger was fair from a financial point of view to you as holders of Carbon common stock. The full text of this opinion is attached as
Appendix B to this proxy statement/prospectus. We encourage you to read the opinion carefully to understand the assumptions made, matters considered and limitations of the review undertaken by
RBC in rendering its fairness opinion. The opinion of RBC will not be updated prior to closing and does not reflect changes in circumstances after the signing of the merger agreement. Carbon has
agreed to pay a fee of $500,000 to RBC for advisory services in connection with the potential merger with Evergreen. At the time this proxy statement/prospectus is mailed to you, Carbon has paid
$300,000 to RBC as a fee for the fairness opinion delivered to the Carbon Board on March 31, 2003. The fairness opinion fee was payable upon delivery of the opinion without regard to whether
the merger is completed but will be credited against the transaction fee mentioned above. Carbon will pay RBC the balance of $200,000 at the time the merger is completed. Carbon has also agreed to
reimburse RBC for reasonable expenses and to indemnify RBC and related parties against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising out of its engagement. 

You Do Not Have Dissent and Appraisal Rights (Page     )    

        You do not have the right to dissent from the merger and demand an appraisal of the fair value of your shares in connection with the merger. 

Special Meeting to Approve Merger to be Held                        , 2003
(Page     )    

        Carbon will hold the special meeting at              .m., Mountain Daylight Time,
on                        , 2003
at                        located at
                        . At the meeting, you will vote on the merger agreement and the plan of merger, the proposal to adjourn
the special meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies to approve the
matters being voted upon at the meeting and any other business that properly arises.

acquisition of unconventional natural gas properties. Evergreen is one of the leading developers of coal bed methane reserves in the United States. Its current operations are principally focused on

As a Result of the Merger, Carbon Will Become a Subsidiary of Evergreen (Page     )    

        In the merger, Evergreen's merger subsidiary will merge into Carbon, and Carbon will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Evergreen. If the Carbon shareholders
approve the merger agreement and the plan of merger at the special meeting, we currently expect to complete the merger in the third quarter of 2003. 

        We
have included the merger agreement as Appendix A to this proxy statement/prospectus. We encourage you to read the merger agreement in full, as it is the legal document that
governs the merger. 

Majority Shareholder Vote Required to Approve the Merger (Page     )    

        Approval of the merger agreement and the plan of merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Carbon
common stock entitled to vote, voting as a single class. If you fail to vote or abstain, it will have the effect of a vote against the merger agreement and the plan of merger. At the record date, the
directors and executive officers of Carbon and their affiliates together owned about 81.8% of the outstanding Carbon common stock entitled to vote at the meeting. Yorktown Energy Partners III, L.P.,
the largest shareholder of Carbon, and Patrick R. McDonald, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the merger. 

        Brokers
who hold shares of Carbon stock as nominees will not have authority to vote those shares on the merger unless the beneficial owners of those shares provide voting instructions.
If you hold your shares in street name, please see the voting form provided by your broker for additional information regarding the voting of your shares. If your shares are not registered in your
name, you will need additional documentation from your record holder to vote the shares in person. 

        The
merger does not require the approval of Evergreen's shareholders. 

Record Date Set at                        , 2003; One Vote per Share of Carbon Stock
(Page     )    

        If you owned shares of Carbon common stock at the close of business
on                        , 2003, the record date, you are entitled to vote on the merger agreement,
the plan of merger, the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies to approve the matters being voted upon at the meeting and any other matters that may be
properly considered at the meeting. 

        On
the record date, there were                        shares of Carbon common stock outstanding. At the meeting, you will have one
vote for each share of Carbon common stock that you owned on
the record date. 

Certain Interests of Carbon Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger Differ From Your Interests (Page     )    

        Some of Carbon's directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that differ from, or are in addition to, the interests of other Carbon
shareholders. These interests include acceleration of vesting of stock-based awards upon a change of control under benefit and compensation plans maintained by Carbon and, in the case of certain key
employees and executive officers of Carbon, severance benefits payable to the employee upon termination in the event of a change in control under existing employment agreements with Carbon. The Carbon
Board of Directors was aware of these and other interests and considered them when it approved and adopted the merger agreement. 

        Employment Agreements.
    In 1999, Carbon entered into an employment agreement with Patrick R. McDonald
providing for Mr. McDonald to serve as Carbon's President and Chief Executive Officer. This employment agreement was renewed in October 2002 with a new three-year employment agreement
containing similar terms. Either Carbon or Mr. McDonald may terminate the agreement if there is a change in control of Carbon, which includes shareholder approval of the merger. In the event of
a change in control supported by the Carbon Board of Directors, Mr. McDonald is to be paid 300% of his average annual compensation for the prior three years upon termination of the employment
agreement by Mr. McDonald or Carbon. In addition, the employment agreement provides that any outstanding stock options and incentive awards granted to Mr. McDonald will become 100%
vested, without any restrictions, upon a change in control. 

        Carbon
has also entered into an employment agreement with Kevin D. Struzeski providing for Mr. Struzeski to serve as Carbon's Chief Financial Officer. The employment agreement
provides that either Carbon or Mr. Struzeski may terminate the agreement if there is a change in control of Carbon, which includes shareholder approval of the merger. In the event of a change
in control supported by the Carbon Board of Directors, Mr. Struzeski is to be paid 200% of his average annual compensation for the prior two years upon termination of his employment agreement
by Carbon or 100% of his average annual compensation upon termination of his employment by him. In addition, the employment agreement provides that any outstanding stock options and incentive awards
granted to Mr. Struzeski will become 100% vested, without any restrictions, upon a change in control. 

        Carbon
has entered into employment agreements with six other employees, including three Canadian employees. These agreements provide for severance benefits in the event of a change in
control of Carbon followed by termination of the employee's employment. The severance benefits range from 100% to 200% of the employee's average annual compensation for the prior two years upon
termination of employment following a change in control supported by the Board of Directors. The agreements also provide that upon a change in control, any outstanding stock options and incentive
awards granted to the employee will become 100% vested, without restrictions. 

        Voting Agreements.
    Evergreen has entered into voting agreements with each of Yorktown Energy
Partners, III, L.P. and Mr. McDonald, pursuant to which Yorktown and Mr. McDonald have agreed to vote their shares in favor of adoption and approval of the merger agreement and against
any action that could delay, postpone or impair completion of the merger. Yorktown and Mr. McDonald have also agreed not to transfer or dispose of their shares prior to the effective date of
the merger or termination of the merger agreement. 

        Registration Rights Agreement.
    Pursuant to a registration rights agreement, Evergreen has agreed to
file a registration statement with the SEC within 45 days after the date the merger becomes effective 

to
register for one year the resale of the Evergreen shares to be received in the merger by Yorktown and its limited partners and Mr. McDonald and his related entities. 

        Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers.
    The merger agreement provides that for three
years after the merger becomes effective Evergreen or one of its subsidiaries will maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance covering directors and officers of Carbon for acts or omissions
occurring before the merger becomes effective. The insurance will provide at least the same coverage and amounts as contained in Carbon's policy on the date of the merger agreement, subject to certain
limits on the premiums that Evergreen will be required to pay. Evergreen has also agreed to indemnify all individuals who are or have been officers, directors or employees of Carbon or a Carbon
subsidiary before the merger becomes effective from any acts or omissions in such capacities before the merger
becomes effective to the extent such indemnification is permitted by Carbon's governing documents and applicable law. 

        The
material terms and financial provisions of these arrangements are described under the heading "Interests of Carbon's Directors and Officers in the Merger" on
page     . 

Evergreen Will Assume Carbon Stock Options and Restricted Stock Awards (Page     )    

        When the merger is completed, outstanding options to purchase Carbon common stock granted to Carbon employees and directors under Carbon's equity-based plans will
be assumed by Evergreen and become options in respect of Evergreen common stock (or substitute options to acquire Evergreen common stock will be granted). The number of shares subject to these options
and the exercise price thereof will be adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio. In addition, upon approval of the merger agreement by the shareholders of Carbon, all outstanding and unvested Carbon
stock options will vest and become immediately exercisable. 

        In
addition, the executive officers and certain employees of Carbon have received grants of restricted stock awards. All restricted stock outstanding under Carbon's plan becomes fully
vested upon a change in control, which includes shareholder approval of the merger agreement. 

Certain Conditions Must Be Satisfied for the Merger to Occur (Page     )    

        A number of conditions must be met for us to complete the merger, including, but not limited to: 


approval
of the merger agreement by the Carbon shareholders;


receipt
of the opinion of Evergreen's counsel that the merger will constitute a reorganization under Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and that
Carbon shareholders will not recognize gain or loss to the extent they exchange their Carbon common stock for Evergreen common stock;


the
continuing accuracy of the parties' representations in the merger agreement;


the
continuing effectiveness of the registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") covering the shares of Evergreen common stock to be
issued in the merger;


the
shares of Evergreen common stock issuable pursuant to the merger agreement shall have been approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange; and


none
of Carbon's properties and assets shall have suffered a casualty loss or have been taken in condemnation such that, when considered with any inaccurate representations
and warranties, there is a material adverse effect on Carbon after taking into account proceeds of insurance and any condemnation award. 

The Merger Agreement May Be Terminated or Amended Under Certain Circumstances (Page     )    

        Evergreen and Carbon can mutually agree at any time to terminate the merger agreement without completing the merger. Either company can also unilaterally
terminate the merger agreement if: 


the
merger is not completed by October 31, 2003;


the
shareholders of Carbon do not approve the merger;


any
condition that must be satisfied to complete the merger cannot be satisfied or fulfilled prior to the closing date;


the
other company violates, in a material way, any of its representations, warranties or obligations under the merger agreement and the violation is not cured in a timely
fashion; or


any
of the required regulatory approvals are denied, and the time period for appeals and requests for reconsideration have expired. 

        Generally,
the party seeking to terminate because a condition cannot be satisfied or fulfilled cannot itself be in violation of the merger agreement in a way that would allow the other
party to terminate. 

        Evergreen
and Carbon can agree to amend the merger agreement in any way, except that after the shareholders' meeting we cannot decrease the consideration that Carbon shareholders will
receive in the merger. Either company can waive any of the requirements of the other company contained in the merger agreement, except that neither company can waive any required regulatory approval. 

Carbon Could Be Required to Pay a Termination Fee to Evergreen (Page     )    

        Carbon will be required to pay Evergreen a termination fee of $2,500,000 if the merger agreement is terminated: 


by
Evergreen or Carbon because Carbon's Board of Directors fails to recommend to Carbon's shareholders that they approve the merger, and Carbon's shareholders fail to
approve the merger;


by
Evergreen because Carbon breaches its non-solicitation covenant or its covenant to recommend that the Carbon shareholders approve the merger; or


by
Evergreen because Carbon has breached any of its representations, warranties or covenants under the merger agreement (other than the non-solicitation covenant
or its covenant to recommend that the Carbon shareholders approve the merger), the violation is not cured
in a timely fashion and Carbon has received notice of a competing proposal from a third party at the time of or prior to the breach.

There are Differences Between the Rights of Carbon's and Evergreen's Shareholders (Page             )    

        Both Evergreen and Carbon are governed by the Colorado Business Corporation Act (the "CBCA"). However, the rights of Carbon's shareholders are governed by
Carbon's articles of incorporation and bylaws, which differ from Evergreen's articles of incorporation and bylaws with respect to certain matters, including: 


Directors
may be removed from office under Evergreen's articles of incorporation and bylaws only for cause and only by the vote of 80% of the outstanding shares entitled to
vote in the election of directors, while directors may be removed from office under Carbon's articles of incorporation and bylaws with or without cause by a majority of votes cast at a special
shareholders meeting called for the purpose of the removal; and


Evergreen's
articles of incorporation and bylaws require the vote of 80% of the shares entitled to vote to approve an amendment to the provisions of the articles of
incorporation concerning the composition of the Board of Directors, while Carbon's articles of incorporation do not alter the
statutory requirement that a majority of the outstanding shares approve such an amendment to the articles of incorporation. 

        A
more complete discussion of the differences in rights of Evergreen and Carbon shareholders is set forth in "Comparison of the Rights of Evergreen and Carbon Shareholders" on
page     .

Selected Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information    

        The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information shows the pro forma effect of the proposed merger. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial information includes statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2002 and certain production and other data,
which assume the merger occurred on January 1, 2002. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information also includes certain balance sheet information as of March 31,
2003, which assumes the merger occurred on that date. 

        This
information is only a summary. You should read the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and the accompanying notes that are included in this document. You
should also read the historical information of Evergreen that is incorporated by reference into this document and for Carbon that is incorporated by reference in, and accompanies, this document. 

        We
are providing the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial and other data that is preliminary and is being furnished solely for information purposes. The pro forma information
does not purport to represent what the financial position and the results of operations of the combined company would have actually been had the proposed merger in fact occurred on the dates
indicated, nor is it necessarily indicative of the results of operations or financial position that may occur in the future. 

        The
information was prepared based on the fact that both Evergreen and Carbon use the full cost method of accounting for their oil and gas producing activities. We have not reflected as
an adjustment to the historical data any annual cost savings that may result from the merger. 

        No
pro forma adjustments have been made with respect to the following items. These items are reflected in the historical results of Evergreen and Carbon, as applicable, and should be
considered in reading the pro forma results: 


In
2002, Evergreen recognized a $51.5 million expense related to the impairment of its international properties.


In
2002, Carbon recognized a $13.2 million reduction to the carrying value of its oil and gas properties pursuant to the full cost ceiling test limitation.

A WARNING ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION    

        Evergreen and Carbon have each made forward-looking statements in this document and in other documents to which this document refers that are subject to risks and
uncertainties. These statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of the managements of Evergreen and Carbon and on information currently available to them or, in the case of information that
appears under the heading "The MergerBackground of and Reasons for the Merger" on page     , information that was available to the managements of Evergreen and Carbon as
of the date of the merger agreement, and should be read in connection with the notices about forward-looking statements made by Evergreen and Carbon in their reports filed with the SEC under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this document are forward-looking statements. Such statements address activities, events or
developments that Evergreen and Carbon expect, believe, project, intend or anticipate will or may occur, including such matters as future capital, development and exploration expenditures, reserve
estimates (including estimates of future net revenues associated with such reserves and the present value of such future net revenues), future production of oil and natural gas, business strategies,
expansion and growth of operations, cash flow and anticipated liquidity, prospect development and property acquisition, obtaining financial or industry partners for prospect or program development, or
marketing of oil and natural gas. See "Where You Can Find More Information" on page     . 

        Any
statements in this document about the anticipated effects of the merger and Evergreen's anticipated performance in future periods are subject to risks relating to, among other
things, the following possibilities: 


costs
or difficulties related to the integration of the business of Evergreen and its merger partners, including Carbon;


a
decline in natural gas prices;


incorrect
estimates of required capital expenditures;


increases
in the costs of drilling and completing wells and for gas gathering;


an
increase in the cost of production and operations;


an
inability to meet projections;


adverse
changes in the securities markets;

risks; and


regulatory
developments. 

        Management
of each of Evergreen and Carbon believes the forward-looking statements about its company are reasonable; however, shareholders of Carbon should not place undue reliance on
them. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The future results and shareholder values of Evergreen following completion of
the merger may differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. Many of the factors that will determine these results and values are beyond Evergreen's and
Carbon's ability to control or predict. 

        All
subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning the merger or other matters addressed in this document and attributable to Evergreen or Carbon or any person acting
on their behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Neither Evergreen nor Carbon undertakes any obligation to release
publicly any revisions to such forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 

RISK FACTORS    

        By electing to receive Evergreen's common stock, you will be subject to the risks of ownership of that security. You are urged to consider carefully the following
important risk factors, as well as those other risk factors that Evergreen has filed with the SEC and that are incorporated by reference into this document. 

Risks Related to the Merger    

        We may be unable to successfully integrate our operations, which could have an adverse effect on the business, results of operations,
financial condition or prospects of Evergreen after the merger.  

        To be successful after the merger, Evergreen and Carbon will need to combine and integrate the operations of their separate companies into one company. Evergreen
and Carbon could encounter difficulties in the integration process. Integration will require substantial management attention and could divert attention away from the
day-to-day business of the combined company. If Evergreen and Carbon cannot integrate their businesses successfully, they may fail to realize the benefits they expect from the
merger. See "The MergerBackground of and Reasons for the Merger." 

        Failure to consummate the merger could negatively impact Carbon and its business.  

        In order to complete the merger, Carbon must meet all merger conditions. If for any reason the merger does not occur, that failure could adversely affect Carbon's
business and make it difficult for Carbon to attract other acquisition partners. In addition, in the event the merger agreement is terminated, Carbon may be required to pay Evergreen a $2,500,000
termination fee. See "The MergerTermination Fee" beginning on page     . 

        Executive officers and directors of Carbon have potential conflicts of interest in their recommendation that Carbon shareholders vote for
approval of the merger.  

        When considering the recommendation of Carbon's Board of Directors, you should be aware that some executive officers and directors of Carbon have interests in the
merger that are somewhat different from your interests. These arrangements may create potential conflicts of interest. These and certain other additional interests of Carbon's directors and executive
officers may cause some of these persons to view the proposed transaction differently than you view it, as a shareholder. See "The MergerInterests of Carbon Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger" beginning on page     . 

        You will receive a fixed ratio of 0.275 shares of Evergreen common stock for each share of Carbon common stock that you own plus cash
instead of any fractional share, regardless of any change in the market values of Carbon common stock or Evergreen common stock before the completion of the merger.  

        Upon completion of the merger, each share of Carbon common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.275 shares of Evergreen common stock plus cash in
lieu of fractional shares. The market values of Evergreen common stock and Carbon common stock have varied since Evergreen and Carbon entered into the merger agreement and are likely to continue to
vary in the future due to changes in the business, operations or prospects of Evergreen and Carbon, market assessments of the merger, regulatory considerations, market and economic considerations and
other factors. The dollar value of Evergreen common stock that holders of Carbon common stock will receive upon completion of the merger will depend on the market value of Evergreen common stock at
the time of completion of the merger, which may be lower than the closing price of Evergreen common stock on the last full trading day preceding public announcement that Evergreen and Carbon entered
into the merger agreement, the last full trading day prior to the date of this proxy statement/prospectus or the date of the special meeting. There will be no adjustment to the exchange ratio, and the
parties do not have a 

right
to terminate the merger agreement based solely upon changes in the market price of either Evergreen common stock or Carbon common stock. 

        Sales of substantial amounts of Evergreen's common stock in the open market by Carbon shareholders could depress Evergreen's stock price.  

        Other than shares held by certain affiliates of Carbon, shares of Evergreen's common stock that are issued to shareholders of Carbon will be freely tradable
without restrictions or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933. Two of Carbon's affiliates, Yorktown Energy Partners III, L.P. and Patrick R. McDonald, Carbon's President
and Chief Executive Officer, own 73.2% and 3.8%, respectively, of Carbon's outstanding common stock. Evergreen has agreed to file a registration
statement with the SEC to permit Yorktown and its limited partners and Mr. McDonald and his related entities to sell their shares free of restrictions applicable to other affiliates of Carbon
for a period of one year from the effective date of the registration statement. If the merger with Carbon closes and if Carbon shareholders, including Yorktown, its limited partners and
Mr. McDonald, sell substantial amounts of Evergreen common stock in the public market following the transaction, the market price of Evergreen common stock could fall. These sales might also
make it more difficult for Evergreen to sell equity or equity-related securities at a time and price that it otherwise would deem appropriate. 

        Loss of Key Carbon employees may have a negative impact on the transition to combined operations.  

        Carbon has several key employees who are familiar with the interests and operations of Carbon. Loss of such key employees could have an adverse effect on
Evergreen's ability to exploit and operate efficiently Carbon's properties. Some of these key Carbon employees have employment agreements pursuant to which they can terminate their employment after a
change in control and receive a severance payment. See "The MergerInterests of Carbon's Directors and Officers in the Merger." 

        Evergreen may encounter difficulties expanding its oil and gas activities into the international areas in which Carbon operates.  

        If the merger is completed, Evergreen will acquire Carbon's working interests in Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada. These international operations may be adversely
affected by currency fluctuations. The expenses of such operations are payable in Canadian dollars. As a result, Evergreen's Canadian operations will be subject to the risk of fluctuations in the
relative value of the Canadian and United States dollars. In addition, international operations are subject to political, economic and other uncertainties, including, among others, risk of war,
revolution, border disputes, expropriation, re-negotiation or modification of existing contracts, import, export and transportation regulations and tariffs, taxation policies, including
royalty and tax increase and retroactive tax claims, exchange controls, limits on allowable levels of production, labor disputes and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty
over Evergreen's international operations. 

        After the merger, Evergreen may be affected by the gas prices in the Rocky Mountain Region.  

        Oil and gas commodity markets are influenced by global and regional supply and demand factors. Worldwide political events can also impact commodity prices. The
prices to be received by Evergreen for the natural gas production from Carbon's properties acquired in the merger will be determined mainly by factors affecting the regional supply of and demand for
natural gas. Based on recent experience as described below, regional differences could cause published indices used generally to establish the price received for natural gas production in the United
States to be higher than the market price received by Carbon for natural gas produced from its properties. 

        At
December 31, 2002, approximately 60% of Carbon's United States production was in the Piceance Basin in Colorado and the Uintah Basin in Utah. After March, 2002, natural gas
prices for 

production
in these areas were unusually low relative to Evergreen's operations and the majority of the producing areas in the United States. Reduced regional seasonal demand and inadequate pipeline
transportation capacity linking Carbon's production in the Piceance and Uintah Basins to consuming regions are principal factors contributing to these price differentials. While there is the prospect
for additional pipeline capacity out of this region, which is expected to help alleviate the price differentials received by Rocky Mountain gas producers, continued volatility is expected to affect
the price received for natural gas produced from Carbon's properties after the merger with Evergreen. 

Risks Related to Evergreen Common Stock    

        Oil and gas prices are volatile, and an extended decline in prices would hurt Evergreen's profitability and financial condition.  

        Evergreen's revenues, operating results, profitability, future rate of growth and the carrying value of its oil and gas properties depend heavily on prevailing
market prices for oil and gas. Evergreen's management expects the markets for oil and gas to continue to be volatile. Any substantial or extended decline in the price of oil or gas would have a
material adverse effect on Evergreen's financial condition and results of operations. Such a decline could reduce Evergreen's cash flow and borrowing capacity, as well as the value and the amount of
its gas reserves. All of Evergreen's proved reserves are natural gas. Therefore, Evergreen is more directly impacted by volatility in the price of natural gas. Various factors beyond Evergreen's
control can affect prices of oil and gas, including: 


worldwide
and domestic supplies of oil and gas,


the
ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls,


political
instability or armed conflict in oil or gas producing regions,


the
price and level of foreign imports,


worldwide
economic conditions,


marketability
of production,


the
level of consumer demand,


the
price, availability and acceptance of alternative fuels,


the
availability of pipeline capacity,


weather
conditions, and


actions
of federal, state, local and foreign authorities. 

        These
external factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it difficult to estimate future commodity prices. 

        Evergreen
periodically reviews the carrying value of its oil and gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the SEC. Under these rules, capitalized costs of proved oil and
gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves, discounted at 10%. Application of the ceiling test generally requires pricing future reserves at
the unescalated prices in effect as of the end of each fiscal quarter and requires a write-down for accounting purposes if the ceiling is exceeded, even if prices were depressed for only a
short period of time. Evergreen may be required to write down or impair the carrying value of its oil and gas properties when oil and gas prices are depressed or unusually volatile. If a
write-down is required, it would result in a charge to earnings and book value but would not impact cash flow from operating activities. Once incurred, a write-down of oil and
gas properties is not reversible at a later date. 

        Evergreen's operations require large amounts of capital.  

        Evergreen's current development plans will require it to make large capital expenditures for the exploration and development of its natural gas properties.
Historically, Evergreen has funded its capital expenditures through a combination of funds generated internally from sales of production or properties, the issuance of equity, long-term
debt financing and short-term financing arrangements. Management cannot be sure that any additional financing will be available to Evergreen on acceptable terms. Future cash flows and the
availability of financing will be subject to a number of variables, such as: 


the
success of Evergreen's coal bed methane project in the Raton Basin,


Evergreen's
success in locating and producing new reserves,


the
level of production from existing wells, and


prices
of oil and natural gas. 

        Issuing
equity securities to satisfy Evergreen's financing requirements could cause substantial dilution to existing shareholders. In addition, debt financing could lead to: 


a
substantial portion of Evergreen's operating cash flow being dedicated to the payment of principal and interest,


Evergreen
being more vulnerable to competitive pressures and economic downturns, and


restrictions
on Evergreen's operations. 

        If
Evergreen's revenues were to decrease due to lower oil and natural gas prices, decreased production or other reasons, and if it could not obtain capital through its credit facility or
otherwise, Evergreen's ability to execute its development plans, replace its reserves or maintain its production levels could be greatly limited. 

        Information concerning Evergreen's reserves and future net revenue estimates is uncertain.  

        There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and their values, including many factors beyond the
control of Evergreen. Estimates of proved undeveloped reserves, which comprise a significant portion of Evergreen's reserves, are by their nature uncertain. The reserve data incorporated in this proxy
statement/prospectus by reference to Evergreen's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002 are estimates. Although management believes they are reasonable, estimates of
production, revenues and capital and operating expenditures will likely vary from actual results, and these variances may be material. 

        Estimates
of oil and natural gas reserves, by necessity, are projections based on geologic and engineering data, and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data
as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and
natural gas that are difficult to measure. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Estimates of
economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as historical production from the area
compared with production from other producing areas, the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions governing future oil and natural gas prices, future operating costs,
severance, ad valorem and excise taxes, development costs and workover and remedial costs, all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results. For these reasons, estimates of the
economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery, and estimates of the future
net cash flows expected therefrom may vary substantially. 

Any
significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to Evergreen's reserves
will likely vary from estimates, and such variances may be material. 

        Analysts
and investors should not construe the present value of future net reserves, or PV-10, as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves
attributable to Evergreen's properties. Management has based the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate, in accordance with
applicable regulations, whereas actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. Many factors will affect actual future net cash flows, including: 


the
amount and timing of actual production,


supply
and demand for natural gas,


curtailments
or increases in consumption by natural gas purchasers, and


changes
in governmental regulations or taxation. 

        The
timing of the production of oil and natural gas properties and of the related expenses affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and, thus, their actual
present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor, which Evergreen is required to use to calculate PV-10 for reporting purposes, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor
given actual interest rates and risks to which Evergreen's business or the oil and natural gas industry in general are subject. 

        Evergreen depends heavily on expansion and development of the Raton Basin.  

        All of Evergreen's proved reserves are in the Raton Basin, and its future growth plans rely heavily on increasing production and reserves in the Raton Basin.
Evergreen's proved reserves will decline as reserves are depleted, except to the extent Evergreen conducts successful exploration activities or acquires other properties containing proved reserves. 

        At
December 31, 2002, Evergreen had estimated net proved undeveloped reserves of approximately 443 Bcf, which constituted approximately 36% of its total estimated net proved
reserves. Evergreen's development plan includes increasing its reserve base through continued drilling and development of its existing properties in the Raton Basin. Evergreen cannot be sure that its
planned projects in the Raton Basin will lead to significant additional reserves or that it will be able to continue drilling productive wells at anticipated finding and development costs. 

        Future acquisitions pose risks to Evergreen's business and growth prospects.  

        As part of its growth strategy, Evergreen may make additional acquisitions of businesses and properties. However, suitable acquisition candidates may not be
available on terms and conditions Evergreen finds acceptable. In pursuing acquisitions, Evergreen competes with other companies, many of which have greater financial and other resources to acquire
attractive companies and properties. Even if future acquisitions are completed, the following are some of the risks associated with acquisitions, including the proposed acquisition of Carbon, that
could have a material adverse effect on Evergreen's business, financial condition and results of operations: 


some
of the acquired businesses or properties may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels,


Evergreen
may assume liabilities that were not disclosed or exceed Evergreen's estimates,


Evergreen
may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result
in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems, 


acquisitions
could disrupt Evergreen's ongoing business, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain Evergreen's current business standards,
controls and procedures,


Evergreen
may finance future acquisitions by issuing common stock for some or all of the purchase price, which could dilute the ownership interests of Evergreen's
stockholders, and


Evergreen
may incur additional debt related to future acquisitions. 

        Evergreen's industry is highly competitive.  

        Major oil companies, independent producers and institutional and individual investors are actively seeking oil and gas properties throughout the world, along with
the equipment, labor and materials required to operate properties. Many of Evergreen's competitors have financial and technological resources vastly exceeding those available to Evergreen. Many oil
and gas properties are sold in a competitive bidding process in which Evergreen may lack technological information or expertise available to other bidders. Evergreen cannot be sure that it will be
successful in acquiring and developing profitable properties in the face of this competition. 

        The oil and gas exploration business involves a high degree of business and financial risk.  

        The business of exploring for and, to a lesser extent, developing oil and gas properties is an activity that involves a high degree of business and financial
risk. Property acquisition decisions generally are based on various assumptions and subjective judgments that are speculative. Although available geological and geophysical information can provide
information about the potential of a property, it is impossible to predict accurately the ultimate production potential, if any, of a particular property or
well. Moreover, the successful completion of an oil or gas well does not ensure a profit on investment. A variety of factors, both geological and market-related, can cause a well to become uneconomic
or marginally economic. 

        Evergreen's business is subject to operating hazards that could result in substantial losses.  

        The oil and natural gas business involves operating hazards such as well blowouts, craterings, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well
fluids, fires, formations with abnormal pressures, pipeline ruptures or spills, pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks, any of which could cause Evergreen a
substantial loss. In addition, Evergreen may be held liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners of property it owns or leases. As a result, Evergreen may face substantial liabilities to
third parties or governmental entities, which could reduce or eliminate funds available for exploration, development or acquisitions or cause Evergreen to incur losses. An event that is not fully
covered by insurancefor example, losses resulting from pollution and environmental risks, which are not fully insurablecould have a material adverse effect on Evergreen's
financial condition and results of operations. 

        Exploratory drilling is an uncertain process with many risks.  

        Exploratory drilling involves numerous risks, including the risk that Evergreen will not find any commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs. The cost
of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain, and a number of factors can delay or prevent drilling operations, including: 


unexpected
drilling conditions,


pressure
or irregularities in formations,


equipment
failures or accidents,


adverse
weather conditions, 


compliance
with governmental requirements, and


shortages
or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment. 

        Evergreen's
future drilling activities may not be successful, nor can Evergreen management be sure that Evergreen's overall drilling success rate or its drilling success rate for
activity within a particular area will not decline. Unsuccessful drilling activities could have a material adverse effect on Evergreen's results of operations and financial condition. Also, Evergreen
may not be able to obtain any options or lease rights in potential drilling locations that it identifies. Although Evergreen has identified numerous potential drilling locations, management cannot be
sure that Evergreen will ever drill them or that it will produce natural gas from them or any other potential drilling locations. 

        Hedging transactions may limit Evergreen's potential gains or expose Evergreen to loss.  

        To manage Evergreen's exposure to price risks in the marketing of its natural gas, Evergreen enters into natural gas fixed price physical delivery contracts as
well as commodity price swap and collar contracts from time to time with respect to a portion of its current or future production. While intended to reduce the effects of volatile natural gas prices,
these transactions may limit Evergreen's potential gains if natural gas prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the contracts. In addition, such transactions may expose
Evergreen to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which: 


Evergreen's
production is less than expected,


there
is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for Evergreen's production and the delivery point assumed in the contracts,


the
counterparties to Evergreen's futures contracts fail to perform under the contracts, or


a
sudden, unexpected event materially impacts natural gas prices. 

        Evergreen may face unanticipated water disposal costs.  

        Evergreen's management believes that the State of Colorado will continue to routinely approve permits for the use of well-site pits, water disposal
wells and evaporation ponds for the disposal of produced water. Where groundwater produced from the Raton Basin coal seams meets surface discharge permit levels, Evergreen can lawfully discharge the
water into arroyos and surface waters pursuant to permits it has obtained from the State of Colorado. All of these disposal options require a laboratory analysis program to ensure compliance with
state permit standards. Additionally, Evergreen contracts with an independent water sampling company that collects the water samples and monitors Evergreen's water management program. These monitoring
costs are directly related to the number of well-site pits, evaporation ponds and discharge points. 

        Where
water of lesser quality is discovered or Evergreen's wells produce water in excess of the applicable volumetric permit limits, Evergreen may have to drill additional disposal wells
to re-inject the produced water back into deep underground rock formations. Produced water is currently injected at eight such wells, and two more of these underground injection control
(UIC) wells are under development. The costs to dispose of this produced water may increase, which could have a material adverse effect on Evergreen's operations in this area, if any of the following
occur: (1) Evergreen cannot obtain future permits from the State of Colorado, (2) water of lesser quality is produced, (3) Evergreen's wells produce excess water or (4) new
laws or regulations require water to be disposed of in a different manner. 

        Evergreen has limited protection for its technology and depends on technology owned by others.  

        Evergreen uses operating practices that management believes are of significant value in developing coal bed methane reserves. In most cases, patent or other
intellectual property protection is unavailable for this technology. Evergreen's use of independent contractors in most aspects of its drilling and some completion operations makes the protection of
such technology more difficult. Moreover, Evergreen relies on the technological expertise of the independent contractors that it retains for its oil and gas
operations. Evergreen has no long-term agreements with these contractors, and management cannot be sure that Evergreen will continue to have access to this expertise. 

        Evergreen's industry is heavily regulated.  

        Federal, state and local authorities extensively regulate the oil and gas industry. Legislation and regulations affecting the industry are under constant review
for amendment or expansion, raising the possibility of changes that may affect, among other things, the pricing or marketing of oil and gas production. Noncompliance with statutes and regulations may
lead to substantial penalties, and the overall regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and, in turn, decreases profitability. State and local authorities regulate
various aspects of oil and gas drilling and production activities, including the drilling of wells (through permit and bonding requirements), the positioning of wells, the unitization or pooling of
oil and gas properties, environmental matters, safety standards, the sharing of markets, production limitations, plugging and abandonment, and restoration. 

        Evergreen must comply with complex environmental regulations.  

        Evergreen's operations are subject to complex and constantly changing environmental laws and regulations adopted by United States federal, state and local
governmental authorities. New laws or regulations, or changes to current requirements, could have a material adverse effect on its business. State, federal and local environmental agencies have
relatively little experience with the regulation of coal bed methane operations, which are technologically different from conventional oil and gas operations. This inexperience has created uncertainty
regarding how these agencies will interpret air, water and waste requirements and other regulations to coal bed methane drilling, fracture stimulation methods, production and water disposal
operations. Evergreen will continue to be subject to uncertainty associated with new regulatory interpretations and inconsistent interpretations between state and federal agencies. Evergreen could
face significant liabilities to the government and third parties for discharges of oil, natural gas or other pollutants into the air, soil or water, and Evergreen could have to spend substantial
amounts on investigations, litigation and remediation. Evergreen cannot be sure that existing environmental laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or enforced, or as they may be interpreted,
enforced or altered in the future, will not materially adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. As a result, Evergreen may face material indemnity claims with respect to
properties it owns or leases or has owned or has leased. 

        Evergreen's business depends on transportation facilities owned by others.  

        The marketability of Evergreen's gas production depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of pipeline systems owned by third parties. Although
Evergreen has some contractual control over the transportation of its product, material changes in these business relationships could materially affect its operations. Federal and state regulation of
gas and oil production and transportation, tax and energy policies, changes in supply and demand, pipeline pressures, and general economic conditions could adversely affect Evergreen's ability to
produce, gather and transport natural gas. 

        Market conditions could cause Evergreen to incur losses on its transportation contracts.  

        Evergreen has gas transportation contracts that require it to transport minimum volumes of natural gas. If Evergreen ships smaller volumes, it may be liable for
the shortfall. Unforeseen events, including production problems or substantial decreases in the price or demand for natural gas, could cause Evergreen to ship less than the required volumes, resulting
in losses on these contracts. 

        Evergreen depends on key personnel.  

        Evergreen's success will continue to depend on the continued services of its executive officers and a limited number of other senior management and technical
personnel. Loss of the services of any of these people could have a material adverse effect on Evergreen's operations. Evergreen does not have employment agreements with its executive officers. 

        Evergreen does not pay dividends.  

        Evergreen has never declared nor paid any cash dividends on its common stock, and it has no intention to do so in the near future. 

        Evergreen's articles of incorporation and bylaws have provisions that discourage corporate takeovers and could prevent shareholders from
realizing a premium on their investment.  

        Evergreen's articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. These provisions,
among other things, provide for a staggered Board of Directors and noncumulative voting in the election of the Board and impose procedural requirements on shareholders who wish to make nominations for
the election of directors or propose other actions at shareholders' meetings. Also, Evergreen's articles of incorporation authorize the Board to issue up to 24,900,000 shares of preferred stock
without shareholder approval and to set the rights, preferences and other designations, including voting rights, of those shares as the Board may determine. These provisions, alone or in combination
with each other and with the rights plan described below, may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a
premium over prevailing market prices to shareholders for their common stock. 

        On
July 7, 1997 Evergreen's Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights agreement, which provides for the distribution of uncertificated stock purchase rights to shareholders
of Evergreen at a rate of one right for each share of common stock held of record. The rights plan is designed to enhance the Board's ability to prevent an acquirer from depriving shareholders of the
long-term value of their investment and to protect shareholders against attempts to acquire Evergreen by means of unfair or abusive takeover tactics. However, the existence of the rights
plan may impede a takeover of Evergreen not supported by the Board, including a takeover that may be desired by a majority of Evergreen's shareholders or involving a premium over the prevailing stock
price. 

        Evergreen's stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile.  

        The market price of Evergreen common stock has been volatile. During 2002, the sale price of the common stock on the NYSE has ranged from a low of $30.90 per
share to a high of $47.00 per share. For the period January 1, 2003 through May 16, 2003, the price has ranged from a low of $41.29 to a high of $52.10. The market price of Evergreen's
common stock is subject to many factors, including: 


prices
for oil and natural gas,


general
stock market conditions,


conditions
in Evergreen's industry,


changes
in Evergreen's revenues and earnings, and


changes
in analyst recommendations and projections. 

MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS    

General    

        This proxy statement/prospectus is being furnished to you in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Carbon Board of Directors from holders of Carbon
common stock, for use at the special meeting of shareholders to be held
at                        on                 
       ,                        , 2003
at                .m., Mountain Daylight Time, and at
any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting. At the special meeting of shareholders, holders of Carbon common stock will be asked to vote upon the following proposals: 


approval
and adoption of the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated March 31, 2003, among Carbon Energy Corporation, Evergreen Resources, Inc. and
Evergreen Merger Corporation and the related plan of merger pursuant to which Evergreen Merger Corporation would merge into Carbon, and Carbon would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Evergreen. In
this proxy statement/prospectus, we refer to the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and the related plan of merger as the "merger agreement" and to Evergreen Merger Corporation as the "merger
subsidiary." A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Appendix A; and


adjournment
of the special meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies to approve of the matters being voted upon at the meeting, and such other matters as may
properly come before the special meeting. 

        Proxies
may be voted on other matters that may properly come before the meeting, if any, at the discretion of the proxy holders. The Carbon Board of Directors knows of no such other
matters except those incidental to the conduct of the meeting. 

Who Can Vote at the Meeting    

        The Carbon Board of Directors has fixed the close of business (             p.m., Mountain Daylight Time)
on                        , 2003 as the record date
for determining the holders of Carbon common stock entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting. Only holders of record of Carbon common stock at the close of business on the record date
will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting. 

        On
the record date, there were            shares of Carbon common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting, held by
approximately            
holders of record. Holders of record of Carbon common stock are entitled to one vote per share on any matter which may properly come before the special meeting. Votes may be cast at the special
meeting in person or by proxy. 

        The
presence at the special meeting, either in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Carbon common stock entitled to vote, is necessary to constitute a
quorum in order to transact business at the special meeting. However, in the event that a quorum is not present at the special meeting, it is expected that the meeting will be adjourned or postponed
in order to solicit additional proxies. 

Attending the Meeting    

        If you are a beneficial owner of Carbon common stock held by a broker, bank or other nominee (i.e., in "street name"), you will need proof of ownership to be
admitted to the meeting. A recent brokerage statement or letter from a bank or broker are examples of proof of ownership. If you want to vote your shares of Carbon common stock held in street name in
person at the meeting, you will have to get a written proxy in your name from the broker, bank or other nominee who holds your shares. 

Vote Required    

        Approval of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Carbon common stock
outstanding on the record date, voting as a single class. Under applicable Colorado law, in determining whether the proposal to approve and adopt the
merger agreement has received the requisite number of affirmative votes, non-votes and abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal. Brokers who hold shares of
Carbon common stock as nominees will not have discretionary authority to vote such shares in the absence of instructions from the beneficial owners of those shares. Any shares which are not voted
because the nominee-broker lacks such discretionary authority ("broker non-votes") will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal. 

        Action
on any other matter that is properly presented at the meeting for consideration of the shareholders will be approved if a quorum is present for that matter and the votes cast
favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action. A quorum will be present for a particular matter if a majority of the outstanding shares of Carbon common stock entitled to vote on that
matter is represented at the meeting in person or by proxy. For purposes of determining whether a quorum is present for a particular matter, shares with respect to which proxies have been marked as
abstentions and any broker non-vote shares will be treated as shares present. The Carbon Board of Directors is not aware of any other business to be presented at the meeting other than
matters incidental to the conduct of the meeting. 

Because approval of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Carbon common stock entitled to
vote, and abstentions and broker non-vote shares will have the same effect as votes against the merger, the Carbon Board of Directors urges you to complete, date and sign the accompanying
proxy and return it promptly in the enclosed postage-prepaid envelope or to otherwise vote your shares in another approved manner.

        You should not return your stock certificates with your proxy cards.
    The procedure for surrendering your stock certificates
is described under "The MergerExchange of Carbon Stock Certificates" on page    . 

        As
of the record date, Carbon's directors and executive officers and their affiliates may be deemed to be the owners of approximately 5,031,300 outstanding shares of Carbon common stock
(not including shares that may be acquired upon the exercise of stock options) (representing approximately 81.8% of the voting power of Carbon common stock). Yorktown Energy Partners III, L.P., the
largest shareholder of Carbon, and Patrick R. McDonald, President and Chief Executive Officer, are obligated pursuant to agreements with Evergreen to vote the outstanding shares they own (77.0% of
Carbon's stock in the aggregate) in favor of approval and adoption of the merger agreement. See "The MergerVoting Agreement." As of the record date, the directors and officers of
Evergreen, their affiliates, Evergreen and its subsidiaries have no ownership in the shares of Carbon common stock. 

Voting and Revocation of Proxies    

        Shares represented by properly executed proxies received in time for the special meeting will be voted at the special meeting in the manner specified by such
proxies unless the proxies are revoked as described below. If your proxy is properly executed but does not contain voting instructions, your proxy will be voted 

"for"
 approval of the merger agreement.
If other matters are properly presented before the special meeting, the persons named in such proxy will have
authority to vote in accordance with their judgment on any other such matters. It is not expected that any matter other than as described in this proxy statement/prospectus will be brought before the
special meeting. 

        The
grant of a proxy on the enclosed proxy card does not preclude a shareholder from voting in person. You may revoke a proxy at any time prior to your proxy being voted at the special
meeting by: 


voting
again by telephone; or


delivering,
prior to the special meeting, to Patrick R. McDonald, Secretary of Carbon, at Carbon, 1700 Broadway, Suite 1150, Denver, Colorado 80290, a written notice of
revocation bearing a later date or time than the proxy; submitting another proxy by mail that is later dated and that is properly signed, dated and completed; or oral revocation in person to any of
the persons named on the enclosed proxy card at the special meeting. 

        Attendance
at the special meeting will not by itself constitute revocation of a proxy. If you hold your shares in street name, please see the voting form provided by your broker for
additional information regarding the voting of your shares. 

        Your
broker may allow you to deliver your voting instructions via the telephone or the internet. Please see the voting instruction form from your broker. If your shares are not
registered in your name, you will need additional documentation from your record holder to vote the shares in person. 

Solicitation of Proxies    

        Carbon will pay the cost of printing this proxy statement/prospectus and all other costs of soliciting proxies. Directors, officers and other employees of Carbon
or its subsidiaries may solicit proxies personally, by telephone or facsimile or otherwise. None of these people will receive any special compensation for solicitation activities. Carbon will arrange
with brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for the forwarding of solicitation material to the beneficial owners of stock held of record by such brokerage firms and other
custodians, nominees and fiduciaries, and Carbon will reimburse these record holders for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Carbon has
engaged                  to assist
in distributing proxy materials and contacting record and beneficial owners of Carbon common stock. Carbon has agreed to pay            approximately
$          , including
out-of-pocket expenses for its services to be rendered on behalf of Carbon. 

        The
special meeting may be adjourned for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies in favor of the merger. Any adjournment of the special meeting may be made without notice, other
than by an announcement made at the special meeting, by approval of the holders of a majority of the shares of Carbon common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting,
whether or not a quorum exists. Any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies will allow Carbon shareholders who have already sent in their
proxies to revoke them at any time prior to their use. 

Recommendation of the Carbon Board    

        The Carbon Board has unanimously approved the merger agreement and believes that the proposed transaction is fair to and in the best interests of Carbon and its
shareholders. 
The Carbon Board unanimously recommends that Carbon's shareholders vote "FOR" approval of the merger agreement.
 See "The
MergerBackground of and Reasons for the Merger" on page    . 

THE MERGER    

The following information describes the material aspects of the merger. This description does not purport to be complete and is qualified
in its entirety by reference to the appendices to this proxy statement/prospectus, including the merger agreement, which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix A and
incorporated herein by reference. You are urged to read the appendices in their entirety.

General    

        The merger agreement provides for the merger of the merger subsidiary with and into Carbon, with Carbon becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Evergreen. As a
result of the merger, holders of Carbon common stock will exchange their shares of Carbon for shares of common stock of Evergreen. On the effective date of the merger, each share of Carbon common
stock then issued and outstanding will be converted into and exchanged for the right to receive 0.275 shares of Evergreen common stock plus cash instead of fractional shares. Shares held by Carbon,
Evergreen or any Evergreen subsidiaries will not be converted to Evergreen common stock. 

Background of and Reasons for the Merger    

 Background of the Merger  

        In 2000 and 2001 at regularly scheduled meetings and from time to time, various directors and executive officers of Carbon discussed the long-term
growth objectives for Carbon as well as the means and strategy required to achieve these objectives. Carbon's Board and management generally discussed the following: obtaining additional capital in
order to develop Carbon's oil and natural gas properties; alternatives to acquire additional capital; potential barriers to raising capital;
achieving a greater degree of liquidity for Carbon's shareholders; the possibility of Carbon's merging with a larger company with greater access to capital; growing through one or more acquisitions of
assets or companies; and other means of achieving Carbon's objectives. 

        In
February, 2001, Carbon retained Dain Rauscher Wessels (which was subsequently acquired by Royal Bank of Canada and is now known as RBC Dain Rauscher Inc., "RBC") to act as
financial adviser to and provide investment banking services for Carbon. RBC worked with Carbon's management and Board to assess Carbon's strategic objectives. 

        After
retaining RBC, Carbon and RBC had discussions with financial institutions, institutional investors and private equity sources regarding the possibility of raising additional
capital by issuing equity. Carbon's small capitalization and public float and the illiquidity of its shares were concerns to the entities contacted. Carbon's management and Board determined that
raising equity financing at an attractive price was not feasible at that time. Carbon and RBC had discussions with several other companies which, in Carbon's and RBC's view, might have a strategic
interest in Carbon's properties located in Colorado, Utah and Alberta, Canada. Several of the companies contacted declined to express an interest in Carbon's assets, and no further discussions were
held with such companies. Four of the companies contacted expressed an interest in Carbon. After execution of confidentiality agreements, Carbon management met with representatives of each of these
companies to present an overview of Carbon's assets in the United States and Canada and to gauge their interest in Carbon's assets. Each of these companies declined to pursue additional discussions
with Carbon, citing the relatively small size of Carbon's assets or the lack of operating or geographical synergy as the reason. 

        Commencing
in September 2001, Carbon held discussions relating to a possible acquisition of a Canadian public company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. In November 2001
Carbon retained RBC to provide financial advisory and investment banking services in connection with a possible transaction with that company. After conducting its due diligence review, Carbon
submitted an offer to acquire such company for cash and common stock of Carbon. The Board of Directors of the target company responded with an alternative proposal. Negotiations continued, but the
parties could not 

reach
an agreement on the consideration to be paid, at which point discussions between the two companies ceased. 

        In
May 2002, Carbon considered another possible transaction with a Canadian public company listed on the Canadian Venture Exchange. In July 2002, Carbon retained RBC to
provide financial advisory and investment banking services in connection with the possible transaction. After conducting its due diligence review, Carbon submitted an offer to acquire the target
company for cash. The Board of Directors of the target company declined to accept Carbon's offer. Carbon's offer expired and there were no further discussions. 

        In
June 2002, Carbon engaged in discussions with another company, larger than Carbon, and retained RBC to provide financial advisory and investment banking services in connection
with a possible transaction. After conducting its due diligence review of the target company, Carbon submitted an offer to acquire the company in a merger in which the proposed target company
stockholders would have the choice of receiving Carbon stock or cash as consideration in the transaction. The Board of Directors of the target company declined Carbon's offer and subsequently accepted
an offer to be acquired by a NYSE-listed company for cash and stock. 

        Throughout
the remainder of 2002, Carbon continued to explore and consider various strategic alternatives, including, but not limited to, equity financing, merger opportunities and asset
or corporate acquisitions. At the regularly scheduled Board meeting during the second quarter of 2002, and from time to time between individual Board members and management, the alternatives were
discussed. In July 2002, Carbon received an unsolicited inquiry from a public oil and gas company, and Mr. McDonald contacted during September 2002 one other public oil and gas
company, regarding a potential transaction involving Carbon. Mr. McDonald met with each company, and, after preliminary discussions with each regarding a share-for-share
merger, Carbon executed confidentiality agreements with each company. Mr. McDonald presented to each company an overview of Carbon's operations, assets and business objectives. Both companies
subsequently orally indicated to Carbon that, in their estimation, the value of Carbon was less than or equal to the then trading price of Carbon shares and that the geographical locations of some of
Carbon's assets were not a strategic fit. The Carbon Board of Directors discussed the indications of value and the prospects for the share appreciation of the two companies, and based on their
analysis, advised Mr. McDonald to discontinue discussions with these companies. During the course of the discussions noted above, Carbon did not receive any written offers regarding a potential
business combination. 

        The
first contact between Carbon and Evergreen was on October 3, 2002, when Mr. McDonald was introduced to Mark S. Sexton, President and Chief Executive Officer of
Evergreen and both informally discussed their business strategies. Mr. McDonald subsequently forwarded to Mr. Sexton public information regarding Carbon. Mr. Sexton reviewed the
information and, at Mr. McDonald's suggestion, agreed to meet to learn more about Carbon's business and operations. 

        On
November 13, 2002, the parties executed a confidentiality agreement. After signing the agreement, Mr. McDonald met with Evergreen's senior management and independent
reserve engineers to discuss the companies' business objectives, assets and operations. Mr. McDonald presented an overview of Carbon's operations, reserves and production, undeveloped potential
and strategy. 

        Following
the initial discussion with Mr. Sexton and again after the November 13, 2002 meeting, Mr. McDonald informed Carbon's Board about the possibility of a
combination with Evergreen. Mr. McDonald met with members of Carbon's Board collectively and individually to discuss the business and operations of Evergreen. Mr. McDonald and members of
Carbon's Board reviewed and analyzed public information regarding the financial condition, operations, production, reserves and undeveloped potential of Evergreen. The directors advised
Mr. McDonald to continue discussions with Evergreen. Subsequently, Mr. McDonald at least weekly had contacts with each of the Carbon directors to report to them on the status of a
possible transaction with Evergreen. 

        On
December 2, 2002, the Evergreen Board of Directors authorized Evergreen's management to pursue a transaction with Carbon subject to the Board's approval of a definitive merger
agreement. 

        On
December 4, 2002, Carbon held a regularly scheduled Board meeting at which Mr. McDonald updated the Board of Directors regarding the strategic and business
considerations relating to the transaction, the ongoing due diligence review, the status of discussions between the parties and other matters relating to a possible transaction. Following the
discussion, the Board of Directors authorized Mr. McDonald to continue discussions with Evergreen. After this meeting concluded, Mr. Sexton and Dennis R. Carlton, Executive Vice
PresidentExploration and Chief Operating Officer of Evergreen, by telephone, and Kevin R. Collins, Executive Vice PresidentFinance, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of
Evergreen, joined the directors to introduce themselves and Evergreen. 

        On
December 23, 2002, Mr. McDonald met with representatives of Evergreen's management to review the results of Evergreen's valuation of the reserves and other assets of
Carbon. The parties also reviewed and discussed Evergreen's proved reserves and other assets and business operations. The parties reviewed the relative contributions of Evergreen and Carbon from a
financial, production and reserves basis. 

        On
December 30, 2002, Mr. Sexton and Mr. Collins, along with other representatives of Evergreen, met with Mr. McDonald to discuss the potential benefits and the
structure of a business combination transaction. Both parties indicated a willingness to consider a share-for-share exchange. 

        During
January and February 2003, Carbon, Mr. McDonald and Evergreen officers and technical persons continued valuation analyses of both companies and discussed information
regarding production, oil and natural gas reserves, drilling opportunities, undeveloped acreage, personnel, regulatory matters and other business and operational items pertaining to the activities of
both companies. In late January, 2003, Carbon prepared and furnished to Evergreen a draft letter of intent for a transaction, which did not include the financial terms of the proposed transaction. 

        On
February 3, 2003, Carbon announced that it had entered into an agreement with a third party to sell the Company's interest in 97 gross wells (23.3 net wells) and 25,400 gross
acres (8,200 net acres) located primarily in southeast New Mexico, for a sale price of $14.4 million in cash, net of normal closing adjustments. This sale represented a complete exit from this
region and completed Carbon's program of selling assets which did not fit with its focus on the development of natural gas properties in the Piceance and Uintah Basins of the United States and in
central Alberta. Net proved reserves at December 31, 2002 of the divested properties were 7.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 172,000 barrels of oil. 

        In
early February, 2003, Mr. McDonald and Mr. Sexton held discussions regarding the possible exchange ratios for the business combination. Each person commented on the
basis for that party's proposed exchange ratio. 

        On
February 11, 2003, following considerable discussion among representatives from Evergreen and between Mr. McDonald and the Carbon Board of Directors,
Messrs. Sexton and McDonald preliminarily agreed on an exchange ratio of 0.275 shares of Evergreen for every one share of Carbon, subject to approval by the Boards of Carbon and Evergreen and
satisfactory resolution of all other remaining legal and business issues. On February 14, 2003, Mr. McDonald, counsel for Carbon, a representative of Yorktown Energy Partners III, L.P.
("Yorktown") and Yorktown's counsel explained to Evergreen Yorktown's need to receive shares of Evergreen that would be freely transferable, and the parties considered the possibility of a
registration statement by Evergreen covering the resale of Evergreen shares by Yorktown. The parties also discussed some terms in the draft letter of intent. 

        Also,
in February, 2003, Evergreen prepared a revised draft of the letter of intent, and the parties negotiated terms of the letter of intent. On March 3, 2003, Carbon sent to
Evergreen proposed changes to the draft letter of intent. The parties then decided that it would be more efficient and expeditious to 

negotiate
the terms of a definitive agreement for the proposed merger and not to enter into a letter of intent. 

        On
March 7, 2003, Evergreen provided a draft of the merger agreement to Carbon and thereafter, through March 30, 2003, prepared additional drafts of the merger agreement to
reflect negotiations of the parties. Mr. McDonald, on behalf of Carbon, and officers of Evergreen, together with their legal counsel, negotiated the final terms of the merger agreement during
this time period. 

        On
March 10, 2003, Evergreen provided to Carbon drafts of the voting agreement, registration rights agreement and affiliate agreement contemplated by the merger agreement, and the
parties negotiated changes to those agreements between March 10, 2003 and March 31, 2003. 

        On
March 24, 2003, Carbon closed its sale of the interests described above in southeast New Mexico. The proceeds from this asset sale were used to repay borrowings under Carbon's
United States credit facility. 

        On
March 24, 2003, Carbon engaged RBC to provide investment banking and financial advisory services in connection with the transaction with Evergreen. 

        On
March 24, 2003, the Evergreen Board approved the merger agreement and related agreements in the form submitted to the Board by management and authorized management to execute
and deliver on behalf of Evergreen definitive agreements with such changes as management determined appropriate. 

        During
the period of March 29 through March 31, 2003, the parties prepared and completed a letter agreement regarding the availability of a cashless exercise feature to be
offered to option holders of Carbon after they exchange their Carbon options for Evergreen options and the minimum severance benefit in the event of termination of Carbon employees. 

        By
March 30, 2003, Mr. McDonald, Mr. Sexton and Mr. Collins, with the assistance of their Boards of Directors and financial and legal advisers, had resolved
all remaining business and legal issues for the merger agreement. The officers then presented the merger agreement to their Boards for approval. 

        On
March 31, 2003, the Board of Directors of Carbon held a special meeting to review the proposed transaction. At the meeting, Carbon's management, together with Carbon's
financial and legal advisers, apprised the Carbon Board of Directors of the status of discussions and reviewed the proposed terms of the transaction. Carbon management discussed the results of their
diligence review. A representative of Carbon's law firm for the sale, Welborn, Sullivan, Meek and Tooley, P.C., reviewed the terms of the transaction agreements. RBC made a presentation to Carbon's
Board in which it discussed the information described under "Opinion of Carbon's Financial Advisor." At that meeting, RBC provided to the Board of Directors an oral opinion (subsequently confirmed in
writing) that, as of March 31, 2003, and subject to no material changes occurring to the terms of the documents relating to the proposed merger, the exchange ratio was fair from a financial
point of view to the holders of Carbon common stock. The Carbon Board also considered reasons for the proposed merger, strategic alternatives previously considered by the Board, the Company's current
condition, its growth potential, the current condition and growth potential of Evergreen, the equal treatment of the shareholders, the likelihood of the merger closing and risks of not closing the
merger, the intended tax treatment for the merger and other factors. The Carbon Board determined that the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement were fair and in the
best interests of Carbon and its shareholders. The Carbon Board approved the merger and the merger agreement and resolved to recommend that Carbon shareholders vote to approve the merger agreement.
Shortly after the meeting of the Carbon Board, the merger agreement, the voting agreements and the registration rights agreement were executed by the parties. 

        On
March 31, 2003, Evergreen and Carbon issued separate press releases announcing that the parties had entered into the merger agreement and terms of the merger. 

 Carbon's Reasons for the Merger  

        At its special meeting held March 31, 2003, the Carbon Board of Directors unanimously approved the merger agreement and resolved to recommend the approval
of the merger agreement by the Carbon shareholders. 

        In
reaching its decision, the Carbon Board of Directors considered a number of factors, including the following: 


Larger, Better Capitalized Company.
  Carbon has a significant inventory of undrilled exploratory and development
prospects located in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States and in Canada, including the Piceance and Uintah Basins of Colorado and Utah and the Carbon and Rowley areas of central Alberta.
Carbon has a limited amount of capital with which to develop its
properties. The merger represents an opportunity for Carbon shareholders to have an interest in Evergreen, which has the financial flexibility and capital resources to accelerate the drilling of
exploratory and development drilling projects and to fund corporate and asset acquisition opportunities in the United States and Canada.


Liquidity of Stock.
  The merger will increase liquidity for the shareholders of Carbon in the combined company
compared to its present illiquid position. The Board considered the current financial market conditions, historical market price for Carbon stock since the inception of Carbon, trading information
with respect to Carbon's common stock, the relatively illiquid and inactive trading pattern for Carbon common stock since Carbon became a publicly-held corporation and the fact that
securities analysts have generally not followed the common stock of the Carbon. Evergreen stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and it trades with substantially greater volumes and will
potentially receive higher multiples than that of Carbon. In addition, approximately 10 securities analysts issue reports on Evergreen.


Premium to Trading Price.
  The consideration offered in the merger, consisting of Evergreen shares, represented
an approximately 18.9% premium over the closing price of Carbon's common stock on the trading day preceding the announcement of the merger.


Tax Consequences.
  The parties intend that the merger be a tax-free reorganization for federal income
tax purposes, and the receipt of an opinion on this subject is a condition to closing the merger. Accordingly, the merger should not be taxable either to Carbon or its United States shareholders,
except for cash issued for fractional shares.


Previous Efforts.
  Carbon was unsuccessful in attempts prior to 2003 to secure additional equity financing,
consummate merger transactions or make a significant corporate or asset acquisition.


Consolidation of the Industry.
  Carbon's management and its Board of Directors believes that the energy industry
will continue to experience consolidation of companies, which affects the ability of Carbon to acquire lands for development, producing assets and acquisitions of other businesses. Larger oil and gas
companies may also benefit from cost savings and economies of scale in the exploration, development and operation of properties.


Technical Expertise.
  The merger of the two companies will result in a company with a combined technical team
which has a strong track record in the oil and gas industry.


Fairness Opinion.
  Carbon's Board considered the opinion of RBC that, as of March 31, 2003, based upon and
subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in the opinion, the exchange ratio in the merger was fair from a financial point of view to the Carbon shareholders. 

        In
determining to approve the merger, the Carbon Board of Directors also considered information presented by management of Carbon and advisers to Carbon with respect to the merger,
including but not limited to the following: 


Reports
from management of Carbon as to the results of due diligence review of Evergreen and its business;


Strategic
alternatives of Carbon, including growth through acquisitions, expansion through internal growth and diversification, and raising additional capital;


Carbon's
current condition, including results of operations, financial condition, and operations capabilities;


Carbon's
growth potential in the United States and Canada and risks involved in Carbon's business;


The
current condition of Evergreen, including results of operations, financial condition and operations capabilities;


Information
with respect to historical trading prices and trading multiples of the common stock of Evergreen; and


The
terms of the merger agreement. 

        The
Carbon Board did not quantify or assign relative weights to the factors considered in reaching its conclusion. Rather, the Carbon Board views its recommendation as being based on the
totality of the information presented to and considered by it. In addition, individual Carbon directors may have given different weights to different factors. In considering the recommendation of the
Carbon Board with respect to the merger, you should be aware that some officers and directors of Carbon have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of
Carbon shareholders generally (discussed in greater detail in "The MergerInterests of Carbon's Directors and Officers in the Merger" beginning on page    ). The Carbon Board of
Directors was aware of these interests and considered them in approving the merger and merger agreement. 

 Evergreen's Reasons for the Merger  

        Over the past several years Evergreen has developed a substantial asset in the Raton Basin. With over 900 producing wells, daily net gas production in excess of
120 MMcfd and total proved reserves of 1.3 tcf, Evergreen has grown substantially over the past eight years. Evergreen has had substantial success with its business model. 

        The
company's business focus includes the following: 


Unconventional
natural gas plays;


North
American prospects;


Large
acreage positions for economies of scale;


Low
finding and development costs;


Vertical
integration; and


Technical
plays, proven commercial by advances in industry extraction technology. 

        Evergreen's
current business strategy is to enhance shareholder value by increasing reserves, production, revenues, cash flow, earnings and net asset value per share. 

        While
the Raton Basin project has developed into a significant resource and cash flow generator, Evergreen believes that it can continue to add value through the development of other
unconventional gas resource plays using the Raton Basin excess cash flow and technologies to accelerate new basin development. 

        Evergreen
has developed a unique business model in the oil and gas industry. Evergreen has focused entirely on unconventional natural gas resources with the development of its coal bed
methane (CBM) project in southern Colorado and the start of a CBM pilot project in Alaska. The focus will be on unconventional natural gas plays located within North American prospects, emphasizing
the Rocky Mountain region, with large acreage positions and drilling locations, as well as low operating, finding and development costs. The unconventional natural gas resources include CBM, tight gas
sands and fractured shales. These resources have several characteristics that require special attention for successful exploration and production, thus separating them from conventional gas resources. 

        The
United States Energy Information Administration recently noted that due to technological improvements and rising natural gas prices, natural gas production from unconventional
sources is projected to increase more rapidly than conventional gas production. Unconventional gas production is projected to grow from 5.4 trillion cubic feet in 2001 to 9.5 trillion cubic feet in
2025, increasing from 28% of total U.S production in 2001 to 36% in 2025. 

        Successful
unconventional natural gas exploration, development and production are technology-driven operations, and Evergreen is structured to optimize the development of unconventional
natural gas reservoirs. Vertical integration makes Evergreen unique in the industry, as Evergreen has direct control of nearly every phase of its operations. Through various subsidiaries, Evergreen
performs its own well cementing services and fracture stimulation treatments, provides workover completion rigs, designs and constructs its own gas collection lines, owns and operates compressor
stations, and markets its own gas production. This operational control provides Evergreen with a strong competitive edge and efficient
cost structure while also providing the quality control and experimentation that Evergreen believes is necessary to succeed in unconventional natural gas development. 

        Evergreen
believes that the Carbon assets fit nicely into the Evergreen business model for the following reasons: 

United States


Access
to large acreage position in the Piceance and Douglas Creek Arch and Uintah Basins with approximately 150,000 gross acres;


Potential
to increase production and reserves through additional development and exploratory drilling in multiple formations and existing well remediations;


Low
operating, finding and development costs; and


A
proven technical team in place with specific knowledge of the Piceance and Uintah Basins. 

Canada


Good
Canadian acreage position in a known hydrocarbon-bearing sedimentary basin with 77,000 gross acres;


A
proven Canadian management and technical team in place that has demonstrated an ability to create value in Canada;


Opportunity
to increase the value of the Canadian assets through drilling unexploited potential in numerous formations, including coal seams and tight gas sands;


Low
operating, finding and development costs; and


Potential
to consolidate additional acreage in strategic areas. 

        The
acquisition provides Evergreen with diversification into new areas of economic potential outside of its core Raton Basin assets. Evergreen believes it will create additional value in
these areas using its own methods and equipment. 

Opinion of Carbon's Financial Advisor    

        On March 31, 2003, RBC delivered to Carbon's Board an oral opinion (subsequently confirmed in writing) that, as of March 31, 2003 and based upon and
subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in the opinion, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Carbon's common stock. 

THE FULL TEXT OF RBC'S OPINION, DATED MARCH 31, 2003, WHICH SETS FORTH ASSUMPTIONS MADE, MATTERS CONSIDERED AND LIMITATIONS ON THE REVIEW UNDERTAKEN IN CONNECTION
WITH THE OPINION, IS ATTACHED TO THIS DOCUMENT AS APPENDIX B AND IS INCORPORATED INTO THIS DOCUMENT BY REFERENCE. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY READ THE OPINION IN ITS ENTIRETY. RBC'S OPINION IS DIRECTED TO
CARBON'S BOARD, ADDRESSES ONLY THE FAIRNESS, FROM A FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW, OF THE EXCHANGE RATIO TO HOLDERS OF CARBON'S COMMON STOCK AND DOES NOT ADDRESS OTHER TERMS AND AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE
MERGER.

        RBC's
opinion does not address the merits of the underlying decision by Carbon to engage in the transaction, or the relative merits of the transaction compared to any alternative
business strategy or transaction in which Carbon might engage. RBC's opinion was provided for the information and assistance of Carbon's Board and does not constitute a recommendation to any
shareholder as to how such holder should vote on the approval and adoption of the merger agreement or any matter related thereto. RBC does not express any opinion as to the prices at which Carbon's
common stock has traded or will trade following the announcement of the transaction. 

        In
arriving at its opinion, RBC: 


Reviewed
the financial terms of the merger agreement;


Reviewed
and analyzed certain publicly available business, financial and other data with respect to Carbon and Evergreen and certain other relevant historical operating data
relating to Carbon and Evergreen made available to RBC from published sources and from the internal records of Carbon and Evergreen;


Conducted
discussions with members of the senior management of Carbon with respect to the business prospects and financial outlook of Carbon;


Conducted
discussions with members of the senior management of Evergreen with respect to the business prospects and financial outlook of Evergreen and the combined company;


Received
and reviewed financial forecasts prepared by Carbon's management and Evergreen's management on the potential future performance of Carbon and Evergreen,
respectively, each on a stand alone basis, and combined; and


Reviewed
Carbon's and Evergreen's Summary Reserve Reports, each dated December 31, 2002, prepared by their respective independent reserve engineers. 

        In
arriving at its opinion, RBC performed the following analyses in addition to the review and inquiries referred to in the preceding paragraph: 


Reviewed
the reported prices and trading activity for Carbon common stock and Evergreen common stock;


Compared
the implied historical exchange ratios between Evergreen common stock and Carbon common stock with the exchange ratio;


Considered
the relative contribution of Carbon and Evergreen;


Compared
selected market valuation metrics of Carbon, Evergreen and other comparable publicly-traded companies; 


Compared
the financial metrics, to the extent publicly available, of selected precedent transactions; and


Performed
other studies and analyses as it deemed appropriate. 

        In
connection with its review, RBC assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial, legal, tax, operating and other information provided to RBC by Carbon and
Evergreen, and did not independently verify such information. RBC did not perform an independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the respective assets or liabilities of Carbon or Evergreen, and was
not furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. In addition, RBC did not conduct any physical inspection of the property or facilities of Carbon or Evergreen. 

        RBC
has assumed that the merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes. RBC has also assumed, in all respects material to its
analysis, that the representations and warranties of each party contained in the merger agreement are true and correct, that each party will perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be
performed by it under the merger agreement, and that all conditions to the consummation of the merger will be satisfied without waiver thereof. In addition, RBC assumed that, in the course of
obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals for the merger, no restrictions, including any divestiture requirements, will be imposed that would have a material effect on the combined company. 

 RBC's Financial Analysis  

        The following is a presentation of the material financial analyses used by RBC in connection with rendering its opinion. The following summary does not purport to
be a complete description of the analyses performed by RBC. To the extent that the following quantitative information is based on market data, it is based on market data as they existed on
March 28, 2003, and is not necessarily indicative of current conditions. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses below include information in tabular format. The tables alone are not a
complete description of RBC's financial analyses and should be read in conjunction with the text of the analyses. 

 Exchange Ratio and Premium Analysis  

        RBC calculated the ratio of the average market price of Carbon common stock to the average of Evergreen common stock over selected periods ending March 28,
2003. In addition, RBC calculated the implied premium being paid in the merger based on the exchange ratio of 0.275 shares of Evergreen common stock for each share of Carbon common stock relative to
historic implied exchange ratios based on Evergreen and Carbon common stock prices over the selected periods ending March 28, 2003.

 Comparable Public Company Analysis  

        RBC reviewed and compared selected financial information, ratios and public market multiples for Carbon and Evergreen to corresponding financial information,
ratios and public market multiples of eight publicly traded middle capitalization exploration and production companies. The group of comparable companies used in the comparison included: Cimarex
Energy Co., Patina Oil & Gas Corporation, Prima Energy Corporation, Quicksilver Resources Inc., St. Mary Land & Exploration Company, Tom Brown, Inc., Ultra Petroleum Corp.
and Westport Resources Corporation. 

        The
selected companies were chosen because they are publicly traded companies with operations that for the purposes of analysis may be considered similar to Carbon and/or Evergreen. RBC
calculated and compared various financial multiples and ratios. The multiples and ratios were calculated using the closing prices for the common stock of Evergreen and Carbon and each of the selected
companies on March 28, 2003 and were based on the most recent publicly available information and Evergreen and Carbon management forecasts. RBC's analyses of the selected companies compared the
following to the results of Evergreen and Carbon: enterprise value to historical 2002 and forecasted 2003 and 2004 EBITDA, price to historical 2002 and forecasted 2003 and 2004 cash flow, adjusted
enterprise value to historical 2002 and forecasted 2003 and 2004 daily 

production
and adjusted enterprise value to proved reserves. Adjusted enterprise value is defined as enterprise value less book value of non-oil and gas assets and undeveloped acreage.

 Comparable Precedent Merger & Acquisition Analysis  

        RBC compared certain information of selected publicly disclosed acquisitions of exploration and production companies from 2000 through 2003, in which the
consideration paid ranged between $50 million and $1 billion, which RBC considered reasonably comparable to the merger. RBC reviewed 18 public corporate transactions, 17 private
corporate transactions, 13 Rocky Mountain asset transactions and 29 Canadian public corporate transactions. 

        RBC
calculated a range of multiples of enterprise value to latest twelve months ("LTM") EBITDA and adjusted enterprise value to proved reserves and latest twelve months production
implied in these transactions. The range and median results for the comparable transactions are compared to the implied acquisition metrics of the merger below.

 Other Considerations  

        In performing its analyses, RBC made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of RBC, Carbon and Evergreen. Any estimates contained in the analyses performed by RBC are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future
results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses. Additionally, estimates of the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to
reflect the prices at which such businesses or securities might actually be sold. Accordingly, such analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. RBC, Carbon and Evergreen
assume no responsibility for their accuracy. RBC's opinion and RBC's presentation to Carbon's Board were among several factors taken into consideration by Carbon's Board in making its determination to
approve the merger agreement. Consequently, RBC's analyses described above should not be viewed as determinative of the decision of Carbon's Board or Carbon's executive management to engage in the
transaction. 

        The
preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the
application of those methods to the particular circumstances. Therefore, such an opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, RBC did not
attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it, or make any conclusion as to how the results of any given analysis, taken alone, supported its opinion. Accordingly, RBC
believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and the factors considered by it, without considering all of the factors and analyses, would create
a misleading view of the processes underlying RBC's opinion. In addition, in certain of its analyses RBC compared Carbon and the transaction with Evergreen to public companies and to other
transactions that RBC deemed comparable. No public company or transaction utilized by RBC as a comparison is identical to Carbon or to the transaction with Evergreen. An analysis of the results of
such comparisons is not mathematical; rather, it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the comparable companies and
transactions and other factors that could affect the public trading value of the comparable companies or enterprise value of the comparable transactions to which Carbon and the transaction with
Evergreen were being compared. 

        RBC's
opinion was based on circumstances as they existed and could be evaluated on, and the information made available to it at, the date of such opinion and was without regard to any
market, economic, financial, legal or other circumstances or event of any kind or nature which may have existed or occurred after such date. RBC has not undertaken to reaffirm or revise its opinion or
otherwise comment upon any events occurring after the date thereof and does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm the opinion. 

        RBC
was retained to render its opinion on the basis of its experience with mergers and acquisitions in the energy industry in general, and on the basis of its experience with companies
in the exploration and production sector of the energy industry. RBC is a nationally recognized investment banking firm and is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, corporate restructurings, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate
and other purposes. RBC has, in the past, provided financial advisory services to Carbon. In the ordinary course of its business, RBC and its affiliates may actively trade the equity securities of
Carbon and Evergreen for their own account and for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. 

        Pursuant
to the terms of the engagement of RBC, Carbon has agreed to pay RBC an advisory fee of $500,000, payable upon consummation of the transaction, and a fee of $300,000 for
rendering its fairness opinion. The fairness opinion fee is creditable against the transaction fee and payment is not 

contingent
on consummation of the merger. Carbon also has agreed to reimburse RBC for reasonable expenses and to indemnify RBC and related parties against certain liabilities, including liabilities
under the federal securities laws, arising out of its engagement. 

Exchange Ratio    

        Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding share of Carbon common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.275 shares of Evergreen common stock
plus cash instead of any fractional shares of Evergreen common stock that would otherwise be issued. Shares of Carbon common stock held by Carbon, Evergreen or any Evergreen subsidiaries will be
canceled. 

        You
should be aware that the market value of a share of Evergreen common stock will fluctuate and that neither Evergreen nor Carbon can give you any assurance as to what the price of
Evergreen common stock will be when the merger becomes effective or when certificates for those shares are delivered following surrender and exchange of your certificates for shares of Carbon stock.
We urge you to obtain information on the market value of Evergreen common stock that is more recent than that provided in this proxy statement/prospectus. See "Summary Comparative Market Prices and
Dividends" on page     . 

        No
fractional shares of Evergreen common stock will be issued in the merger. If you would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of Evergreen common stock in the merger, you will be
paid an amount
in cash determined by multiplying the fractional part of the share of Evergreen common stock by the average of the closing prices per share of Evergreen common stock on the New York Stock Exchange
(the "NYSE") for the 20 trading days preceding the closing date of the merger as reported daily in 
The Wall Street Journal
. 

Exchange of Carbon Stock Certificates    

        When the merger is completed, without any action on the part of Carbon or the Carbon shareholders, shares of Carbon common stock will be converted into and will
represent the right to receive, upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares as described below, whole shares of Evergreen common stock and cash instead of any fractional share of
Evergreen common stock that would otherwise be issued. Promptly after the merger becomes effective, Evergreen will deliver or mail to you a form of letter of transmittal and instructions for surrender
of your Carbon stock certificates. When you properly surrender your certificates or provide other satisfactory evidence of ownership and return the letter of transmittal duly executed and completed in
accordance with its instructions and any other documents as may be reasonably requested, Evergreen will promptly deliver to you the shares of Evergreen common stock and cash, if any, to which you are
entitled. 

You should not send in your stock certificates until you receive the letter of transmittal and instructions.

        After
the merger is completed, and until surrendered as described above, each outstanding Carbon stock certificate will be deemed for all purposes to represent only the right to receive
the merger consideration. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash payable for fractional shares as part of the merger consideration. With respect to any Carbon stock certificate that has been
lost, stolen or destroyed, Evergreen will pay the merger consideration attributable to the shares represented by such certificate upon receipt of a surety bond in a reasonable amount or other adequate
indemnity, as required in accordance with Evergreen's standard policy, and evidence reasonably satisfactory to Evergreen of ownership of the shares in question. After the merger is completed, Carbon's
transfer books will be closed and no transfer of the shares of Carbon stock outstanding immediately before the time that the merger becomes effective will be made on Evergreen's stock transfer books. 

        To
the extent permitted by law, after the merger becomes effective, you will be entitled to vote at any meeting of Evergreen shareholders the number of whole shares of Evergreen common
stock into which your shares of Carbon stock are converted, regardless of whether you have exchanged your Carbon stock certificates for Evergreen stock certificates. In the event Evergreen declares a
dividend or other distribution on the Evergreen common stock which has a record date after the merger becomes effective, the declaration will include dividends or other distributions on all shares of
Evergreen
common stock issuable under the merger agreement. However, no dividend or other distribution payable to the holders of record of Evergreen common stock will be delivered to you until you surrender
your Carbon stock certificate for exchange as described above. Upon surrender of your Carbon stock certificate, the certificate representing the Evergreen common stock into which your shares of Carbon
stock have been converted, together with cash instead of any fractional share of Evergreen common stock to which you would otherwise be entitled and any undelivered dividends, will be delivered and
paid to you, without interest. 

The Merger Agreement    

 Effective Date and Time of the Merger  

        The merger agreement provides that the closing of the merger will take place as soon as practicable following the satisfaction of the conditions to the completion

must have received agreements from certain affiliates of Carbon concerning their shares of Carbon common stock and the shares of Evergreen common stock to be
received by them;


Evergreen
must have received certain closing certificates from Carbon and legal opinions from Carbon's counsel;


None
of Carbon's properties and assets shall have suffered a casualty loss (meaning a loss, damage or reduction in value resulting from catastrophic occurrences or acts of
God or any other loss which is not a result of normal wear and tear) nor have been taken in condemnation, and no proceeding for such loss shall be pending, such that, when aggregated with inaccuracies
in Carbon's representations and warranties, they would have a material adverse effect (as 

defined
in the merger agreement) after taking into account proceeds of insurance or any condemnation award; 


The
representations and warranties of Carbon concerning the following must be true and correct (except for 
de minimis

inaccuracies):


its
capitalization;


its
and its subsidiaries' organization and authority to conduct business;


its
ownership of its subsidiaries and other equity interests;


its
authorization of, and the binding nature of, the merger agreement;


the
absence of conflict between the transactions in the merger agreement and Carbon's articles of incorporation or bylaws;


actions
taken to exempt the merger from any applicable anti-takeover laws; and


its
labor relations; and


There
must not be inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of Carbon in the merger agreement that, individually or in the aggregate, have or are reasonably likely
to have a material adverse effect on Carbon and its subsidiaries taken as a whole (evaluated without regard to whether the merger is completed). 

 Conduct of Carbon's and Evergreen's Businesses Before the Merger Becoming Effective  

        Except with the consent of Evergreen, until the merger is effective, neither Carbon nor any of its subsidiaries may: 


carry
on its business other than in the usual, regular and ordinary course in substantially the same manner as previously conducted, or establish or acquire any new
subsidiary or engage in any new type of activity or expand any existing activities;


declare,
set aside, make or pay any dividend or other distribution in respect of its capital stock;

or permit the imposition or existence of any lien, charge or encumbrance on any share of stock held by it in any Carbon subsidiary, or permit any such lien, charge or
encumbrance to exist; or waive or release any material right or cancel or compromise any debt or claim, in each case other than in the ordinary course of business;


fail
to comply in any material respect with any laws, regulations, ordinances or governmental actions applicable to it and to the conduct of its business;

the rate of compensation of any of its directors, officers or employees (excluding increases in compensation resulting from the exercise of compensatory stock
options that are outstanding as of the date of the merger agreement) or pay or agree to pay any bonus to, or provide any new employee benefit or incentive to, any of its directors, officers or
employees, except for increases or payments made in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice pursuant to plans or arrangements in effect on the date of the merger agreement;


enter
into or substantially modify (except as provided for in the merger agreement or as may be required by applicable law or regulation) any pension, retirement, stock
option, stock purchase, stock appreciation right, savings, profit sharing, deferred compensation, consulting, bonus, group 

insurance

with any other entity or permit any other entity to merge into it, or consolidate with any other entity; acquire control over any other entity; or liquidate, sell or
otherwise dispose of any assets or acquire any assets other than in the ordinary course of its business consistent with past practices;


solicit
or encourage inquiries or proposals with respect to, furnish any information relating to, or participate in any negotiations or discussions concerning, any
acquisition or purchase of all or a substantial portion of the assets of or a substantial equity interest in, or any recapitalization, liquidation or dissolution involving or a business combination or
similar transaction with, Carbon or any Carbon subsidiary other than as contemplated by the merger agreement; or authorize any officer, director, agent or affiliate of Carbon or any Carbon subsidiary
to do any of the above; or fail to notify Evergreen immediately if any such inquiries or proposals are received, any such information is requested or required, or any such negotiations or discussions
are sought to be initiated; provided, that this paragraph does not apply to furnishing information to or participating in negotiations or discussions with any person that has made, or that the Carbon
Board of Directors determines in good faith is reasonably likely to make, a superior offer if the Carbon Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
that it should take such actions in light of its fiduciary duty to Carbon's shareholders (a superior offer means a proposal or offer to acquire or purchase all or a substantial portion of the assets
of or a substantial equity interest in, or to effect any recapitalization, liquidation or dissolution involving or a business combination or other similar transaction with, Carbon or any Carbon
subsidiary (including, without limitation, a tender offer or exchange offer to purchase Carbon common stock) other than as contemplated by the merger agreement: (a) that did not arise from or
involve a breach or violation by Carbon of any provision of the merger agreement; (b) that the Carbon Board of Directors determines in its good faith judgment, based, among other things, on
advice of its financial advisor, to be more favorable to the Carbon shareholders than the merger; and (c) the financing for the implementation of which, to the extent required, is then
committed as evidenced by a letter of the lender issued to Carbon and provided by Carbon to Evergreen's Board of Directors, which commitment will be subject only to conditions that are usual and
customary for transactions of the type contemplated by the letter, or the Carbon Board of Directors, based among other things on advice of its financial advisor, has a reasonable basis for being
highly confident that the party making such proposal or offer will obtain such financing to the extent required);


enter
into (a) any material agreement, arrangement or commitment not made in the ordinary course of business, (b) any agreement, indenture or other instrument
not made in the ordinary course of business relating to the borrowing of money by Carbon or a Carbon subsidiary or guarantee by Carbon or a Carbon subsidiary of any obligation, (c) any
agreement, arrangement or commitment relating to the employment or severance of a consultant or the employment, severance, election or retention in office of any present or former director, officer or
employee (this clause shall not apply to the election of directors by shareholders or the reappointment of officers in the normal course), or (d) any contract, agreement or understanding with a
labor union;


change
its methods of accounting in effect at December 31, 2002, except as required by changes in generally accepted accounting principals concurred to by Evergreen
(which may not unreasonably withhold its concurrence) or change in any material respect its methods of reporting income and deductions for federal income tax purposes from those used in the 

preparation
of its federal income tax returns for the year ended December 31, 2002, except as required by changes in law or regulation; 


incur
any commitments for capital expenditures or obligations to make capital expenditures in excess of $50,000, for any one expenditure, or $250,000, in the aggregate;


take
any action that would or could reasonably be expected to (a) cause the merger not to constitute a reorganization under Section 386 of the Internal Revenue
Code as determined by Evergreen, (b) result in any inaccuracy of a representation or warranty that would permit termination of the merger agreement or (c) cause any of the conditions
precedent to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement to fail to be satisfied;


dispose
of or acquire any material assets, other than in the ordinary course of its business;


issue
any shares of capital stock (including treasury shares), except pursuant to Carbon's stock option plans with respect to the stock options outstanding as of
March 31, 2003 (or that may become outstanding after March 31, 2003 other than in violation of the merger agreement);


incur
any indebtedness other than in the ordinary course of business; and


agree
to do any of the foregoing. 

        In
addition, Carbon has agreed, among other things: 


to
convene and hold a meeting of shareholders to obtain the necessary vote to approve the merger as soon as reasonably practicable following the effectiveness of Evergreen's
registration statement filed in connection with the merger. Subject to their fiduciary duties, the Carbon Board of Directors will recommend to the Carbon shareholders the approval of the merger
agreement;


to
take such actions as may be reasonably necessary to modify the structure of or to add parties to (so long as such addition is an Evergreen subsidiary) the transactions,
as long as the modification does not change the consideration to be received by Carbon shareholders, abrogate the covenants and other agreements contained in the merger agreement or substantially
delay or impair the prospects of completing the merger;


to
keep Evergreen advised of all material developments relevant to its business prior to completion of the merger;


to
provide Evergreen access to Carbon's books and records;


to
cooperate with Evergreen and its agents with respect to any environmental audits of Carbon's properties;


to
maintain the confidentiality of all information obtained in connection with the merger agreement; and


use
its best efforts to cause all Carbon affiliates to execute and deliver to Evergreen agreements concerning the shares of Evergreen common stock to be received by them as
necessary to promote compliance with federal securities laws. 

        Except
with the consent of Carbon, until the merger is effective, neither Evergreen nor any of its subsidiaries may take any action that would or might be expected to: 


cause
the merger not to constitute a reorganization under Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code;


result
in any inaccuracy of a representation or warranty that would allow termination of the merger agreement; 


cause
any of the conditions precedent to the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement to fail to be satisfied; or


fail
to comply in any material respect with any laws, regulations, ordinances or governmental actions applicable to it and to the conduct of its business. 

        Evergreen
has also agreed, among other things, to keep Carbon advised of all material developments relevant to its business before the completion of the merger, to provide Carbon access
to Evergreen's books and records and to maintain the confidentiality of all information obtained in connection with the merger agreement. 

 Waiver; Amendment; Termination; Expenses  

        Except with respect to any required regulatory approval, Evergreen or Carbon may at any time (whether before or after approval of the merger agreement by the
Carbon shareholders) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party and may waive (a) any inaccuracies of the other party in the representations
or warranties contained in the merger agreement or any document delivered pursuant thereto, (b) compliance with any of the covenants, undertakings or agreements of the other party, or
satisfaction of any of the conditions precedent to its obligations, contained in the merger agreement, or (c) the performance by the other party of any of its obligations set out in the merger
agreement. The parties may also mutually amend or supplement the merger agreement in writing at any time. However, no extension, waiver, amendment or supplement which would reduce the exchange ratio
to be provided to holders of Carbon common stock upon completion of the merger or the payment terms for fractional interests will be made after the Carbon shareholders approve the merger agreement. 

        The
merger agreement may be terminated, and the merger may be abandoned: 


at
any time before the merger becomes effective, by the mutual consent in writing of Evergreen and Carbon;


at
any time before the merger becomes effective, by either party: (a) in the event of a material breach by the other party of any covenant or agreement contained in
the merger agreement; or (b) in the event of an inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the other party contained in the merger agreement that would provide the nonbreaching party the
ability to refuse to complete the merger under the applicable standard in the merger agreement (see "Conditions to the Merger" on page    ); and, in either case, if the breach
or inaccuracy has not been cured by the earlier of 30 days following notice of the breach or inaccuracy to the breaching party or the effective time of the merger;


at
any time before the merger becomes effective, by either party in writing, if any of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the other party to complete the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement cannot be satisfied or fulfilled before the time the merger becomes effective, and the party giving the notice is not in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or undertakings;


at
any time, by either party in writing, if any of the applications for prior approval required to complete the merger are denied, and the time period for appeals and
requests for reconsideration has run;


at
any time, by either party in writing, if the shareholders of Carbon do not approve the merger agreement by the required vote; 


at
any time following October 31, 2003 by either party in writing, if the merger has not yet become effective and the party giving the notice is not in material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or undertakings; and


at
any time prior to 11:59 p.m. on May 10, 2003 by Evergreen in writing, if Evergreen determines in good faith, through review of information disclosed by
Carbon, or as a result of Evergreen's due diligence investigation following the date of the merger agreement, or otherwise, that there exist (a) any conditions which represent or are reasonably
likely to result in a breach of Carbon's representation and warranty regarding environmental matters, (b) any defects in title that would render Carbon's title to any of the properties or
assets less than good and marketable, (c) any contracts or agreements to which Carbon or any of its properties or assets are bound that contain terms that are not typical of similar contracts
dealing with similar subject matter, or (d) any other conditions, defects or circumstances, whether or not relating to Carbon's properties and assets, that would materially and adversely affect
the ownership, use or value of any of Carbon's properties or that would make the financial condition, results of operations, business or business prospects of Carbon and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, materially adversely different from Evergreen's reasonable expectations on the date of execution of the merger agreement. The fact that Carbon has disclosed information to Evergreen will not
prevent Evergreen from terminating the merger agreement pursuant to this paragraph on account of such information. 

        If
the merger agreement is terminated pursuant to any of the provisions described above, both the merger agreement and the plan of merger will become void and have no effect, except that
(a) provisions in the merger agreement relating to confidentiality, the termination fee and expenses will survive the termination and (b) a termination for an uncured breach of a
covenant or agreement or inaccuracy in a representation or warranty will not relieve the breaching party from liability for that breach or inaccuracy. 

        Each
party will pay the expenses it incurs in connection with the merger agreement and the merger. 

Termination Fee    

        In the event that the merger agreement is terminated: 


by
either Carbon or Evergreen because the shareholders of Carbon fail to approve the merger agreement and either (a) at the time of the Carbon shareholders' meeting
or (b) prior to such shareholders' meeting, the Carbon Board of Directors withdraws its recommendation or refuses to recommend to the shareholders of Carbon that they vote to approve the plan
of merger;


by
Evergreen because Carbon has breached its non-solicitation covenant or its covenant to submit the merger to the Carbon shareholders for approval and recommend
approval of the merger agreement to the Carbon shareholders; or


by
Evergreen because (a) Carbon has knowingly breached its representations, warranties or covenants (other than its non-solicitation covenant or its
covenant to submit the merger to the Carbon shareholders for approval and recommend approval of the merger agreement to the Carbon shareholders); (b) all applicable notice and cure periods have
expired; and (c) an overture has been communicated to the Carbon Board of Directors at or before the time of the breach to engage in an agreement or plan to purchase all or a substantial
portion of the assets of, or a substantial equity interest in, Carbon, to effect a recapitalization, liquidation or dissolution involving Carbon or to effect a business combination or similar
transaction with Carbon other than with Evergreen, 

then
Carbon will pay a termination fee of $2,500,000 to Evergreen. 

Interests of Carbon's Directors and Officers in the Merger    

        Some members of Carbon's management and the Carbon Board have interests in the merger that are in addition to or different from their interests as Carbon
shareholders. The Carbon Board was aware of these interests and considered them in approving the merger agreement and the merger. 

 Vesting of Stock Options  

        Directors and executive officers of Carbon have received grants of stock options under Carbon's stock incentive plans. Under the terms of these plans, all
unvested options will vest and become exercisable as a result of Carbon shareholder approval of the merger agreement. As of April 30, 2003, Carbon directors and executive officers held options
to acquire 35,003 shares of Carbon common stock at an average exercise price of $9.1214 that will vest on an accelerated basis. Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding option to acquire Carbon
common stock will be converted into an option to acquire 0.275 shares of Evergreen common stock, and the exercise price will be adjusted correspondingly. Employees of Carbon or a Carbon subsidiary at
the time of the merger ("transferred employees") will be allowed to exercise their Evergreen options by share delivery or cashless exercise, or both, to the extent that such payment methods are
generally available to other holders of Evergreen options. See "Effect on Employee Benefit Plans and OptionsStock Options" on page     . 

 Restricted Stock  

        The executive officers and certain employees of Carbon have received grants of restricted stock awards under Carbon's 1999 Restricted Stock Plan. The restricted
stock vests 33.33% each year over a three-year period from the date of grant. All restricted stock outstanding under this plan becomes fully vested upon a change of control as defined in
the plan, which includes shareholder approval of the merger agreement. Mr. McDonald (President, Chief Executive Officer and a director of Carbon) and Kevin D. Struzeski (Chief Financial Officer
of Carbon) own 10,001 and 7,501 shares of restricted stock of Carbon, respectively, as to which vesting will be accelerated if the shareholders of Carbon approve the merger agreement. 

 Carbon Employment Agreements  

        In October 1999, Patrick R. McDonald and Carbon entered into a three-year employment agreement which provided for Mr. McDonald to be the
President and Chief Executive
Officer of Carbon. This employment agreement was renewed in October 2002 by the parties entering into a new three-year employment agreement with similar terms. Either Carbon or
Mr. McDonald may terminate the agreement if there is a change in control of Carbon as defined in the employment agreement. A change in control includes shareholder approval of the merger
agreement. In the event of a change in control supported by the Board of Directors, Mr. McDonald is to be paid 300% of his average annual compensation upon termination of the employment
agreement by Carbon or Mr. McDonald. In the event of a change in control not supported by a majority of the Board of Directors, Mr. McDonald is to be paid 400% of his average annual
compensation upon termination of the employment agreement by Carbon or Mr. McDonald. For this purpose, Mr. McDonald's compensation means the arithmetic average of Mr. McDonald's
annual base salary and incentive compensation for the three years prior to termination of his employment, which is currently approximately $610,000 (which is multiplied by a percentage stated above if
his employment is terminated after shareholder approval of the merger). In addition, upon a change in control, the employment agreement provides that any outstanding stock options and incentive awards
(including restricted stock) granted to Mr. McDonald become 100% vested, without any restrictions. 

        In
October 1999, Carbon entered into a two-year employment agreement with Mr. Struzeski, which provides for Mr. Struzeski to be the Chief Financial
Officer of Carbon. The initial two-year term ended 

in
October 2001, after which the agreement continues from year to year unless Carbon or Mr. Struzeski gives a written notice of termination at least three months preceding the date of
termination. The employment agreement with Mr. Struzeski provides that either Carbon or Mr. Struzeski may terminate the contract if there is a change in control of Carbon, which includes
shareholder approval of the merger agreement. In the event of a change in control supported by the Board of Directors, Mr. Struzeski is to be paid 200% of his average annual compensation upon
termination of his employment agreement by Carbon or 100% of his average annual compensation upon termination of his employment by him. In the event of a change in control not supported by a majority
of the Board of Directors, Mr. Struzeski is to be paid 300% of his average annual compensation upon termination of the employment agreement. Mr. Struzeski's compensation for this purpose
is an annualized amount of base salary and incentive compensation which is equal to approximately $277,000 (which is multiplied by a percentage stated above if his employment is terminated after
shareholder approval of the merger). His employment agreement also provides that, in the event of a change in control, any outstanding stock options, stock appreciation rights and incentive awards
(including restricted stock) granted to Mr. Struzeski will become 100% vested, without restrictions. 

        In
addition, Carbon has entered into employment agreements with six other employees, including three Canadian employees. These agreements provide for severance benefits in the event of a
change in control of Carbon followed by termination of the employee's employment. The severance benefits range from 100% to 200% of the employee's average annual compensation upon termination of
employment following a change in control supported by the Board of Directors and from 200% to 300% of the employee's average annual compensation upon termination of employment following a change in
control not supported by the Board of Directors. These employment agreements also generally provide that in the event of a change in control, any outstanding stock options, stock appreciation rights
and incentive awards (including restricted stock) granted to the employee will become 100% vested, without restrictions. 

 Voting Agreements  

        Evergreen has entered into voting agreements with each of Yorktown Energy Partners III, L.P., the largest shareholder of Carbon, and Patrick R. McDonald, Carbon's
President and Chief Executive Officer. Pursuant to the voting agreements, Yorktown and Mr. McDonald have agreed to vote their shares in favor of adoption and approval of the merger agreement
and against any action that could delay, postpone or impair the completion of the merger. The voting agreements also state that the voting agreements will not be construed to require Yorktown or
Mr. McDonald to take any action or fail to take any action that the party determines in good faith, after consulting with legal counsel, would be in violation of any applicable law or legal
duty. In addition, Yorktown and Mr. McDonald have agreed not to transfer or dispose of their shares prior to the effective date of the merger or termination of the merger agreement. 

 Registration Rights Agreement  

        Pursuant to a registration rights agreement, Evergreen has agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC within 45 days after the effective
date of the merger to register for one year the resale of the shares to be received in the merger by Yorktown and its limited partners and Mr. McDonald and entities related to him. Evergreen is
to maintain the registration statement in effect for a period of one year from the date of effectiveness. 

 Indemnification of Directors and Officers  

        The merger agreement provides that Evergreen or one of its subsidiaries will maintain for three years after the merger becomes effective directors' and officers'
liability insurance covering directors and officers of Carbon for acts or omissions occurring before the merger becomes effective. This 

insurance
will provide at least the same coverage and amounts as contained in Carbon's policy on the date of the merger agreement, unless the annual premium on the policy for the first year of such
coverage would exceed 125% of the annual premium payments on Carbon's policy, and for any subsequent year exceed 125% of the premium for the immediately preceding year, in which case Evergreen would
maintain the most advantageous policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance obtainable for such year for a premium equal to that amount. Evergreen has also agreed to indemnify all
individuals who are or have been officers, directors or employees of Carbon or a Carbon subsidiary before the merger becomes effective from any acts or omissions in such capacities before the merger
becomes effective to the extent such indemnification is permitted by Carbon's articles of incorporation and bylaws at the date of the merger agreement and the CBCA. 

Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger    

        The following is a summary of the material anticipated federal income tax consequences of the merger generally applicable to the shareholders of Carbon and to
Evergreen and Carbon. This summary is not intended to be a complete description of all of the federal income tax consequences of the merger. No information is provided with respect to the tax
consequences of the merger under any other tax laws, including applicable state, local and foreign tax laws. In addition, the following discussion may not be applicable with respect to certain
specific categories of shareholders, including but not limited to: 


corporations,
trusts, dealers in securities, financial institutions, insurance companies or tax exempt organizations;


persons
who are not United States citizens or resident aliens or domestic entities (partnerships or trusts);


persons
who are subject to alternative minimum tax (to the extent that tax affects the tax consequences of the merger), who elect to apply a
mark-to-market method of accounting, or who are subject to the "golden parachute" provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (to the extent that tax affects the tax consequences
of the merger);


persons
who acquired Carbon stock pursuant to employee stock options or otherwise as compensation if such shares are subject to any restriction related to employment;


persons
who do not hold their shares as capital assets; or


persons
who hold their shares as part of a "hedge," "constructive sale," "straddle," "conversion transaction or similar integrated transaction." 

        No
ruling has been or will be requested from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the tax effects of the merger. The federal income tax laws are complex, and a shareholder's
individual circumstances may affect the tax consequences to the shareholder. Consequently, each Carbon shareholder is urged to consult his or her own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences,
including the applicable United States federal, state, local, and foreign tax consequences, of the merger to him or her. 

 Tax Consequences of the Merger Generally  

        In the opinion of Berenbaum, Weinshienk & Eason, P.C., counsel to Evergreen: 


the
merger will constitute a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; 


each
of Evergreen, Evergreen Merger Corporation and Carbon will be a party to that reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended;


no
gain or loss will be recognized by Evergreen, Evergreen Merger Corporation or Carbon by reason of the merger;


the
shareholders of Carbon will recognize no gain or loss for federal income tax purposes to the extent Evergreen common stock is actually received in the merger in exchange
for Carbon common stock;


a
shareholder of Carbon who receives cash instead of a fractional share of Evergreen common stock will recognize gain or loss as if the shareholder was deemed to receive the
fractional share and such fractional share was then redeemed for cash in an amount equal to the amount paid by Evergreen in respect of the fractional share, provided that such redemption is treated as
an exchange under Section 302 of the Internal Revenue Code;


the
tax basis in the Evergreen common stock received by a shareholder (including any fractional share interest deemed received) will be the same as the tax basis in the
Carbon common stock surrendered in exchange; and


the
holding period for Evergreen common stock received (including any fractional share interest deemed received) in exchange for shares of Carbon common stock will include
the period during which the shareholder held the shares of Carbon common stock surrendered in exchange, provided that the Carbon common stock was held as a capital asset at the time the merger becomes
effective. 

        The
completion of the merger is conditioned upon the receipt by Evergreen and Carbon of the legal opinion of Evergreen's legal counsel, dated as of the date the merger is completed, to
the effect of the first and fourth bulleted items described above. Neither party intends to waive this condition. 

 Cash Received Instead of a Fractional Share of Evergreen Common Stock  

        A shareholder of Carbon who receives cash instead of a fractional share of Evergreen common stock will be treated as having received the fractional share pursuant
to the merger and then as having exchanged the fractional share for cash in a redemption by Evergreen, provided that such redemption is treated as an exchange under Section 302 of the Internal
Revenue Code. As a result, a Carbon shareholder will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and the portion of the basis of the shares of
Evergreen common stock allocable to his or her fractional interest. This gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if, as of the date
of the exchange, the holding period for such shares is greater than one year. Long-term capital gain of a non-corporate holder is generally subject to tax at a maximum federal
tax rate of 20%. 

 Backup Withholding and Information Reporting  

        Payments of cash to a holder surrendering shares of Carbon stock will be subject to information reporting and backup withholding (whether or not the holder also
receives Evergreen common stock) at a rate of 30% of the cash payable to the holder, unless the holder furnishes its taxpayer identification number in the manner prescribed in applicable Treasury
Regulations, certifies that such number is correct, certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding and meets certain other conditions. Penalties apply for failure to furnish correct
information and for failure to include reportable payments in income. Any amounts withheld from payments to a holder under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or credit against
the holder's United States federal income tax liability, provided the required information is furnished to the Internal Revenue Service. 

Each
holder of Carbon common stock should consult with his own tax advisor as to this qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such exemption. 

Tax matters are very complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to each holder of Carbon common stock will depend on the facts of that shareholder's
particular situation. The United States federal income tax discussion set forth above does not address all United States federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a particular holder and
may not be applicable to holders in special situations. Holders of Carbon common stock are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific tax consequences of the
merger.

Material Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations    

        In the opinion of Burnet Duckworth & Palmer LLP, counsel to Evergreen, the following is a summary of the principal Canadian federal income tax
considerations under the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the "Tax Act"), as of the date hereof, generally applicable to a shareholder of Carbon in respect of merger who, at all relevant times, for the
purposes of the Tax Act and any applicable income tax treaty or convention, (i) is, or is deemed to be, resident in Canada, (ii) in respect of whom neither Carbon nor Evergreen is a
foreign affiliate; (iii) deals at arm's length with Carbon and Evergreen; (iv) is not affiliated with Carbon or Evergreen and (v) holds Carbon shares as capital property. Carbon
shares generally will be considered capital property to such a shareholder unless the shareholder holds such Carbon shares in the course of carrying on a business, or the shareholder has acquired them
in a transaction or transactions considered to be an adventure in the nature of trade. Carbon shares are not Canadian securities (as defined in the Tax Act) and therefore an election in accordance
with subsection 39(4) of the Tax Act is not available in respect of such shares. This summary does not apply to Carbon shareholders who are "financial institutions", "specified financial institutions"
or an interest in which would be a "tax shelter investment" each as defined in the Tax Act. 

        The
summary is based on the provisions of the Tax Act in force on the date hereof and counsel's understanding of the current published administrative practices of the Canada Customs and
Revenue Agency (the "CCRA"). The CCRA has a long standing administrative practice which applies to various corporate reorganizations where cash is paid in lieu of issuing fractional shares. While this
practice has not been specifically approved for the type of transaction described herein, it is anticipated and this opinion assumes that such practice will be adopted by the CCRA and made applicable
to this type of transaction The summary takes into account all specific proposals to amend the Tax Act which have been publicly announced by or on behalf of the Minister of Finance (Canada) prior to
the date hereof (the "Proposed Amendments") and assumes that all such Proposed Amendments will be enacted in their present form. No assurances can be given that the Proposed Amendments will be enacted
in the form proposed, if at all. The summary does not otherwise take into account or anticipate any changes in law, whether by judicial, governmental or legislative decision or action or changes in
administrative practices of the CCRA (save as noted above), nor does it take into account provincial, territorial or foreign income tax legislation or considerations. The provisions of provincial
income tax legislation vary from province to province in Canada and in some cases differ from federal income tax legislation. 

 Disposition of Carbon Shares in Exchange for Evergreen Shares  

        A holder of Carbon shares who receives Evergreen shares in exchange for Carbon shares pursuant to the merger will, unless the holder elects in a tax return for
the taxation year in which the merger takes place not to have this provision apply, be deemed to have disposed of such Carbon shares for proceeds of disposition equal to the holder's adjusted cost
base and consequently will realize neither a gain or loss as a result of such disposition. The holder will be deemed to acquire the Evergreen shares at a cost equal to such proceeds and will generally
be required to average such cost with the cost of any other Evergreen shares held as capital property for the purpose of determining the adjusted cost base of each Evergreen share held. 

        A
holder of Carbon shares who receives less than Cdn$200 cash in lieu of a fraction of an Evergreen share pursuant to the merger may, choose to reduce the cost of the Evergreen shares
acquired by the amount of such cash or recognize a gain (or loss) equal to the amount by which the cash exceeds (or is less than) the adjusted cost base of the applicable Carbon shares. 

        A
holder of Carbon shares who receives Evergreen shares (including a holder who receives cash in lieu of a faction of an Evergreen share) in exchange for Carbon shares pursuant to the
merger and who elects in a tax return for the taxation year in which the merger takes place not to have the provisions noted above apply, will be deemed to have disposed of such Carbon shares for
proceeds of disposition equal to their fair market and to have acquired the Evergreen shares for the same amount (less any cash received in lieu of a fraction of share). The holder will generally be
required to average such cost with the cost of any other Evergreen shares held as capital property for the purpose of determining the adjusted cost base of each Evergreen share held. Such a
shareholder will be required to include one-half of the amount of any capital gain (a "taxable capital gain") in income, and one-half of the amount of any capital loss (an
"allowable capital loss") will be required to be deducted against taxable capital gains realized in the year of disposition. Allowable capital losses not deducted in the taxation year in which they
are realized may ordinarily be carried back and deducted in any of the three preceding years or carried forward and deducted in any following year against taxable capital gains realized in such years,
to the extent and under the circumstances specified in the Tax Act. 

        A
Shareholder that is, throughout the relevant taxation year, a "Canadian-controlled private corporation" (as defined in the Tax Act) may be liable to pay an additional refundable tax of

/

% on its "aggregate investment income" for the year, which is defined to include an amount in respect of taxable capital gains. 80% of capital gains realized by an individual or a
trust, other than certain specified trusts, will be taken into account in determining liability for alternative minimum tax under the Tax Act. 

The summary is of a general nature only and is not exhaustive of all possible Canadian federal income tax considerations and is not intended to be, nor should it
be construed to be, legal, business or tax advice or representations to any particular Carbon shareholder. Accordingly, Carbon shareholders should consult their own tax advisors with respect to their
particular circumstances, including the application and effect of the income and other tax laws of any country, province, state or local tax authority.

Regulatory Considerations    

        No filing under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, is required in connection with the merger. Neither Carbon nor
Evergreen is aware of a material U.S. governmental or regulatory approval required for completion of the merger, other than compliance with the applicable corporate laws of Colorado. 

        No
filing under Canada's Competition Act or application for review under Canada's Investment Canada Act are anticipated to be required in connection with the merger. The parties are not
aware of a material Canadian governmental or regulatory approval required for the completion of the merger. 

Accounting Treatment    

        Under purchase accounting, Evergreen would record the acquired identifiable assets and liabilities assumed at their fair market value at the time the merger is
completed. Any excess of the cost of Carbon over the sum of the fair values of tangible and identifiable intangible assets would be recorded as goodwill. Evergreen's reported income would include the
operations of Carbon after the merger. Financial statements of Evergreen issued after completion of the merger would reflect the impact of the merger with Carbon. Financial statements of Evergreen
issued before completion of the merger would not be restated retroactively to reflect Carbon's historical financial position or results of 

operations.
The unaudited pro forma financial information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus has been prepared using the purchase method of accounting. See "SummaryComparative

Effect on Employee Benefit Plans and Stock Options    

 Employee Benefit Plans  

        Each transferred employee will become an employee of Evergreen or an Evergreen subsidiary (an "Evergreen employer"). As of a date (the "benefit plan date")
determined by Evergreen with respect to the 401(k) plan and separately with respect to each other plan or program of Carbon, and to be not later than the first day following the calendar year during
which Carbon is merged into Evergreen or an Evergreen subsidiary, Evergreen will cause Carbon's 401(k) plan either to be merged with Evergreen's 401(k) plan or to be frozen or terminated, as
determined by Evergreen and subject to receipt of applicable regulatory or governmental approvals. Each transferred employee who is a participant in Carbon's 401(k) plan at the time the merger becomes
effective and continues in the employment of an Evergreen employer until the benefit plan date will be eligible to participate in Evergreen's 401(k) plan as of the benefit plan date. All rights to
participate in Evergreen's 401(k) plan are subject to Evergreen's right to amend or terminate the plan. Evergreen will maintain Carbon's 401(k) plan and any related supplemental plans for the benefit
of participating employees until the benefit plan date. In administering Evergreen's 401(k) plan, service with Carbon and its subsidiaries will be deemed to be service with Evergreen for participation
and vesting purposes, but not for purposes of benefit accrual. 

        Each
transferred employee will be eligible to participate in group hospitalization, medical, dental, life, disability and other welfare benefit plans and programs available to employees
of the Evergreen employer as of the benefit plan date with respect to each such plan or program, conditional upon the transferred employee's being employed by the Evergreen employer as of the benefit
plan date and subject to complying with eligibility requirements of the respective plans and programs. With respect to any plan or program of Carbon that the Evergreen employer determines in its
discretion provides benefits of the same type or class as a corresponding plan or program maintained by the Evergreen employer, Evergreen will cause the Evergreen employer to continue the Carbon
welfare plans and programs in effect for the benefit of the transferred employees so long as they remain eligible to participate and until they become eligible to participate in the corresponding plan
or program maintained by the Evergreen employer (and, with respect to any such plan or program, subject to complying with eligibility requirements and subject to the right of the Evergreen employer to
terminate the plan or program). For purposes of administering these plans and programs, service with Carbon will be deemed to be service with the Evergreen employer for the purpose of determining
eligibility to participate and vesting (if applicable), but not for purposes of computing benefits, if any, determined in whole or in part with reference to service. 

        Except
to the extent of contractual commitments specifically made or assumed by Evergreen, all transferred employees will be employees at will (to the extent permitted by applicable law)
of the Evergreen employer, and no Evergreen employer will have any obligation arising from the merger to continue any transferred employees in its employ or in any specific job or to provide to any
transferred employee any specified level of compensation or any incentive payments, benefits or perquisites. Each transferred employee who is terminated by an Evergreen employer after the merger
becomes effective, excluding any employee who has a then-existing contract providing for severance, will be entitled to severance pay in accordance with the special severance policy
adopted by Evergreen for transferred employees, if and to the extent that the employee is entitled to severance pay under the applicable policy. Such an employee's service with Carbon will be
aggregated with Evergreen service for purposes of determining the amount of severance pay, if any, under the applicable severance policy. 

        Evergreen
has agreed to honor all employment agreements, severance agreements and deferred compensation agreements that Carbon and its subsidiaries have with their current and former
employees and directors and which have been disclosed to Evergreen pursuant to the merger agreement, except to the extent any agreements are superseded or terminated when the merger becomes effective
or thereafter. Except as these agreements may provide otherwise, and except as otherwise described above, the employee benefit plans of Carbon will be frozen, terminated or merged into comparable
plans of Evergreen, as Evergreen may determine in its sole discretion. 

 Stock Options  

        At the time the merger becomes effective, each then outstanding stock option granted under Carbon's various stock option plans will be converted into rights with
respect to Evergreen common stock. Unless it elects to substitute options as described below, Evergreen will assume each of these stock options in accordance with the terms of the Carbon plan, except
that: (a) Evergreen and the compensation committee of the Evergreen Board will be substituted for Carbon and its committee with respect to administering its stock option plan; (b) each
stock option may be exercised solely for shares of Evergreen common stock; (c) the number of shares of Evergreen common stock subject to each stock option will be the number of whole shares
(omitting any fractional share) determined by multiplying the number of shares of Carbon common stock subject to the stock option by the exchange ratio in the merger and (d) the per share
exercise price for each stock option will be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price for the stock option by the exchange ratio in the merger and rounding up to the nearest cent. 

        As
an alternative to converting the stock options, Evergreen may choose to substitute options under the Evergreen Resources, Inc. 2000 Stock Incentive Plan or any other comparable
plan for all or a part of the Carbon stock options, subject to the adjustments described in (c) and (d) in the preceding paragraph, and further subject to the condition that such
modification will not constitute a modification, extension or renewal of any of the stock options. Except as provided above, the substituted options will continue
in effect on the same terms and conditions provided in Carbon's stock option plans and the stock option agreements relating to the options. 

        Pursuant
to a letter agreement between Carbon and Evergreen, Evergreen will allow transferred employees the opportunity to exercise stock options by (a) delivering shares of
Evergreen common stock owned by the transferred employee at the time of exercise for a period of at least six months; or (b) delivering written notice of exercise to Evergreen and delivering to
a broker written notice of exercise and irrevocable instructions to promptly deliver to Evergreen the amount of sale or loan proceeds to pay the option price, or a combination of both methods, to the
extent and so long as Evergreen continues to offer such methods to Evergreen option holders in general. 

        Each
grant of a converted or substitute option to any individual who will be a director or officer of Evergreen (as construed under Rule 16b-3 of the SEC) will, as a
condition to such conversion or substitution, be approved in accordance with the provisions of Rule 16b-3. Each incentive stock option will be adjusted as required by
Section 424 of the Internal Revenue Code, and the related regulations, so that it continues to be an incentive stock option, and so that it will not constitute a modification, extension or
renewal of the option within the meaning of Section 424(h) of the Internal Revenue Code. 

        Evergreen
has reserved and will continue to reserve adequate shares of Evergreen common stock for the exercise of any converted or substitute options. As soon as practicable after the
merger, if it has not already done so, and to the extent Carbon has a registration statement in effect or an obligation to file a registration statement, Evergreen will file a
registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the shares of Evergreen common stock subject to converted or substitute options, and Evergreen will use its reasonable efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement (and maintain the current status of the related prospectus or prospectuses) for so long as the converted or 

substitute
options remain outstanding. With respect to those directors and officers, if any, who following the merger may be subject to the reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Evergreen will administer the assumed Carbon stock option plan (or the Evergreen option plan, if applicable) in a manner that complies with
Rule 16b-3 of the SEC to the extent necessary to preserve the benefits of Rule 16b-3 to the extent such benefits were available to these officers and directors
prior to the effective time of the merger. 

        Based
on stock options outstanding as of the record date, options to purchase an aggregate of approximately            shares of Carbon common stock may be outstanding at the
effective time of the merger. Any shares of Carbon common stock issued pursuant to the exercise of stock options under the stock option plans before the effective time of the merger will be converted
into shares of Evergreen common stock in the same manner as other outstanding shares of Carbon common stock. 

        Evergreen
will deliver to each Carbon employee who receives converted or substitute options an appropriate notice setting forth the employee's rights with respect to the converted or
substitute options. 

        Eligibility
to receive stock option grants after the merger will be determined by Evergreen in accordance with its plans and procedures and subject to any contractual obligations. 

Severance Agreements    

        Pursuant to a letter agreement between Carbon and Evergreen, if Evergreen terminates any transferred employee who does not have an existing agreement providing
for severance without fault of the transferred employee within one year after the effective time of the merger, the transferred employee will be entitled to a special severance benefit equal to the
transferred employee's monthly base salary payable for the number of months following his or her termination equal to the number of years of combined continuous service of the transferred employee
with Carbon and Evergreen. The letter agreement covers only those employees who are not otherwise a party to an agreement that provides severance payments and, accordingly, does not cover Carbon's
executive officers. A transferred employee with less than three years of continuous service will be deemed to have three years of service, and the "monthly base salary" will be the annual base salary
immediately prior to the termination divided by 12. Terminated employees will be entitled to partial months' severance benefits for partial years of continuous service. Both a voluntary termination by
the transferred employee and a termination by Evergreen due to the transferred employee's failure to perform his or her job in accordance with reasonable performance standards established by Evergreen
will be deemed to be a termination due to fault of the transferred employee. The severance benefit will no longer be available in the event that the employment of a transferred employee is transferred
to a new employer pursuant to a sale of assets by Evergreen to an unrelated entity. 

Restrictions on Resales by Affiliates    

        The shares of Evergreen common stock to be issued in the merger will be registered under the Securities Act and will be freely transferable, except any shares
received by any shareholder who may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Carbon at the effective time of the merger for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. Affiliates of Carbon may sell
their shares of Evergreen common stock acquired in the merger only in transactions registered under the Securities Act or permitted by the resale provisions of Rule 145 under the Securities Act
or as otherwise permitted by the Securities Act. Persons who may be deemed affiliates of Carbon generally include individuals or entities that directly, or indirectly through one or more
intermediaries, control, are controlled by or are under common control with Carbon and include directors and certain executive officers of Carbon. The restrictions on resales by an affiliate extend
also to related parties of the affiliate, including parties related by marriage who live in the same home as the affiliate. 

        Carbon
has agreed to use its best efforts to cause each of its affiliates to deliver to Evergreen a written agreement to the effect generally that he or she will not offer to sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of Evergreen common stock issued to that person in the merger, except in compliance with the Securities Act and the related rules and regulations. 

        These
restrictions will be set forth in a legend on certificates issued to such affiliates pursuant to the merger. 

        As
a condition to the merger, Evergreen will enter into registration rights agreements with each of Yorktown Energy Partners III, L.P. and with Patrick R. McDonald and entities related
to him, providing for the registration of the resale of the shares of Evergreen common stock acquired in the merger by Yorktown and its limited partners and by Mr. McDonald and such entities. 

Rights of Dissenting Shareholders    

        Carbon shareholders will not have any right to dissent from the merger and demand an appraisal of their shares of Evergreen common stock. 

INFORMATION ABOUT EVERGREEN    

General    

        Evergreen is a Colorado corporation organized on January 14, 1981 and engaged in the operation, development, production, exploration and acquisition of
unconventional natural gas properties. Evergreen is one of the leading developers of coal bed methane reserves in the United States. Its current operations are principally focused on developing and
expanding its coal bed methane project located in the Raton Basin in southern Colorado. The Company has also acquired a significant acreage position in Kansas and has begun a coal bed methane project
in southern Alaska. 

        Evergreen
is one of the largest holders of oil and gas leases in the Raton Basin. Evergreen holds interests in approximately 325,000 gross acres of coal bed methane properties in the
basin. At December 31, 2002, Evergreen had estimated net proved reserves of 1.24 Tcf, 64% of which were proved developed, with a present value of future net reserves, or PV-10, of
approximately $1.6 billion. Evergreen's net daily gas sales for the month of December 2002 were approximately 114 MMcf from a total of 837 net producing wells. Evergreen's Raton Basin
drilling program has enabled Evergreen to build an extensive inventory of additional drilling locations. Evergreen has identified at least 700 additional drilling locations on its Raton Basin acreage,
of which 377 were included in its estimated proved reserve base at December 31, 2002. Evergreen operates and has a 100% working interest in substantially all of its Raton Basin acreage and
wells. 

        Since
Evergreen began its drilling efforts in the Raton Basin, Evergreen has drilled more than 650 wells and achieved a success rate of approximately 98%. In addition, Evergreen has
acquired over 250 producing wells in the Raton Basin since the beginning of the Raton Basin project. From March 31, 1995 through December 31, 2002, Evergreen grew its estimated proved
reserves from 58 Bcf to 1,239 Bcf, which represents a compound annual growth rate of approximately 48%. During the same period, Evergreen's net daily gas sales increased from just over one MMcf to
approximately 114 MMcf. 

        Evergreen's
management believes Evergreen's success in the Raton Basin has enabled Evergreen to become one of the lowest-cost finders, developers and producers among United
States publicly-traded independent oil and gas companies. From the beginning of Evergreen's Raton Basin project through December 31, 2002, Evergreen has spent approximately $330 million
on the drilling and completion of its wells, pipelines, gas collection systems and compression equipment, and $244 million on the acquisition of additional properties. This represents an
estimated total finding and development cost of $0.33 per proved Mcf excluding acquisitions and $0.44 per proved Mcf including acquisitions. 

        In
2001, Evergreen acquired a 100% working interest in approximately 64,000 gross acres of prospective coal bed methane properties in Alaska. The acreage is located in the Cook
Inlet-Susitna Basin approximately 30 miles north of Anchorage. Evergreen began drilling operations in Alaska in late October 2002. By year-end, Evergreen had drilled two
four-well pilot projects. All eight wells penetrated coal seams with aggregate thicknesses in excess of 100 feet. Completion and production testing operations are expected to be completed
in the spring of 2003.

DESCRIPTION OF EVERGREEN CAPITAL STOCK    

General    

        The authorized capital stock of Evergreen consists of 50,000,000 shares of Evergreen common stock, no par value, and 24,900,000 shares of preferred stock, no par
value. As of April 30, 2003, there were 19,339,170 shares of Evergreen common stock issued and outstanding. There were no shares of Evergreen preferred stock issued and outstanding as of such
date. Based on the number of shares of Carbon common stock outstanding at the record date, it is estimated that approximately            shares of Evergreen common stock would be issued in
the
merger. 

Evergreen Common Stock    

        Holders of shares of Evergreen common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders. There are
no cumulative voting rights with respect to the election of directors. Accordingly, the holder or holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Evergreen common stock will be able to elect
Evergreen's entire Board of Directors. Holders of Evergreen common stock have no preemptive rights and are entitled to such dividends as may be declared by the Board of Directors out of legally
available funds. Evergreen common stock is not entitled to any sinking fund, redemption or conversion provisions. If Evergreen liquidates, dissolves or winds up its business, the holders of Evergreen
common stock will be entitled to share ratably in Evergreen's net assets remaining after the payment of all creditors, if any, and the liquidation preferences of any preferred shareholders. When
issued to Carbon shareholders pursuant to the merger agreement, the shares of Evergreen common stock will be fully paid and nonassessable. The common stock is currently listed on the NYSE. The
transfer agent and registrar for the common stock is Computershare Investor Services, L.L.C. 

Evergreen Preferred Stock    

        The Evergreen Board of Directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and has the authority to fix the voting, conversion,
dividend, redemption, liquidation and other rights, preferences, privileges and qualifications of the preferred stock, all without any further vote or action by Evergreen's shareholders. The issuance
of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to holders of Evergreen common stock, and adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting
rights, of such holders. 

        The
issuance of shares of Evergreen preferred stock, or the issuance of rights to purchase shares, could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal. For instance, the
issuance of a series of preferred stock might impede a business combination by including class or series voting rights that would enable the holders to block such a transaction, or might facilitate a
business combination by including voting rights that would provide a required percentage vote of the shareholders. In addition, under certain circumstances, the issuance of Evergreen preferred stock
could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of Evergreen common stock. Although Evergreen's Board of Directors is required to make any determination to issue such stock based on its
judgment as to the best interests of Evergreen's shareholders, the Board could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some or even a majority of the
shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then market price of such stock. The Board of Directors does not at
present intend to seek shareholder approval prior to any issuance of currently authorized stock, unless otherwise required by law or the rules of any market on which Evergreen's securities are traded. 

Shareholder Rights Plan    

        On July 7, 1997, Evergreen's Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights plan pursuant to which stock purchase rights were distributed as a dividend to
Evergreen's common shareholders at a rate of one right for each share of common stock held of record as of July 22, 1997 and for each share of stock issued thereafter. The rights plan is
designed to enhance the Board's ability to prevent an acquiror from depriving shareholders of the long-term value of their investment and to protect shareholders against attempts to
acquire Evergreen by means of unfair or abusive takeover tactics that have been prevalent in many unsolicited takeover attempts. 

        Under
the rights plan, the rights will become exercisable only if a person or a group (except for those who held 20% or more of Evergreen's outstanding stock when the rights plan was
adopted) acquires or
commences a tender offer for 20% or more of Evergreen's common stock. Until they become exercisable, the rights attach to and trade with Evergreen common stock. The rights will expire July 22,
2007. The rights may be redeemed by the continuing members of the Board at $.001 per right prior to the day after a person or group has accumulated 20% or more of the common stock. If a person or
group acquired 20% of Evergreen's outstanding common stock, the rights would then be modified to represent the right to receive, for the exercise price, common stock having a value worth twice the
exercise price. If Evergreen were involved in a merger or other business combination at any time after a person or group has acquired 20% or more of Evergreen's common stock, the rights would entitle
a holder to buy a number of shares of common stock of the acquiring entity having a market value of twice the exercise price of each right. All rights held or acquired by a person or group holding 20%
or more of Evergreen's shares are void. The rights are not triggered by continued stock ownership of those who held 20% or more of Evergreen's stock when the rights plan was adopted, unless these
shareholders increase their holdings in Evergreen above 30%. 

Other Anti-Takeover Provisions    

        Evergreen's articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of
Evergreen. These provisions, among other things, provide for a Board of Directors with staggered terms and noncumulative voting in the election of directors and impose certain procedural requirements
on shareholders who wish to make nominations for the election of directors or propose other actions at shareholders' meetings. 

        In
addition, Evergreen's articles of incorporation authorize the Board to issue up to 24,900,000 shares of preferred stock without shareholder approval and to set the rights, preferences
and other designations, including voting rights, of those shares as the Board of Directors may determine. These provisions, alone or in combination with each other and with the shareholder rights plan
described above, may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control of Evergreen, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing
market prices to holders of common stock. 

COMPARISON OF THE RIGHTS OF EVERGREEN
  SHAREHOLDERS AND CARBON SHAREHOLDERS    

        When the merger becomes effective, holders of Carbon common stock will become shareholders of Evergreen. The following is a summary of material differences
between the rights of holders of Evergreen common stock and holders of Carbon common stock. Since Evergreen and Carbon are both organized under the laws of the State of Colorado, the differences in
the rights of holders of Evergreen common stock and those of holders of Carbon common stock arise only from differing provisions of their respective articles of incorporation and bylaws and from
Evergreen's shareholder rights plan. 

        The
following summary does not purport to be a complete statement of the provisions affecting, and differences between, the rights of holders of Evergreen common stock and holders of
Carbon common stock. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the governing corporate instruments of Evergreen and Carbon, to which the shareholders of Carbon are referred.

        Evergreen's articles of incorporation and bylaws provide for a Board of Directors having not less than six members as determined from time to time by resolution
of a majority of the members of the Evergreen Board or by resolution of the shareholders of Evergreen. Currently, the Evergreen Board consists of nine directors. The Evergreen Board is divided into
three classes, with directors serving staggered terms (typically three years). Under Evergreen's articles of incorporation and bylaws, Evergreen directors may be removed only for cause and only by the
vote of 80% of the outstanding shares entitled to vote in the election of directors. 

 Carbon  

        Carbon's bylaws state that the number of directors shall be fixed from time to time by the Carbon Board of Directors. Currently, the Carbon Board consists of six
directors. Carbon's Board of Directors may increase or decrease the number of directors at any time, but no decrease may cause the term of an incumbent director to be shortened. Carbon directors may
be removed with or without cause by a majority of votes cast at a special shareholder meeting called for purposes of the removal. 

Actions without Meeting    

        Under the CBCA, any action that may be taken at a meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting only if such action is authorized by the unanimous
written consent of all shareholders entitled to vote at a meeting for such purposes. Under the CBCA, any action that may be taken at a meeting of directors may be taken without a meeting only if such
action is authorized by the unanimous written consent of all directors. Evergreen's and Carbon's bylaws reflect these requirements. 

Dividends and Other Distributions    

 Evergreen  

        Dividends in cash, property or shares of Evergreen's capital stock may be paid on Evergreen's common stock, as and when declared by Evergreen's Board of
Directors, out of funds to the extent allowed under the CBCA. Evergreen has not declared nor paid and does not anticipate declaring or paying any dividends on its common stock in the near future. Any
future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends would be at the discretion of Evergreen's Board of Directors and would depend on then existing conditions, including Evergreen's
financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and such other factors as the Board deems relevant. 

 Carbon  

        The holders of Carbon common stock are entitled to share ratably in dividends when and if declared by Carbon's Board of Directors out of legally available funds. 

Shareholder Nominations and Shareholder Proposals    

        In accordance with Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, shareholder proposals intended to be included in Evergreen's or Carbon's proxy statement
and presented at a regularly scheduled special meeting must be received by Evergreen or Carbon, as applicable, at least 120 days before the anniversary of the date that the previous year's
proxy statement was first mailed to shareholders. As provided in the SEC rules, if the special meeting date has been changed by more than 30 days from the date of the prior year's meeting, or
for special meetings, the proposal must be submitted within a reasonable time before the corporation begins to print and mail its proxy material. 

 Evergreen  

        Evergreen's bylaws establish advance notice procedures for shareholder proposals and the nomination, other than by or at the direction of the Evergreen Board or
one of its committees, of candidates for election as directors. Evergreen's bylaws provide that a shareholder wishing to nominate a person as a candidate for election to the Evergreen Board must
submit the nomination in writing to the Secretary of Evergreen at least 30 days and no more than 60 days before the annual meeting of shareholders, together with biographical information
about the candidate and his or her written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected and the shareholder's name and shareholdings. Nominations
that are not made in accordance with the foregoing provisions may be ruled out of order by the presiding officer or the Chairman of the meeting. 

        Evergreen's
bylaws provide that shareholder proposals intended to be presented at a regularly scheduled annual meeting must be received by Evergreen no less than 60 days and no
more than 90 days before the anniversary of the previous year's annual shareholders' meeting. As provided in the SEC rules, if the special meeting date has been changed by more than
30 days before or more than 60 days after the date of the prior year's meeting, the proposal must be submitted no less than the earlier of 60 days before the annual shareholders'
meeting and 10 days after the day on which Evergreen publicly announces the date of the annual shareholders' meeting, and no more than 90 days before the annual shareholders' meeting.
The notice must contain: 


a
brief description of the proposal and the reasons for bringing the proposal before the annual shareholders' meeting;


the
name and shareholdings of the shareholder submitting the proposal; and


any
material interest of the shareholder in the proposal. 

 Carbon  

        Neither Carbon's articles of incorporation nor its bylaws address procedures for nominating directors or submitting shareholder proposals. 

Exculpation and Indemnification    

        Evergreen's and Carbon's articles of incorporation and bylaws each require the corporation to indemnify each of its directors and officers to the fullest extent
permitted by law against liabilities arising out of his or her status as a director or officer. Applicable law permits such indemnification, provided that the director or officer acted in good faith
and in a manner reasonably believed to be in 

the
corporation's best interests and, with respect to any criminal action, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was illegal. Without prior court approval, the corporation may not
indemnify an officer or director against liabilities resulting from any claim, issue or matter in which the officer or director was adjudged liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of
his or her duties. 

        Evergreen's
and Carbon's articles of incorporation also each provide that no director will be personally liable to the corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for breaches
of fiduciary duty as a director to the full extent permitted by law. Applicable law does not permit any limitation for liability related to: 


breaches
of a director's duty of loyalty;


acts
or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;


distributions
made in violation of certain statutory requirements; or


any
transaction from which the director directly or indirectly derives an improper personal benefit. 

        Evergreen's
articles of incorporation also provide that no director or officer will be personally liable for any injury to person or property arising out of a tort committed by an
employee unless such director or officer was personally involved in the situation giving rise to the liability or unless such director or officer committed a criminal offense in connection with such
situation. 

Mergers, Share Exchanges and Sales of Assets    

        Colorado law generally requires that the holders of a majority of the outstanding capital stock of each constituent corporation approve a merger and that the
holders of a majority of the outstanding capital stock of a corporation approve the disposition of substantially all of the corporation's assets otherwise than in the ordinary course of business.
Colorado law does not require a shareholder vote of the surviving corporation in a merger (unless the corporation provides otherwise in its articles of incorporation) if: 


the
merger agreement does not amend the existing articles of incorporation;


each
share of the stock of the surviving corporation outstanding immediately before the effective date of the merger is an identical outstanding share after the merger; and


the
shares of authorized, unissued shares or treasury shares of common stock of the surviving corporation and/or the shares, securities or obligations convertible into such
stock to be issued or delivered under the plan of merger do not exceed 20% of the shares of common stock of such constituent corporation outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the
merger. 

        Unless
one of these exceptions is available, Colorado law requires that a majority of the shareholders of each constituent corporation approve a merger. Neither the articles of
incorporation nor the bylaws of Evergreen or Carbon alter the statutory requirements for shareholder approval of mergers or asset sales. 

Amendments to Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws    

        Under the CBCA, an amendment or change to the articles of incorporation generally requires the approval of the Board of Directors, followed by the approval of
such amendment by the affirmative vote of the owners of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon, with limited exceptions for certain matters that do not require shareholder
approval. When an amendment of the articles would adversely affect the rights of a class of stock or the rights of a series of a class, the CBCA provides that the enactment of the amendment also
requires the affirmative vote of the owners 

of
a majority of the outstanding shares of such class or series. Furthermore, the CBCA provides that, unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, an amendment of the articles of a
corporation need not be adopted by the Board of Directors prior to its submission to the shareholders for approval if it is proposed by a petition of shareholders entitled to cast at least 10% of the
votes that all shareholders are entitled to cast thereon. Evergreen's articles of incorporation provide that amendment of Article VII, concerning indemnification of officers and directors,
requires a unanimous stockholder vote and that amendment of Article XII, concerning the composition of the Board of Directors, requires a vote of 80% of the shares entitled to vote for the
election of directors. Carbon's articles of incorporation do not include comparable provisions. 

        The
CBCA provides that a corporation's bylaws may be amended by the Board of Directors or by shareholders. Both Evergreen's and Carbon's articles of incorporation and bylaws allow the
Board of Directors to amend the bylaws without shareholder approval. 

Consideration of Business Combinations    

 Evergreen  

        Evergreen's articles of incorporation provide that when evaluating any offer of another party to make a tender or exchange offer for any equity security, merge or
consolidate with another corporation or purchase or otherwise acquire all or substantially all of Evergreen's properties and assets, Evergreen's Board of Directors will, in connection with its
exercise of its judgment in determining what is in the best interests of Evergreen and its stockholders, give due consideration to all relevant factors, including
the social, legal, environmental and economic effects on Evergreen's employees, customers, suppliers and other constituencies, on the communities and geographical areas in which Evergreen operates or
is located and on any of the businesses and properties of Evergreen. Evergreen's Board of Directors must also give due consideration not only to the consideration being offered, in relation to the
market price for Evergreen's capital stock, but also in relation to Evergreen's value in a freely negotiated transaction and in relation to the Board of Directors' estimate of Evergreen's future value
(including the unrealized value of its properties and assets) as an independent going concern. 

 Carbon  

        Carbon's articles of incorporation do not specify any factors to which Carbon's Board of Directors must give consideration in evaluating a transaction involving a
potential change in control of Carbon. 

Shareholder Rights Plan    

 Evergreen  

        Evergreen has a shareholder rights plan that was adopted July 7, 1997 and amended August 22, 2000. This plan may make it more difficult for a
potential acquirer to effect a non-negotiated business transaction with Evergreen. See "Description of Evergreen Capital StockShareholder Rights Plan." 

 Carbon  

        Carbon does not have a shareholder rights plan. 

OTHER BUSINESS    

        The Carbon Board is not aware of any business to come before the meeting other than those matters described in this proxy statement/prospectus. However, if any
other matters should properly come before the meeting, it is intended that the proxies solicited by this proxy statement/prospectus will be voted with respect to those other matters in accordance with
the judgment of the persons voting the proxies. 

LEGAL MATTERS    

        The validity of the shares of Evergreen common stock offered by this proxy statement/prospectus will be passed upon by Berenbaum, Weinshienk & Eason, P.C.,
as counsel to Evergreen. 

EXPERTS    

        The consolidated financial statements of Evergreen Resources, Inc. incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus have been audited by BDO
Seidman, LLP, independent certified public accounts, to the extent and for the periods set forth in their report incorporated herein by reference, and are incorporated herein in reliance upon such
report given upon the authority of said firm as experts in auditing and accounting. The audit report incorporated by reference refers to a change in the method of accounting for derivative instruments
effective January 1, 2001. 

        The
consolidated financial statements of Carbon Energy Corporation as of December 31, 2002, and for the year then ended, have been included herein and in the registration
statement in reliance upon the report of KPMG LLP, independent accountants, appearing elsewhere herein, and upon the authority of said firm as experts in accounting and auditing. The audit report
covering the December 31, 2002, financial statements refers to a change in the method of accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities in 2001. 

        The
consolidated financial statements of Carbon Energy Corporation as of and for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2001, incorporated by reference in this
proxy statement/prospectus, have been audited by Arthur Andersen LLP, independent certified public accountants, as stated in their report incorporated by reference herein. See "Notice Regarding Arthur
Andersen LLP" below. 

NOTICE REGARDING ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP    

        On July 12, 2002, Carbon announced that it had appointed KPMG LLP to replace Arthur Andersen LLP as Carbon's independent accountants. After reasonable
efforts, Carbon has been unable to obtain Arthur Andersen's updated written consent to the incorporation by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus of Arthur Andersen's audit reports with
respect to Carbon's financial statements. Under these circumstances, Rule 437a under the Securities Act permits Evergreen and Carbon to omit Arthur Andersen's updated written consent from this
proxy statement/prospectus. 

        Section 11(a)
of the Securities Act provides that if any part of a registration statement at the time it becomes effective contains an untrue statement of a material fact or an
omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, any person acquiring a security pursuant to such registration statement
(unless it is proved that at the time of such acquisition such person knew of such untruth or omission) may sue, among others, every accountant who has consented to be named as having prepared or
certified any part of the registration statement or as having prepared or certified any report or valuation which is used in connection with the registration statement with respect to the statement in
such registration statement, report or valuation which purports to have been prepared or certified by the accountant. 

        Accordingly,
Arthur Andersen may not be liable under Section 11(a) of the Securities Act because it has not consented to being named as an expert in this proxy
statement/prospectus. Evergreen believes, however, that other persons who may be liable under Section 11(a) of the Securities Act, including Evergreen's officers and directors, may still rely
on Arthur Andersen's audit reports as being made by an expert under the due diligence defense provision of Section 11(b) of the Securities Act.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION    

        On March 31, 2003, Evergreen Resources, Inc. entered into a merger agreement to acquire 100% of the outstanding common stock of Carbon Energy
Corporation. 

        Carbon
is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, development and production of natural gas and crude oil in the United States and Canada. Carbon's areas of
operations in the United States are the Piceance Basin in Colorado and the Uintah Basin in Utah. Carbon's areas of operations in Canada are central and northwest Alberta and southeast Saskatchewan. 

        Under
the terms of the merger agreement, Carbon's shareholders will receive 0.275 shares of Evergreen common stock for each common share of Carbon. The exchange ratio was based upon the
relative values of the two securities at the time of this agreement. This will require Evergreen to issue approximately 1.69 million new shares of Evergreen common stock to Carbon's
shareholders. Based upon the average closing price of Evergreen's common stock for a period two days before and after announcement of the merger, the average value per share is $45.43 per share, and
the total value of the stock to be issued is approximately $76.8 million. The aggregate value of the transaction, including transaction costs of approximately $7 million and the fair
value of Carbon employee stock options to be assumed by Evergreen of approximately $5.4 million is approximately $89.2 million. The transaction is expected to be non-taxable
to the stockholders of both companies. 

        The
acquired Carbon properties are estimated to contain at least 88 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) of proved reserves, substantially all of which are natural gas. Carbon
operates substantially all of its properties in the United States and Canada. Net gas reserves in the United States and Canada are approximately 57 Bcf and 31 Bcf, respectively, of which 39% and 66%
are classified as proved developed and the remaining amounts are classified as proved undeveloped. Independent petroleum engineering consultants, Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., prepared
the reserve estimates for Carbon. The gross acreage position is approximately 150,000 acres in the United States and 77,000 acres in Canada. 

        The
following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information shows the pro forma effect of the proposed merger. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
information includes statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 and for the three months ended March 31, 2003, which assume the merger occurred on January 1,
2002. The unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial information also includes a balance sheet as of March 31, 2003, which assumes the merger occurred on that date. 

        The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared to assist in your analysis of the financial effects of the merger. It is based on the historical
financial statements of Evergreen and Carbon and should be read in conjunction with those historical financial statements and related notes, which, for Evergreen and Carbon, are incorporated by
reference into this document. 

        The
pro forma information is based on the estimates and assumptions set forth in the notes to such information. It is preliminary and is being furnished solely for information purposes.
The pro forma information does not purport to represent what the financial position and the results of operations of the combined company would have actually been had the proposed merger in fact
occurred on the dates indicated, nor is it necessarily indicative of the results of operations or financial position that may occur in the future. 

        The
information was prepared based on the fact that both Evergreen and Carbon use the full cost method of accounting for their oil and gas producing activities. We have not reflected as
an adjustment to the historical data any annual cost savings that may result from the merger. 

        No
pro forma adjustments have been made with respect to the following items. These items are reflected in the historical results of Evergreen and Carbon, as applicable, and should be
considered in reading the pro forma results: 


In
2002, Evergreen recognized a $51.5 million expense related to the impairment of its international properties.


In
2002, Carbon recognized a $13.2 million reduction to the carrying value of its oil and gas properties pursuant to the full cost ceiling test limitation.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION  

 March 31, 2003  

(1)    BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

        The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet and condensed combined statements of operations present the pro forma effects of the merger.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet is presented as though the merger occurred on March 31, 2003. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for
the three months ended March 31, 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2002 are presented as though the merger occurred on January 1, 2002. 

(2)    METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR THE MERGER  

        Evergreen will account for the merger using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations. Under that method of accounting, Evergreen is deemed to
be the acquiror for accounting purposes based on a number of factors determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

        The
purchase method of accounting requires that Carbon's assets and liabilities assumed by Evergreen be revalued and recorded at their estimated "fair values." In the merger, Evergreen
will issue 0.275 of a share of Evergreen common stock for each outstanding share of Carbon common stock. On a pro forma basis, assuming that the merger had occurred on March 31, 2003, this
would have resulted in Evergreen issuing approximately 1.69 million shares of its common stock to Carbon stockholders. 

        Based
upon the average closing price of Evergreen's common stock for a period two days before and after announcement of the merger, the average value per share is $45.43 per share, and
the total value of the stock to be issued is approximately $76.8 million. The aggregate value of the transaction, including transaction costs of approximately $7 million and the fair
value of Carbon employee stock options to be assumed by Evergreen of approximately $5.4 million is approximately $89.2 million. 

(3)    PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE MERGER  

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet includes the following adjustments: 

(a)
This
entry adjusts the historical book values of Carbon's assets and liabilities to their estimated fair values as of March 31, 2003. The calculation of the total purchase
price and the preliminary allocation of this price to the acquired assets and liabilities are shown below.

$

162,647

        The
total preliminary purchase price includes the value of the Evergreen common stock to be issued to Carbon stockholders in the merger. The total preliminary purchase price also
includes: 


$7 million
of estimated merger costs. These costs include investment banking expenses, severance, legal and accounting fees, printing expenses and other
merger-related costs. These costs have been added to current liabilities in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet.


$5.4 million
of Evergreen employee stock options to be issued in exchange for existing Carbon employee stock options. The value of these options is added to
stockholders' equity in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet. 

        The
purchase price allocation is preliminary and is subject to change due to several factors, including: (1) changes in the fair values of Carbon's assets and liabilities as of
the closing date of the merger (specifically oil and gas property values may change due to pricing volatility); (2) the actual merger costs incurred; (3) the number of Carbon shares and
stock options outstanding as of the closing date of the
merger; and (4) changes in Evergreen's fair value estimates that may be made between now and the closing date of the merger. These changes will not be known until after the closing date of the
merger. However, Evergreen does not believe that the final purchase price allocation will differ materially from the estimated allocation presented herein. 

(b)
This
adjustment includes the elimination of the historical book value of Carbon's stockholders' equity of $20,688,000. 

        The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations include the following adjustments: 

(c)
This
adjustment revises Carbon's historical depreciation, depletion and amortization expense to reflect the adjustment of Carbon's assets from historical book value to fair value. For
the combined companies' oil and gas producing properties, pro forma depreciation, depletion and amortization expense of $8.0 million and $30.7 million for the three month period ended
March 31, 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2002 was calculated using the equivalent units-of-production method. Carbon's proved oil and gas reserves, divided
by its annualized production for 2002, yields an estimated reserve life of approximately 12 years for gas reserves and 6 years for oil reserves.

(d)
This
adjustment records the income tax impact of the depreciation, depletion, amortization, and other pro forma adjustments at the statutory rate which approximates Evergreen's
effective tax rate of approximately 38.0% for the three month period ended March 31, 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2002. 

(4)    COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING  

March 31, 2003  

        Net income from continuing operations per average common share outstanding for the three months ended March 31, 2003 has been calculated based on the pro
forma weighted average number of shares outstanding as follows: 

Basic

Diluted

(in thousands)

Evergreen's weighted average common shares outstanding

19,059

19,720

Carbon's shares outstanding multiplied by 0.275 exchange ratio

1,690

1,690

Pro forma weighted average Evergreen shares outstanding

20,749

21,410

December 31, 2002  

        Net loss from continuing operations per average common share outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2002 has been calculated based on the pro forma
weighted average number of shares outstanding as follows for both basic and diluted calculations: 

(in thousands)

Evergreen's weighted average common shares outstanding

18,956

Carbon's shares outstanding multiplied by 0.275 exchange ratio

1,690

Pro forma weighted average Evergreen shares outstanding

20,646

        The
diluted shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2002 do not include options and warrants to purchase 1,405,028 shares of Evergreen common stock because their
inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. Also, no potential common shares related to Evergreen's senior convertible debt were included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per
share for the three months ended March 31, 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2002 as no circumstances occurred that would allow them to be convertible. 

        Pro
forma shares of Evergreen common stock outstanding at March 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, assuming the merger occurred at that date, are as follows: 

March 31,

(5)    CARBON'S HISTORICAL AND RECLASSIFIED BALANCES  

 Disposition of Assets  

        On March 24, 2003, Carbon closed on the sale of its interests in 97 gross wells (23.3 net wells) and 25,400 gross acres (8,200 net acres) located primarily
in southeast New Mexico. The adjusted purchase price was $14.4 million in cash, net of normal closing adjustments. Proceeds from the sale were used to repay borrowings under Carbon's U.S.
credit facility with Bank of Oklahoma. 

        The
following pro forma adjustments give effect to Carbon's sale of oil and gas properties to Fasken and are based upon assumptions set forth below. The pro forma adjustments reflect the
effects of the above mentioned transaction assuming that the transaction for which the pro forma effects are shown was consummated on January 1, 2002 for the pro forma statement of operations
adjustments. The unaudited pro forma statements of operations include the following adjustments: 

(i)
Reflects
the reduction in revenues and operating expenses associated with the sold properties. 

(ii)
Represents
the estimated decrease in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense resulting from the exclusion of the sold properties from Carbon's full cost pool computed on the
units-of-production method.

(iii)
Represents
the estimated decrease in interest expense as a result of the utilization of net sale proceeds from the property sale to repay borrowings under Carbon's credit facility.

(iv)
Reflects
the income tax impact of the adjustments described above at the U.S. statutory rate which approximates Carbon's effective tax rate of 37.5% for the three months ended
March 31, 2003. No adjustment was made to income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2002 as Carbon recorded a valuation allowance for all of its U.S. deferred tax assets in
that year. 

 Reclassifications  

        Evergreen and Carbon present certain revenues and expenses differently in their respective consolidated financial statements. To make the unaudited pro forma
financial information consistent, certain of Carbon's 2002 and 2003 reported amounts of revenues and expenses have been reclassified to conform Evergreen's presentation. 

        The
historical, sale-adjusted and reclassified amounts for the three months ended March 31, 2003 are presented in the following table:

(6)    ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD  

        In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 143, "Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 requires the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation to be recognized in the period in
which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. SFAS
No. 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. 

        Evergreen
and Carbon adopted SFAS No. 143 effective January 1, 2003 using a cumulative effect approach to recognize transition amounts for asset retirement obligations,
asset retirement costs and accumulated depreciation. The effect of the adoption of this Statement required Evergreen and Carbon to record a non-cash expense of approximately
$0.7 million and a credit of approximately $0.3 million, respectively, as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax, on January 1, 2003. In addition,
Evergreen and Carbon recorded non-current liabilities of approximately $4.6 million and $3.0 million, respectively, and additions to oil and gas properties of approximately
$3.9 million and $3.5 million, respectively, in connection with the adoption of this Statement effective January 1, 2003. 

(7)    SUPPLEMENTAL PRO FORMA INFORMATION REGARDING OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS  

        The following pro forma supplemental information regarding oil and gas operations is presented pursuant to the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 69,
"Disclosures About Oil and Gas Producing Activities." The following pro forma supplemental information does not give effect to Carbon's sale of certain properties as discussed in Note 5. 

 Pro Forma Costs Incurred  

        The following tables reflect the costs incurred in oil and gas producing property acquisition, exploration and development activities of Evergreen, Carbon and the
combined company on a pro forma basis for the year ended December 31, 2002.

        Future
cash inflows are computed by applying year-end prices to the year-end quantities of proved reserves, except in those instances where fixed and determinable
price changes are provided by contractual arrangements in existence at year-end. These year-end prices are adjusted for transportation and other charges and for geographic
differentials. The December 31, 2002, sales price for natural gas utilized for the purposes of estimating Evergreen's proved reserves and future net revenue was $4.22 per Mcf. The sales prices
used for Carbon were based on average oil and liquids prices of $29.48 per barrel in the United States and $24.68 per barrel in Canada, and average natural gas prices of $3.14 per Mcf in the United
States and $3.84 per Mcf in Canada.

AGREEMENT
  AND
  PLAN OF REORGANIZATION    

        THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION ("Agreement"), dated as of March 31, 2003 is among CARBON ENERGY CORPORATION ("Carbon"), a Colorado corporation
having its principal office at 1700 Broadway, Suite 1150, Denver Colorado, EVERGREEN RESOURCES, INC. ("Evergreen"), a Colorado corporation having its principal office at 1407 17
th

St., Suite 1200, Denver, Colorado, and EVERGREEN MERGER CORPORATION, a Colorado corporation and directly wholly-owned subsidiary of Evergreen ("Merger Sub"); 

RECITALS:  

        The parties desire that Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Carbon (such transaction being hereinafter referred to as the "Merger") pursuant to a plan of
merger (the "Plan of Merger") substantially in the form attached as Annex A hereto, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Carbon shall continue as the surviving
corporation. The parties also desire to provide for certain undertakings, conditions, representations, warranties and covenants in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. 

        NOW,

        (d)   The

           2.6

           2.7
    Merger Consideration. 

        (a)   As
used herein, the term "Merger Consideration" shall mean the number of shares of Evergreen Common Stock (to the nearest ten thousandth of a share) to be exchanged for
each share of Carbon Common Stock issued and outstanding (excluding any shares of Carbon Common Stock held by Carbon, Evergreen and any wholly-owned subsidiary of Evergreen (collectively, the
"Excluded Shares")) as of the Effective Time (the "Exchange Shares") and cash (without interest) to be payable in exchange for any fractional share of Evergreen Common Stock which would otherwise be
distributable to a Carbon shareholder as provided in Section 2.7(b). The number of shares of Evergreen Common Stock (to the nearest ten thousandth of a share) to be issued for each issued and
outstanding share of Carbon Common Stock (the "Common Exchange Ratio") shall be .2750. 

        (b)   The
amount of cash payable with respect to any fractional share of Evergreen Common Stock shall be determined by multiplying the fractional part of such share by the
average of the closing prices per share of Evergreen Common Stock on the NYSE for the twenty trading days preceding the Closing Date as reported daily in 
The Wall Street
Journal.

           2.8
    Conversion of Shares; Payment of Merger Consideration. 

        (a)   At
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Carbon or the holders of record of Carbon Common Stock, Evergreen, the holders of
record of Evergreen Common Stock, or Merger Sub, each share of Carbon Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Excluded Shares) shall be converted
into and shall represent the right to receive, upon surrender of the certificate representing such share of Carbon Common Stock (as provided in subsection (d) below), the Merger Consideration. 

        (b)   Each
share of Evergreen Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be issued and outstanding. 

        (c)   Until
surrendered, each outstanding certificate which prior to the Effective Time represented one or more shares of Carbon Common Stock shall be deemed upon the
Effective Time for all purposes to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any declared and unpaid dividends with respect to Carbon Common Stock. No interest will be paid or
accrued on the Merger Consideration upon the surrender of the certificate or certificates representing shares of Carbon Common Stock. With respect to any certificate for Carbon Common Stock that has
been lost, stolen or destroyed, Evergreen shall pay the Merger Consideration attributable to such certificate upon receipt of a surety bond in a reasonable amount or other adequate indemnity as
required in accordance with Evergreen's standard policy, and evidence reasonably satisfactory to Evergreen of ownership of the shares represented thereby. After the Effective Time, Carbon's transfer
books shall be closed and no transfer of the shares of Carbon Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be made on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation.
Each of the Excluded Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be
outstanding, shall be canceled and retired without payment of any consideration thereof and shall cease to exist. 

        (d)   Promptly
after the Effective Time, Evergreen shall cause to be delivered or mailed to each Carbon shareholder (other than holders of the Excluded Shares) a form of
letter of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates which, immediately 

A-7

prior
to the Effective Time, represented any shares of Carbon Common Stock. Upon proper surrender of such certificates or other evidence of ownership meeting the requirements of Section 2.8(c),
together with such letter of transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably requested, Evergreen shall promptly
cause the transfer to the persons entitled thereto of the Merger Consideration. 

        (e)   To
the extent permitted by law, former shareholders of record of Carbon shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of Evergreen shareholders the
number of whole shares of Evergreen Common Stock into which their respective shares of Carbon Common Stock are converted, regardless of whether such holders have exchanged their certificates
representing Carbon Common Stock for certificates representing Evergreen Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by
Evergreen on the Evergreen Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, the declaration shall include dividends or other distributions on all shares of Evergreen Common
Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement, but no dividend or other distribution payable to the holders of record of Evergreen Common Stock as of any time subsequent to the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the holder of any certificate representing Carbon Common Stock until such holder surrenders such certificate for exchange as provided in this Section 2.8. Upon surrender of such
certificate, both the Evergreen Common Stock certificate and any undelivered dividends and cash payments payable hereunder (without interest) shall be delivered and paid with respect to the shares of
Carbon Common Stock represented by such certificate. 

           2.9
    Conversion of Stock Options. 

        (a)   At
the Effective Time, each Stock Option then outstanding (and which by its terms does not lapse on or before the Effective Time), whether or not then exercisable, shall
be converted into and become rights with respect to Evergreen Common Stock, and Evergreen shall assume each Stock Option in accordance with the terms of the Stock Option Plan, except that from and
after the Effective Time (i) Evergreen or Evergreen's Compensation Committee, as appropriate, shall be substituted for Carbon and Carbon's Compensation Committee with respect to administering
the Stock Option Plan, (ii) each Stock Option assumed by Evergreen may be exercised solely for shares of Evergreen Common Stock, (iii) the number of shares of Evergreen Common Stock
subject to each such Stock Option shall be the number of whole shares of Evergreen (omitting any fractional share) determined by multiplying the number of shares of Carbon Common Stock subject to such
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, and (iv) the per share exercise price under each such Stock Option shall be adjusted by dividing the per share
exercise price under each such Stock Option by the Exchange Ratio and rounding up to the nearest cent. 

        (b)   Notwithstanding
Section 2.9(a), Evergreen may at its election substitute as of the Effective Time options under the Evergreen Resources, Inc. 2000 Stock
Incentive Plan or any other duly adopted comparable plan (in either case, the "Evergreen Option Plan") for all or a part of the Stock Options, subject to the following conditions: (x) the
requirements of Section 2.9(a)(iii) and (iv) shall be met; (y) such substitution shall not constitute a modification, extension or renewal of any of the Stock Options; and
(z) the substituted options shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions as provided in the Stock Option Agreements and the Stock Option Plan governing each Stock Option. 

        (c)   Each
grant of a converted or substitute option to any individual who subsequent to the Merger will be a director or officer of Evergreen as construed under Commission
Rule 16b-3 shall, as a condition to such conversion or substitution, be approved in accordance with the provisions of Rule 16b-3. Each Stock Option which is an
incentive stock option shall be adjusted as required by 

A-8

Section 424
of the Code, and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, so as to continue as an incentive stock option under Section 424(a) of the Code, and so as not to constitute a
modification, extension, or renewal of the option within the meaning of Section 424(h) of the Code. Evergreen and Carbon agree to take all necessary steps to effectuate the foregoing provisions
of this Section 2.9. Evergreen has reserved and shall continue to reserve adequate shares of Evergreen Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of any converted or substitute options. 

        (d)   As
soon as practicable after the Effective Time, if it has not already done so, and to the extent Carbon shall have a registration statement in effect or an obligation
to file a registration statement, Evergreen shall file a registration statement on Form S-3 or Form S-8, as the case may be (or any successor or
other appropriate forms), with respect to the shares of Evergreen Common Stock subject to converted or substitute options and shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such converted or substitute options remain outstanding. With respect to
those individuals, if any, who subsequent to the Merger may be subject to the reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, Evergreen shall administer the Stock Option Plan
assumed pursuant to this Section 2.9 (or the Evergreen Option Plan, if applicable) in a manner that complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent
necessary to preserve for such individuals the benefits of Rule 16b-3 to the extent such benefits were available to them prior to the Effective Time. Carbon hereby represents that
the Stock Option Plan in their current forms comply with Rule 16b-3 to the extent, if any, required as of the date hereof. 

        (e)   As
soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Evergreen shall deliver to the participants receiving converted options under the Evergreen Option Plan an
appropriate notice setting forth such participant's rights pursuant thereto. 

        (f)    Eligibility
to receive stock option grants following the Effective Time with respect to Evergreen Common Stock shall be determined by Evergreen in accordance with its
plans and procedures as in effect from time to time, and subject to any contractual obligations. 

           2.10
    Anti-Dilution. 

        In
the event Evergreen changes the number of shares of Evergreen Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend or other
similar recapitalization, and the record date thereof (in the case of a stock dividend) or the effective date thereof (in the case of a stock split or similar recapitalization for which a record date
is not established) shall be prior to the Effective Time, the Common Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted. 

           2.11
    No Right to Dissent. 

        Nothing
in the CBCA or Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of Carbon or any Carbon Subsidiary provides or would provide to any person, including without limitation the Carbon
shareholders, upon execution of this Agreement or the Plan of Merger and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, rights of dissent and appraisal of any kind.

reflected on the balance sheet of Carbon in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2002 as owned by Carbon and the Carbon Subsidiaries or acquired
after such date ("Other Properties"), as to both the Reserve Report Properties and the Other Properties free and clear of any liens, security interests, charges, mortgages, adverse claims or other

effective and all royalties, rentals and other payments due by Carbon to any lessor of any such oil and gas leases have been paid. All major items of operating equipment of Carbon and the Carbon
Subsidiaries are in good operating condition and in a state of reasonable maintenance and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted. 

        (b)   The
term "Good and Marketable Title," for purposes of this Section 3.10, with respect to Carbon and the Carbon Subsidiaries, means such title that: (1) is

state land office (provided there is no inconsistent assignment or other document of record in the applicable county records), or (C) in the case of Canada, from the records of the federal or
provincial register, as applicable) or is assignable to Carbon or the Carbon Subsidiaries out of an interest of record (as so defined) by reason of the performance by Carbon or the
Carbon Subsidiaries of all operations required to earn an enforceable right to such assignment; (2) is free from reasonable doubt to the end that a prudent purchaser engaged in the business of
the ownership, development and operation of producing oil and gas properties with knowledge of all of the facts and their legal bearing would be willing to accept and pay full value for the same and a
prudent lender would be willing to lend against it as collateral without discount for title matters; (3) entitles Carbon or the Carbon Subsidiaries to receive not less than the interest set
forth in the Carbon Reserve Reports with respect to each proved property evaluated therein under the caption "net revenue interest" or "NRI" (or, with respect to the Carbon Reserve Report for Canadian

(4) obligates Carbon or the Carbon Subsidiaries to pay costs and expenses relating to each such proved property in an amount not greater than the interest set forth under the caption "working
interest" or "WI" in the Carbon Reserve Reports with respect to such property without increase over the life of such property except as shown on the Carbon Reserve Reports; and (5) does not
restrict the ability of Carbon or the Carbon Subsidiaries to utilize the properties as currently intended. 

        (c)   All
leases, easements, rights of way, surface use agreements, permits and licenses pursuant to which Carbon or any Carbon Subsidiary, as lessee or licensee, leases or
licenses rights to real or personal property are valid and enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, and Carbon is not in default under any of the terms thereof, nor to the knowledge of

any applicable Environmental Laws to operate and use any of Carbon's or each of the Carbon Subsidiary's assets for their current purposes and uses. 

        (f)    There
are no past or present actions, activities, circumstances, conditions, events or incidents that could reasonably form the basis of any claim or action or
governmental investigation that could result in the imposition of any liability arising under any Environmental Laws, against Carbon or any Carbon Subsidiary or against any person or entity whose
liability for any such claim Carbon or any Carbon Subsidiary has or may have retained or assumed, either contractually or by operation of law.

    Employees; Compensation; Benefit Plans. 

        (a)
    Compensation.
    Carbon has Disclosed a complete and correct list of the name, age, position, rate of
compensation and any incentive compensation arrangements, bonuses or commissions or fringe or other benefits, whether payable in cash or in kind, of each director, officer or shareholder of Carbon and
of each Carbon Subsidiary and each other person (in each case other than as an employee) to whom Carbon or any Carbon Subsidiary pays or provides, or has an obligation, agreement (written or
unwritten), policy or practice of paying or providing, retirement, health, welfare or other benefits of any kind or description whatsoever. 

        (b)
    Employee Benefit Plans.

        (i)    Carbon
has Disclosed an accurate and complete list of all Plans, as defined below, contributed to, maintained or sponsored by Carbon or any Carbon Subsidiary, to which
Carbon or any Carbon Subsidiary is obligated to contribute or has any liability or potential liability, whether direct or indirect, including all Plans contributed to, maintained or sponsored by each
member of the controlled group of corporations, within the meaning of Sections 414(b), 414(c), 414(m) and 414(o) of the Code, of which Carbon or any Carbon Subsidiary is a member. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Plan" shall mean a plan, arrangement, agreement or program described in the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.15(b)(i) that is: (A) a profit-sharing,
deferred compensation, bonus, stock option, stock purchase, pension, retainer, consulting, retirement, severance, welfare or incentive plan, agreement or arrangement, whether or not funded and whether
or not terminated, (B) an employment agreement, (C) a personnel policy or fringe benefit plan, policy, program or arrangement 

A-16

providing
for benefits or perquisites to current or former employees, officers, directors or agents, whether or not funded, and whether or not terminated, including, without limitation, benefits
relating to automobiles, clubs, vacation, child care, parenting, sabbatical, sick leave, severance, medical, dental, hospitalization, life insurance and other types of insurance, or (D) any
other employee benefit plan as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, whether or not funded and whether or not terminated. 

        (ii)   Neither
Carbon nor any Carbon Subsidiary contributes to, has an obligation to contribute to or otherwise has any liability or potential liability with respect to
(A) any multiemployer plan as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, (B) any plan of the type described in Sections 4063 and 4064 of ERISA or in Section 413 of the Code (and
regulations promulgated thereunder), or (C) any plan which provides health, life insurance, accident or other "welfare-type" benefits to current or future retirees or former
employees or directors, their spouses or dependents, other than in accordance with Section 4980B of the Code or applicable state continuation coverage law. 

        (iii)  None
of the Plans obligates Carbon or any Carbon Subsidiary to pay separation, severance, termination or similar-type benefits solely as a result of any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement or solely as a result of a "change in control," as such term is used in Section 280G of the Code (and regulations promulgated thereunder). 

        (iv)  Each
Plan, and all related trusts, insurance contracts and funds, has been maintained, funded and administered in compliance in all respects with its own terms and in
compliance in all respects with all applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code. No actions, suits, claims, complaints, charges, proceedings, hearings,
examinations, investigations, audits or demands with respect to the Plans (other than routine claims for benefits) are pending or threatened, and there are no facts which could give rise to or be
expected to give rise to any actions, suits, claims, complaints, charges, proceedings, hearings, examinations, investigations, audits or demands. No Plan that is subject to the funding requirements of
Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" as such term is defined in such Sections of ERISA and the Code,
whether or not waived, and each Plan has always fully met the funding standards required under Title I of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code. No liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation ("PBGC") (except for routine payment of premiums) has been or is expected to be incurred with respect to any Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, no reportable event (as such term is
defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) for which the PBGC has not waived notice has occurred with respect to any such Plan, and the PBGC has not commenced or threatened the termination of any Plan.
None of the assets of Carbon or any Carbon Subsidiary is the subject of any lien arising under Section 302(f) of ERISA or Section 412(n) of the Code, neither Carbon nor any Carbon
Subsidiary has been required to post any security pursuant to Section 307 of ERISA or Section 401(a)(29) of the Code, and there are no facts which could be expected to give rise to such
lien or such posting of security. No event has occurred and no condition exists that would subject Carbon or any Carbon Subsidiary to any tax under Sections 4971, 4972, 4976, 4977 or 4979 of the Code
or to a fine or penalty under Section 502(c) of ERISA. 

        (v)   Each
Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, and each trust (if any) forming a part thereof, has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS as to the qualification under the Code of such Plan and the tax exempt status of such related trust, and nothing has occurred since the date of such determination
letter that could adversely affect the qualification of such Plan or the tax exempt status of such related trust. 

A-17

        (vi)  No
underfunded "defined benefit plan" (as such term is defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA) has been, during the five years preceding the Closing Date, transferred
out of the controlled group of corporations (within the meaning of Sections 414(b), (c), (m) and (o) of the Code) of which Carbon or any Carbon Subsidiary is a member or was a member
during such five-year period. There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist, that would result in, any liability with respect to any employee benefit plan that is maintained,
sponsored or contributed to by any entity that is a member of the Carbon controlled group of corporations (as defined above) (i) under Title IV of ERISA, (ii) under section 302 of
ERISA, (iii) under sections 412 and 4971 of the Code, or (iv) as a result of a failure to comply with the continuation coverage requirements of section 601 et seq. of ERISA and
section 4980B of the Code, or (v) under any other statute, rule or regulation that would reasonably be expected to be a liability of Carbon or a Carbon Subsidiary solely as a result of
an entity being a member of the Carbon controlled group of corporations (as defined above), that would be a liability of Carbon or any Carbon Subsidiary, other than such liabilities that arise solely
out of, or relate solely to, the Plans Disclosed in Section 3.15(b) of the Carbon Disclosure Memorandum. 

        (vii)   As
of December 31, 2002, the fair market value of the assets of each Plan that is a tax qualified defined benefit plan equaled or exceeded, and as
of the Closing Date will equal or exceed, the present value of all vested and nonvested liabilities thereunder determined in accordance with reasonable actuarial methods, factors and assumptions
applicable to a defined benefit plan on an ongoing basis. With respect to each Plan that is subject to the funding requirements of Section 412 of the Code and Section 302 of ERISA, all
required contributions for all periods ending prior to or as of the Closing Date (including periods from the first day of the then-current plan year to the Closing Date and including all
quarterly contributions required in accordance with Section 412(m) of the Code)
shall have been made. With respect to each other Plan, all required payments, premiums, contributions, reimbursements or accruals for all periods ending prior to or as of the Closing Date shall have
been made. No tax qualified Plan has any unfunded liabilities. 

        (viii)   No
prohibited transaction (which shall mean any transaction prohibited by Section 406 of ERISA and not exempt under Section 408 of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code, whether by statutory, class or individual exemption) has occurred with respect to any Plan which would result in the imposition, directly or indirectly, of any
excise tax, penalty or other liability under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA. Neither Carbon nor, to the knowledge of Carbon, any Carbon Subsidiary, any
trustee, administrator or other fiduciary of any Plan, or any agent of any of the foregoing has engaged in any transaction or acted or failed to act in a manner that could subject Carbon or any Carbon

anti-takeover laws, and no such law shall be activated or applied as a result of such transactions. Neither the Articles of Incorporation nor the Bylaws of Carbon, nor any other document

capital stock or voting security, to approve the Merger or any other transactions contemplated in this Agreement. 

           3.23

ARTICLE V
  COVENANTS    

        5.1
    Carbon Shareholder Meeting. 

        Carbon
shall submit this Agreement and the Plan of Merger to its shareholders for approval at a meeting to be held as soon as reasonably practicable following the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement. By approving this Agreement and authorizing its execution, the Board of Directors of Carbon agrees that it shall, at the time the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is mailed to the
shareholders of Carbon, recommend that Carbon's shareholders vote for such approval; provided that, if the Board of Directors of Carbon, after consultation with (and based on the advice of) counsel,
determines in good faith that, following a Superior Offer, it would more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement and
the Plan of Merger, then in submitting this Agreement and the Plan of Merger to Carbon's shareholders, the Board of Directors of 

A-24

Carbon
may submit this Agreement and the Plan of Merger to Carbon's shareholders without recommendation (although the resolutions adopting this Agreement and the Plan of Merger as of the date hereof
may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of Directors of Carbon may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to the Carbon shareholders in the Proxy Statement or an
appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law; provided that it may not take any actions under this sentence until after giving Evergreen at least five Business Days to
respond to such Superior Offer (and after giving Evergreen notice of the latest material terms, conditions and third party in the Superior Offer) and then taking into account any amendment or
modification to this Agreement proposed by Evergreen. At the time of execution of this Agreement, each of Yorktown Energy Partners III, L. P. and Patrick R. McDonald has executed an agreement with
Evergreen obligating each of them to vote all shares over which each has voting control in favor of the Plan of Merger. 

           5.2
    Registration Statement; Proxy Statement/Prospectus. 

        As
promptly as practicable after the date hereof, Evergreen shall prepare and file the Registration Statement with the Commission. Carbon will furnish to Evergreen the information
required to be included in the Registration Statement with respect to its business and affairs before it is filed with the Commission and again before any amendments are filed, and shall have the
right to review and consult with Evergreen on the form of, and any characterizations of such information included in, the Registration Statement prior to the filing with the Commission. Such
Registration Statement, at the time it becomes effective and on the Effective Time, shall in all material respects conform to the requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Commission. The Registration Statement shall include the form of Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Evergreen and Carbon shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be approved by the Commission for mailing to the Carbon shareholders, and such Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall, on the date of mailing, conform in all material respects to the
requirements of the Securities Laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. Carbon shall cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to shareholders in accordance
with all applicable notice requirements under the Securities Laws, the CBCA and the rules and regulations of the American Stock Exchange. 

           5.3
    Plan of Merger; Reservation of Shares. 

        At
the Effective Time, the Merger shall be effected in accordance with the Plan of Merger. In connection therewith, Evergreen acknowledges that it (i) has caused Merger Sub to be
incorporated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Evergreen and that Evergreen will cause Merger Sub to take all actions required of it to consummate the Merger hereunder, and (ii) will pay or cause
to be paid when due the Merger Consideration. Evergreen has reserved for issuance such number of shares of Evergreen Common Stock as shall be necessary to pay the Merger Consideration and agrees not
to take any action that would cause the aggregate number of authorized shares of Evergreen Common Stock available for issuance hereunder not to be sufficient to effect the Merger. If at any time the
aggregate number of shares of Evergreen Common Stock reserved for issuance hereunder is not sufficient to effect the Merger, Evergreen shall take all appropriate action as may be required to increase
the number of shares of Evergreen Common Stock reserved for such purpose. 

           5.4
    Additional Acts. 

        (a)   Carbon
agrees to take such actions requested by Evergreen as may be reasonably necessary to modify the structure of, or to add parties to (so long as such addition is an
Evergreen Subsidiary) the transactions contemplated hereby, provided that such modifications do not change the Merger Consideration or abrogate the covenants and other agreements contained in this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the covenant not to take any action that would 

A-25

substantially
delay completion of, or substantially impair the prospects of completing, the Merger pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan of Merger. 

        (b)   If
deemed required by the parties, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, each of the parties shall submit notice or applications for prior approval of the
transactions contemplated herein to any federal, state or local government agency, department or body to which notice is required or from which approval is required for consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby, including but not limited to any requirements of the HSR Act, if applicable. Each of the parties represents and warrants that all information included (or
submitted for inclusion) concerning it, its respective Subsidiaries, and any of its respective directors, officers and shareholders, shall be true, correct and complete in all material respects as of
the date presented. 

           5.5
    Best Efforts. 

        Each
of Evergreen and Carbon shall use, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to use, its best efforts in good faith to (i) furnish such information as may be
required in connection with and otherwise cooperate in the preparation and filing of the documents referred to in Section 5.2 and Section 5.4 (if applicable) or elsewhere herein, and
(ii) take or cause to be taken all action necessary or desirable on its part to fulfill the conditions in Article VI, including, without limitation, executing and delivering, or causing
to be executed and delivered, such representations, certificates and other instruments or documents as may be reasonably requested by Evergreen's legal counsel for such counsel to issue the opinion
contemplated by Section 6.1(e), and to consummate the transactions herein contemplated at the earliest possible date. None of the parties shall take, or cause, or to the best of its ability
permit to be taken, any action that would substantially delay or impair the prospects of completing the Merger pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan of Merger. 

           5.6
    Access to Information. 

        Carbon
and Evergreen will each keep the other advised of all material developments relevant to its business and the businesses of its Subsidiaries, and to consummation of the Merger, and
each shall provide to the other, upon request, reasonable details of any such development. Upon reasonable notice, Carbon shall afford to representatives of Evergreen and Evergreen shall afford to
representatives of Carbon access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of the properties, books, contracts, commitments and records of such party and its
Subsidiaries and, during such period, shall make available all information concerning such party's businesses as may be reasonably requested. Carbon shall cooperate with Evergreen and its agents in
the performance by Evergreen and its representatives, at Evergreen's expense, of such environmental audit or audits of Carbon's properties as Evergreen determines is reasonable under the circumstances
and shall provide Evergreen with copies of all studies, reports or other records related to the environmental condition of Carbon's properties and assets that are in Carbon's possession or under its
control. Evergreen shall likewise cooperate with Carbon with respect to the performance, at Carbon's expense, of such phase 1 environmental audits of Evergreen's properties as Carbon determines is
reasonable under the circumstances; provided that in no event shall this sentence be interpreted as giving Carbon any rights to conduct any environmental audit, test or examination other than phase 1
audits. No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by, or the conditions to the obligations hereunder of, either party
hereto. Each party hereto shall, and shall cause each of its directors, officers, attorneys and advisors to, maintain the confidentiality of all information obtained hereunder which is not otherwise
publicly disclosed by the other party, said undertakings with respect to confidentiality to survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement, each party shall return to the other party upon request all confidential information previously furnished in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

A-26

          5.7

and Carbon shall agree with each other as to the form and substance of any press release related to this Agreement and the Plan of Merger or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, and consult with each other as to the form and substance of other public disclosures related thereto; provided, that nothing contained herein shall prohibit either party, following
notification to and, if practicable, consultation with, the other party, from making any disclosure which in the opinion of its counsel is required by law. 

           5.8
    Forbearances of Carbon. 

        Except
with the prior written consent of Evergreen, between the date hereof and the Effective Time, Carbon shall not, and shall cause each of the Carbon Subsidiaries not to:

Subsidiary or engage in any new type of activity or expand any existing activities; 

        (b)   declare,

    Affiliates. 

        Carbon
shall use its best efforts to cause all persons who are Affiliates of Carbon to deliver to Evergreen promptly following execution of this Agreement a written agreement, in the
form of Annex B hereto (an "Affiliate Agreement"), providing that such person will not dispose of Evergreen Common Stock received in the Merger, except in compliance with the Securities Act and the

A-28

           5.11
    Section 401(k) Plan; Other Employee Benefits. 

        (a)   Each
employee of Carbon or a Carbon Subsidiary who is employed by Carbon or a Carbon Subsidiary at the Effective Time shall continue following the Effective Time as an
employee of Evergreen or of an Evergreen Subsidiary ("Employer Entity"), and is referred to herein as a "Transferred Employee." 

        (b)   Effective
on the Benefit Plan Determination Date with respect to the 401(k) plan of Carbon, Evergreen shall cause such plan to be merged with the 401(k) plan maintained
by Evergreen and the Evergreen Subsidiaries, or to be frozen or to be terminated, in each case as determined by Evergreen and subject to the receipt of all applicable regulatory or governmental
approvals. Each Transferred Employee who is a participant in the 401(k) plan of Carbon immediately prior to the Effective Time, and who continues in the employment of an Employer Entity until the
Benefit Plan Determination Date for the 401(k) plan, shall be eligible to participate in Evergreen's 401(k) plan as of the Benefit Plan Determination Date. All rights to participate in Evergreen's
401(k) plan are subject to Evergreen's right to amend or terminate the plan. Until the Benefit Plan Determination Date, Evergreen shall continue in effect for the benefit of participating employees
the Section 401(k) plan of Carbon. For purposes of administering Evergreen's 401(k) plan, service with Carbon and the Carbon Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be service with Evergreen for
participation and vesting purposes, but not for purposes of benefit accrual. 

        (c)   Each
Transferred Employee shall be eligible to participate in group hospitalization, medical, dental, life, disability and other welfare benefit plans and programs
available to employees of the Employer Entity, subject to the terms of such plans and programs, as of the Benefit Plan Determination Date for each such plan or program, conditional upon the
Transferred Employee's being employed by an Employer Entity as of such Benefit Plan Determination Date and subject to complying with eligibility requirements of the respective plans and programs. With
respect to any welfare benefit plan or program of Carbon that the Employer Entity determines, in its sole discretion, provides benefits of the same type or class as a corresponding plan or program
maintained by the Employer Entity, the Employer Entity shall continue such Carbon plan or program in effect for the benefit of the Transferred Employees so long as they remain eligible to participate
and until they shall become eligible to become participants in the corresponding plan or program maintained by the Employer Entity (and, with respect to any such plan or program, subject to complying
with eligibility requirements and subject to the right of the Employer Entity to terminate such plan or program). For purposes of administering the welfare plans and programs subject to this
Section 5.11(c), service with Carbon shall be deemed to be service with the Employer Entity for the purpose of determining eligibility to participate and vesting (if applicable) in such welfare
plans and programs, but not for the purpose of computing benefits, if any, determined in whole or in part with reference to service (except as otherwise provided in Section 5.11(d)). 

        (d)   Except
to the extent of contractual commitments, if any, specifically made or assumed hereunder by Evergreen, all Transferred Employees shall be employees at will (to
the extent permitted by applicable law) of the Employer Entity, and neither Evergreen nor any other Employer Entity shall have any obligation arising from the Merger to continue any Transferred
Employees in its employ or in any specific job or to provide to any Transferred Employee any specified level of compensation or any incentive payments, benefits or perquisites. Each Transferred
Employee who is terminated by an Employer Entity subsequent to the Effective Time, excluding any employee who has a then existing contract providing for severance, shall be entitled to severance pay
in accordance with the special severance policy adopted by Evergreen for Transferred Employees, if and to the extent that such employee is entitled to severance pay under such policy. Such employee's
service with Carbon or a Carbon Subsidiary shall be treated as 

A-29

service
with Evergreen for purposes of determining the amount of severance pay under Evergreen's severance policy. 

        (e)   Evergreen
agrees to honor all employment agreements, severance agreements and deferred compensation agreements that Carbon and the Carbon Subsidiaries have with their
current and former employees and directors and which have been Disclosed to Evergreen pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent any such agreements shall be superseded or terminated at the
Closing or following the Closing Date. Except for the agreements described in the preceding sentence and except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.11, the employee benefit plans of Carbon
shall, in the sole discretion of Evergreen, be frozen, terminated or merged into comparable plans of Evergreen, effective as Evergreen shall determine in its sole discretion. 

           5.12
    Directors and Officers Protection. 

        Evergreen
or a Evergreen Subsidiary shall provide and keep in force for a period of three years after the Effective Time directors' and officers' liability insurance providing coverage
to directors and officers of Carbon for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time. Such insurance shall provide at least the same coverage and amounts as contained in Carbon's policy on
the date hereof; provided, that in no event shall the annual premium on such policy for the first year of such coverage exceed 125% of the annual premium on Carbon's policy in effect as of the date
hereof, and for any subsequent year exceed 125% of the premium for the immediately preceding year (with respect to each year, the "Maximum Amount"). If the amount of the premiums necessary to maintain
or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount for any year, Evergreen shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain the most advantageous policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance obtainable for such year for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount applicable to such year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Evergreen further agrees to indemnify all individuals who are or
have been officers, directors or employees of Carbon or any Carbon Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time from any acts or omissions in such capacities prior to the Effective Time, to the extent that
such indemnification is provided pursuant to the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of Carbon on the date hereof and is permitted under the CBCA. 

           5.13
    Forbearances of Evergreen. 

        Except
with the prior written consent of Carbon, between the date hereof and the Effective Time, neither Evergreen nor any Evergreen Subsidiary shall take any action which would or might
be expected to (i) cause the business combination contemplated hereby not to constitute a reorganization under Section 368 of the Code; (ii) result in any inaccuracy of a
representation or warranty herein that would allow for termination of this Agreement; (iii) cause any of the conditions precedent to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to fail to
be satisfied; or (iv) fail to comply in any material respect with any laws, regulations, ordinances or governmental actions applicable to it and to the conduct of its business. 

           5.14
    Reports. 

        Each
of Carbon and Evergreen shall file (and shall cause the Carbon Subsidiaries and the Evergreen Subsidiaries, respectively, to file), between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, all reports required to be filed by it with the Commission and any other regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over such party, and shall deliver to Evergreen or Carbon, as the
case may be, copies of all such reports promptly after the same are filed. If financial statements are contained in any such reports filed with the Commission, such financial statements will fairly
present the consolidated financial position of the entity filing such statements as of the dates indicated and the consolidated results of operations, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows
for the periods then ended in accordance with GAAP (subject in the case of interim financial statements to the absence of notes and to normal recurring year-end adjustments that are not
material). As of their respective dates, such 

A-30

reports
filed with the Commission will comply in all material respects with the Securities Laws and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Any financial statements contained in any other
reports to a regulatory authority other than the Commission shall be prepared in accordance with requirements applicable to such reports. 

           5.15
    Exchange Listing. 

        Evergreen
shall use its reasonable best efforts to list, prior to the Effective Time, on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, the shares of Evergreen Common Stock to be
issued to the holders of Carbon Common Stock pursuant to the Merger, and Evergreen shall give all notices and make all filings with the NYSE required in connection with the transactions contemplated
herein. 

           5.16
    Public Information Filings. 

        Evergreen
agrees that it will duly and timely file all annual, quarterly or other periodic reports that it may be required to file pursuant to the Exchange Act and will make available
adequate current public information with respect to its financial condition and operations under Rule 144(c) of the Securities Act in order to permit resales of the Exchange Shares in
accordance with Rule 145(d)(1) or (2) promulgated thereunder, for the lesser of: (i) the period that resales of the Exchange Shares by the Carbon shareholders are subject to
compliance with Rule 145 under the Securities Act, or (ii) the period that the Carbon shareholders shall own any of the Exchange Shares. 

           5.17
    Status of Exchange Shares and Securities Act. 

        Carbon
acknowledges and agrees that the Exchange Shares when delivered to the Carbon shareholders who are affiliates (the term "affiliates" in this Section 5.17 means as defined
under the Securities Laws) will be subject to restrictions upon transfer or other disposition under Rule 145 of the Commission. Upon consummation of the transactions set forth herein, the
Carbon shareholders who are affiliates of Carbon or Evergreen at the time the Merger is submitted to a vote of the Carbon shareholders may not transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the Exchange
Shares, except in compliance with the limitations and restrictions set forth in the Affiliate Agreement referred to in Section 5.10. With respect to affiliates, Evergreen shall cause the
following legend to be placed on each certificate representing ownership of Exchange Shares and any certificates issued in exchange therefor: 

        The
shares represented by this certificate are subject to restrictions as to transfer by virtue of provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the
General Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder. Such shares may not be transferred except in compliance with Rule 145(d) under the Securities Act or the
favorable opinion of counsel for Evergreen Resources, Inc. that such transfer will not constitute or result in a violation of the registration provisions of the Securities Act. 

With
respect to any proposed disposition by the Carbon shareholders of their holdings of the Exchange Shares, and upon receipt of such evidence as Evergreen may reasonably request in confirmation that
the conditions to transfer have been satisfied, Evergreen will give to its transfer agent such instructions and opinions of its counsel as may be necessary to effect a registration of the transfer
free of the foregoing restrictions. 

           5.18
    Registration Rights Agreement. 

        On
the Closing Date, Evergreen and Yorktown Energy Partners III, L.P. will enter into a Registration Rights Agreement in the form attached hereto as Annex C in order to provide for the
registration of the resale of shares of Evergreen Common Stock acquired in the Merger by Yorktown Energy Partners III, L.P. and its limited partners.

ARTICLE VII
  TERMINATION, DEFAULT, WAIVER AND AMENDMENT    

        7.1
    Termination. 

        This
Agreement may be terminated: 

        (a)   At
any time prior to the Effective Time, by the mutual consent in writing of the parties hereto. 

        (b)   At
any time prior to the Effective Time, by either party (i) in the event of a material breach by the other party of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement, or (ii) in the event of an inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the other party contained in this Agreement, which inaccuracy would provide the nonbreaching party the
ability to refuse to consummate the Merger under the applicable standard set forth in Section 6.2(a) in the case of Carbon and Section 6.3(a) in the case of Evergreen; and, in the case
of (i) or (ii), if such breach or inaccuracy has not been cured by the earlier of thirty days following written notice of such breach to the party committing such breach or the Effective Time. 

        (c)   At
any time prior to the Effective Time, by either party hereto in writing, if any of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such party to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby cannot be satisfied or fulfilled prior to the Closing Date, and the party giving the notice is not in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or undertakings herein. 

        (d)   At
any time, by either party hereto in writing, if any of the applications for prior approval referred to in Section 5.4 are denied, and the time period for
appeals and requests for reconsideration has run. 

        (e)   At
any time, by either party hereto in writing, if the shareholders of Carbon do not approve the Agreement and the Plan of Merger. 

        (f)    At
any time following October 31, 2003 by either party hereto in writing, if the Effective Time has not occurred by the close of business on such date, and the
party giving the notice is not in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or undertakings herein. 

        (g)   At
any time prior to 11:59 p.m. on the 30
th
 day after the date that Evergreen receives the Carbon Disclosure Memorandum, by Evergreen in writing, if
Evergreen determines in its sole good faith judgment, through review of information Disclosed by Carbon, or as a result of Evergreen's investigation undertaken following the date of this Agreement, or
otherwise, that there exists (i) any conditions which represent or are reasonably likely to result in a breach of Carbon's 

A-34

representation
and warranty set forth in Section 3.11, (ii) any defects in title that would render Carbon's title to any of its properties or assets less than good and marketable,
(iii) any contracts or agreements to which Carbon or any of its properties or assets are bound that contain terms that are not typical of similar contracts dealing with similar subject matter,
or (iv) any other conditions, defects or circumstances, whether or not relating to Carbon's properties and assets, that would materially and adversely affect the ownership, use or value of any
of Carbon's properties or that would make the financial condition, results of operations, business or business prospects of Carbon and of the Carbon Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, materially
adversely different from Evergreen's reasonable expectations with respect thereto on the date of execution of this Agreement. The fact that Carbon has Disclosed information shall not prevent Evergreen
from terminating this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(g) on account of such information. 

           7.2
    Effect of Termination. 

        In
the event this Agreement and the Plan of Merger is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, both this Agreement and the Plan of Merger shall become void and have no effect, except
that (i) the provisions hereof relating to confidentiality, the Termination Fee and expenses set forth in Sections 5.6, 7.6 and 8.1, respectively, shall survive any such termination and
(ii) a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(b) shall not relieve the breaching party from liability for a breach of the covenant, agreement, representation or warranty giving rise to such
termination. 

          7.3
    Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. 

        All
representations, warranties and covenants in this Agreement or the Plan of Merger or in any instrument delivered pursuant hereto or thereto shall expire on, and be terminated and
extinguished at, the Effective Time, other than covenants that by their terms are to be performed after the Effective Time (including Sections 5.12 and 5.16); provided that no such representations,
warranties or covenants shall be deemed to be terminated or extinguished so as to deprive Evergreen or Carbon (or any director, officer or controlling person thereof) of any defense at law or in
equity which otherwise would be available against the claims of any person, including, without limitation, any shareholder or former shareholder of either Evergreen or Carbon, the aforesaid
representations, warranties and covenants
being material inducements to consummation by Evergreen and Carbon of the transactions contemplated herein. 

           7.4
    Waiver. 

        Except
with respect to any required regulatory approval, each party hereto, by written instrument signed by an executive officer of such party, may at any time (whether before or after
approval of the Agreement and the Plan of Merger by the Carbon shareholders) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party hereto and may waive
(i) any inaccuracies of the other party in the representations or warranties contained in this Agreement, the Plan of Merger or any document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto,
(ii) compliance with any of the covenants, undertakings or agreements of the other party, or satisfaction of any of the conditions precedent to its obligations, contained herein or in the Plan
of Merger, or (iii) the performance by the other party of any of its obligations set out herein or therein; provided that no such extension or waiver, or amendment or supplement pursuant to
this Section 7.4, executed after approval by the Carbon shareholders of this Agreement and the Plan of Merger, shall reduce either the Exchange Ratio or the payment terms for fractional
interests. 

           7.5
    Amendment or Supplement. 

        This
Agreement or the Plan of Merger may be amended or supplemented at any time in writing by mutual agreement of Evergreen and Carbon, subject to the proviso to Section 7.4.

(or at any adjournment thereof) or (B) prior to such
shareholders' meeting, Carbon's Board of Directors shall have withdrawn its recommendation or refused to recommend to the shareholders of Carbon that they vote to approve the Plan of Merger; 

        (ii)   by
Evergreen pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or 7.1(c) (in either case, solely with respect to a breach by Carbon of Section 5.1 or Section 5.8(j)); or 

        (iii)  by
Evergreen pursuant to Section 7.1(b) as a result of any breach of this Agreement on the part of Carbon (other than a breach by Carbon of Section 5.1
or Section 5.8(j)), and an overture from a bona fide person or entity shall have been communicated to the Carbon Board of Directors at or before the time of such breach to engage in an
agreement, plan or transaction to acquire or purchase all or a substantial portion of the assets of or a substantial equity interest in, or to effect any recapitalization, liquidation or dissolution
involving or a business combination or other similar transaction with, Carbon or any Carbon Subsidiary (including, without limitation, a bona fide tender offer or exchange offer to purchase Carbon
Common Stock) other than with Evergreen or an Evergreen Subsidiary; 

then
Carbon shall within two business days after the occurrence of such termination, pay to Evergreen as compensation for the Merger not becoming effective a termination fee equal to $2,500,000 (the
"Termination Fee") by wire transfer of immediately available funds. The Termination Fee shall be in addition to any other rights that Evergreen may have under this Agreement and is not intended to
constitute liquidated damages or a penalty, and shall be payable without regard to any expenses to be paid pursuant to Section 8.1. 

        (b)   Carbon
acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 7.6(a) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without
these agreements, Evergreen would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Carbon fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to Section 7.6(a) and, in order to obtain such payment,
Evergreen commences a suit which results in a judgment against Carbon for all or a substantial portion of the payment set forth in Section 7.6(a), Carbon shall pay to Evergreen its costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the Termination Fee from the date that payment was required to be made until the date payment is
made at the prime rate of Wachovia Bank, N.A., in effect on the date payment was required to be made plus two percentage points.

The
Board of Directors

Carbon Energy Corporation

1700 Broadway, Suite 1150

Denver, Colorado 80290 

Members
of the Board: 

        You
have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the common stock ("Company Common Stock") of Carbon Energy Corporation, a Colorado
corporation (the "Company"), of the Common Exchange Ratio set forth in the proposed Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the "Agreement") dated March 31, 2003, by and among Evergreen
Resources, Inc., a Colorado corporation ("Evergreen"), Evergreen Merger Corporation, a Colorado corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Evergreen ("Merger Sub"), and the Company. Pursuant to
the Agreement, Merger Sub will merge (the "Merger") into the Company. Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings used in the Agreement unless otherwise defined herein. 

        Pursuant
to the Agreement, each outstanding share of Company Common Stock is proposed to be exchanged for the Per Share Merger Consideration (comprising shares of Evergreen Common Stock,
calculated in accordance with the Common Exchange Ratio). Stock Options of the Company will be assumed by Evergreen and adjusted to become options to acquire shares of Evergreen Common Stock based on
the Common Exchange Ratio. Pursuant to the Agreement, the transaction is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under the provisions of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue
Code. The terms and conditions of the Merger, including the matters described above in this paragraph, are set forth more fully in the Agreement. 

        RBC
Dain Rauscher Inc. ("RBC"), a member company of RBC Capital Markets, as part of its investment banking services, is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, corporate restructurings, underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for
corporate and other purposes. 

        We
are acting as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Merger, and we will receive a fee for our services, which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger or a
similar transaction involving the Company. We will also receive a fee for providing this opinion, which is creditable against the contingent transaction fee. The opinion fee is not contingent upon the
consummation of the Merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. We have, in the past, provided financial advisory services to the
Company. In the ordinary course of business, RBC may act as a market maker and broker in the publicly traded securities of the Company and receive customary compensation in connection therewith, and
also actively trades securities of the Company for its own account and the accounts of its customers, and, accordingly, may hold a long or short position in such securities. Similarly, in the ordinary
course of business, RBC may also act as a market maker and broker in the publicly traded securities of Evergreen and receive customary compensation in connection therewith, and also actively trades
securities of Evergreen for its own account and the accounts of its customers, and, accordingly, may hold a long or short position in such securities. 

        In
the preparation of our opinion, we have undertaken such review and inquiries as we deemed necessary or appropriate under the circumstances, including the following: (i) we
reviewed the financial terms of the Agreement; (ii) we reviewed and analyzed certain publicly available financial and other data with respect to the Company and Evergreen and certain other
relevant historical operating data relating to the Company and Evergreen made available to us from published sources and from the internal records of the Company and Evergreen; (iii) we
conducted discussions with members of the 

senior
management of the Company with respect to the business prospects and financial outlook of the Company; (iv) we conducted discussions with members of the senior management of Evergreen
with respect to the business prospects and financial outlook of Evergreen and the combined company; (v) we received and reviewed financial forecasts prepared by the Company's management and
Evergreen's management on the potential future performance of the Company and Evergreen, respectively, each on a stand alone basis, and combined; and (vi) we reviewed the Company's and
Evergreen's Summary Reserve Reports dated December 31, 2002, prepared by their respective independent reserve engineers. 

        In
arriving at our opinion, we performed the following analyses in addition to the review and inquiries referred to in the preceding paragraph: (i) we reviewed the reported prices
and trading activity for Company Common Stock and Evergreen Common Stock; (ii) we compared the implied historical
exchange ratios between Evergreen Common Stock and Company Common Stock with the Common Exchange Ratio (iii) we considered the relative contribution of the Company and Evergreen; (iv) we
compared selected market valuation metrics of the Company, Evergreen and other comparable publicly-traded companies; (v) we compared the financial metrics, to the extent publicly available, of
selected precedent transactions; and (xiii) we performed other studies and analyses as we deemed appropriate. 

        In
rendering our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial, legal, tax, operating and other information provided to us by the Company and
Evergreen (including, without limitation, the financial statements and related notes thereto of the Company and Evergreen), and have not assumed responsibility for independently verifying and have not
independently verified such information. We have not assumed any responsibility to perform, and have not performed, an independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the respective assets or
liabilities of the Company or Evergreen, and we have not been furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. In addition, we have not assumed any obligation to conduct, and have not conducted, any
physical inspection of the property or facilities of the Company or Evergreen. Additionally, we have not been asked and did not consider the possible effects of any litigation or other legal claims. 

        We
have assumed that the Merger will be accounted for by Evergreen as a purchase transaction under generally accepted accounting principles and will qualify as a tax-free
reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes. We have also assumed, in all respects material to our analysis, that the representations and warranties of each party contained in the
Agreement are true and correct, that each party will perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the Agreement, and that all conditions to the consummation of the
Merger will be satisfied without waiver thereof. In addition, in arriving at our opinion, we have assumed that, in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals for the Merger, no
restrictions, including any divestiture requirements, will be imposed that would have a material effect on the combined Company. 

        Our
opinion speaks only as of the date hereof, is based on the conditions as they exist and information which we have been supplied as of the date hereof, and is without regard to any
market, economic, financial, legal, or other circumstances or event of any kind or nature which may exist or occur after such date. 

        Our
advisory services and the opinion expressed herein are provided for the information and assistance of the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with the transaction
contemplated by the Agreement and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the Merger. This opinion shall not be otherwise
published or used, nor shall any public references to RBC be made, without our prior written consent, except for publication in any proxy statement or prospectus related to the Merger. 

B-2

        Our
opinion does not address the merits of the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Merger or the relative merits of the Merger compared to any alternative business
strategy or transaction in which the Company might engage. 

        Our
opinion addresses solely the fairness of the Common Exchange Ratio, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock. Our opinion does not in any way address
other Merger terms or arrangements, including, without limitation, the financial or other terms of any voting or employment agreement. We are not expressing any opinion herein as to the prices at
which Company Common Stock or Evergreen Common Stock have traded or may trade following the announcement or consummation of the Merger. 

        Based
on our experience as investment bankers and subject to the foregoing, including the various assumptions and limitations set forth herein, it is our opinion that, as of the date
hereof, the Common Exchange Ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock. 

Very
truly yours, 

RBC
DAIN RAUSCHER INC.
