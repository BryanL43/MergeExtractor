This Amendment No. 2 (Amendment) to the Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (this Schedule TO) filed initially
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) on January 29, 2003 and amended by Amendment No. 1 to the Schedule TO filed with the Commission on February 10, 2003, relates to the offer by Rapid Resources Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the Purchaser) and a wholly owned subsidiary of SunGard Data Systems Inc., a Delaware corporation (SunGard), to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock (the Shares) of Caminus
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (Caminus), at a purchase price of $9.00 per Share, in cash, without interest thereon, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated January 29, 2003 (the
Offer to Purchase), and in the related Letter of Transmittal (which, as they may be amended or supplemented from time to time, such Offer to Purchase and Letter of Transmittal together constitute the Offer), copies of which
were previously filed as Exhibits (a)(1) and (a)(2), respectively, to the Schedule TO. This Amendment to the Schedule TO is being filed on behalf 

of the Purchaser and SunGard. Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings
ascribed to such terms in the Offer to Purchase. 

ITEMS 1-9 AND ITEM 11 

Items 1-9 and Item 11 of the Schedule TO are hereby amended and supplemented to include the following: 

Statements made by SunGard, Purchaser or
Caminus in connection with the Offer are not entitled to the safe harbor provisions of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the PSLRA). Consequently, notwithstanding any statements to the contrary, the PSLRA does not
apply to any forward-looking statements made by SunGard, Purchaser or Caminus in connection with the Offer. 

Items 1-9 and Item 11 of the Schedule TO are hereby amended by the following amendments to the Offer to Purchase: 

The ninth paragraph of the Introduction to the Offer to
Purchase is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: 

The following directors, executive officers and affiliated stockholders of Caminus have entered into a tender and voting agreement with SunGard and the Purchaser (the Tender and Voting
Agreement) pursuant to which they have agreed, in their capacity as stockholders of Caminus, to tender all of their shares of Caminus common stock, with certain limited exceptions, as well as any additional shares of Caminus common stock that
they may acquire (pursuant to Caminus stock options or otherwise), with certain limited exceptions, to the Purchaser in the Offer: 

William P. Lyons; 
Brian J. Scanlan; 
Joseph P. Dwyer; 
John A. Andrus; 
Cynthia Chang; 
Clare M.J. Spottiswoode; 
OCM Principal Opportunities Fund, L.P.; 
ZAK Associates, Inc.; 
RIT Capital Partners PLC; 
GFI Two LLC; and 
OW Richards and CMJ Spottiswoode Accumulation and Maintenance Trust DTD. 

As of January 19, 2003, such directors, executive officers and
affiliated stockholders held in the aggregate, including shares issuable upon exercise of stock options, 5,099,416 shares of Caminus common stock, which represented approximately 28% of Caminuss Adjusted Outstanding Shares as of such date. See
Section 12 (Purpose of the Offer; Plans for Caminus; The Merger Agreement; The Tender and Voting Agreement) of this Offer to Purchase. 

The eleventh
paragraph of the Introduction to the Offer to Purchase is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: 

Caminus has informed the Purchaser that, as of January 19, 2003, there were (i) 16,782,306 shares of Caminus common
stock issued and outstanding; (ii) 896,272 shares of Caminus common stock subject to outstanding options with exercise prices per share equal to or less than the Offer Price; (iii) 280,556 shares of Caminus common stock subject to outstanding
options with exercise prices per share greater than the Offer Price; and (iv) up to 300,000 shares to be issued by Caminus pursuant to its 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Based upon the foregoing, the Minimum Condition will be satisfied if at
least approximately 9,150,000 shares of Caminus common stock are validly tendered (including shares tendered pursuant to the Tender and Voting Agreement) and not withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date of the Offer. Assuming all of the shares of
Caminus common stock that are eligible to be tendered by the parties to the Tender and Voting Agreement (except for an aggregate of 469,300 outstanding shares and shares underlying outstanding options which are subject to pledge agreements or the
tender of which would violate the provisions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are tendered, an aggregate of approximately 4,520,000 additional shares of Caminus common stock, representing approximately 25% of the
Adjusted Outstanding Shares of Caminus as of January 19, 2003 would need to be validly tendered in order to satisfy the Minimum Condition. The actual number of shares of Caminus common stock that are required to be tendered to satisfy the Minimum
Condition will depend upon the actual number of Adjusted Outstanding Shares prior to the Expiration Date. 

The tenth paragraph of Section 1 (Terms of the Offer) of the Offer to Purchase is hereby amended and restated as follows: 

Under Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act,
the Purchaser may provide for a subsequent offering period so long as, among other things, (i) the initial 20-business day period of the Offer has expired, (ii) the Purchaser offers the same form and amount of consideration for shares of Caminus
common stock in the subsequent offering period that was offered in the Offer, (iii) the Purchaser immediately accepts and promptly pays for all shares of Caminus common stock that are validly tendered to the Purchaser and not properly withdrawn
prior to the Expiration Date, (iv) the Purchaser announces the results of the Offer, including the approximate number and percentage of shares of Caminus common stock that were validly tendered in the Offer, no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City
time, on the next business day after the Expiration Date and immediately begins the subsequent offering period on the next business day after the Expiration Date, and (v) the Purchaser immediately accepts and promptly pays for shares of Caminus
common stock as they are tendered during the subsequent offering period. 

The second
sentence of the first paragraph of Section 4 (Acceptance for Payment and Payment for Shares of Caminus Common Stock) of the Offer to Purchase is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: 

Subject to the terms of the Merger
Agreement, the Purchaser expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to delay acceptance for payment of or the payment for shares of Caminus common stock that are tendered in the Offer in order to comply with any applicable antitrust law
or obtain any necessary governmental regulatory approval, including, without limitation, pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. See Section 14 (Certain Legal Matters) of this Offer to Purchase.

The second sentence of the last paragraph of
Section 8 (Certain Information Concerning Caminus) of the Offer to Purchase is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: 

Although the Purchaser and SunGard do not have any knowledge that any such information is untrue, neither the
Purchaser nor SunGard has verified the accuracy or completeness of such information. 

The first sentence of the second paragraph of Section 10 (Source and Amount of Funds) of the Offer to Purchase is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: 

The total amount of funds required by
the Purchaser to pay for all outstanding shares of Caminus common stock that are tendered in the Offer and converted into the right to receive cash in the Merger, and to pay all fees and expenses incurred by SunGard and Purchaser related to the
Offer and the Merger, is estimated to be approximately $164 million plus any related transaction fees and expenses. 

The third paragraph of Section 10 (Source and Amount of Funds) of the Offer to Purchase is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to
read as follows: 

SunGards line of credit is available pursuant to a 364-Day Credit Agreement, dated as of January 25, 2002 and as amended from time to time, and an Amended and Restated Three-Year Credit Agreement, dated as of January 10,
2003 (collectively, the Credit Agreements), among SunGard, certain banks and other financial institutions, JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent, PNC Bank, National Association, as Syndication Agent, First Union National Bank, as
Documentation Agent, ABN AMRO Bank, N.V., as Co-Documentation Agent, and Fleet National Bank, as Co-Documentation Agent. The Credit Agreements contain representations and warranties, conditions precedent, covenants, events of default and other
provisions generally found in similar agreements. The Credit Agreements provide for up to $500 million of unsecured borrowings, and consist of a $150 million short-term (364 day) facility that was extended in January 2003 that now expires in January
2004, a $175 million revolving facility and a $175 million term loan that both expire in January 2005. The multi-year agreement 

was amended in January 2003 to permit $75 million of multicurrency borrowing under the
$175 million revolving facility and to add J.P. Morgan Europe Limited, as London Agent, as a party. SunGards only current outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreements are $175 million under the term loan. SunGard can periodically
designate borrowings as base-rate borrowings or LIBOR borrowings. Base-rate borrowings bear interest generally at the prime rate plus a margin (currently prime), while LIBOR borrowings bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin (currently
LIBOR plus 1%), depending upon SunGards corporate credit rating at the time of the borrowing. Interest rates on base-rate borrowings reset daily, while LIBOR borrowings can be fixed for one-, two-, three- or six-month periods at SunGards
option. In order to remain eligible to borrow under the Credit Agreements, SunGard must, among other requirements, maintain a minimum net worth of $850 million plus 50% of the quarterly net income starting April 1, 2002 ($930 million as of September
30, 2002), an interest coverage ratio of at least four to one, and limit its total debt to no more than two and one-half times SunGards earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. 

Each of the third and fourth paragraph of Section 11
(Background of the Offer) to the Offer to Purchase is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: 

On September 26, 2002, Mr. Conde indicated in a conversation with Mr. Gilson that SunGard considered the valuation
of Caminus to be approximately $7.00 per share. The initial price of $7.00 per share was determined by SunGard after a review of the historical public information regarding Caminus, in particular Caminuss financial results and financial
condition. SunGard also made certain assumptions with respect to future revenue growth and cost synergies that could be achieved with the acquisition of Caminus. Mr. Gilson responded that it did not appear that SunGard, in deriving its valuation,
was factoring appropriately, among other things, expected revenues or the number of shares of Caminus common stock outstanding. Mr. Gilson indicated that the 2002 expected revenue figure that SunGard was using to value Caminus was lower than the
consensus of publicly available estimates by stock analysts following Caminuss stock. In addition, Mr. Gilson indicated that SunGard had not taken into account Caminuss recently announced stock buy-back program and was therefore using an
inflated figure regarding the number of shares of Caminus common stock outstanding. 

Subsequently, in a conversation with Mr. Gilson on October 10, 2002, Mr. Conde indicated that SunGard had revised its
valuation of Caminus and considered its revised valuation of Caminus to be in the range of $8.50 to $9.00 per share. 

The second bullet point under the first paragraph of Section 13 (Certain Conditions to the Offer) of the Offer to Purchase is hereby
amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: 

on any scheduled expiration date of the Offer, any of the following events or circumstances shall occur or exist or shall be reasonably determined by SunGard or the Purchaser to have occurred or exist, and in the sole
good faith judgment of SunGard or the Purchaser, and regardless of the circumstances giving rise to such event or circumstance, such event or circumstance makes it inadvisable to proceed with the Offer and/or with such acceptance for payment of or
payment for shares of Caminus common stock: 

The penultimate paragraph of Section 13 (Certain Conditions to the Offer) of the Offer to Purchase is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of SunGard and the Purchaser and,
subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, may be asserted by SunGard or Purchaser regardless of the circumstances giving rise to such condition, and must be satisfied, unless waived by SunGard or Purchaser in one or more respects
(as described below) prior to the Expiration Date. The foregoing conditions may be waived by SunGard or Purchaser, in their reasonable discretion, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time prior to the Expiration Date, in each case
subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement. The failure by SunGard or the Purchaser, at any time prior to the Expiration Date, to exercise any of the foregoing rights will not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right will be deemed
an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time prior to the Expiration Date. 

Section 13 (Certain Conditions to the Offer) of the Offer to Purchase is hereby amended to
include the following paragraph after the penultimate paragraph of that section. 

The foregoing paragraph notwithstanding, the condition requiring compliance with any applicable antitrust law or
other governmental regulation may be satisfied or waived by SunGard or Purchaser, in their reasonable discretion, after the Expiration Date and prior to the Purchasers acceptance for payment of or payment for the validly tendered shares.

The foregoing is hereby incorporated by
reference in answer to Items 1-9 and Item 11 of the Schedule TO.
