OFFER TO PURCHASE

Prepared by R.R. Donnelley Financial -- Offer to Purchase



Exhibit (a)(1) 

Offer to Purchase
for Cash 

All Outstanding Shares of Common Stock 

of 

inSilicon Corporation 

at 

$4.05 Net Per Share 

by 

Ferrite Acquisition Corp., 

a wholly owned
subsidiary of 

Synopsys, Inc. 

THE OFFER AND WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS WILL EXPIRE AT 12:00 MIDNIGHT, NEW YORK CITY TIME, ON WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 4, 2002, UNLESS THE
OFFER IS EXTENDED.

The Offer is being made pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of July 23, 2002, by and among Synopsys, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Ferrite Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Synopsys (the Purchaser), and inSilicon Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the Merger Agreement) pursuant to which, following the consummation of the Offer and the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, the Purchaser will be merged with and into inSilicon (the Merger), with
inSilicon surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Synopsys. As a result of the Merger, each outstanding share of inSilicon common stock (other than shares owned by Synopsys, the Purchaser, inSilicon or any subsidiary of Synopsys or
inSilicon, or by stockholders, if any, who are entitled to and properly exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive the price per share paid pursuant to the Offer in cash, without interest thereon.

The inSilicon Board of Directors has, based upon a unanimous recommendation of a special committee of the
Board of Directors of inSilicon, (i) determined that the Merger Agreement is advisable, (ii) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (including the Offer and the Merger, taken together) are at a price and on
terms that are in the best interests of the holders of shares of common stock of inSilicon (other than inSilicons majority stockholder, Phoenix Technologies Ltd., with respect to which the inSilicon Board of Directors has made no
determination), and (iii) approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Offer and the Merger. Accordingly, the inSilicon Board of Directors recommends that the stockholders of inSilicon (other than Phoenix
Technologies, as to which the inSilicon Board of Directors makes no recommendation) accept the Offer and tender their shares of inSilicon common stock to the Purchaser pursuant to the Offer. 

The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, (i) there being validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer and not properly withdrawn prior to the
Expiration Date (as defined in this Offer to Purchase) that number of shares of inSilicon common stock that, together with the shares of inSilicon common stock then owned by the Purchaser and Synopsys (if any), represent a majority of all then
outstanding shares of inSilicon common stock, calculated on a fully diluted basis including all shares of inSilicon common stock issued or issuable upon the redemption of the exchangeable preferred stock of inSilicon Canada Ltd. and the exercise of
all then outstanding options to purchase shares of inSilicon common stock, other than options with a per share exercise price that is greater than the Offer Price (as defined in this Offer to Purchase) (which shares are referred to as
inSilicons Fully Diluted shares and which condition is referred to as the Minimum Condition), and (ii) the termination or expiration of any waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976,
as amended, applicable to the purchase of shares of inSilicon common stock pursuant to the Offer. The Offer is also subject to other conditions described in section 13 (Certain Conditions of the Offer) of this Offer to Purchase.

As of July 23, 2002, Phoenix Technologies held an aggregate number of shares of inSilicon common stock that
represented 58.4% of all then outstanding Fully Diluted shares of inSilicon common stock. Phoenix Technologies has entered into a Tender and Voting Agreement with Synopsys, dated as of July 23, 2002, pursuant to which it agreed, solely in its
capacity as a stockholder of inSilicon, to tender all of its shares of inSilicon common stock to the Purchaser in the Offer. Assuming that Phoenix Technologies tenders its shares to the Purchaser in the Offer in compliance with its Tender and Voting
Agreement with Synopsys, the Minimum Condition will be satisfied. In addition, all of inSilicons directors and executive officers have entered into Tender and Voting Agreements with Synopsys, dated as of July 23, 2002, pursuant to which they
agreed, solely in their capacity as stockholders of inSilicon, to tender all of their shares of inSilicon common stock to the Purchaser in the Offer. 

Questions regarding the Offer, and requests for assistance in connection with the Offer, may be directed to the Information Agent for the Offer at its address and telephone number listed below.

SUMMARY TERM SHEET 

We are Ferrite Acquisition Corp. and we are making an offer to
purchase your outstanding shares of common stock of inSilicon Corporation. The following are some of the questions you, as a stockholder of inSilicon, may have about our offer and our answers to those questions. This Summary Term Sheet provides
important and material information about our offer that is described in more detail elsewhere in this Offer to Purchase, but this Summary Term Sheet may not include all of the information about our offer that is important to you. We urge you to
carefully read the remainder of this Offer to Purchase and the related Letter of Transmittal for our offer because the information in this Summary Term Sheet is not complete. Additional important information about our offer is contained in the
remainder of this Offer to Purchase and the related Letter of Transmittal for our offer. We have included cross-references in this Summary Term Sheet to other sections of this Offer to Purchase to direct you to the sections of this Offer to Purchase
in which a more complete description of the topics covered in this Summary Term Sheet appear. 

Who is Ferrite Acquisition Corp.?

We are a Delaware corporation formed by Synopsys, Inc. for the sole purpose of making a tender offer for the
outstanding shares of common stock of inSilicon. Synopsys is a leading supplier of electronic design automation (EDA) software to the global electronics industry. See Introduction and section 9 (Certain Information Concerning the
Purchaser and Synopsys) of this Offer to Purchase for more information. 

How many shares of inSilicon common stock are you
offering to purchase? 

We are making an offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock of
inSilicon. See Introduction and section 1 (Terms of the Offer) of this Offer to Purchase for more information. 

How much are you offering to pay for my shares of inSilicon common stock, what is the form of payment and will I have to pay any fees or commissions if I tender my shares in your offer? 

We are offering to pay $4.05 per share, net to you, in cash (without interest) for your shares of inSilicon common stock. If you are the
record owner of your shares and you tender them in our offer, you will not have to pay any brokerage fees or similar expenses for doing so. If you own your shares through a broker or other nominee, and your broker tenders your shares in our offer on
your behalf, your broker or nominee may charge you a fee for doing so. You should consult your broker or nominee to determine whether it will charge you a fee for tendering your shares in our offer. See Introduction and section 1
(Terms of the Offer) of this Offer to Purchase for more information. 

Do you have the financial resources to pay for all
of the shares of inSilicon common stock that you are offering to purchase? 

Yes.    Our
parent company, Synopsys, will provide us with sufficient funds to pay for all of the shares of inSilicon common stock that are tendered to us in the offer and to make any payments for all of the shares of inSilicon common stock that are not
tendered in our offer and that will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $4.05 in cash in the merger described below, following the successful completion of our offer. Synopsys expects to use its generally available corporate funds
to make these payments. Our offer is not conditioned upon any financing arrangements or contingencies. See section 10 (Source and Amount of Funds) of this Offer to Purchase for more information. 



Is your financial condition relevant to my decision whether to tender my shares of inSilicon common
stock in your offer? 

We do not believe that our financial condition is relevant to your decision whether to
tender your shares of inSilicon common stock in our offer because: 



cash is the only consideration that we are paying to the holders of inSilicon common stock in connection with our offer; 



we are offering to purchase all of the outstanding shares of inSilicon common stock in our offer; 



our offer is not subject to any financing arrangements or other contingencies; and 



the amount of cash consideration payable to holders of inSilicon common stock in our offer and the merger described below, taken together, is not material in
relation to the financial capacity of Synopsys and its affiliates. 

See section 10
(Source and Amount of Funds) of this Offer to Purchase for more information. 

How long do I have to decide whether to
tender my shares of inSilicon common stock in your offer? 

Unless we extend our offer, you will have at least
until 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Wednesday, September 4, 2002, to decide whether to tender your shares of inSilicon common stock in our offer. Further, if you cannot deliver everything that is required to tender your shares by that time,
you may be able to use a guaranteed delivery procedure in lieu of tendering your shares, which is described in section 1 (Terms of the Offer) and section 2 (Procedures for Tendering Shares of inSilicon Common Stock in the
Offer) of this Offer to Purchase. 

Under what circumstances can or must you extend your offer? 

We are required to extend our offer: 



for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission or its staff that is applicable to our
offer, or by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. that is applicable to our offer; and 



for successive periods of not more than 10 business days each, until either all of the conditions to our offer are satisfied or waived or our Merger Agreement
with inSilicon is terminated in accordance with its terms. See section 1 (Terms of the Offer) of this Offer to Purchase for more information. 

We are not required to extend our offer beyond September 21, 2002, unless any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended, has not expired or been terminated by that date, in which event we are required to extend our offer if so requested by inSilicon (or we can elect to do so even if not so requested by inSilicon), but in no event are we required to extend our
offer beyond December 21, 2002. 

We may, and under certain circumstances we are required to, provide for a
subsequent offering period following the expiration of our offer during which you could tender your shares to us for the same offer price payable in our offer. See section 1 (Terms of the Offer) of this Offer to Purchase for more
information. 

How will I be notified if you extend your offer? 

If we extend our offer, we will inform the depositary for our offer of that fact and will make a public announcement of the extension, not later than 9:00 a.m., New York
City time, on the next business day after the day on which our offer was scheduled to expire. See section 1 (Terms of the Offer) of this Offer to Purchase for more information. 

What are the most significant conditions to your offer? 

We are not obligated to purchase any shares of inSilicon common stock that are tendered in our offer unless, prior to the expiration date of our offer, the number of shares validly tendered in accordance with the terms of our offer
and not properly withdrawn, together with the shares of inSilicon common stock then owned by



Synopsys and us (if any), represents a majority of all then outstanding shares of inSilicon common stock, calculated on a fully diluted basis including all shares of inSilicon common stock issued
or issuable upon the redemption of all outstanding shares of the exchangeable preferred stock of inSilicon Canada Ltd. and the exercise of all then outstanding options to purchase inSilicon common stock, other than options with a per share exercise
price that is greater than $4.05 (which condition we refer to as the minimum condition in this Summary Term Sheet). As of July 23, 2002, Phoenix Technologies held an aggregate number of shares of inSilicon common stock that represented
58.4% of all then outstanding shares of inSilicon common stock calculated on a fully diluted basis in the manner described above. Phoenix Technologies has entered into a Tender and Voting Agreement with Synopsys, dated as of July 23, 2002, pursuant
to which it agreed, solely in its capacity as a stockholder of inSilicon, to tender all of its shares of inSilicon common stock in our offer. Assuming that Phoenix Technologies tenders its shares in our offer in compliance with its Tender and Voting
Agreement, the minimum condition will be satisfied. In addition, all of inSilicons directors and executive officers have entered into Tender and Voting Agreements with Synopsys, dated as of July 23, 2002, pursuant to which they agreed, solely
in their capacity as stockholders of inSilicon, to tender all of their shares of inSilicon common stock in our offer. 

We are not obligated to purchase any shares of inSilicon common stock that are tendered in our offer if any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, has not expired or been
terminated. 

We are not obligated to purchase any shares of inSilicon common stock that are tendered in our offer
if, by the expiration of our offer, there has occurred and continues to exist any change or effect that is, or is reasonably likely to be, materially adverse to the business, assets (including intangible assets), financial condition or results of
operations of inSilicon and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (with some exceptions). 

Our offer is not subject
to any financing arrangements or contingencies, but it is subject to a number of other conditions that we have not described above. See section 13 (Certain Conditions of the Offer) of this Offer to Purchase for more information about
these other conditions to our offer. 

We can waive any condition to our offer, other than the minimum condition.

How do I tender my shares of inSilicon common stock in your offer? 

To tender all or any portion of your shares of inSilicon common stock in our offer, you must deliver the certificate or certificates representing your tendered shares,
together with the related Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile copy of it) enclosed with this Offer to Purchase, properly completed and duly executed, together with any required signature guarantees, and any other required documents, to the
depositary for our offer, Computershare Trust Company of New York, prior to the expiration date of our offer. 

If
you hold your shares of inSilicon common stock in street name through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee and you wish to tender all or any portion of your shares of inSilicon common stock in our offer, the
broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee that holds your shares must tender them in our offer on your behalf through the depositary for our offer. 

If you cannot deliver the items that are required to be delivered to the depositary for our offer by the expiration date of our offer, you may obtain a little extra time to
do so by having a broker, bank or other fiduciary that is a member of the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program or other eligible institution guarantee that the missing items will be received by the depositary for our offer within three
Nasdaq Stock Market trading days. You may be able to use the Notice of Guaranteed Delivery enclosed with this Offer to Purchase for this purpose. To tender shares of inSilicon common stock in this manner, however, the depositary for our offer must
receive the missing items within that three trading day period. See section 2 (Procedures for Tendering Shares of inSilicon Common Stock in the Offer) of this Offer to Purchase for more information. 



Can I withdraw shares that I previously tendered in your offer? 

Yes.    You can withdraw some or all of the shares of inSilicon common stock that you previously tendered in our offer
at any time until the expiration date of our offer as it may be extended. Further, if we have not accepted your shares for payment within 60 days after we commence our offer, you can withdraw them at any time after such 60-day period. Once we accept
your tendered shares for payment upon the expiration of our offer, however, you will no longer be able to withdraw them. In addition, your right to withdraw your previously tendered shares will not apply to any subsequent offering period (which is
not the same as an extension of our offer), if one is provided. See section 1 (Terms of the Offer) and section 3 (Withdrawal Rights) of this Offer to Purchase for more information. 

How do I withdraw my previously tendered shares? 

To withdraw any shares of inSilicon common stock that you previously tendered in our offer, you (or, if your shares are held in street name, the broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust
company or other nominee that holds your shares) must deliver a written notice of withdrawal (or a facsimile copy of one), with the required information, to the depositary for our offer while you still have the right to withdraw your shares. See
section 1 (Terms of the Offer) and section 3 (Withdrawal Rights) of this Offer to Purchase for more information. 

Has the inSilicon board of directors approved your offer? 

Yes.    Our offer is being made pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 23, 2002, by and among Synopsys, inSilicon and us. The inSilicon board of directors has, based upon a unanimous
recommendation of a special committee of the board of directors of inSilicon, (i) determined that the Merger Agreement is advisable, (ii) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (including our offer and the
merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement, taken together) are at a price and on terms that are in the best interests of the holders of shares of common stock of inSilicon (other than inSilicons majority stockholder, Phoenix Technologies,
with respect to which the inSilicon board of directors has made no determination), and (iii) approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including our offer and the merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Accordingly, the inSilicon board of directors recommends that the stockholders of inSilicon (other than Phoenix Technologies, as to which the inSilicon board of directors makes no recommendation) accept our offer and tender their shares of inSilicon
common stock in our offer. 

The factors considered by the inSilicon board of directors, in addition to the
special committees recommendation, in making the determinations and the recommendation described above are described in inSilicons Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, which has been filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and is being mailed to the stockholders of inSilicon at the same time as the mailing of this Offer to Purchase to such stockholders. The factors considered by the special committee of the inSilicon board of directors in making
its recommendation that the inSilicon board of directors make the determinations and the recommendation described above, are described in inSilicons Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9. 

RBC Dain Rauscher Inc., which acted as the financial advisor to the special committee of the inSilicon board of directors, delivered an
opinion to the special committee and the inSilicon board of directors, dated July 21, 2002, to the effect that, as of such date and subject to the qualifications, assumptions and limitations stated in its written opinion, the offer price to be paid
to tendering stockholders pursuant to our offer and to be paid to holders of inSilicon common stock in the related merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of inSilicon common stock (other than Phoenix Technologies,
as to which the RBC Dain Rauscher Inc. was not asked to express, and did not express, an opinion). Stockholders of inSilicon are urged to, and should, carefully read inSilicons Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 and the
opinion of RBC Dain Rauscher Inc. in their entirety. 



Have any stockholders of inSilicon already agreed to tender their shares in your offer?

Yes.    As noted above, Phoenix Technologies and inSilicons directors and executive
officers have entered into Tender and Voting Agreements with Synopsys pursuant to which they each agreed, solely in their capacity as stockholders of inSilicon, to tender all of their respective shares of inSilicon common stock in our offer. As of
July 23, 2002, Phoenix Technologies held an aggregate number of shares of inSilicon common stock that represented 58.4% of all then outstanding shares of inSilicon common stock calculated on a fully diluted basis in the manner described above.

What are your plans if you complete your offer but do not acquire all of the outstanding shares of inSilicon common stock in your
offer? 

If we complete our offer and certain conditions are satisfied, as soon as practicable following the
completion of our offer, we intend to merge with and into inSilicon. As a result of that merger (i) all of the outstanding shares of inSilicon common stock that are not tendered in our offer, other than shares that are owned by Synopsys, inSilicon
or us and any shares that are owned by stockholders who have properly and validly exercised appraisal rights under Delaware law in respect of such shares, will be canceled and converted into the right to receive $4.05 in cash, and (ii) all of our
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock, which are currently owned by Synopsys, will be canceled and converted into shares of inSilicon, as a result of which Synopsys will own all of the issued and outstanding shares of inSilicon.

We are not obligated to merge with inSilicon following the completion of our offer unless the requisite approval
of inSilicons stockholders under Delaware law has been obtained and no court or other governmental authority has issued or enacted an order or law which prohibits the merger. If we obtain at least 90% of the outstanding shares of inSilicon
common stock pursuant to our offer, however, we will not be required to obtain stockholder approval for the merger. Even if we do not obtain 90% of the outstanding shares of inSilicon common stock pursuant to our offer, if we complete our offer, we
will hold a sufficient number of shares of inSilicon common stock so as to ensure that we will obtain the requisite approval of inSilicon stockholders under Delaware law to complete the merger. 

If you complete your offer, what will happen to inSilicons board of directors? 

If we complete our offer, we are entitled to designate a number of individuals who will become directors of inSilicon and comprise a majority of the members of inSilicons board of directors.
inSilicon has agreed to take all action necessary to ensure that our designees are appointed to its board of directors. Therefore, if we complete our offer, we will obtain control over the management of inSilicon shortly thereafter. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, until the effective time of the merger described above, the members of the special committee of inSilicons board of directors will remain members of the board of directors of inSilicon, and their approval will be required to,
among other things, amend or terminate the Merger Agreement on behalf of inSilicon, waive any of the obligations of Synopsys or us under the Merger Agreement, or waive any of inSilicons rights under the Merger Agreement. See Section 12
(Purpose of the Offer; Plans for inSilicon; The Merger Agreement; The Tender and Voting Agreements) of this Offer to Purchase for more information. 

If I decide not to tender my shares of inSilicon common stock in your offer, how will your offer affect my shares? 

If we complete our offer, but you do not tender your shares in our offer, at the effective time of the merger, described above, your shares will be canceled and converted into the right to receive the
same amount of cash that you would have received had you tendered your shares in our offer, subject to your right to pursue your appraisal rights under Delaware law. Therefore, if we complete the merger, unless you perfect your appraisal rights
under Delaware law, the only difference to you between tendering your shares in our offer and not tendering your shares in our offer is that you will be paid earlier if you tender your shares. 



Until such time, if any, when we complete the merger following our offer, the
number of stockholders and the number of shares of inSilicon common stock that remain in the hands of the public may be so small that there may no longer be an active public trading market (or, possibly, any public trading market) for such shares.
Also, shares of inSilicon common stock may no longer be eligible to be traded on the Nasdaq National Market or any other securities exchange, and inSilicon may cease making filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or otherwise cease being
required to comply with the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules relating to publicly held companies. See section 7 (Effect of the Offer on the Market for Shares of inSilicon Common Stock; Nasdaq Listing of inSilicon Common Stock;
Exchange Act Registration of inSilicon Common Stock; Margin Regulations) and section 12 (Purpose of the Offer; Plans for inSilicon; The Merger Agreement; The Tender and Voting Agreements) of this Offer to Purchase for more
information. 

Are appraisal rights available in either your offer or the related merger? 

Appraisal rights are not available in connection with our offer. If you choose not to tender your shares of inSilicon common stock in our
offer, however, and we complete the offer, appraisal rights will be available to you in connection with our merger with and into inSilicon. If you choose to exercise your appraisal rights in connection with the merger, and you comply with the
applicable legal requirements under Delaware law, you will be entitled to payment for your shares based on a fair and independent appraisal of the market value of your shares. This market value may be more or less than the $4.05 per share that we
are offering to pay you for your shares in the offer. See section 12 (Purpose of the Offer; Plans for inSilicon; The Merger Agreement; The Tender and Voting Agreements) of this Offer to Purchase for more information. 

What are the United States federal income tax consequences of tendering my shares of inSilicon common stock in your offer? 

The receipt of cash pursuant to our offer (or the merger described above) will be a taxable transaction for United States
federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and may also be a taxable transaction under applicable state, local or foreign income or other tax laws. Generally, for United States federal income tax purposes, a
stockholder tendering shares of inSilicon common stock in our offer will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received by the stockholder in our offer (or the merger described above) and the stockholders
aggregate adjusted tax basis in the shares tendered by the stockholder and purchased in our offer (or converted into cash in the merger described above). Gain or loss will be calculated separately for each block of shares tendered and purchased in
the offer (or converted into cash in the merger described above). See section 5 (Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences) of this Offer to Purchase for more information. 

Stockholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax consequences to them (including the application and effect of any state,
local or foreign income and other tax laws) of our offer (and the merger described above). 

What is the market value of my shares
of inSilicon common stock? 

On July 23, 2002, the last trading day before Synopsys and inSilicon announced
that they had entered into the Merger Agreement, the last sale price of shares of inSilicon common stock reported on Nasdaq National Market was $2.40 per share. On August 5, 2002, the last full trading day prior to the commencement of our offer, the
last sale price of shares of inSilicon common stock reported on the Nasdaq National Market was $4.01 per share. We advise you to obtain a recent quotation for shares of inSilicon common stock when deciding whether to tender your shares in our offer.
See section 6 (Price Range of Shares of inSilicon Common Stock; Dividends on Shares of inSilicon Common Stock) of this Offer to Purchase for more information.

INTRODUCTION

Ferrite Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (the
Purchaser) and a wholly owned subsidiary of Synopsys, Inc., a Delaware corporation, hereby offers to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of inSilicon Corporation, a Delaware corporation, at
a price of $4.05 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon (the Offer Price), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Offer to Purchase and the Letter of Transmittal enclosed with this Offer to
Purchase, which together with any amendments or supplements hereto or thereto, collectively constitute the Offer described in this Offer to Purchase. 

Tendering inSilicon stockholders whose shares of inSilicon common stock are registered in their own names and who tender their shares directly to Computershare Trust Company of New York, which is
acting as the depositary for the Offer (the Depositary) will not be obligated to pay brokerage fees or commissions in connection with the Offer or, except as set forth in Instruction 6 of the Letter of Transmittal for the Offer, transfer
taxes on the sale of shares pursuant to the Offer. Stockholders of inSilicon who hold their shares of inSilicon common stock through brokers, dealers, commercial banks, trust companies or other nominees should check with such institutions to
determine whether they will charge any service fees for tendering such stockholders shares to the Purchaser in the Offer. 

The Purchaser will pay all fees and expenses of the Depositary and D.F. King & Co., Inc., which is acting as the information agent for the Offer (the Information Agent), incurred in connection with the Offer. See
section 15 (Fees and Expenses) of this Offer to Purchase for more information. 

The Offer is being
made pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 23, 2002, by and among Synopsys, the Purchaser and inSilicon (the Merger Agreement) pursuant to which, following the consummation of the Offer and the satisfaction or
waiver of certain conditions, the Purchaser will be merged with and into inSilicon (the Merger), with inSilicon surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Synopsys. As a result of the Merger, each outstanding share of inSilicon
common stock (other than shares owned by Synopsys, the Purchaser, inSilicon or any subsidiary of Synopsys or inSilicon, or by stockholders, if any, who are entitled to and properly exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law) will be converted into
the right to receive the price per share paid pursuant to the Offer in cash, without interest thereon. See section 12 (Purpose of the Offer; Plans for inSilicon; The Merger Agreement; The Tender and Voting Agreements) of this offer to
purchase for more information. 

The inSilicon Board of Directors has, based upon a unanimous recommendation of
a special committee of the Board of Directors of inSilicon, (i) determined that the Merger Agreement is advisable, (ii) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (including the Offer and the Merger, taken
together) are at a price and on terms that are in the best interests of the holders of shares of common stock of inSilicon (other than inSilicons majority stockholder, Phoenix Technologies Ltd. (Phoenix Technologies), with respect
to which the inSilicon Board of Directors has made no determination), and (iii) approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Offer and the Merger. Accordingly, the inSilicon Board of Directors recommends
that the stockholders of inSilicon (other than Phoenix Technologies, as to which the inSilicon Board of Directors makes no recommendation) accept the Offer and tender their shares of inSilicon common stock to the Purchaser pursuant to the Offer.

The factors considered by the inSilicon Board of Directors, in addition to the special committees
recommendation, in making the determinations and the recommendation described above are described in inSilicons Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, which has been filed with the



Securities and Exchange Commission and is being mailed to the stockholders of inSilicon at the same time as the mailing of this Offer to Purchase. The factors considered by the special committee
of the inSilicon Board of Directors in making its recommendation that the inSilicon Board of Directors make the determinations and the recommendation described above, are described in inSilicons Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9. 

RBC Dain Rauscher Inc., which acted as the financial advisor to the special committee of
the inSilicon Board of Directors, delivered an opinion to the special committee and the inSilicon Board of Directors, dated July 21, 2002, to the effect that, as of such date and subject to the qualifications, assumptions and limitations stated in
its opinion, the Offer Price to be paid to tendering stockholders pursuant to the Offer and to be paid to holders of inSilicon common stock in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of inSilicon common stock
(other than Phoenix Technologies, as to which RBC Dain Rauscher Inc. was not asked to express, and did not express, an opinion). Stockholders of inSilicon are urged to, and should, carefully read inSilicons Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 and the opinion of RBC Dain Rauscher Inc. in their entirety. 

The Offer is
conditioned upon, among other things, (i) there being validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date (as defined in section 1 of this Offer to Purchase) of the Offer that
number of shares of inSilicon common stock that, together with the shares of inSilicon common stock then owned by the Purchaser and Synopsys (if any), represent a majority of all then outstanding shares of inSilicon common stock, calculated on a
fully diluted basis including all shares of inSilicon common stock issued or issuable upon the redemption of the exchangeable preferred stock of inSilicon Canada Ltd. and the exercise of all then outstanding options to purchase shares of inSilicon
common stock, other than options with a per share exercise price that is greater than the Offer Price (which shares are referred to as inSilicons Fully Diluted shares and which condition is referred to as the Minimum
Condition), and (ii) the termination or expiration of any waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, applicable to the purchase of shares of inSilicon common stock pursuant to the Offer. The
Offer is also subject to other conditions described in section 13 (Certain Conditions of the Offer) of this Offer to Purchase. 

As of July 23, 2002, Phoenix Technologies held an aggregate number of shares of inSilicon common stock that represented 58.4% of all then outstanding Fully Diluted shares of inSilicon common stock.
Phoenix Technologies has entered into a Tender and Voting Agreement with Synopsys, dated as of July 23, 2002, pursuant to which it agreed, solely in its capacity as a stockholder of inSilicon, to tender all of its shares of inSilicon common stock to
the Purchaser pursuant to the Offer. Assuming that Phoenix Technologies tenders its shares to the Purchaser in the Offer in compliance with its Tender and Voting Agreement with Synopsys, the Minimum Condition will be satisfied. In addition, all of
inSilicons directors and executive officers have entered into Tender and Voting Agreements with Synopsys, dated as of July 23, 2002, pursuant to which they agreed, solely in their capacity as stockholders of inSilicon, to tender all of
their shares of inSilicon common stock to the Purchaser in the Offer. 

Completion of the Merger is also
subject to a number of conditions, including (i) the purchase of shares of inSilicon common stock by the Purchaser pursuant to the Offer, and (ii) the approval of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of inSilicon common stock, if required by applicable law. If the Purchaser acquires 90% or more of the outstanding shares of inSilicon common stock pursuant to the Offer, the Purchaser and Synopsys will be able to complete the
Merger without obtaining the approval of the remaining holders of inSilicon common stock who have not tendered their shares of inSilicon common stock in the Offer. In such event, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Synopsys, the Purchaser and
inSilicon have agreed to take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after the completion of the Offer. See section 12 (Purpose of the Offer; Plans for inSilicon; The Merger
Agreement; The Tender and Voting Agreements) of this Offer to Purchase for more information. 



inSilicon has informed the Purchaser that, as of July 19, 2002, there were: (i)
15,196,923 shares of inSilicon common stock issued and outstanding; (ii) 4,142,957 shares of inSilicon common stock subject to outstanding options to purchase shares of inSilicon common stock from inSilicon; and (iii) 744,332 shares of inSilicon
common stock reserved for issuance upon redemption of all exchangeable preferred stock of inSilicon Canada Ltd. then issued and reserved for issuance. Based upon the foregoing and assuming the redemption of all the then issued and reserved for
issuance shares of exchangeable preferred stock of inSilicon Canada Ltd. for shares of inSilicon common stock and the exercise of all 1,963,613 outstanding options to purchase shares of inSilicon common stock with exercise prices per share equal to
or less than $4.05, the Minimum Condition will be satisfied if at least 8,952,435 shares of inSilicon common stock are validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date of the Offer. Phoenix Technologies owns, and has agreed to tender
in the Offer under the terms of its Tender and Voting Agreement with Synopsys, an aggregate of 10,450,010 shares of inSilicon common stock. The actual number of shares of inSilicon common stock that are required to be tendered to satisfy the Minimum
Condition will depend upon the actual number of outstanding Fully Diluted shares of inSilicon common stock prior to the Expiration Date. 

Certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the sale of shares of inSilicon common stock pursuant to the Offer and the conversion of shares of inSilicon common stock pursuant to the Merger are described in section 5
(Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences) of this Offer to Purchase. 

This Offer to
Purchase and the related Letter of Transmittal for the Offer contain important information about the Offer and should be read carefully and in their entirety before any decision is made with respect to the Offer. 



THE TENDER OFFER

1.

Terms of the Offer

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer, the
Purchaser will accept for payment and pay for all shares of inSilicon common stock that are validly tendered prior to the Expiration Date and not theretofore withdrawn in accordance with the procedures for withdrawal described in section 3
(Withdrawal Rights) of this Offer to Purchase. The term Expiration Date as used in this Offer to Purchase means 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Wednesday, September 4, 2002, unless and until the Purchaser extends the
period of time during which the Offer is open in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, in which event the term Expiration Date as used in this Offer to Purchase will mean the latest time and date on which the Offer, as so
extended by the Purchaser, will expire. 

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Purchaser is obligated to
extend the Offer by giving oral or written notice of such extension to the Depositary, (i) for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission or its staff that is applicable to the
Offer, or by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. that is applicable to the Offer, or (ii) in the event that any of the conditions to the Offer are not satisfied or waived as of any then scheduled
Expiration Date, for successive extension periods of not more than 10 business days each until such time as either (a) all of the conditions to the Offer are satisfied or waived or (b) the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with it terms.
We are not required to extend our Offer beyond September 21, 2002, unless any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, has not expired or been terminated by that date, in which event we
are required to extend our Offer if so requested by inSilicon (or we can elect to do so even if not so requested by inSilicon), but in no event are we required to extend our Offer beyond December 21, 2002. 

Under no circumstances will interest be paid on the Offer Price for tendered shares of inSilicon common stock, regardless of any
extension of or amendment to the Offer or any delay in paying for any shares. 

The Purchaser expressly
reserves the right (but is not obligated under the terms of the Merger Agreement or for any other reason) to increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer, at any time and from time to time, by giving
oral or written notice of such increase or other change to the Depositary, except that, unless otherwise provided by the Merger Agreement or previously approved by inSilicon in writing, the Purchaser may not make any change to the terms and
conditions of the Offer that (i) decreases the Offer Price, (ii) changes the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer, (iii) reduces the number of shares of inSilicon common stock to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) imposes conditions to the
Offer in addition to the conditions to the Offer described in section 13 (Certain Conditions of the Offer) of this Offer to Purchase, (v) amends the conditions to the Offer described in section 13 (Certain Conditions of the
Offer) of this Offer to Purchase so as to broaden the scope of such conditions to the Offer (vi) extends the Offer for any reason other than as described in the immediately preceding paragraph of this Offer to Purchase, (vii) amends or waives
the Minimum Condition, or (viii) makes any other change to any of the terms and conditions of the Offer that is adverse to the holders of shares of inSilicon common stock in the reasonable and good faith judgment of inSilicon. 

If by 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Wednesday, September 4, 2002 (or by any other time and date then scheduled as the
Expiration Date), any or all of the conditions to the Offer have not been satisfied or waived, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Purchaser will (i)
subject to the qualification described in the immediately preceding paragraph of this Offer to Purchase with respect to the Minimum Condition, waive all of the conditions to the Offer that remain unsatisfied and accept for payment and pay for all
shares of inSilicon common stock that have been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date, (ii) extend the Offer and,



subject to the right of holders of shares of inSilicon common stock previously tendered to withdraw such tendered shares at any time prior to the Expiration Date, retain all of the shares that
have been previously tendered and not properly withdrawn during the period or periods for which the Offer is extended, (iii) subject to the qualifications described in the immediately preceding paragraph of this Offer to Purchase, amend the Offer,
or (iv) terminate the Offer in accordance with the Merger Agreement, not accept for payment or pay for any shares of inSilicon common stock and return all previously tendered shares to the owners of such shares. 

Any extension, waiver, amendment or termination will be followed as promptly as practicable by a public announcement thereof. An
announcement in the case of an extension will be made no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the next business day after the previously scheduled Expiration Date. Without limiting the manner in which the Purchaser may choose to make any
public announcement, subject to applicable law (including Rules 14d-4(d), 14d-6(c) and 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), which require that material changes be promptly disseminated to
holders of shares of inSilicon common stock), the Purchaser will have no obligation to publish, advertise or otherwise communicate any such public announcement other than by issuing a release to the PR Newswire news service. The phrase
business day as used in this paragraph has the meaning set forth in Rule 14d-1 under the Exchange Act. 

In the event that the Purchaser makes a material change in the terms of the Offer or the information concerning the Offer, or waives a material condition of the Offer, the Purchaser will disseminate additional tender offer materials
and extend the Offer to the extent required by Rules 14d-4(d), 14d-6(c) and 14e-1 under the Exchange Act. The minimum period during which an Offer must remain open following a material change in the terms of such Offer or information concerning such
Offer, other than a change in price or a change in the percentage of securities sought, will depend upon the facts and circumstances then existing, including the relative materiality of the changed terms or information. With respect to a change in
price or a change in the percentage of securities sought, a minimum period of 10 business days is generally required under the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission to allow for adequate dissemination to
stockholders. 

Under Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act and subject to the conditions described in the following
paragraphs of this Offer to Purchase, the Purchaser may elect to provide for a subsequent offering period, immediately following the Expiration Date, of not less than three business days nor more than 20 business days in length. In addition, the
Purchaser will be obligated to provide for a subsequent offering period immediately following the Expiration Date, of 10 business days in length, in the event that more than 85% (but less than 90%) of the then outstanding shares of inSilicon common
stock are validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date. 

If provided, a
subsequent offering period would be an additional period of time, following the Expiration Date and the acceptance for payment of, and the payment for, any shares of inSilicon common stock that are validly tendered in the Offer and not properly
withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date, during which holders of shares of inSilicon common stock that were not previously tendered in the Offer may tender such shares to the Purchaser in exchange for the Offer Price on the same terms and conditions
that applied to the Offer. A subsequent offering period is not the same as an extension of the Offer, which will have been previously completed if a subsequent offering period is provided. The Purchaser will accept for payment, and pay for, any
shares of inSilicon common stock that are validly tendered to the Purchaser during a subsequent offering period, if provided, as promptly as practicable after any such shares are validly tendered to the Purchaser during such subsequent offering
period, for the same price paid to holders of shares of inSilicon common stock that were validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date, net to the holders thereof in cash. Holders of shares of inSilicon common
stock that are validly tendered to the Purchaser during a subsequent offering period, if provided, will not have the right to withdraw such tendered shares. 

Under Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act, the Purchaser may provide for a subsequent offering period so long as, among other things, (i) the initial 20-business day period of the Offer has expired, (ii)
the Purchaser offers the same form and amount of consideration for shares of inSilicon common stock in the subsequent



offering period that was offered in the Offer, (iii) the Purchaser immediately accepts and promptly pays for all shares of inSilicon common stock that are validly tendered to the Purchaser and
not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date, (iv) the Purchaser announces the results of the Offer, including the approximate number and percentage of shares of inSilicon common stock that were deposited in the Offer, no later than 9:00
a.m., New York City time, on the next business day after the Expiration Date and immediately begins the subsequent offering period, and (v) the Purchaser immediately accepts and promptly pays for shares of inSilicon common stock as they are tendered
during the subsequent offering period. 

Unless required under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Purchaser
does not currently intend to provide for a subsequent offering period following the expiration of the Offer, although it reserves the right to do so in its sole discretion. 

inSilicon has provided the Purchaser with a list, and security position listings, of inSilicons stockholders for the purpose of disseminating the Offer to holders of
shares of inSilicon common stock. This Offer to Purchase, the related Letter of Transmittal enclosed with this Offer to Purchase and other materials related to the Offer will be mailed to record holders of shares of inSilicon common stock, and will
be furnished to brokers, dealers, commercial banks, trust companies and other nominees whose names, or the names of whose nominees, appear on the list of inSilicons stockholders, or, if applicable, who are listed as participants in a clearing
agencys security position listing, for subsequent transmittal to beneficial owners of shares of inSilicon common stock.

executed, together with any required signature guarantees (as described below under the caption Guaranteed Signatures) and any other required documents, must be received by the Depositary at one of its addresses listed on the back cover
of this Offer to Purchase prior to the Expiration Date; 



in the case of a tender effected pursuant to the book-entry transfer procedures described below under the caption Book-Entry Transfer, (i) either
the related Letter of Transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, together with any required signature guarantees (as described below under the caption Guaranteed Signatures), or an Agents Message (as described below under
the caption Book-Entry Transfer), and any other required documents, must be received by the Depositary at one of its addresses listed on the back cover of this Offer to Purchase prior to the Expiration Date, and (ii) the shares to be
tendered must be delivered pursuant to the book-entry transfer procedures described below under the caption Book-Entry Transfer and a Book-Entry Confirmation (as described below under the caption Book-Entry Transfer) must be
received by the Depositary prior to the Expiration Date; or 



the tendering stockholder must comply with the guaranteed delivery procedures described below under the caption Guaranteed Delivery prior to the

The valid tender of shares of inSilicon common stock in accordance with one

The method of delivery of shares of inSilicon common stock to be tendered in the Offer, the related Letter of Transmittal and all other required documents, including
delivery through the Book-Entry Transfer Facility described below under the caption Book-Entry Transfer, is at the election and risk of the tendering stockholder. Shares of inSilicon common stock to be tendered in the Offer will be
deemed



delivered only when actually received by the Depositary (including, in the case of a book-entry transfer, by Book-Entry Confirmation described below under the caption Book-Entry
Transfer). If delivery of shares is made by mail, registered mail with return receipt requested, properly insured, is recommended. In all cases, sufficient time should be allowed to ensure timely delivery. 

Book-Entry Transfer 

The Depositary will establish an account with respect to the shares of inSilicon common stock at The Depository Trust Company (the Book-Entry Transfer Facility) for purposes of the Offer
within two business days after the date of this Offer to Purchase. Any financial institution that is a participant of the Book-Entry Transfer Facilitys system may effect a book-entry delivery of shares of inSilicon common stock in the Offer by
causing the Book-Entry Transfer Facility to transfer such shares into the Depositarys account in accordance with the Book-Entry Transfer Facilitys procedures for such transfer. The confirmation of a book-entry transfer of shares into the
Depositarys account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility as described above is sometimes referred to in this Offer to purchase as a Book-Entry Confirmation. The term Agents Message as used in this Offer to Purchase
means a message, transmitted by the Book-Entry Transfer Facility to, and received by, the Depositary and forming a part of a Book-Entry Confirmation, which states that (i) the Book-Entry Transfer Facility has received an express acknowledgment from
the participant in the Book-Entry Transfer Facility tendering the shares of inSilicon common stock that such participant has received, (ii) the participant agrees to be bound by the terms of the Letter of Transmittal, and (iii) the Purchaser may
enforce such agreement against such participant. 

Although delivery of shares of inSilicon common stock may be
effected through book-entry transfer into the Depositarys account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility, the Letter of Transmittal enclosed with this Offer to Purchase (or a facsimile copy of it), properly completed and duly executed, together
with any required signature guarantees (as described below under the caption Signature Guarantees), or an Agents Message (as described above), and any other required documents, must be received by the Depositary at one of its
addresses listed on the back cover of this Offer to Purchase prior to the Expiration Date to effect a valid tender of shares by book-entry. Delivery of documents to the Book-Entry Transfer Facility in accordance with the Book-Entry Transfer
Facilitys procedures does not constitute delivery to the Depositary. 

Signature Guarantees

No signature guarantee is required on the Letter of Transmittal that is being returned with shares of
inSilicon common stock being tendered in the Offer if (i) the Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the shares of inSilicon common stock tendered with such Letter of Transmittal, unless such registered holder(s) has
completed either the box labeled Special Payment Instructions or the box labeled Special Delivery Instructions on such Letter of Transmittal, or (ii) shares of inSilicon common stock are tendered for the account of a
financial institution (including most commercial banks, savings and loan associations and brokerage houses) that is a participant in the Security Transfer Agents Medallion Program, Nasdaq Stock Market Medallion Signature Guarantee Program or the
Stock Exchange Medallion Program or by any other eligible guarantor institution, as such term is defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act (which we sometimes refer to as Eligible Institutions in this Offer to Purchase).
For purposes of the foregoing, a registered holder of shares of inSilicon common stock includes any participant in the Book-Entry Transfer Facilitys system whose name appears on a security position listing as the owner of such
shares. In all other cases, all signatures on the Letter of Transmittal that is being returned with shares of inSilicon common stock being tendered in the Offer must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution. See Instructions 1 and 5 to the Letter of
Transmittal enclosed with this Offer to Purchase for more information. If certificates representing shares of inSilicon common stock being tendered in the Offer are registered in the name of a person other than the signer of the Letter of
Transmittal that is being returned with such shares, or if payment is to be made or certificates representing shares of inSilicon common stock not being tendered or not accepted for payment are to be returned to a person other than the registered
holder



of the certificates surrendered, the tendered certificates must be endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either case signed exactly as the name or names of the registered
holders or owners appear on such certificates, with the signatures on such certificates or stock powers guaranteed as aforesaid. See Instructions 1 and 5 to the Letter of Transmittal enclosed with this Offer to Purchase for more information.

Guaranteed Delivery 

If a stockholder desires to tender shares of inSilicon common stock in the Offer and such stockholders certificates representing such shares are not immediately
available, or the book-entry transfer procedures described above under the caption Book-Entry Transfer cannot be completed on a timely basis, or time will not permit all required documents to reach the Depositary prior to the Expiration
Date, such stockholder may tender such shares of inSilicon common stock if all the following conditions are met: 



such tender is made by or through an Eligible Institution (as described above under the caption Signature Guarantees); 



a properly completed and duly executed Notice of Guaranteed Delivery, substantially in the form enclosed with this Offer to Purchase, is received by the
Depositary at one of its addresses listed on the back cover of this Offer to Purchase prior to the Expiration Date; and 



either (i) the certificates representing tendered shares of inSilicon common stock being tendered in the Offer, together with the Letter of Transmittal enclosed
with this Offer to Purchase (or facsimile copy of it), properly completed and duly executed, and any required signature guarantees (as described above under the caption Signature Guarantees), and any other required documents, are
received by the Depositary at one of its addresses listed on the back cover of this Offer to Purchase within three trading days (as described below) after the date of execution of such Notice of Guaranteed Delivery or (ii) in the case of a
book-entry transfer effected pursuant to the book-entry transfer procedures described above under the caption Book-Entry Transfer, (1) either the Letter of Transmittal enclosed with this Offer to Purchase (or facsimile copy of it),
properly completed and duly executed, and any required signature guarantees (as described above under the caption Signature Guarantees), or an Agents Message (as described above under the caption Book-Entry Transfer),
and any other required documents, is received by the Depositary at one of its addresses listed on the back cover of this Offer to Purchase, and (2) such shares are delivered pursuant to the book-entry transfer procedures described above under the
caption Book-Entry Transfer and a Book-Entry Confirmation (as described above under the caption Book-Entry Transfer) is received by the Depositary, in each case within three trading days after the date of execution of such
Notice of Guaranteed Delivery. For purposes of the foregoing, a trading day is any day on which the Nasdaq Stock Market is open for business. 

The Notice of Guaranteed Delivery described above may be delivered by hand to the Depositary, or transmitted by telegram, facsimile transmission or mail to the Depositary,
and must include a guarantee by an Eligible Institution (as described above under the caption Signature Guarantees) in the form set forth in such Notice of Guaranteed Delivery. 

Other Requirements 

Notwithstanding any provision hereof, in all cases payment for shares of inSilicon common stock that are accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer will be made only after timely receipt by the Depositary of the following:



certificates for such shares, or a timely Book-Entry Confirmation (as described above under the caption Book-Entry Transfer) with respect to such
shares; 



the Letter of Transmittal enclosed with this Offer to Purchase (or a facsimile copy of it), properly completed and duly executed, with any required signature
guarantees (as described above under the



caption Signature Guarantees), or in the case of a Book-Entry Transfer, an Agents Message in lieu of the Letter of Transmittal, as described above under the caption
Book-Entry Transfer); and 



any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal. 

Accordingly, tendering stockholders may be paid at different times depending upon when certificates for shares of inSilicon common stock being tendered in the Offer, or
Book-Entry Confirmations with respect to shares of inSilicon common stock being tendered in the Offer are actually received by the Depositary. 
Under no circumstances will interest be paid by the Purchaser on the Offer Price payable in respect of
shares of inSilicon common stock being tendered in the Offer, regardless of any extension of the Offer or any delay in making such payment.

Appointment 

By executing and returning the Letter
of Transmittal enclosed with this Offer to Purchase (or a facsimile copy of it), or in the case of a book-entry transfer, by delivery of an Agents Message in lieu of the Letter of Transmittal as described above under the caption
Book-Entry Transfer, a stockholder tendering shares of inSilicon common stock in the Offer will be irrevocably appointing designees of the Purchaser as such stockholders attorneys-in-fact and proxies in the manner described in the
Letter of Transmittal, each with full power of substitution, to the full extent of such stockholders rights with respect to the shares of inSilicon common stock being tendered by such stockholder and accepted for payment by the Purchaser and
with respect to any and all other shares of inSilicon common stock or other securities or rights issued or issuable in respect of such shares on or after the date of this Offer to Purchase. All such proxies will be considered coupled with an
interest in the shares of inSilicon common stock being tendered. Such appointment will be effective when, and only to the extent that, the Purchaser accepts for payment the shares of inSilicon common stock being tendered by such stockholder as
provided in this Offer to Purchase. Upon the effectiveness of such appointment, all prior powers of attorney, proxies and consents given by such stockholder with respect to such shares of inSilicon common stock or other securities or rights will,
without further action, be revoked and no subsequent powers of attorney, proxies, consents or revocations may be given (and, if given, will not be effective). The designees of the Purchaser will thereby be empowered to exercise all voting and other
rights with respect to such shares of inSilicon common stock and other securities or rights in respect of any annual, special or adjourned meeting of inSilicons stockholders, actions by written consent in lieu of any such meeting or otherwise,
as they in their sole discretion deem proper. The Purchaser reserves the right to require that, in order for shares of inSilicon common stock to be deemed validly tendered, immediately upon the Purchasers acceptance for payment of such shares,
the Purchaser must be able to exercise full voting, consent and other rights with respect to such shares and other securities or rights, including voting at any meeting of stockholders. 

Determination of Validity 

All questions as to the validity, form, eligibility (including time of receipt) and acceptance of any tender of shares of inSilicon common stock in the Offer will be determined by the Purchaser in its sole discretion, which
determination will be final and binding. The Purchaser reserves the absolute right to reject any or all tenders of shares of inSilicon common stock determined by it not to be in proper form or the acceptance for payment of or payment for which may,
in the opinion of the Purchaser, be unlawful. The Purchaser also reserves the absolute right to waive any defect or irregularity in the tender of any shares of inSilicon common stock of any particular stockholder, whether or not similar defects or
irregularities are waived in the case of other stockholders. No tender of shares of inSilicon common stock in the Offer will be deemed to have been validly made until all defects or irregularities relating thereto have been cured or waived. None of
the Purchaser, Synopsys, inSilicon, the Depositary, the Information Agent for the Offer or any other person will be under any duty to give notification of any defects or irregularities in tenders or incur any liability for failure to give any such
notification. The Purchasers interpretation of the terms and conditions of the Offer (including the Letter of Transmittal and the instructions thereto and any other documents related to the Offer) will be final and binding. 



Backup Withholding 

In order to avoid backup withholding of United States federal income tax on payments of cash in connection with the Offer, a
stockholder tendering shares of inSilicon common stock in the Offer who is a U.S. citizen or a U.S. resident alien must, unless an exemption applies, provide the Depositary with such stockholders correct taxpayer identification number on a
Substitute Form W-9 and certify under penalty of perjury that such taxpayer identification number is correct and that such stockholder is not subject to backup withholding. If a stockholder does not provide such stockholders correct taxpayer
identification number or fails to provide the certifications described above, the United States Internal Revenue Service may impose a penalty on such stockholder and the payment of cash to such stockholder in connection with the Offer may be subject
to backup withholding at a rate of 30%. All stockholders tendering shares of inSilicon common stock in the Offer should complete and sign the main signature form and the Substitute Form W-9 included as part of the Letter of Transmittal enclosed with
this Offer to Purchase to provide the information and certification necessary to avoid backup withholding (unless an applicable exemption exists and is proved in a manner satisfactory to the Purchaser and the Depositary). Certain stockholders
(including, among others, all corporations and certain foreign individuals and entities) are not subject to backup withholding. Stockholders who are not U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens should complete and sign the main signature form and a
Form W-8BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding, included as part of the Letter of Transmittal enclosed with this Offer to Purchase to provide the information and certification necessary to avoid
backup withholding. See Instruction 9 to the Letter of Transmittal enclosed with this Offer to Purchase. 

3.    

Withdrawal Rights 

Except as otherwise provided in this section 3, tenders of shares of
inSilicon common stock in the Offer are irrevocable. Shares of inSilicon common stock that are tendered in the Offer may be withdrawn pursuant to the procedures described below at any time prior to the Expiration Date and shares that are tendered
may also be withdrawn at any time after October 4, 2002 unless accepted for payment on or before that date as provided in this Offer to Purchase. In the event that the Purchaser provides for a subsequent offering period following the completion of
the Offer, (i) no withdrawal rights will apply to shares tendered during such subsequent offering period and (ii) no withdrawal rights will apply to shares that were previously tendered in the Offer and accepted for payment. 

For a withdrawal of shares of inSilicon common stock previously tendered in the Offer to be effective, a written or facsimile transmission
notice of withdrawal must be timely received by the Depositary at one of its addresses listed on the back cover of this Offer to Purchase, specifying the name of the person having tendered the shares to be withdrawn, the number of shares to be
withdrawn and the name of the registered holder of the shares to be withdrawn, if different from the name of the person who tendered the shares. If certificates for shares have been delivered or otherwise identified to the Depositary, then, prior to
the physical release of such certificates, the serial numbers shown on such certificates must be submitted to the Depositary and, unless such shares have been tendered by an Eligible Institution, any and all signatures on the notice of withdrawal
must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution. If shares have been tendered pursuant to the book-entry transfer procedures described in section 2 of this Offer to Purchase, any notice of withdrawal must also specify the name and number of the
account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility to be credited with the withdrawn shares and otherwise comply with the Book-Entry Transfer Facilitys procedures. Withdrawals of tenders of shares may not be rescinded, and any shares properly
withdrawn will thereafter be deemed not validly tendered for purposes of the Offer. Withdrawn shares may be re-tendered in the Offer, however, by again following one of the procedures described in section 2 of this Offer to Purchase at any time
prior to the Expiration Date. 

All questions as to the form and validity (including time of receipt) of any notice
of withdrawal will be determined by the Purchaser in its sole discretion, which determination will be final and binding. None of the Purchaser, Synopsys, inSilicon, the Depositary for the Offer, the Information Agent for the Offer or any other
person will be under any duty to give notification of any defects or irregularities in any notice of withdrawal or incur any liability for failure to give any such notification. 



4.    

Acceptance for Payment and Payment for Shares of inSilicon Common Stock

On the terms
and subject to the conditions of the Offer (including, if the Offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of any such extension or amendment), promptly after the Expiration Date, the Purchaser will accept for payment, and will pay for,
all shares of inSilicon common stock validly tendered to the Purchaser in the Offer and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date. Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Purchaser expressly reserves the right, in its sole
discretion, to delay acceptance for payment of or the payment for shares of inSilicon common stock that are tendered in the Offer in order to comply in whole or in part with any applicable law. Any such delays will be effected in compliance with
Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to a bidders obligation to pay for or return tendered securities promptly after the termination or withdrawal of such bidders offer). 

In all cases, payment for shares of inSilicon common stock that are accepted for payment in the Offer will be made only after timely receipt by the Depositary of:



the certificates representing such shares, together with the Letter of Transmittal enclosed with this Offer to Purchase (or a facsimile copy of it), properly
completed and duly executed, and any required signature guarantees (as described in section 2 (Procedures for Tendering Shares of inSilicon Common Stock in the Offer) of this Offer to Purchase under the caption Signature
Guarantees); or 



in the case of a transfer effected pursuant to the book-entry transfer procedures as described in section 2 (Procedures for Tendering Shares of inSilicon
Common Stock in the Offer) of this Offer to Purchase under the caption Book-Entry Transfer a Book-Entry Confirmation and either the Letter of Transmittal enclosed with this Offer to Purchase (or a facsimile copy of it), properly
completed and duly executed, and any required signature guarantees (as described in section 2 of this Offer to Purchase under the caption Signature Guarantees) or an Agents Message, and any other required documents. 

Accordingly, stockholders tendering shares of inSilicon common stock in the Offer may be paid at different
times depending upon when certificates for shares or Book-Entry Confirmations with respect to shares are actually received by the Depositary. 

The per share consideration paid to any stockholder pursuant to the Offer will be the highest per share consideration paid to any other stockholder pursuant to the Offer. 

For purposes of the Offer, the Purchaser will be deemed to have accepted for payment, and thereby purchased, shares of inSilicon common
stock that are validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date as, if and when the Purchaser gives oral or written notice to the Depositary of the Purchasers acceptance for payment of such shares. On the
terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer, payment for shares of inSilicon common stock that are accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer will be made by deposit of the purchase price therefor with the Depositary, which will act as an agent
for stockholders tendering shares in the Offer for the purpose of receiving payment from the Purchaser and transmitting payment to such stockholders whose shares of inSilicon common stock have been accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer.

Under no circumstances will interest be paid on the Offer Price for shares of inSilicon common stock that are tendered in the Offer, regardless of any extension of, or amendment to, the Offer or any delay in paying for such shares.

If the Purchaser is delayed in its acceptance for payment of, or payment for, shares of inSilicon common
stock that are tendered in the Offer, or is unable to accept for payment, or pay for, shares that are tendered in the Offer for any reason, then, without prejudice to the Purchasers rights under the Offer (but subject to compliance with Rule
14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to a bidders obligation to pay for or return tendered securities promptly after the termination or withdrawal of such bidders offer) and the terms of the Merger Agreement (requiring that the
Purchaser pay for shares of inSilicon common stock that are accepted for payment promptly after the Expiration Date)), the Depositary may, nevertheless, on behalf of the Purchaser, retain shares



of inSilicon common stock that are tendered in the Offer, and such shares may not be withdrawn except to the extent that stockholders tendering such shares are entitled to do so as described in
section 3 (Withdrawal Rights) of this Offer to Purchase. 

If any shares of inSilicon common stock that
are tendered in the Offer are not accepted for payment pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Offer for any reason, the certificates for such shares will be returned (and, if certificates are submitted for more shares than are tendered, new
certificates for the shares not tendered will be sent) in each case without expense to the stockholder tendering such shares (or, in the case of shares delivered by book-entry transfer of such shares into the Depositarys account at the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility pursuant to the book-entry transfer procedures, such shares will be credited to an account maintained at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility), as promptly as practicable after the expiration or termination of the Offer.

5.    

Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences 

The receipt of cash pursuant to
the Offer or the Merger will be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which we sometimes refer to as the IRC in this Offer to Purchase), and may also be a
taxable transaction under applicable state, local or foreign income or other tax laws. Generally, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. stockholder tendering shares of inSilicon common stock in the Offer will recognize gain or loss equal to
the difference between the amount of cash received by the stockholder in the Offer or the Merger and the stockholders aggregate adjusted tax basis in the shares tendered by the stockholder and purchased in the Offer or converted into cash in
the Merger, as the case may be. Gain or loss will be calculated separately for each block of shares tendered and purchased in the offer or converted into cash in the merger, as the case may be. 

If shares of inSilicon common stock that are tendered in the Offer are held by a tendering U.S. stockholder as capital assets, gain or loss recognized by such
stockholder will be capital gain or loss, which will be long-term capital gain or loss if such stockholders holding period for such shares exceeds one year. In the case of a tendering non-corporate stockholder, long-term capital gains will be
eligible for a maximum United States federal income tax rate of 20%. In addition, there are limits on the deductibility of capital losses. 

A stockholder (other than certain exempt stockholders including, among others, all corporations and certain foreign individuals) that tenders shares of inSilicon common stock in the Offer may be subject to 30% backup
withholding unless such stockholder provides such stockholders taxpayer identification number and certifies under penalty of perjury that such taxpayer identification number is correct (or properly certifies that it is awaiting a taxpayer
identification number) and certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. A stockholder that is tendering shares of inSilicon common stock in the
Offer which does not furnish a required taxpayer identification number or which does not otherwise establish a basis for an exemption from backup withholding may be subject to a penalty imposed by the United States Internal Revenue Service. See
section 2 (Procedures for Tendering Shares of inSilicon Common Stock in the Offer) of this Offer to Purchase under the caption Backup Withholding. Each stockholder that is tendering shares of inSilicon common stock in the
Offer who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien should complete and sign the Substitute Form W-9 included as part of the Letter of Transmittal enclosed with this Offer to Purchase so as to provide the information and certification necessary to
avoid backup withholding. Stockholders who are not U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens should complete and sign the Form  W-8BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding included as part of the
Letter of Transmittal enclosed with this Offer to Purchase in order to avoid backup withholding. 

If backup
withholding applies to a stockholder that is tendering shares of inSilicon common stock in the Merger, the Depositary is required to withhold 30% of any amounts that would otherwise be paid to such stockholder in connection with the Offer. Backup
withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the amount of the backup withholding can be credited against the United States federal income tax liability of the person subject to the backup withholding, provided that the required information is
given to the United States Internal Revenue



Service. If backup withholding results in an overpayment of tax, the stockholder subject to such backup withholding can obtain a refund by filing a United States federal income tax return.

The foregoing description is based on the IRC, regulations issued thereunder, judicial decisions and
administrative rulings, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. The foregoing description may not be applicable with respect to shares of inSilicon common stock that are received pursuant to the exercise of employee
stock options or otherwise as compensation or with respect to holders of shares of inSilicon common stock who are subject to special tax treatment under the IRCsuch as non-U.S. persons, insurance companies, dealers or brokers in securities or
currencies, tax-exempt organizations and financial institutionsand may not apply to a holder of shares of inSilicon common stock in light of individual circumstances, such as holding shares of inSilicon common stock as a hedge or as part of a
hedging, straddle, conversion, synthetic security, integrated investment or other risk-reduction transaction. 

Stockholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax consequences to them (including the application and effect of any state, local or foreign income and other tax laws) of the Offer and the
Merger.

common stock on the Nasdaq National Market was $4.01 per share. 
Stockholders are urged to obtain current market quotations for shares of inSilicon common stock before making a decision with respect to the Offer.

inSilicon has not declared nor paid any cash dividends since its initial public offering. In addition, under the terms of the Merger
Agreement, inSilicon is not permitted to declare or pay dividends in respect of shares of its common stock without the prior written consent of Synopsys. 



7.    

Effect of the Offer on the Market for Shares of inSilicon Common Stock; Nasdaq Listing of Shares of inSilicon Common Stock; Exchange Act Registration of Shares of inSilicon Common Stock; Margin Regulations 

Effect of the Offer on the Market for Shares of inSilicon Common Stock 

The purchase of shares of inSilicon common stock pursuant to the Offer will reduce the number of holders of shares of inSilicon common
stock and the number of shares of inSilicon common stock that might otherwise trade publicly and could adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the remaining shares of inSilicon common stock held by the public. 

Nasdaq Listing of Shares of inSilicon Common Stock 

Synopsys intends to cause all shares of inSilicon common stock to be delisted from Nasdaq National Market promptly upon completion of the Merger. 

Even if the Merger is not completed, if shares of inSilicon common stock are purchased pursuant to the Offer, inSilicon may no longer meet
the requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq National Market, depending upon the number of shares purchased pursuant to the Offer. According to Nasdaqs published guidelines, Nasdaq would consider disqualifying shares of inSilicon
common stock for listing on the Nasdaq National Market (though not necessarily from the Nasdaq SmallCap Market) if, among other possible grounds, the number of publicly held shares of inSilicon common stock falls below 750,000, the total number of
beneficial holders of round lots of shares of inSilicon common stock falls below 400, or the market value of publicly held shares of inSilicon common stock over a 30 consecutive business day period is less than $5,000,000. Furthermore, Nasdaq would
consider delisting shares of inSilicon common stock from Nasdaq altogether if, among other possible grounds, the number of publicly held shares of inSilicon common stock falls below 500,000, the total number of beneficial holders of round lots of
shares of inSilicon common stock falls below 300, or the market value of publicly held shares of inSilicon common stock over a 30 consecutive business day period is less than $1,000,000. Shares of inSilicon common stock that are held by directors or
officers of inSilicon, or by any beneficial owner of more than 10% of the shares of inSilicon common stock, are not considered to be publicly held for this purpose. According to inSilicon, as of July 19, 2002, there were 15,196,923 shares of its
common stock outstanding. If, as a result of the purchase of shares of inSilicon common stock pursuant to the Offer or otherwise, the shares of inSilicon common stock no longer meet the requirements of Nasdaq for continued listing and such shares
are either no longer eligible for the Nasdaq National Market or are delisted from Nasdaq altogether, the market for shares of inSilicon common stock will be adversely affected. 

If Nasdaq were to delist shares of inSilicon common stock, it is possible that such shares would continue to trade on other securities exchanges or in the over-the-counter
market and that price quotations would be reported by such exchanges. Under such circumstances, however, the extent of the public market for shares of inSilicon common stock and the availability of such quotations would depend upon the number of
holders of such shares remaining at such time, the level of interest in maintaining a market in such shares on the part of securities firms, the possible termination of registration of such shares under the Exchange Act (as described below) and
other factors. 

Exchange Act Registration of Shares of inSilicon Common Stock 

inSilicon common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act. Such registration may be terminated upon application of
inSilicon to the Securities and Exchange Commission if shares of inSilicon common stock are neither listed on a national securities exchange nor held by 300 or more holders of record. Termination of registration of shares of inSilicon common stock
under the Exchange Act would reduce the information required to be furnished by inSilicon to its stockholders and to the Securities and Exchange Commission and would make certain provisions of the Exchange Act no longer applicable to inSilicon, such
as the short-swing profit recovery provisions of section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the requirement of furnishing a



proxy or information statement pursuant to sections 14(a) and 14(c) of the Exchange Act in connection with meetings of inSilicons stockholders and the related requirement of furnishing an
annual report to inSilicons stockholders, and the requirements of Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act with respect to going private transactions. Furthermore, the ability of affiliates of inSilicon and persons holding
restricted securities of inSilicon to dispose of such securities pursuant to Rule 144 or 144A promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, may be impaired or eliminated if inSilicon common stock is no longer registered under
the Exchange Act. The purchaser intends to seek to cause inSilicon to apply for termination of registration of inSilicon common stock under the Exchange Act as soon after the completion of the Offer as the requirements for such termination are met.

Margin Regulations 

Shares of inSilicon common stock are currently margin securities under the regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (which we
sometimes refer to as the Federal Reserve Board in this Offer to Purchase), which has the effect, among other things, of allowing brokers to extend credit on the collateral of shares of inSilicon common stock. Depending upon factors
similar to those described above regarding listing and market quotations, it is possible that, following the Offer, shares of inSilicon common stock would no longer constitute margin securities for the purposes of the margin regulations
of the Federal Reserve Board and therefore could no longer be used as collateral for loans made by brokers.

Certain Information Concerning inSilicon

General 

inSilicon is a Delaware corporation with its principal offices located at 411 East Plumeria Drive, San Jose, California 95134.
inSilicons telephone number at that address is (408) 894-1900. 

inSilicon was incorporated in Delaware on
November 1, 1999 and completed its initial public offering of shares of its common stock in March 2000. inSilicon is a provider of connectivity semiconductor intellectual property used by semiconductor and systems companies to design complex
systems-on-chip that are critical components of innovative wired and wireless products. 

Certain inSilicon
Projections 

Prior to entering into the Merger Agreement, Synopsys conducted a due diligence review of
inSilicon, and in connection with that review, Synopsys received from inSilicon certain projections of inSilicons future operating performance. To the knowledge of the Purchaser and Synopsys, inSilicon does not, as a matter of course, make
public forecasts regarding its future operating performance, and Synopsys has been advised by inSilicon that the projections it received from inSilicon were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure. Synopsys did not rely on the projections
that it received from inSilicon when reaching its determination to make the Offer or in determining the Offer Price; but rather, during the course of its due diligence review of inSilicon, Synopsys prepared its own internal projections of
inSilicons operating performance as a wholly owned subsidiary of Synopsys following the Offer and the Merger. Synopsys based its internal projections, in part, on the following: (i) information that inSilicon provided to Synopsys; (ii)
publicly available information about inSilicon; (iii) Synopsys own beliefs regarding inSilicons future operating prospects in light of Synopsys view of the industry in which inSilicon operates, general business, economic, market
and financial conditions; and (iv) the potential synergies to be derived by incorporating inSilicons business into Synopsys operations. 

The projections that Synopsys received from inSilicon included, among other things, the following forecasts of the Companys revenues, gross profit, income from operations and net income for the
fourth quarter of inSilicons fiscal year 2002, and each of inSilicons fiscal years 2003 and 2004, respectively, which forecasts were dated as of June 24, 2002.

inSilicon prepared the projections described above on June 24, 2002
based on numerous assumptions, including assumptions concerning growth in revenues, product mix, channel mix, cost savings, industry performance and general business, economic, market and financial conditions during the periods covered by such
projections. inSilicon prepared the projections described above, based on the limited information available to inSilicon management at the time that such projections were prepared, for the sole purpose of providing Synopsys with inSilicons
view, as of that date, of its potential future operating performance. The projections described above do not (i) reflect recent developments that have occurred since inSilicon prepared them (including the fact that inSilicons results of
operations for the third quarter of its fiscal year 2002 fell short of its announced revenue and earnings targets for the same period), (ii) assume any reductions in revenue or other performance metrics as a result of the possible loss of support
from Phoenix Technologies, or (iii) give effect to the Offer and the Merger, the potential combined operations of inSilicon, Synopsys and its affiliates or changes that Synopsys may make to inSilicons operations or strategy after the
completion of the Offer and the Merger. The Purchaser and Synopsys have included the projections described above in this Offer to Purchase solely because such projections were provided to Synopsys in connection with its due diligence review of
inSilicon, and the inclusion of such projections in this Offer to Purchase is not intended to indicate that the Purchaser or Synopsys relied on them when determining whether to proceed with the Offer or the Merger or that they should be considered
material to any stockholders decision about whether to tender shares of inSilicon common stock in the Offer. 

Synopsys has been advised by inSilicon that inSilicon did not prepare the projections described above with a view to public disclosure or compliance with published guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding
projections or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants regarding the preparation and presentation of financial projections or forecasts. In addition, inSilicons independent accountants did not
examine or compile any of the projections described above, or express any conclusion or provide any assurance with respect to such projections. 

The projections described above constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results reflected in such projections, including, without limitation, those described in inSilicons most recently filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. At the time of receipt,
Synopsys was advised by inSilicon that the projections described above were subjective in many respects and thus susceptible to interpretations and periodic revision based on actual experience and business developments. The projections described
above also reflect numerous assumptions (not all of which were provided to Synopsys), all of which were made by inSilicons management, with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions,
competition and other matters that are inherently subject to significant uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond inSilicons control. Neither the Purchaser nor Synopsys approved the assumptions or the
methodology used to produce the projections. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the assumptions made in preparing the projections described above will prove accurate, and actual results may be materially lower than those contained in such
projections. 

The inclusion of the projections described above in this Offer to Purchase should not be
regarded as an indication that any of the Purchaser, Synopsys, inSilicon or their respective affiliates or representatives considered in the past or currently consider such projections to be a reliable prediction of future events,



and such projections should not be relied upon as such. None of the Purchaser, Synopsys, inSilicon or any of their respective affiliates or representatives has made or makes any representation to
any person regarding the information contained in the projections described above, and none of them intends to update or otherwise revise such projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date that inSilicon prepared such projections or
to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying such projections are shown to be in error.

Certain Information Concerning the Purchaser and Synopsys

The Purchaser is a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Synopsys. The Purchaser was organized by Synopsys to acquire inSilicon and has not conducted any unrelated activities since its organization. All outstanding shares of capital stock of the Purchaser are owned by Synopsys. The principal
office of the Purchaser is located at the same address as Synopsys principal office listed below, and its telephone number at that address is the same telephone number as Synopsys telephone number listed below. 

Synopsys is a Delaware corporation. The principal office of Synopsys is located at 700 East Middlefield Road, Mountain View, California
94043, and its telephone number at that address (650) 584-5000. 

The name, citizenship, business address, present
principal occupation or employment and five-year employment history of each of the directors and executive officers of the Purchaser and Synopsys are listed in Schedule I to this Offer to Purchase. 

During the last five years, none of the Purchaser, Synopsys or, to the best knowledge of the Purchaser and Synopsys, any of the persons
listed in Schedule I to this Offer to Purchase (i) has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or (ii) was a party to any judicial or administrative proceeding (except for matters that were
dismissed without sanction or settlement) that resulted in a judgment, decree or final order enjoining the person from future violations of, or prohibiting activities subject to, federal or state securities laws, or a finding of any violation of
such laws. 



Except as described in this Offer to Purchase, none of the Purchaser, Synopsys or, to the knowledge of the Purchaser and
Synopsys, any of the persons listed in Schedule I to this Offer to Purchase, or any associate or majority-owned subsidiary of Synopsys, the Purchaser or any of the persons listed in Schedule I to this Offer to Purchase, beneficially owns any equity
security of inSilicon, and none of the Purchaser, Synopsys or, to the knowledge of the Purchaser and Synopsys, any of the other persons or entities referred to above, or any of the respective directors, executive officers or subsidiaries of any of
the foregoing, has effected any transaction in any equity security of inSilicon during the past 60 days. 

Except
as described in this Offer to Purchase or the Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO filed by Synopsys with the Securities and Exchange Commission to which this Offer to Purchase is filed as an exhibit, (i) there have not been any contacts,
transactions or negotiations between the Purchaser or Synopsys, any of their respective subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the Purchaser and Synopsys, any of the persons listed in Schedule I to this Offer to Purchase, on the one hand, and
inSilicon or any of its directors, officers or affiliates, on the other hand, that are required to be disclosed pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and (ii) none of the Purchaser, Synopsys or, to the
knowledge of the Purchaser and Synopsys, any of the persons listed on Schedule I to this Offer to Purchase, has any contract, arrangement, understanding or relationship with any person with respect to any securities of inSilicon. 

The Purchaser believes that the financial condition of Synopsys and its affiliates is not material to a decision by a holder of
shares of inSilicon common stock whether to tender such shares in the Offer because (i) cash is the only consideration that will be paid to the holders of inSilicon common stock in connection with the Offer and the Merger, (ii) the Purchaser is
offering to purchase all of the outstanding shares of inSilicon common stock in the Offer, (iii) the Offer is not subject to any financing arrangements or other contingencies, and (iv) the amount of cash consideration payable to holders of inSilicon
common stock in the Offer and the Merger, taken together, is not material in relation to the financial capacity of Synopsys and its affiliates. 

10.

Source and Amount of Funds

The Offer is not conditioned on any financing arrangements or
contingencies. 

The total amount of funds required by the Purchaser to pay for all outstanding shares of inSilicon
common stock that are tendered in the Offer and cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash in the Merger, and to pay all fees and expenses related to the Offer and the Merger, is estimated to be approximately $70.2 million. The Purchaser
plans to obtain all funds needed for the Offer and the Merger through capital contributions or loans that will be made by Synopsys, either directly or through one or more wholly owned subsidiaries of Synopsys, to the Purchaser. Synopsys expects to
use its generally available corporate funds to make such contributions. 

11.

Contacts and Transactions with inSilicon; Background of the Offer 

In April 2001, Synopsys contacted Needham & Company, Inc. (Needham), Phoenix Technologies financial advisor, concerning the possibility of Synopsys acquiring inSilicon and/or Phoenix Technologies interest
in inSilicon. Synopsys signed nondisclosure agreements with Phoenix Technologies on April 30, 2001 and May 5, 2001 and received information about inSilicon. Synopsys submitted a written preliminary expression of interest to inSilicon. These contacts
and discussions did not ripen into a definitive agreement. 

In early January 2002, John Chilton, Senior Vice
President and General Manager of the Intellectual Property & Systems Group of Synopsys, had a brief discussion with Barry Hoberman, Chief Executive Officer of inSilicon, concerning strategic alternatives for inSilicon. This discussion did
not ripen into a definitive agreement either. 

On April 22, 2002, Robert B. Henske, Chief Financial Officer of
Synopsys, contacted Needham regarding the possibility of Synopsys acquiring inSilicon. On April 29, 2002, Synopsys submitted a non-binding written



proposal to purchase all of the outstanding shares of inSilicon common stock for cash, subject to completion of due diligence and negotiation of definitive agreements. On May 8, 2002, Synopsys
executed a nondisclosure agreement with Phoenix Technologies and inSilicon to permit Synopsys to begin its due diligence review of inSilicon. Following discussions with Phoenix Technologies and inSilicon, on May 16, 2002, Synopsys submitted a
revised non-binding written proposal for the possible acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of inSilicon common stock for cash, subject to additional due diligence review and negotiation of definitive agreements. 

Between May 22 and June 7, 2002, Synopsys and its advisors discussed the terms of Synopsys written proposal with Phoenix
Technologies, inSilicon, the special committee of the inSilicon Board of Directors and their respective advisors. 

On June 7, 2002, after further discussions with inSilicon and Phoenix Technologies, Synopsys submitted a revised non-binding written proposal for the possible acquisition of all outstanding shares of inSilicon common stock for cash,
subject to additional due diligence review and negotiation of definitive agreements. 

On June 7, 2002, the special
committee of the inSilicon Board of Directors met with its advisors to review the status of discussions with Synopsys regarding Synopsys latest proposal and to consider a request from Synopsys that Phoenix Technologies and inSilicon enter into
an exclusive negotiation agreement with Synopsys and a nondisclosure and nonsolicitation agreement allowing additional non-public information to be provided to Synopsys in connection with its evaluation of a possible transaction. Synopsys indicated
that execution of the two agreements was a condition to Synopsys conducting a full due diligence review of inSilicon and negotiating definitive transaction agreements. 

The inSilicon Board of Directors also met on June 7, 2002, after the meeting of the special committee of the inSilicon Board of Directors, and it authorized the execution
of the exclusive negotiation agreement and the nondisclosure and nonsolicitation agreement. These agreements were executed as of such date. 

From June 7 to July 21, 2002, inSilicon, Phoenix and their respective advisors and the advisors of the special committee of the inSilicon Board of Directors negotiated price and other terms exclusively
with Synopsys. In addition to the price to be paid per share of inSilicon common stock, inSilicon, representatives of the special committee of the inSilicon Board of Directors and Synopsys negotiated the terms of the definitive Merger Agreement,
including the circumstances under which Synopsys would be required to extend the term of the Offer and provide for a subsequent offering period, the conditions to the Offer, whether the Minimum Condition would be calculated on a fully-diluted basis,
the scope of the no-solicitation provision, the circumstances under which the inSilicon Board of Directors would be permitted to withdraw its recommendation in favor of the Offer and the Merger, the circumstances under which the Offer and the Merger
Agreement may be terminated, and the circumstances under which a termination fee would be payable if the Merger Agreement was terminated. During this period, Phoenix Technologies and Synopsys separately negotiated the terms upon which Phoenix
Technologies would provide transition services to inSilicon for a period of time after the completion of the Merger. 

By July 21, 2002, the proposed form of Merger Agreement, Tender and Voting Agreement with Phoenix Technologies and form of Tender and Voting Agreement with inSilicons directors and executive officers were in substantially final
form. On July 21, 2002, Synopsys Board of Directors approved these agreements and so advised the advisor to the special committee of the inSilicon Board of Directors, RBC Dain Rauscher, Inc., a member company of RBC Capital Markets
(RBC). Later on July 21, 2002, the special committee of the inSilicon Board of Directors met with its advisors to review the draft Merger Agreement and the forms of the Tender and Voting Agreements and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Offer, the Merger and the tenders called for by the Tender and Voting Agreements. At that meeting, RBC reviewed its financial analysis of the Offer Price and delivered its oral fairness opinion (later confirmed in writing) to
the effect that, as of such date and subject to the qualifications, assumptions and limitations stated in its written opinion, the Offer Price to be paid to tendering stockholders pursuant to the Offer and to be paid to holders of inSilicon common



stock in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of inSilicon common stock (other than Phoenix Technologies, as to which no opinion was requested or given).
The special committee of the inSilicon Board of Directors resolved unanimously to recommend to the inSilicon Board of Directors that it approve the definitive Merger Agreement and Tender and Voting Agreements. 

Following the July 21, 2002 meeting of the special committee of inSilicons Board of Directors, inSilicons Board of Directors
also met on July 21, 2002 and received a report from the special committee of the inSilicon Board of Directors regarding its recommendation. The inSilicon Board of Directors discussed the proposed transaction, the draft Merger Agreement and
draft Tender and Voting Agreements with the special committee of the inSilicon Board of Directors, RBC and legal counsel to inSilicon. RBC presented an overview of its analysis of the Offer Price that it had presented to the special committee of the
inSilicon Board of Directors in detail, repeated its oral fairness opinion given to the special committee of the inSilicon Board of Directors and orally advised that its written fairness opinion dated July 21, 2002 would be addressed to the full
inSilicon Board of Directors and the special committee of the inSilicon Board of Directors. Mr. Albert E. Sisto, Chairman of the inSilicon Board of Directors and President and Chief Executive Officer of Phoenix Technologies, recused himself from the
vote due to his relationship with Phoenix Technologies. The remaining members of the inSilicon Board of Directors, having determined that the Offer and the Merger were in the best interests of the stockholders of inSilicon (other than Phoenix
Technologies, with respect to which the inSilicon Board of Directors made no determination), then unanimously accepted the recommendation of the special committee of the inSilicon Board of Directors, approved the Merger Agreement, the Tender and
Voting Agreements and the transactions these agreements contemplated, and resolved to recommend that the stockholders of inSilicon (other than Phoenix Technologies, as to which the inSilicon Board of Directors makes no recommendation) accept the
Offer and tender their shares of inSilicon common stock in the Offer. 

On July 22 and July 23, 2002, the parties
and their advisors worked to finalize the transaction documents and on July 23, 2002, after the closing of normal trading on the Nasdaq National Market, where inSilicon common stock is traded, the Merger Agreement and Tender and Voting Agreements
were finalized and executed and that execution was announced in a joint press release by inSilicon and Synopsys. In addition, on July 23, 2002, a press release by Phoenix Technologies announced its execution of its Tender and Voting Agreement with
Synopsys.

Purpose of the Offer; Plans for inSilicon; The Merger Agreement; The Tender and Voting Agreements

Purpose of the Offer 

The purpose of the Offer and Merger is to enable Synopsys to acquire the entire equity interest in, and thus control of, inSilicon. The
Offer, as the first step in the acquisition of inSilicon, is intended to facilitate the acquisition of all the outstanding shares of inSilicon common stock or, if less, all shares of inSilicon common stock that are tendered in the Offer and not
properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date, subject to the conditions to the Offer described in section 13 (Certain Conditions of the Offer) of this Offer to Purchase. The purpose of the Merger is to acquire any and all
outstanding shares of inSilicon common stock that are not tendered in the Offer and purchased by the Purchaser pursuant to the Offer. 

Plans for inSilicon 

If the Minimum Condition and the other conditions to
the Offer described in section 13 (Certain Conditions of the Offer) of this Offer to Purchase have been satisfied and the Purchaser purchases all of the shares of inSilicon common stock that are tendered in the Offer, Synopsys intends
and will have the right to designate representatives to inSilicons Board of Directors who will constitute a majority of the Board of Directors and therefore control inSilicon. Following completion of the Offer and the Merger, Synopsys intends
to integrate inSilicons operations with those of Synopsys under the direction of Synopsys management. Synopsys principal reason for acquiring inSilicon is to expand its intellectual property product offerings. Synopsys intends to



continue to review inSilicon and its assets, corporate structure, dividend policy, capitalization, operations, properties, policies, management and personnel and, subject to the terms of the
Merger Agreement, to consider whether any changes would be desirable in light of the circumstances then existing, and reserves the right to take such actions or effect such changes as it deems desirable. 

The Merger Agreement 

The following is a summary of the Merger Agreement. The following summary does not purport to be a complete description of the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to the Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO that has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the Purchaser and Synopsys in connection with the
Offer, and is incorporated in this Offer to Purchase by reference. The Merger Agreement may be examined, and copies obtained, by following the procedures described in section 8 (Certain Information Concerning inSilicon) of this Offer to
Purchase. 

The Offer 

The Merger Agreement provides for the commencement of the Offer. The Purchasers obligation to accept for payment shares of inSilicon common stock that are tendered in
the Offer is subject to the satisfaction of each of the conditions of the Offer that are described in section 13 (Certain Conditions of the Offer) of this Offer to Purchase. The purchaser may not, without inSilicons prior written
consent, make any change to the terms and conditions of the Offer which (i) decreases the Offer Price, (ii) modifies the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer, (iii) reduces the number of shares of inSilicon common stock to be purchased
in the Offer, (iv) imposes new conditions to the Offer in addition to those described in section 13 of this Offer to Purchase, (v) amends the conditions to the Offer described in section 13 of this Offer to Purchase so as to broaden their scope,
(vi) extends the Offer except as provided for in the Merger Agreement and described below, (vii) amends or waives the Minimum Condition, or (viii) are adverse to the holders of shares of inSilicon common stock in the reasonable and good faith
judgment of inSilicon. 

The Merger Agreement provides that the Purchaser must extend the Offer (i) for any period
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission or its staff, or of the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., that is applicable to the Offer and (ii) if any of the conditions to the Offer described in
section 13 (Certain Conditions of the Offer) of this Offer to Purchase are not satisfied or waived as of any then scheduled expiration date of the Offer, for successive periods of up to 10 business days each until such time as either all
of the conditions to the Offer are satisfied or waived or the Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to its terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of the Merger Agreement, in no event is the Purchaser required to extend the Offer beyond
September 21, 2002, unless any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, has not expired or been terminated by that date, in which event the Purchaser is required to extend the Offer if so
requested by inSilicon (or we can elect to do so even if not so requested by inSilicon), but in no event is the Purchaser required to extend the Offer beyond December 21, 2002. In addition, the foregoing provisions in no way impair, limit or
otherwise restrict in any manner Synopsys right to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms. 

The Purchaser may (but is not required to) provide for a subsequent offering period (within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act) of not less than three nor more than 20 business days immediately following the expiration
of the Offer. In the event that more than 85% (but less than 90%) of the then outstanding shares of inSilicon common stock are validly tendered and not properly withdrawn in the Offer prior to the Expiration Date, the Purchaser must provide for a
subsequent offering period of 10 business days immediately following the Expiration Date. 

The Merger Agreement
further provides that the Purchaser will, on the terms and subject to the conditions to the Offer, accept for payment, and pay for, all the shares of inSilicon common stock that are validly tendered and



not properly withdrawn in the offer as promptly as practicable after the Expiration Date. If the Purchaser provides for a subsequent offering period, subject to the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement, the Merger Agreement also provides that the Purchaser will accept for payment, and pay for, all shares of inSilicon common stock that are validly tendered during the subsequent offering period as promptly as practicable after such
shares are tendered. 

Appointment of Directors After Acceptance of Shares Tendered in the Offer

The Merger Agreement provides that, effective upon the Purchasers initial acceptance for payment of
shares of inSilicon common stock that are tendered in the Offer (the Appointment Time) and subject to compliance with section 14(f) of the Exchange Act, Synopsys will be entitled to designate up to such number of directors on the Board
of Directors of inSilicon, rounded up to the next whole number, equal to the product of the total number of directors on the inSilicon Board of Directors multiplied by the a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of inSilicon
common stock held by Synopsys and the Purchaser, and the denominator of which is the total number of then outstanding shares of inSilicon common stock. 

The Merger Agreement further provides that promptly following a request by Synopsys, inSilicon must take all action necessary to cause the individuals designated by Synopsys to be elected or appointed
to the inSilicon Board of Directors, including, if necessary, either increasing the size of the inSilicon Board of Directors or securing the resignations of then incumbent directors. Furthermore, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement,
inSilicon must take all action necessary to cause the individuals so designated by Synopsys to constitute substantially the same percentage (rounding up where appropriate) as is on the inSilicon Board of Directors on (i) each committee of the
inSilicon Board of Directors (other than the special committee of the inSilicon Board of Directors), (ii) each board of directors of each subsidiary of inSilicon, and (iii) each committee of each such board of directors of each subsidiary of
inSilicon. At all times until the effective time of the Merger, the members of the special committee of the Board of Directors of inSilicon will remain members of the inSilicon Board of Directors. If either or both of such directors resigns from the
inSilicon board of directors, they will be replaced by persons who are not officers, employees or affiliates of Synopsys, the Purchaser or inSilicon. We sometimes refer to these directors as the Independent Directors in this Offer to
Purchase. 

Notwithstanding anything in the Merger Agreement to the contrary, subsequent to the election or
appointment of the directors designated by Synopsys to the inSilicon Board of Directors and prior to the effective time of the Merger, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the approval of a majority of the Independent Directors will be required
to (i) amend or terminate the Merger Agreement on behalf of inSilicon, (ii) extend or waive the time for performance of, or waive any of the obligations of Synopsys or the Purchaser under the Merger Agreement, (iii) waive any of inSilicons
rights under the Merger Agreement, or (iv) make any other determination with respect to inSilicons actions taken or not to be taken related to the Merger Agreement. 

The Merger
.    The Merger Agreement provides that, following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the Merger described below under the
caption Conditions to the Merger, the Purchaser will be merged with and into inSilicon in accordance the applicable provision of Delaware law, inSilicon will continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger and the separate corporate
existence of the Purchaser will cease. 

Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation
.    The Merger Agreement provides that at the effective time of the Merger, the certificate of incorporation of inSilicon shall be amended and restated to read identically to the certificate of incorporation of
the Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, except for the name of the surviving corporation will be inSilicon Corporation. The bylaws of the Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the
effective time of the Merger, will become the bylaws of inSilicon at the effective time of the Merger. 

Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.
    Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, the initial directors and officers of inSilicon will be the directors
and officers of the Purchaser immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger. 



Conversion of Shares of inSilicon Common
Stock
.    Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each share of inSilicon common stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than shares owned by Synopsys, the Purchaser or
inSilicon, or by a subsidiary of Synopsys, the Purchaser or inSilicon, or by those stockholders, if any, who properly exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive the price per share paid pursuant to the
Offer in cash, without interest thereon (the Merger Consideration). 

Appraisal
Rights.
    The Merger Agreement provides that shares of inSilicon common stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger which are held by persons who have neither voted in favor of the Merger
nor consented thereto in writing and who have properly and validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such shares in accordance with section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the DGCL)
will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Instead, these stockholders will be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of their shares of inSilicon common stock in accordance with section 262 of the DGCL. Shares
of inSilicon common stock held by stockholders who fail to perfect, or otherwise withdraw or lose their rights to appraisal under section 262 of the DGCL, however, will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

Treatment of inSilicon Options and Purchase Rights under inSilicon ESPP 

The Merger Agreement provides that each option to purchase inSilicon common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time of the Merger under inSilicons 1999 Stock Option Plan and inSilicons 2000 Stock Plan, each as amended, or any other stock option plan or agreement of inSilicon, whether or not then vested, with an exercise price per share that is
less than or equal to the Merger Consideration (In-the-Money Options) must be assumed by Synopsys. Each In-the-Money Option so assumed by Synopsys will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions of such
In-the-Money Option immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (including any repurchase rights or vesting provisions), except that (i) each In-the-Money Option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms)
for that number of whole shares of Synopsys common stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of inSilicon common stock that were issuable upon exercise of such In-the-Money Option immediately prior to the
effective time of the Merger (not taking into account any restrictions on exercise or vesting), and (y) the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the Merger Consideration by (2) the average of the closing prices of one share of Synopsys common stock, as
quoted on the Nasdaq National Market for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the closing date of the Merger (the Exchange Ratio), rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Synopsys common stock, and (ii)
the per share exercise price for the shares of Synopsys common stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed In-the-Money Option (not taking into account any restrictions on exercise or vesting) will be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x)
the exercise price per share of such In-the-Money Option immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger and (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The Merger Agreement also provides that, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the effective time of the Merger (and in no event more than 15 business days thereafter), Synopsys must file, if available for use by Synopsys, a registration statement on Form S-8 to register the shares of Synopsys common stock
issuable upon the exercise of all inSilicon options that are assumed by Synopsys in connection with the Merger. 

Synopsys is not assuming any outstanding inSilicon option, whether or not vested, with an exercise price per share that is greater than the Merger Consideration. The Merger Agreement provides that each outstanding inSilicon option,
whether or not then vested, with an exercise price per share that is greater than the Merger Consideration will be made fully vested and exercisable. If the holders of those inSilicon options decide not to exercise them prior to the effective time
of the Merger, then their inSilicon options will terminate at the effective time of the Merger without the right to receive any additional consideration. 

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, inSilicon must amend the inSilicon 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the inSilicon ESPP), as necessary, to provide that prior to the effective time
of the Merger,



outstanding purchase rights under inSilicon ESPP will be exercised in accordance with the terms of inSilicon ESPP and each share of inSilicon common stock that is purchased pursuant to such
exercise will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the effective time of the Merger. inSilicon will terminate the inSilicon ESPP immediately after such purchases of shares of inSilicon common stock are complete.

Non-Solicitation Provisions 

The Merger Agreement provides that inSilicon and its subsidiaries must immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with respect to any offer or proposal (other than
an offer or proposal from the Purchaser or Synopsys) (an Acquisition Proposal) relating to any transaction or series of related transactions involving any of the following (each, an Acquisition Transaction): 



any acquisition or purchase from inSilicon by any person or group of more than a 15% interest in the total outstanding voting securities of inSilicon or any of
its subsidiaries, or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person or group beneficially owning 15% or more of the total outstanding voting securities of inSilicon or any of its subsidiaries, or any merger,
consolidation, business combination or similar transaction involving inSilicon pursuant to which the stockholders of inSilicon immediately preceding such transaction hold less than 85% of the equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of
such transaction; 



any sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of business), exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of business), acquisition or
disposition of more than 15% of the assets of inSilicon (measured by the book value thereof); or 



any liquidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other significant corporate reorganization of inSilicon. 

The Merger Agreement further provides that from the date of the Merger Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of the
Merger Agreement and the Appointment Time, inSilicon and its subsidiaries may not, nor may they authorize or permit any of their respective officers, directors, controlled affiliates or employees or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor
or representative retained by any of them to, directly or indirectly: 



solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage, or induce the making, submission or announcement of, an Acquisition Proposal; 



furnish to any person (other than Synopsys, the purchaser or any designees of Synopsys or the purchaser) any non-public information relating to inSilicon or any
of its subsidiaries, or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of inSilicon or any of its subsidiaries to any person that has made an Acquisition Proposal, or take any other action intended to assist or facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; 





engage in discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; 



approve, endorse or recommend an Acquisition Proposal; or 



enter into any letter of intent or similar contract contemplating or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Transaction. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Appointment Time, the Board of Directors of inSilicon and/or the special committee
of the inSilicon Board of Directors may, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other intermediaries, subject to inSilicons compliance with the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement described in this Offer to
Purchase: 



engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with any person that has made (and not withdrawn) a 
bona fide
, unsolicited Acquisition Proposal in
writing that the Board of Directors of inSilicon reasonably concludes in good faith (based upon a recommendation of the special committee of the inSilicon Board of Directors following consultation by the special committee of the inSilicon Board of
Directors with its financial advisor) constitutes an Acquisition Proposal involving the acquisition of all of the outstanding voting securities of inSilicon (1) which, if any cash consideration is involved, is not subject to any financing
contingencies, and (2) with respect to which the Board of Directors of inSilicon shall have reasonably determined in good faith (based upon a recommendation of the special committee of the inSilicon Board of Directors following consultation by the
special committees with its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel, and after taking into account, among other things, the financial, legal and regulatory aspects of such Acquisition Transaction) that (x) the acquiring party is capable of
consummating the proposed Acquisition Transaction on the terms proposed, and (y) that the proposed Acquisition Transaction would, if consummated in accordance with its terms, be more favorable to the holders of shares of inSilicon common stock, from
a financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger (which we sometimes refer to as a Superior Proposal in this Offer to Purchase); and/or 



furnish to any person that has made (and not withdrawn) a 
bona fide
, unsolicited Acquisition Proposal in writing any non-public information relating to
inSilicon or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement the terms of which, in the aggregate, are no less favorable to inSilicon than those contained in the confidentiality agreement in place among inSilicon, Synopsys and
Phoenix Technologies; 

provided that in the case of any action taken pursuant to the provisions described in the two
preceding bullet points, (1) none of inSilicon, any of its subsidiaries or any representatives of inSilicon or its subsidiaries has violated any of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement in connection with the Acquisition Proposal,
(2) the inSilicon Board of Directors reasonably concludes in good faith (based upon a recommendation of the special committee of the inSilicon Board of Directors following consultation by the special committee of the inSilicon Board of Directors
with its outside legal counsel) that such action is required in order for the inSilicon Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties to inSilicon stockholders under Delaware law, (3) at least two business days prior to engaging or
participating in any such discussions or negotiations with, or furnishing non-public information to, such person, inSilicon gives Synopsys written notice of the identity of such person and all of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal (unless such Acquisition Proposal is in written form, in which case inSilicon must give Synopsys a copy of it) and of inSilicons intention to engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish non-public information
to, such person, and (4) contemporaneously with furnishing any non-public information to such person, inSilicon furnishes such non-public information to Synopsys. 

The Merger Agreement also provides that inSilicon must, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours), advise Synopsys orally and in writing of any
Acquisition Proposal, or any request or inquiry which inSilicon reasonably believes could lead to an Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity of the person or group
making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, inSilicon must also keep



Synopsys informed of the status and material terms and conditions (including all amendments or proposed amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. In addition to the
foregoing, inSilicon must provide Synopsys with at least two business days prior written notice of a meeting of the Board of Directors of inSilicon at which the inSilicon Board of Directors is reasonably expected to recommend (based upon a
recommendation of the special committee of the inSilicon Board of Directors or otherwise) a Superior Proposal to the stockholders of inSilicon, and together with such notice a copy of the definitive documentation relating to such Superior Proposal.

The Merger Agreement provides that any violation of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement by
any director, officer or employee of inSilicon or any of its subsidiaries, or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative of inSilicon or any of its subsidiaries will be deemed to be a breach of the Merger Agreement by
inSilicon. 

Company Stockholders Meeting

If approval of the stockholders of inSilicon is required under the DGCL in order to complete the Merger, the Merger Agreement provides that inSilicon must establish a
record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the stockholders of inSilicon as promptly as practicable following the Appointment Time for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of the Merger Agreement in accordance with the
DGCL. Unless the inSilicon Board of Directors has withheld, withdrawn, amended or modified its recommendation in accordance with the Merger Agreement, under the terms of the Merger Agreement inSilicon must use all commercially reasonable efforts to
solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement in accordance with the DGCL, and must take all other commercially reasonable action necessary or advisable to secure the required stockholder vote at
inSilicons stockholders meeting. Unless the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, under the terms of the Merger Agreement inSilicon must establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting
of stockholders for the purpose of voting on the adoption of the Merger Agreement in accordance with Delaware law whether or not the inSilicon Board of Directors at any time determines that the Merger Agreement is no longer advisable or recommends
that inSilicon stockholders reject it. In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that inSilicons obligation to establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of
the Merger Agreement described above is not limited to, or otherwise affected by, the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to inSilicon of any Acquisition Proposal. 

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each of the Purchaser and Synopsys must vote all of their shares of inSilicon common stock acquired pursuant to the Offer (or
otherwise beneficially owned by it or any of its respective subsidiaries as of the applicable record date) in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement in accordance with Delaware law at any meeting of the stockholders of inSilicon at which the
Merger is considered and voted on. In addition, Synopsys has agreed under the terms of the Merger Agreement to vote all of its shares of the Purchasers common stock in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement in accordance with Delaware
law. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of the Merger Agreement, in the event that Synopsys, the Purchaser
or any subsidiary of Synopsys, acquire at least 90% of the outstanding shares of inSilicon common stock pursuant to the Offer or otherwise, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each of Synopsys, the Purchaser and inSilicon must take all
necessary action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after such acquisition, without a meeting of the stockholders of inSilicon, in accordance with section 253 of the DGCL. 

Proxy Statement; Recommendation of the inSilicon Board of Directors

The Merger Agreement provides that if the approval of inSilicons stockholders is required by the DGCL in order to complete the Merger, inSilicon and Synopsys must
jointly prepare, and inSilicon must file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a proxy statement for use in connection with the solicitation of proxies



from inSilicons stockholders in connection with the Merger. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, subject to the right of inSilicons Board of Directors to withhold, withdrawal,
amend or modify its recommendation as described below, the proxy statement must contain a recommendation of the Board of Directors of inSilicon that inSilicon stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with the applicable provisions of
Delaware law. The Merger Agreement further provides that the Board of Directors of inSilicon may: 



based upon a recommendation from the special committee of the inSilicon Board of Directors, withhold, withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation that the
stockholders of inSilicon accept the Offer and tender their shares of inSilicon common stock in the Offer, and that such stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with Delaware law, if (i) neither inSilicon nor any of its representatives
has violated any of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement, and (ii) the Board of Directors of inSilicon concludes in good faith (based on a recommendation of the special committee of the inSilicon Board of Directors following
consultation by the special committee with its outside legal counsel) that the withholding, withdrawal, amendment or modification of such recommendation is required in order for the Board of Directors of inSilicon to comply with its fiduciary duties
to inSilicons stockholders under Delaware law; or 



approve or recommend that the holders of shares of inSilicon common stock approve an Acquisition Proposal that is not withdrawn, if (i) such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (ii) neither inSilicon nor any of its representatives has violated any of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement, and (iii) the Board of Directors of inSilicon concludes in good faith (based
on a recommendation of the special committee of the inSilicon Board of Directors following consultation by the special committee with its outside legal counsel) that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the approval or recommendation of such
Acquisition Transaction is required in order for the Board of Directors of inSilicon to comply with its fiduciary duties to inSilicons stockholders under Delaware law; 
provided, however
, that prior to taking any action related to
changing its recommendation or approval or recommending an Acquisition Proposal, the inSilicon Board of Directors must have given Synopsys at least two business days notice of such change, approval or recommendation and the opportunity to meet with
the Board of Directors of inSilicon, the special committee of the inSilicon Board of Directors and their respective outside legal counsel. 

Nothing in the Merger Agreement, however, prohibits the Board of Directors of inSilicon (based upon a recommendation of the special committee of the inSilicon Board of Directors) from: 



taking and disclosing to inSilicons stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act; 



complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; and 



making any other disclosure required by applicable law; 

provided that, in each case, any statement(s) made by the inSilicon Board of Directors (based upon a recommendation of the special committee of the inSilicon Board of Directors or otherwise) pursuant
to Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act is subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. 

Commercially Reasonable Efforts.    
The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, inSilicon, the Purchaser and Synopsys must each use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all reasonable actions and to do or cause to be done and assist the other parties to do all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to complete and make effective as promptly as
practicable the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger), including obtaining all consents from governmental authorities required for the completion of the Offer and the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the Merger Agreement will be deemed to require Synopsys or inSilicon or any subsidiary or affiliate of Synopsys or inSilicon to agree to any divestiture by
itself or any of its affiliates of shares of capital stock or of any business, 



assets or property, or the imposition of any limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their business or to own or exercise control of such assets, properties and stock.

Employee Benefit Matters.    
The Merger Agreement provides that inSilicon must
terminate, effective as of the day immediately preceding the date inSilicon becomes a member of the same Controlled Group of Corporations (as defined in section 414(b) of the IRC) of Synopsys, any and all 401(k) plans maintained by inSilicon or any
of its subsidiaries unless Synopsys provides notice to inSilicon that any such 401(k) plan(s) should not be terminated. The Merger Agreement further provides that, from and after the effective time of the Merger, Synopsys must take commercially
reasonable actions to allow employees of inSilicon who continue their employment with inSilicon or who become employees of Synopsys or any subsidiary of Synopsys to participate in the benefit programs of Synopsys to the same extent as similarly
situated employees of Synopsys as soon as practicable after the effective time of the Merger and, to the extent permitted under applicable law, each such employee will be given credit for service with inSilicon or its subsidiaries under all employee
benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained by Synopsys or the surviving corporation of the Merger, subject to certain limitations, including circumstances that would result in duplicative benefits. The Merger Agreement also
provides that inSilicon must terminate any and all group severance, separation, deferred compensation or salary continuation plans, programs or arrangements maintained by inSilicon or any of its Subsidiaries, effective in each case as of the day
immediately preceding the last day of the Offer (not including any subsequent offer period provided by Synopsys pursuant to Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act). 

Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance 

The Merger Agreement provides that, from and after the effective time of the Merger, Synopsys and the surviving corporation of the Merger must fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of
inSilicon under any indemnification contracts in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger between inSilicon and its current and former directors and officers, and any indemnification provisions set forth in inSilicons
charter documents as in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving
corporation must contain provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification of directors and officers that are at least as favorable to the current and former directors and officers of inSilicon as those contained in inSilicons charter
documents as in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement. 

In addition, under the terms of the Merger Agreement,
for a period of six years following the effective time of the Merger, Synopsys must cause the surviving corporation of the Merger to maintain in effect, if available, directors and officers liability insurance covering those persons who
are covered by inSilicons directors and officers liability insurance policy as of the date of the Merger Agreement or as of the effective time of the Merger (Covered persons) in an amount and on terms no less favorable,
when taken as a whole, to those applicable to the directors and officers of inSilicon as of the date of the Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, in no event will Synopsys or the surviving
corporation of the Merger be required to expend an annual premium for such coverage in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by inSilicon under its directors and officers liability insurance policy in effect as of the date
of the Merger Agreement, and if the cost for such coverage is in excess of such amount, the surviving corporation of the Merger will only be required to maintain such coverage as is available for such amount. 

Conditions to the Merger.    
The Merger Agreement provides that the respective obligations of each party to
effect the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, consisting of the following: 



if required by the DGCL (i.e. if, following completion of the Offer the Purchaser owns less than 90% of the then outstanding shares of inSilicon common stock),
the Merger must have been approved by the stockholders of inSilicon in accordance with the DGCL and inSilicons charter documents; 



the purchaser or Synopsys must have accepted for payment, and paid for, all of the shares of inSilicon common stock that were validly tendered in the Offer and
not properly withdrawn; and 





no court or other governmental entity of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any statute, rule, regulation,
judgment, decree, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) which is in effect and prohibits consummation of the Merger. 

Termination of the Merger Agreement 

The Merger Agreement may be terminated, and the offer may be abandoned, at any time prior to the Appointment Time: 



by mutual written consent of Synopsys and inSilicon; 



by either Synopsys or inSilicon, if the Offer expires or is terminated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement without the Purchaser (or Synopsys

by inSilicon, in the event (i) of a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of the Purchaser and Synopsys contained in the Merger Agreement, or (ii)

the time of such breach or as of the time such representation and warranty became inaccurate; 
provided, however
, that notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that such breach by inSilicon or such inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of inSilicon are curable by inSilicon through the exercise of its commercially reasonable efforts, then Synopsys will not be permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to the provision of the Merger Agreement described in this

The Merger Agreement
provides that all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger)



will be paid by the party or parties, as applicable, incurring such expenses, whether or not the Offer and the Merger are completed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, under the terms of the
Merger Agreement Synopsys and inSilicon will share equally: 



all fees and expenses (other than attorneys and accountants fees and expenses) incurred in connection with the printing, filing and mailing of all
documents related to the Offer, the proxy statement to be used for the Merger, if required, and any amendments or supplements thereto; and 



any filing fees required to be paid under the HSR Act or any foreign antitrust or competitionrelated filings required to be made in connection with the
transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger). 

In the
event that the Merger Agreement is terminated by Synopsys because a Triggering Event has occurred, the Merger Agreement provides that inSilicon must pay to Synopsys a fee equal to $2,460,000 (Termination Fee Amount) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Synopsys. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, inSilicon must also pay to Synopsys a fee equal to the Termination Fee Amount within one business day after demand by
Synopsys, in the event that: 



(i) the Merger Agreement is terminated by Synopsys or inSilicon because the Offer expires or is terminated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement
without the Purchaser (or Synopsys on the Purchasers behalf) having accepted for payment any shares of inSilicon common stock pursuant to the Offer on or before the Initial Termination Date or the Extended Termination Date, as applicable, or
(ii) the Merger Agreement is terminated by Synopsys because (1) of a material breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of inSilicon contained in the Merger Agreement, or (2) any representation or warranty of inSilicon contained in the Merger
Agreement becomes inaccurate such that the conditions to the offer related to inSilicons representations and warranties and obligations contained in the Merger Agreement would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time
such representation and warranty became inaccurate; 



following the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and prior to the termination of the Merger Agreement (in the case of any termination referred to in
clause (i) of the preceding bullet point) or prior to the breach or inaccuracy that forms the basis for the termination of the Merger Agreement (in the case of any termination referred to in clause (ii) of the preceding bullet point), an Acquisition
Proposal is publicly announced or becomes publicly known, and is not withdrawn; and 



within nine months following the termination of the Merger Agreement (in the case of any termination referred to in clause (i) of the first bullet point above)
or within six months following the termination of the Merger Agreement (in the case of any termination referred to in clause (ii) of the first bullet point above), either a transaction underlying an Acquisition Proposal is consummated or inSilicon
enters into a letter of intent or contract providing for such a transaction and such transaction is later consummated. 

Procedure for Amendment, Extension, or Waiver 

Subject to applicable law and
subject to the other provisions of the Merger Agreement, the Merger Agreement may be amended by the parties at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Synopsys, the Purchaser and inSilicon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, however, in the event that the Merger Agreement has been adopted by the stockholders of inSilicon in accordance with the DGCL, no amendment may be made to the Merger Agreement that requires the approval of such stockholders without such
approval. 

Prior to the effective time of the Merger, any party to the Merger Agreement may, to the extent legally
allowed and except as otherwise set forth in the Merger Agreement, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party or parties to the Merger Agreement, as applicable, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties made to such party or parties contained in the Merger Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant the Merger Agreement, and (iii) waive compliance with any of



the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party or parties contained the Merger Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party or parties to the Merger Agreement to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party or parties, as applicable. Any delay in exercising any right under the Merger Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right. 

Definition of Material Adverse Effect.    
The Merger Agreement provides that a Material
Adverse Effect means, with respect to any person, any change or effect that, individually or when taken together with all other such changes or effects that have occurred prior to the date of determination of the occurrence of the Material
Adverse Effect, is or is reasonably likely to be materially adverse to the business, assets (including intangible assets), financial condition or results of operations of such person and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; 
provided, however
,
that none of the following changes or effects, by itself or when aggregated with any one or more of the other such changes or effects, will be deemed to constitute a Material Adverse Effect and none of the following changes or effects, by itself or
when aggregated with any one or more of the other such changes or effects, will be taken into account when determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred or may occur: (i) any change or effect resulting from changes or developments in
general economic conditions, provided that any such changes or developments do not disproportionately affect such person; (ii) any change or effect resulting from conditions or developments affecting the semiconductor intellectual property industry
as a whole, provided that any such changes or developments do not disproportionately affect such person; or (iii) any change or effect (including, solely for illustrative purposes, delays or cancellations in customer orders, a reduction in sales,
disruptions in supplier, distributor or similar relationships, or a loss of employees) if and solely to the extent that such change or effect results from the announcement or pendency of the Merger Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 

The Tender and Voting Agreements

The following is a summary of the Tender and Voting Agreements entered into by Synopsys and Phoenix
Technologies, and Synopsys and each of inSilicons directors and executive officers (whom we sometimes refer to as the Principal inSilicon Stockholders in this Offer to Purchase). The following summary does not purport to be a
complete description of the terms and conditions of the Tender and Voting Agreements and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Tender and Voting Agreements, copies of which are filed as exhibits to the Tender Offer Statement on Schedule
TO that has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the Purchaser and Synopsys in connection with the Offer, and which are incorporated in this Offer to Purchase by reference. 

As a condition and inducement to Synopsys and the Purchaser to enter into the Merger Agreement, each of Phoenix Technologies, which owns 10,450,010 shares of inSilicon
common stock, and each of the other Principal inSilicon Stockholders, who collectively own an aggregate of 468,253 shares of inSilicon common stock (including 459,339 shares of inSilicon common stock subject to inSilicon options exercisable within
60 days of July 23, 2002), representing approximately 69.7% of inSilicons outstanding shares of common stock on July 19, 2002 (including the 459,339 shares of inSilicon common stock subject to inSilicon options), entered into the Tender and
Voting Agreements with Synopsys concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement. 

Under the
terms of the Tender and Voting Agreements, each Principal inSilicon Stockholder agreed that he or it will not (i) sell, pledge, encumber, assign, grant an option with respect to, transfer or dispose of any or all of his or its shares of inSilicon
common stock, or enter into an agreement or commitment to provide for any of the foregoing, or (ii) deposit any of his or its shares of inSilicon common stock into a voting trust or grant any proxy or enter into any voting agreement or similar
agreement in contravention of the obligations of such principal inSilicon stockholder under his or its tender and voting agreement with Synopsys. 

The terms of the Tender and Voting Agreements also provide that each Principal inSilicon Stockholder must tender (and will not withdraw), pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Offer, the
shares of inSilicon common stock held by such Principal inSilicon Stockholder. 



In addition, under the terms of the Tender and Voting Agreements, each of the
Principal inSilicon Stockholders agreed to vote, and has granted Synopsys an irrevocable proxy to vote, his or its shares of inSilicon common stock as follows: 



in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, and in favor of each of the other actions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; 



against approval of any proposal made in opposition to, or in competition with, consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement; and 



against any of the following actions (other than those actions that relate to the Offer, the Merger and any other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement): 



any merger, consolidation, business combination, sale of assets, reorganization or recapitalization of inSilicon or any subsidiary of inSilicon with any party;



any sale, lease or transfer of any significant part of the assets of inSilicon or any subsidiary of inSilicon; 



any reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of inSilicon or any subsidiary of inSilicon; 



any material change in the capitalization of inSilicon or any subsidiary of inSilicon, or the corporate structure of inSilicon or any subsidiary of inSilicon;
or 



any other action that is intended, or could reasonably be expected to, impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or adversely affect the Offer, the
Merger or any other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 

Phoenix Technologies
also agreed pursuant to its Tender and Voting Agreement with Synopsys that, in its capacity as a stockholder of inSilicon, it will not, and it will not authorize or permit any of its officers, directors, controlled affiliates or employees, or any
investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative retained by Phoenix Technologies to, directly or indirectly: 



solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage, or induce the making, submission or announcement of, an Acquisition Proposal; 



furnish to any person (other than Synopsys, the Purchaser or any designees of Synopsys or the Purchaser) any non-public information relating to inSilicon or any
of its subsidiaries, or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of Phoenix Technologies relating to inSilicon or any of inSilicons subsidiaries to any person that has made an Acquisition Proposal, or take any other
action intended to assist or facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; 



engage in discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; 



approve, endorse or recommend an acquisition proposal; or 



enter into any letter of intent or similar contract contemplating or otherwise relating to an acquisition transaction. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, under the terms of Phoenix Technologies Tender and Voting Agreement with
Synopsys, Phoenix Technologies may engage in any of the foregoing activities if and solely to the extent that inSilicon is permitted to engage in such activities pursuant to the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement. 

In addition, under the terms of the Tender and Voting Agreement between Phoenix Technologies and Synopsys, Phoenix Technologies
must immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions or



negotiations with any persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. In addition, Phoenix Technologies must, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours),
advise Synopsys orally and in writing of any request for information that Phoenix Technologies reasonably believes could lead to an Acquisition Proposal or of any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to or which Phoenix Technologies
reasonably believes could lead to any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request, acquisition proposal or inquiry, and the identity of the person or group making any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. Phoenix
Technologies also must keep Synopsys informed of the status and material terms and conditions (including all amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. 

The Tender and Voting Agreements terminate in accordance with their terms on the earlier to occur of: 



the date the Merger Agreement is terminated; 



the effective time of the Merger; or 



such date and time as any amendment or change to the Merger Agreement is effected without the consent of the Principal inSilicon Stockholder that is a party to
such agreement which (i) decreases the Offer Price, (ii) extends the termination date of the Merger Agreement (other than an extension of the termination date under the Merger Agreement because the expiration or termination of applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act has not occurred), or (iii) materially adversely affects Phoenix Technologies (in the case of the Tender and Voting Agreement between Phoenix Technologies and Synopsys), or adversely affects the Principal inSilicon
Stockholder that is a party to such agreement in a manner that is not approved by inSilicon in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement (in the case of the Tender and Voting Agreements between the directors and executive officers of
inSilicon and Synopsys). 

13.

Certain Conditions of the Offer

The Merger Agreement provides that, notwithstanding any other
provision of the Offer, and in addition to the Purchasers right to extend and amend the Offer at any time in its sole discretion (subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement), the Purchaser is not required to accept for payment

promptly after termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for, and may delay the acceptance for payment of, or, subject to the restriction referred to above, the payment for, any shares of inSilicon common stock that are tendered in the Offer if

(ii) challenging the acquisition by the Purchaser (or Synopsys on the Purchasers behalf) of any shares of inSilicon common stock pursuant to the Offer, seeking to restrain or prohibit the

Synopsys, the Purchaser or inSilicon any damages that are material in relation to inSilicon and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (iii) seeking to impose material limitations on the ability of the Purchaser (or Synopsys on the Purchasers

material limitations on the ability of Synopsys or the Purchaser effectively to exercise full rights of ownership of shares of inSilicon common stock, including the right to vote the shares of inSilicon common stock purchased by it on all matters

there shall be any statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order or injunction enacted, entered, enforced, promulgated, or deemed applicable, pursuant to an
authoritative interpretation by or on behalf of a government entity, to the Offer or the Merger, or any other action shall be taken by any governmental entity, other than the application to the Offer or the Merger of applicable waiting periods under

(i) any general suspension of trading in, or limitation on prices for, securities on the New York Stock Exchange or in the Nasdaq Stock Market, for a period in

any Material Adverse Effect in respect of inSilicon occurring after the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement (whether or not events or circumstances
occurring prior to the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement contributed to the occurrence of such Material Adverse Effect); 



(i) the inSilicon Board of Directors has for any reason withheld or withdrawn, or has for any reason amended or modified in a manner adverse to Synopsys, the

non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement) accepting any Acquisition Proposal; or (vi) an Acquisition Proposal has been made and not withdrawn by a person unaffiliated with Synopsys, and within 10 business days after notice of such
Acquisition Proposal is first published, sent or given to inSilicons stockholders, inSilicon has not sent to its stockholders pursuant to Rule 14e-2 under the



Exchange Act a statement reaffirming the inSilicon Recommendations and recommending that inSilicon stockholders reject such Acquisition Proposal; 



any of the representations and warranties of inSilicon set forth in the Merger Agreement (i) will not have been true and correct in all respects as of the date
of the Merger Agreement, and (ii) will not be true and correct in all respects on and as of the Expiration Date with the same force and effect as if made on and as of such date, except, in the case of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), (a) for any
failure to be so true and correct as has not had and would not reasonably be expected have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on inSilicon; 
provided, however
, that such Material Adverse Effect qualifier will be
inapplicable with respect to certain special representation identified in the Merger Agreement, each of which individually will have been true and correct in all material respects as of the date of the Merger Agreement and will be true and correct
in all material respects on and as of the Expiration Date, (b) for changes contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and (c) for those representations and warranties which address matters only as of a particular date (which representations will have
been true and correct (subject to the Material Adverse Effect and materiality qualifications and limitations set forth in the preceding clause (a)) as of such particular date); and 
provided further
 that, for purposes of determining the
accuracy of the representations and warranties of inSilicon set forth in the Merger Agreement for purposes of this bullet point, (1) all Material Adverse Effect and materiality qualifications and other qualifications based on the word
material or similar phrases contained in such representations and warranties (other than the representations and warranties set forth in a section specified in the Merger Agreement) will be disregarded (it being understood and hereby
agreed that (x) the phrase similar phrases as used in this proviso will not be deemed to include any dollar thresholds contained in any such representations and warranties, and (y) the representation and warranty set forth in section
specified in the Merger Agreement will not be disregarded pursuant to the terms of this proviso), and (2) any update of or modification to the inSilicon disclosure schedule made or purported to have been made after the date of the Merger Agreement
will be disregarded; 



inSilicon will have failed to perform in any material respect any material obligation or to comply in any material respect with any material agreement or
covenant of inSilicon to be performed or complied with by it prior to the Appointment Time under the Merger Agreement; or 



the Merger Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms; 

and which in any such case, and regardless of the circumstances (including any action or inaction by Synopsys or the Purchaser) giving rise to such condition, makes it inadvisable, in the good faith
judgment of Synopsys or the Purchaser (or in the reasonable and good faith judgment of Synopsys and the Purchaser in the case of the condition set forth in the third sub-bullet point above), to proceed with the Offer and/or with such acceptance for
payment of or payment for shares of inSilicon common stock. 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of
Synopsys and the Purchaser and, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, may be waived by Synopsys or the Purchaser, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, in the sole discretion of Synopsys or the Purchaser. The
failure by Synopsys or the Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights will not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right will be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

If the Offer is terminated pursuant to the foregoing provisions, all tendered shares of inSilicon common stock
that are not accepted for payment will be promptly returned to the tendering stockholders. 

14.

Certain Legal Matters

Except as described in this section 14, based on information
provided by inSilicon, none of inSilicon, the Purchaser or Synopsys is aware of any license or regulatory permit that appears to be material to the business of



inSilicon that might be adversely affected by the Purchasers acquisition of shares of inSilicon common stock in connection with the Offer or the Merger, or of any approval or other action
by a domestic or foreign governmental, administrative or regulatory agency or authority that would be required for the acquisition and ownership of shares of inSilicon common stock by the Purchaser in connection with the Offer or the Merger. Should
any such approval or other action be required, the Purchaser and Synopsys presently contemplate that such approval or other action will be sought, except as described below under State Takeover Laws. While, except as otherwise described
in this Offer to Purchase, the Purchaser does not presently intend to delay the acceptance for payment of, or payment for, shares of inSilicon common stock that are tendered in the Offer pending the outcome of any such matter, there can be no
assurance that any such approval or other action, if needed, would be obtained or would be obtained without substantial conditions or that failure to obtain any such approval or other action might not result in consequences adverse to
inSilicons business or that certain parts of inSilicons business might not have to be disposed of or other substantial conditions complied with in the event that such approvals were not obtained or such other actions were not taken or in
order to obtain any such approval or other action. If certain types of adverse action are taken with respect to the matters discussed below, the Purchaser could decline to accept for payment, or pay for, shares of inSilicon common stock that are
tendered in the Offer. See section 13 (Certain Conditions of the Offer) of this Offer to Purchase for certain conditions to the Offer, including conditions with respect to governmental actions. 

Delaware Law 

In general, section 203 of the DGCL prevents an interested stockholder (generally, a stockholder owning 15% or more of a corporations outstanding voting stock or an affiliate thereof) from engaging in a
business combination (generally defined to include a merger and certain other transactions as described below) with a Delaware corporation for a period of three years following the time when such stockholder became an interested
stockholder unless (i) prior to such time the corporations board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in such stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, (ii) upon consummation of the
transaction that resulted in such stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the corporations voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced (excluding shares owned by
certain employee stock option plans and persons who are directors and also officers of the corporation) or (iii) on or subsequent to such time, the business combination is approved by the corporations board of directors and authorized at an
annual or special meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder (and such action may not be taken by written consent). 

The Board of Directors of inSilicon has taken all actions necessary to exempt the Merger Agreement, the Tender and Voting Agreements, the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement from the provisions of section 203 of the DGCL. 

State Takeover Statutes 

A number of states have adopted laws that purport, to
varying degrees, to apply to attempts to acquire corporations that are incorporated in, or that have substantial assets, stockholders, principal executive offices or principal places of business or whose business operations otherwise have
substantial economic effects in, such states. inSilicon, directly or through subsidiaries, conducts business in a number of states throughout the United States, some of which have enacted such laws. Except as described in this Offer to Purchase, we
do not know whether any of these laws will, by their terms, apply to the Offer or the Merger and have not complied with any such laws. To the extent that certain provisions of these laws purport to apply to the Offer or the Merger, we believe that
there are reasonable bases for contesting such laws. 

In 1982, in a case named 
Edgar v. MITE Corp
., the
Supreme Court of the United States invalidated on constitutional grounds the Illinois Business Takeover Statute, which, as a matter of state securities law, made takeovers of corporations meeting certain requirements more difficult. In 1987,
however, in a case named 
CTS



Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of America
, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the State of Indiana could, as a matter of corporate law, constitutionally disqualify a potential
acquiror from voting shares of a target corporation without the prior approval of the remaining stockholders where, among other things, the corporation is incorporated, and has a substantial number of stockholders, in the state. Subsequently, in a
case named 
TLX Acquisition Corp. v. Telex Corp
., a Federal District Court located in the State of Oklahoma ruled that certain Oklahoma statutes were unconstitutional insofar as they purported to apply to corporations incorporated outside of
the State of Oklahoma in that they would subject such corporations to inconsistent regulations. Similarly, in a case named 
Tyson Foods, Inc. v. McReynolds
, a Federal District Court located in the State of Tennessee ruled that four Tennessee
takeover statutes were unconstitutional as applied to corporations incorporated outside of the State of Tennessee. This decision was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. In December 1988, a Federal District Court
located in the State of Florida held in a case named 
Grand Metropolitan PLC v. Butterworth
 that the provisions of the Florida Affiliated Transactions Act and the Florida Control Share Acquisition Act were unconstitutional as applied to
corporations incorporated outside of the State of Florida. 

Antitrust 

United States Antitrust Law
.    Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the
HSR Act), and the rules that have been promulgated under the HSR Act by the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC), certain acquisition transactions may not be consummated unless certain information has been furnished to the FTC
and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the Antitrust Division) and certain waiting period requirements have been satisfied. 

Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act with respect to the Offer have been filed separately by Phoenix Technologies (as the parent entity of inSilicon) and by Synopsys. Before expiration of
the 15-day waiting period, however, either the FTC or the Antitrust Division may extend the waiting period by requesting additional information or material from the parties. If such request is made, the waiting period will expire at 11:59 P.M., New
York City time, on the 10th calendar day after Synopsys has substantially complied with such request. Thereafter, the waiting period may be extended only by court order or with the Purchasers consent. 

The FTC and the Antitrust Division frequently scrutinize the legality under the antitrust laws of transactions such as the
Purchasers acquisition of shares of inSilicon common stock pursuant to the Offer and the Merger. The parties have learned that the FTC will be the agency responsible for reviewing the present transaction. At any time before the
Purchasers acquisition of shares of inSilicon common stock, the FTC could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the Purchasers acquisition of
shares of inSilicon common stock pursuant to the Offer, the Merger or otherwise, or seeking the divestiture of shares of inSilicon common stock acquired by the Purchaser, or the divestiture of substantial assets of Synopsys or its subsidiaries. At
any time after the Purchasers acquisition of shares of inSilicon common stock pursuant to the Offer and the Merger, the FTC or the Antitrust Division could take such action under the antitrust laws as either deems necessary or desirable in the
public interest, including seeking the divestiture of the shares of inSilicon common stock acquired by the Purchaser pursuant to the Offer and the Merger or the divestiture of substantial assets of Synopsys or its subsidiaries. Private parties, as
well as state governments, may also bring legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the Offer or the Merger or other acquisition of shares of inSilicon common stock by the
Purchaser on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, of the result. See section 13 (Certain Conditions of the Offer) of this Offer to Purchase for certain conditions to the Offer, including conditions with
respect to litigation and certain governmental actions. 

Foreign Laws.    
The Offer and
the Merger cannot be consummated until the Federal Cartel Office of Germany has been notified and approves of the Purchasers acquisition of shares of inSilicon common stock in connection with the Offer and the Merger under the German Act
Against Restraints of Competition (the Competition Act). Upon receipt of notification, the Federal Cartel Office will conduct a preliminary review for a period of up to one month. Upon conclusion of the preliminary review, the Federal
Cartel Office may either 



approve the Purchasers acquisition of shares of inSilicon common stock in connection with the Offer and the Merger or initiate an in-depth review for a period of up to four months from the
date of the original notification if further examination is necessary to determine whether the Purchasers acquisition of shares of inSilicon common stock in connection with the Offer and the Merger violates the Competition Act. The Purchaser,
Synopsys and Phoenix Technologies (as the parent entity of inSilicon) will prepare and file a joint filing with the Federal Cartel Office. The Federal Cartel Office may conduct an in-depth review to further examine the merits of the Offer and the
Merger under the Competition Act. In addition, the parties plan to file a pre-merger notification in Taiwan. 

Other Foreign Antitrust Filings.    
In addition to the United States, Germany and Taiwan, the antitrust and competition laws of other countries may apply to the Offer and the Merger and additional filings
and notifications may be required. The Purchaser, Synopsys and inSilicon are reviewing whether any such filings are required in connection with the Offer or the Merger and intend to make such filings promptly to the extent required.

Federal Reserve Board Regulations 

Regulations G, U and X of the Federal Reserve Board (the Margin Regulations) restrict the extension or maintenance of credit for the purpose of buying or
carrying margin stock, including the shares of inSilicon common stock, if the credit is secured directly or indirectly by margin stock. Such secured credit may not be extended or maintained in an amount that exceeds the maximum loan value of all the
direct and indirect collateral securing the credit, including margin stock and other collateral. All financing for the Offer has been structured so as to be in full compliance with the margin regulations. 

15.

Fees and Expenses

The Purchaser and Synopsys have retained D.F. King & Co.,
Inc. to act as the Information Agent for the Offer, and Computershare Trust Company of New York to serve as the Depositary for the Offer. Each of the Information Agent and the Depositary will receive reasonable and customary compensation for their
services, be reimbursed for certain reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and be indemnified against certain liabilities and expenses in connection with their services, including certain liabilities and expenses under United States federal securities
laws. 

Neither the Purchaser nor Synopsys will pay any fees or commissions to any broker or dealer or other person
in connection with the solicitation of tenders of shares of inSilicon common stock in connection with the offer. Upon request, the Purchaser will reimburse brokers, dealers, banks, trust companies and other nominees for customary mailing and
handling expenses incurred by them in forwarding material to their customers. 

16.

Miscellaneous

The Offer is not being made to (nor will tenders be accepted from
or on behalf of) holders of shares of inSilicon common stock in any jurisdiction in which the making of the Offer or the acceptance of the Offer would not be in compliance with the laws of such jurisdiction. Neither the Purchaser nor Synopsys is
aware of any jurisdiction in which the making of the Offer or the acceptance of the Offer would not be in compliance with the laws of such jurisdiction. To the extent that the Purchaser or Synopsys becomes aware of any state law that would limit the
class of offerees in the Offer, the Purchaser will amend the Offer and, depending on the timing of such amendment, if any, will extend the Offer to provide adequate dissemination of such information to holders of shares of inSilicon common stock
prior to the expiration of the Offer. 

No person has been authorized to give any information or to make any
representation on behalf of the Purchaser or Synopsys that is not contained in this Offer to Purchase or in the related Letter of Transmittal and, if given or made, such information or representation must not be relied upon as having been

transfer procedures described in the Offer to Purchase cannot be completed on a timely basis, or time will not permit all required documents to reach the Depositary prior to the Expiration Date, such stockholder may tender such Shares if all the
following conditions are met: (i) such tender is made by or through an Eligible Institution; (ii) a properly completed and duly executed Notice of Guaranteed Delivery, substantially in the form provided by the Purchaser, is received by the
Depositary at one of its addresses listed herein prior to the Expiration Date; and (iii) either (a) the certificates representing such Shares, together with this Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile copy of it), properly completed and duly
executed, and any required signature guarantees, and any other required documents, are received by the Depositary at one of its addresses listed herein within three trading days (as described below) after the date of execution of such Notice of
Guaranteed Delivery or (b) in the case of a book-entry transfer effected pursuant to the book-entry transfer procedures described in the Offer to Purchase, (1) either this Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile copy of it), properly completed
and duly executed, and any required signature guarantees, or an Agents Message, and any other required documents, is received by the Depositary at one of its addresses listed herein, and (2) such Shares are delivered pursuant to the book-entry
transfer procedures described in the Offer to Purchase and a Book-Entry Confirmation is received by the Depositary, in each case within three trading days after the date of execution of such Notice of Guaranteed Delivery. For purposes of the
foregoing, a trading day is any day on which the Nasdaq Stock Market is open for business. 

The
method of delivery of Shares to be tendered in the Offer, this Letter of Transmittal and all other required documents, including delivery through the Book-Entry Transfer Facility, is at the election and risk of the tendering stockholder. Shares to
be tendered in the Offer, will be deemed delivered only when actually received by the Depositary (including, in the case of a book-entry transfer, by Book-Entry Confirmation). If delivery of Shares is by mail, registered mail with return receipt
requested, properly insured, is recommended. In all cases, sufficient time should be allowed to ensure timely delivery. 

No alternative, conditional or contingent tenders will be accepted and no
fractional Shares will be purchased. All tendering stockholders, by execution of this Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile copy of it), waive any right to receive any notice of the acceptance of their Shares for payment. 

3.    
Inadequate Space
.    If the space provided herein is inadequate, the certificate
numbers and/or the number of Shares should be listed on a separate schedule attached hereto. 

4.    
Partial Tenders (Applicable to Certificate Stockholders Only)
.    If fewer than all the Shares evidenced by any certificate submitted are to be tendered herewith, fill in the
number of Shares that are to be tendered in the box entitled Number of Shares Tendered. In any such case, new certificate(s) for the remainder of the Shares that were evidenced by the old certificate(s) will be sent to the registered
holder(s), unless otherwise provided in the appropriate box on this Letter of Transmittal, as soon as practicable after the acceptance of payment of, and payment for, the Shares tendered herewith. All Shares represented by certificates delivered to
the Depositary will be deemed to have been tendered unless otherwise indicated. 

5.    
Signatures on Letter of Transmittal, Stock Powers and Endorsements
.    If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the Shares tendered herewith, the
signature(s) must correspond with the name(s) as written on the face of the certificate(s) without any change whatsoever. 

If any of the Shares tendered herewith are owned of record by two or more joint owners, all such owners must sign this Letter of Transmittal. 

If any tendered Shares are registered in different names on several certificates, it will be necessary to complete, sign and submit as many separate copies of this Letter of Transmittal as there are
different registrations of certificates. 

If this Letter of Transmittal or any certificates or stock powers are
signed by trustees, executors, administrators, guardians, attorneys-in-fact, officers of corporations or others acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such persons should so indicate when signing and proper evidence, satisfactory to the
Purchaser, of their authority so to act must be submitted. 

When this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the
registered owner(s) of the Shares tendered herewith, no endorsements of certificates or separate stock powers are required unless payment is to be made to, or certificates for Shares not tendered or accepted for payment are to be issued to, a person
other than the registered owner(s). Signatures on such certificates or stock powers must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution. 

If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by a person other than the registered owner(s) of certificate(s) listed on the cover page, such certificate(s) must be endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either
case signed exactly as the name or names of the registered owner(s) appear on such certificate(s). Signatures on such certificates or stock powers must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution. 

6.    
Stock Transfer Taxes
.    The Purchaser will pay any stock transfer taxes with respect to the transfer and sale of
Shares to it or its order pursuant to the Offer. If, however, payment of the purchase price is to be made to, or if certificates for Shares not to be tendered or not accepted for payment are to be registered in the name of, any person(s) other than
the registered owner(s), or if tendered certificate(s) are registered in the name of any person(s) other than the person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal, the amount of any stock transfer taxes (whether imposed on the registered owner(s) or
such person(s)) payable on account of the transfer to such person(s) will be deducted from the purchase price unless satisfactory evidence of the payment of such taxes or exemption therefrom is submitted. 

Except as provided in this Instruction 6, it will not be necessary for transfer tax stamps to be affixed to the certificate(s) listed in
this Letter of Transmittal. 

7.    
Special Payment and Delivery
Instructions
.    If a check is to be issued in the name of, and/or certificates for Shares not accepted for payment are to be returned to, a person other than the person signing this Letter of Transmittal, or if a check is to
be sent and/or such certificates are to be returned to a person other than the person signing this Letter of Transmittal or to an address other than that shown above, the appropriate boxes on this Letter of Transmittal should be completed.

8.    
Waiver of Conditions
.    The
Purchaser reserves the absolute right in its sole discretion to waive any of the specified conditions (other than the Minimum Condition (as defined in the Offer to Purchase)) of the Offer, in whole or in part, in the case of any Shares to be
tendered herewith. 

9.    
30% Backup Withholding
.    In order to
avoid backup withholding of U.S. federal income tax on payments of cash pursuant to the Offer, a stockholder tendering Shares in the Offer who is a U.S. citizen or a U.S. resident alien must, unless an exemption applies, provide the Depositary with
such stockholders correct taxpayer identification number (TIN) on Substitute Form W-9 included below in this Letter of Transmittal and certify under penalties of perjury that such TIN is correct and that such stockholder is not
subject to backup withholding. If a stockholder does not provide such stockholders correct TIN or fails to provide the certifications described above, the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) may impose a penalty on such stockholder
and payment of cash to such stockholder pursuant to the Offer may be subject to backup withholding of 30%. 

Backup
withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the amount of the backup withholding can be credited against the Federal income tax liability of the person subject to the backup withholding, provided that the required information is given to the IRS.
If backup withholding results in an overpayment of tax, a refund can be obtained by the stockholder upon filing an income tax return. 

The stockholder is required to give the Depositary the TIN (i.e., social security number or employer identification number) of the record owner(s) of the Shares tendered herewith. If such Shares are held in more than one
name, or are not in the name of the actual owner(s), consult the enclosed Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9 for additional guidance on which number to report. 

The box in Part 3 of the Substitute Form W-9 may be checked if the tendering stockholder has not been issued a TIN and has applied for a
TIN or intends to apply for a TIN in the near future. If the box in Part 3 is checked, the stockholder or other payee must also complete the Certificate of Awaiting Taxpayer Identification Number below in order to avoid backup withholding.
Notwithstanding that the box in Part 3 is checked and the Certificate of Awaiting Taxpayer Identification Number is completed, the Depositary will withhold 30% on all payments made prior to the time a properly certified TIN is provided to the
Depositary. However, such amounts will be refunded to such Stockholder if a TIN is provided to the Depositary within 60 days. 

See the enclosed Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9 for more instructions. 

Certain stockholders (including, among others, all corporations and certain foreign individuals and entities) are not subject to backup withholding. Tendering stockholders who are not U.S. citizens or
U.S. resident aliens should complete and sign the main signature form and the Form W-8BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding, included below in this Letter of Transmittal, in order to avoid backup
withholding. Stockholders should consult their tax advisors about qualifying for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such exemption. 

10.    
Lost, Destroyed or Stolen Certificates
.    If any certificate representing Shares to be tendered in the Offer has been
lost, destroyed or stolen, the Stockholder should promptly notify the transfer agent for inSilicon common stock, Equiserve Trust Company, at (816) 843-4299. The stockholder will then be instructed by Equiserve Trust Company as to the steps that
must be taken in order to replace such certificate. This Letter of Transmittal and related documents cannot be processed until the procedures for replacing lost or destroyed certificates have been completed. 

Important:    This Letter of Transmittal (or a manually signed facsimile copy of it) together with any signature
guarantees, or in the case of a book-entry transfer, an Agents Message, and any other required documents, must be received by the Depositary prior to the Expiration Date and either certificates for tendered Shares must be received by the
Depositary or Shares must be delivered pursuant to the procedures for book-entry transfer described in the Offer to Purchase, in each case prior to the Expiration Date, or the tendering stockholder must comply with the procedures for guaranteed
delivery described in the Offer to Purchase.

Ladies and Gentlemen: 

The undersigned hereby tenders to Ferrite Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (the Purchaser) and a wholly owned subsidiary of Synopsys, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Synopsys), the above described
shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Shares), of inSilicon Corporation, a Delaware corporation (inSilicon), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchasers Offer to Purchase,
dated August 6, 2002 (the Offer to Purchase), and this Letter of Transmittal (which, together with any amendments or supplements thereto or hereto, collectively constitute the Offer), receipt of which is hereby acknowledged.

At the time of execution hereof, such Shares are represented by the Exchangeable Shares of inSilicon Canada Ltd.
held by the undersigned (the Exchangeable Shares), the certificate(s) for which have been sent to inSilicon with a Notice of Conditional Retraction, and which will be exchanged for that number of Shares set forth above only immediately
prior to the completion of the Offer. Subject to the terms of this Letter of Transmittal, the valid delivery of this Letter of Transmittal to the Depositary shall be deemed to occur at the Purchase Time (as such time is defined in the enclosed
Notice of Conditional Retraction), notwithstanding that the actual Letter of Transmittal may be physically delivered to the Depositary prior to that time. inSilicon has been instructed by the undersigned to deliver the certificate(s) representing
such Shares to the Depositary promptly following the Purchase Time. For the purposes of this Letter of Transmittal, the Purchase Time shall be deemed to occur if, and only if, any shares of inSilicon that are tendered in the Offer are accepted for
payment by the Purchaser. 

Subject to the foregoing and otherwise upon the terms of the Offer, subject to, and
effective upon, acceptance for payment of, and payment for, the Shares tendered herewith in accordance with the terms of the Offer, the undersigned hereby sells, assigns and transfers to, or upon the order of, the Purchaser all right, title and
interest in and to all the Shares that are being tendered herewith (and any and all other Shares or other securities or rights issued in respect thereof on or after August 6, 2002) and irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Depositary the true and
lawful agent and attorney-in-fact of the undersigned, with full power of substitution (such power of attorney being deemed to be an irrevocable power coupled with an interest), to the full extent of the undersigneds rights with respect to such
Shares (and any such other Shares or securities or rights) (i) to deliver certificate(s) for such Shares (and any such other Shares or securities or rights) or transfer ownership of such Shares (and any such other Shares or securities or rights) on
the account books maintained by the Book-Entry Transfer Facility (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) together, in any such case, with all accompanying evidences of transfer and authenticity to, or upon the order of, the Purchaser, (ii) to present
such Shares (and any such other Shares or securities or rights) for transfer on inSilicons books and (iii) to receive all benefits and otherwise exercise all rights of beneficial ownership of such Shares (and any such other Shares or
securities or rights), all in accordance with the terms of the Offer. 

Subject to the foregoing, the undersigned
hereby represents and warrants that the undersigned has full power and authority to tender, sell, assign and transfer the Shares tendered herewith (and any and all other Shares or other securities or rights issued or issuable in respect of such
Shares on or after August 6, 2002) and, when the same are accepted for payment by the Purchaser, the Purchaser will acquire good title thereto, free and clear of all liens, restrictions, claims and encumbrances, and the same will not be subject to
any adverse claim. The undersigned will, upon request, execute any additional documents deemed by the Depositary or the Purchaser to be necessary or desirable to complete the sale, assignment and transfer of the Shares tendered herewith (and any
such other Shares or other securities or rights). 

All authority conferred or agreed to be conferred pursuant to
this Letter of Transmittal shall be binding upon the successors, assigns, heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives of the undersigned and shall not be affected by, and shall survive, the death or incapacity of the undersigned.
Except as described in the Offer to Purchase, this tender is irrevocable. 

By executing this Letter of
Transmittal, the undersigned hereby irrevocably appoints each designee of the Purchaser an attorney-in-fact and proxy of the undersigned, each with full power of substitution, to vote at any annual, special, or

adjourned or postponed meeting of inSilicons stockholders or otherwise in such manner as each such attorney-in-fact and proxy (or his or her substitute) shall in his or her sole discretion
deem proper with respect to, to execute any written consent concerning any matter as each such attorney-in-fact and proxy (or his or her substitute) shall in his or her sole discretion deem proper with respect to, and to otherwise act as each such
attorney-in-fact and proxy (or his or her substitute) shall in his or her sole discretion deem proper with respect to, the Shares tendered herewith that have been accepted for payment by the Purchaser prior to the time any such action is taken and
with respect to which the undersigned is entitled to vote (and any and all other Shares or other securities or rights issued or issuable in respect of such Shares on or after August 6, 2002). This appointment is effective when, and only to the
extent that, the Purchaser accepts for payment such Shares as provided in the Offer to Purchase. This power of attorney and proxy are irrevocable and are granted in consideration of the acceptance for payment of such Shares in accordance with the
terms of the Offer. Upon such acceptance for payment, all prior powers of attorney, proxies and consents given by the undersigned with respect to the Shares tendered herewith (and any such other Shares or securities or rights) will, without further
action, be revoked and no subsequent powers of attorney, proxies, consents or revocations may be given (and, if given, will not be deemed effective) by the undersigned in respect of such Shares. 

The undersigned understands that the valid tender of Shares pursuant to any of the procedures described in the Offer to Purchase and in the Instructions hereto will
constitute a binding agreement between the undersigned and the Purchaser upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer. 

Unless otherwise indicated herein in the box labeled Special Payment Instructions, please issue the cheque for the purchase price and/or return any certificate(s) for Shares not tendered or accepted for payment
in the name(s) of the registered holder(s) indicated herein in the box labeled Description of Shares Tendered on the cover page of this Letter of Transmittal. Similarly, unless otherwise indicated herein in the box labeled Special
Delivery Instructions, please mail the cheque for the purchase price and/or return any certificate(s) for Shares not tendered or accepted for payment (and accompanying documents, as appropriate) to the address(es) of the registered holder(s)
indicated herein in the box labeled Description of Shares Tendered on the cover page of this Letter of Transmittal. In the event that both of the boxes herein labeled the Special Payment Instructions and the Special
Delivery Instructions, respectively, are completed, please issue the cheque for the purchase price and/or return any certificate(s) for Shares not tendered or accepted for payment (and any accompanying documents, as appropriate) in the name

payment by crediting the account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility. The undersigned recognizes that the Purchaser has no obligation pursuant to the Special Payment Instructions to transfer any Shares from the name of the registered
holder(s) thereof if the Purchaser does not accept for payment any of the Shares so tendered. 

The undersigned

true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact of the undersigned to request the delivery to the Depositary of certificate(s) representing Shares to be issued in the name of the undersigned upon the purchase of the undersigneds Exchangeable Shares
at the Redemption Call Purchase Time (as such term is defined in the Notice of Exercise of Redemption Call Right upon Accelerated Redemption Date), and inSilicon and its affiliates are entitled to rely on directions received from the Purchaser or
the Depositary in respect of such Shares. The undersigned further acknowledges that should it deliver this Letter of Transmittal directly to the Depositary, then the undersigned will be entitled to receive proceeds from its tender of the Shares in

SEPTEMBER 4, 2002, UNLESS THE OFFER IS EXTENDED.

August 6, 2002 

To Brokers, Dealers, Banks, 

Trust
Companies and other Nominees: 

We have been engaged by Ferrite Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (the
Purchaser) and a wholly owned subsidiary of Synopsys, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Synopsys), to act as the information agent (the Information Agent) in connection with the Purchasers offer to purchase all
of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Shares), of inSilicon Corporation, a Delaware corporation (inSilicon), at a price of $4.05 per share (the Offer Price), net to the seller
in cash, without interest thereon, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchasers Offer to Purchase, dated August 6, 2002 (the Offer to Purchase), and in the related Letter of Transmittal (which, together
with any amendments or supplements thereto, collectively constitute the Offer). Please furnish copies of the enclosed materials to those of your clients for whom you hold Shares that are registered in your name or in the name of your
nominee. 

Enclosed herewith are copies of the following documents: 

1.  The Offer to Purchase dated August 6, 2002; 

2.  The Letter of Transmittal to be used by stockholders of inSilicon to tender Shares in the Offer (facsimile copies of the Letter of Transmittal
may also be used to tender Shares); 

3.  A letter to stockholders of inSilicon from the
President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board of Directors of inSilicon, accompanied by inSilicons Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9; 

4.  A printed form of letter that may be sent to your clients for whose account you hold Shares that are registered in your name or in the name of
your nominee, with space provided for obtaining such clients instructions with regard to the Offer; 

5.  Notice of Guaranteed Delivery with respect to Shares; 

6.  Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9 and Instructions for Form W-8BEN; and 

7.  Return envelope addressed to Computershare Trust
Company of New York, as the depositary for the Offer (the Depositary). 

We urge you to contact your
clients promptly. Please note that the Offer and withdrawal rights will expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Wednesday, September 4, 2002, unless the Offer is extended. 

The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, (i) there being validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer and not properly withdrawn prior to the
Expiration Date (as defined in the Offer to Purchase), that number of Shares that, together with the Shares then owned by the Purchaser and Synopsys (if any), represent a majority of all then outstanding Shares, calculated on a fully diluted basis
including all Shares issued or issuable upon the redemption of the exchangeable preferred stock of inSilicon Canada Ltd. and the exercise of all then outstanding options to purchase Shares, other than options with a per share exercise price that is
greater than $4.05 (which Shares are referred to as inSilicons Fully Diluted Shares herein and which condition is referred to as the Minimum Condition herein), and (ii) the termination or expiration of any waiting
period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, applicable to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer. As of July 23, 2002, inSilicons majority stockholder, Phoenix Technologies Ltd., held an aggregate
number of Shares that represented 58.4% of all then outstanding Fully Diluted Shares. Phoenix Technologies has entered into a Tender and Voting Agreement with Synopsys, dated as of July 23, 2002, pursuant to which it agreed, solely in its capacity
as a stockholder of inSilicon, to tender all of its Shares to the Purchaser. 
Assuming that Phoenix Technologies tenders its Shares to the Purchaser in the Offer in compliance with its Tender and Voting Agreement with Synopsys, the Minimum
Condition will be satisfied.
 In addition, all of inSilicons directors and executive officers have entered into Tender and Voting Agreements with Synopsys, dated as of July 23, 2002, pursuant to which they agreed, solely in their capacity
as stockholders of inSilicon, to tender all of their Shares to the Purchaser. 

The Offer is being made pursuant to
an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 23, 2002 (the Merger Agreement), by and among Synopsys, the Purchaser and inSilicon pursuant to which, following the consummation of the Offer and the satisfaction or waiver of certain
conditions, the Purchaser will be merged with and into inSilicon (the Merger), with inSilicon surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Synopsys. As a result of the Merger, each outstanding Share (other than Shares owned by
Synopsys, the Purchaser, inSilicon or any subsidiary of Synopsys or inSilicon, or by stockholders, if any, who are entitled to and properly exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive the price per Share
paid pursuant to the Offer in cash, without interest thereon. 

The inSilicon board of directors has, based upon a
unanimous recommendation of a special committee of the board of directors of inSilicon, (i) determined that the Merger Agreement is advisable, (ii) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (including the
Offer and the Merger, taken together) are at a price and on terms that are in the best interests of the holders of Shares (other than inSilicons majority stockholder, Phoenix Technologies, with respect to which the inSilicon board of directors
has made no determination), and (iii) approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Offer and the Merger. Accordingly, the inSilicon board of directors recommends that the stockholders of inSilicon (other
than Phoenix Technologies, as to which the inSilicon board of directors makes no recommendation) accept the Offer and tender their Shares to the Purchaser. 

On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer, promptly after the Expiration Date of the Offer, the Purchaser will accept for payment, and pay for, all Shares validly tendered to the
Purchaser and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date of the Offer. To validly tender Shares in the Offer (i) the certificate(s) representing the tendered Shares, together with the related Letter of Transmittal (or a facsimile copy of
it), properly completed and duly executed, together with any required signature guarantees, and any other required documents, must be received by the Depositary prior to the Expiration Date of the Offer, (ii) in the case of a tender effected
pursuant to the book-entry transfer procedures described in the Offer to Purchase (a) either the related

Letter of Transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, together with any required signature guarantees, or an Agents Message, (as defined in the Offer to Purchase), and any other
required documents, must be received by the Depositary prior to the Expiration Date of the Offer, and (b) the Shares to be tendered must be delivered pursuant to the book-entry transfer procedures described in the Offer to Purchase and a Book-Entry
Confirmation (as defined in the Offer to Purchase), must be received by the Depositary prior to the Expiration Date of the Offer, or (iii) the tendering stockholder must comply with the guaranteed delivery procedures described in the Offer to
Purchase prior to the Expiration Date of the Offer. 

Neither of the Purchaser or Synopsys will pay any fees or
commissions to any broker or dealer or other person (other than the Depositary and the Information Agent, as described in the Offer to Purchase) in connection with the solicitation of tenders of Shares in connection with the Offer. You will be
reimbursed by the Purchaser upon request for customary mailing and handling expenses incurred by you in forwarding the enclosed materials to your customers. 

Questions regarding the Offer, and requests for additional copies of the enclosed material, may be directed to the Information Agent at the address and telephone number listed on the back cover of the
Offer to Purchase. 

Very truly yours, 

D. F. KING & CO., INC.

(as defined below) described in this Notice of Offer is made solely by the Offer to Purchase dated August 6, 2002, and the related Letter of 

Transmittal and any amendments or supplements thereto, each of which is being delivered to holders of inSilicon common stock. The 

Offer is not being made to (nor will tenders be accepted from or on behalf of) holders of shares of inSilicon common stock in any 

jurisdiction in which the making of the Offer or the acceptance thereof would not be in compliance with the laws of such 

jurisdiction or any administrative or judicial action pursuant thereto. The Purchaser (as defined below) 

may, in its discretion, take
such action as it may deem necessary to make the Offer in any jurisdiction 

and extend the Offer to holders of shares of inSilicon common stock in such
jurisdiction. 

Notice of Offer to Purchase for Cash 

All Outstanding Shares of Common Stock 

of 

inSilicon Corporation 

at 

$4.05 Net Per Share 

by 

Ferrite
Acquisition Corp., 

a wholly owned subsidiary of 

Synopsys,
Inc. 

Ferrite Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (the Purchaser) and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Synopsys, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is offering to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of inSilicon Corporation, a Delaware corporation, at a price of $4.05 per share, net to the
seller in cash, without interest thereon (the Offer Price), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated August 6, 2002 (the Offer to Purchase), and the related Letter of Transmittal,
which together with any amendments or supplements thereto, collectively constitute the Offer described in this Notice of Offer. Tendering inSilicon stockholders whose shares of inSilicon common stock are registered in their own names and
who tender their shares directly to Computershare Trust Company of New York, which is acting as the depositary for the Offer (the Depositary) will not be obligated to pay brokerage fees or commissions in connection with the Offer or,
except as set forth in Instruction 6 of the Letter of Transmittal, transfer taxes on the sale of shares pursuant to the Offer. Stockholders of inSilicon who hold their shares of inSilicon common stock through brokers, dealers, commercial banks,
trust companies or other nominees should check with such institutions to determine whether they will charge any service fees for tendering such stockholders shares to the Purchaser in the Offer. The Purchaser is offering to acquire all of the
shares of inSilicon common stock as a first step in acquiring the entire equity interest in, and thus control of, inSilicon. Following the consummation of the Offer, the Purchaser intends to effect the merger described below to acquire all of the
outstanding shares of inSilicon common stock that are not tendered to and purchased by the Purchaser pursuant to the Offer. 

THE OFFER AND WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS WILL EXPIRE AT 12:00 MIDNIGHT, NEW YORK CITY TIME, ON WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 4, 2002, UNLESS THE OFFER IS EXTENDED. 

The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, (i) there being validly tendered in accordance with the terms
of the Offer and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date (as defined below) that number of shares of inSilicon common stock that, together with the shares of inSilicon common stock then owned by the Purchaser and Synopsys (if any),
represent a majority of all then outstanding shares of inSilicon common stock, calculated on a fully diluted basis including all shares of inSilicon common stock issued or issuable upon the redemption of the exchangeable preferred stock of inSilicon
Canada Ltd. and the exercise of all then outstanding options to purchase shares of inSilicon common stock, other than options with a per share exercise price that is greater than the Offer Price (which shares are referred to as inSilicons
Fully Diluted shares in this Notice of Offer and which condition is referred to as the Minimum Condition in this Notice of Offer), and (ii) the termination or expiration of any waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, applicable to the purchase of shares of inSilicon common stock pursuant to the Offer. As of July 23, 2002, inSilicons majority stockholder, Phoenix Technologies Ltd., held an aggregate number of
shares of inSilicon common stock that represented 58.4% of all then outstanding Fully Diluted shares of inSilicon common stock. Phoenix Technologies has entered into a Tender and Voting Agreement with Synopsys, dated as of July 23, 2002, pursuant to
which it agreed, solely in its capacity as a stockholder of inSilicon, to tender all of its shares of inSilicon common stock to the Purchaser in the Offer. 
Assuming that Phoenix Technologies tenders its shares to the Purchaser in the Offer in
compliance with its Tender and Voting Agreement with Synopsys, the Minimum Condition will be satisfied. 
In addition, all of inSilicons directors and executive officers have entered into Tender and Voting Agreements with Synopsys, each
dated as of July 23, 2002, pursuant to which they agreed, solely in their capacity as stockholders of inSilicon, to tender all of their shares of inSilicon common stock to the Purchaser in the Offer. The Offer is being made pursuant to an Agreement
and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 23, 2002, by and among Synopsys, the Purchaser and inSilicon (the Merger Agreement) pursuant to which, following the consummation of the Offer and the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, the
Purchaser will be merged with and into inSilicon (the Merger), with inSilicon surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Synopsys. As a result of the Merger, each outstanding share of inSilicon common stock (other than shares
owned by Synopsys, the Purchaser, inSilicon or any subsidiary of Synopsys or inSilicon, or by stockholders, if any, who are entitled to and properly exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive the price
per share paid pursuant to the Offer in cash, without interest thereon. 

The inSilicon Board of Directors has,
based upon a unanimous recommendation of a special committee of the Board of Directors of inSilicon, (i) determined that the Merger Agreement is advisable, (ii) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby
(including the Offer and the Merger, taken together) are at a price and on terms that are in the best interests of the holders of shares of common stock of inSilicon (other than Phoenix Technologies, with respect to which the inSilicon Board of
Directors has made no determination), and (iii) approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Offer and the Merger. Accordingly, the inSilicon Board of Directors recommends that the stockholders of inSilicon
(other than Phoenix Technologies, as to which the inSilicon Board of Directors makes no recommendation) accept the Offer and tender their shares of inSilicon common stock to the Purchaser in the Offer. 

On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer, promptly after the
Expiration Date, the Purchaser will accept for payment, and pay for, all shares of inSilicon common stock validly tendered to the Purchaser in the Offer and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date. The Purchaser will be deemed to have
accepted for payment, and thereby purchased, shares of inSilicon common stock that are validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date as, if and when the Purchaser gives oral or written notice to the Depositary
of the Purchasers acceptance for payment of such shares. Payment for shares of inSilicon common stock that are accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer will be made by deposit of the purchase price therefor with the Depositary, which will
act as an agent for stockholders tendering shares in the Offer for the purpose of receiving payment from the Purchaser and transmitting payment to such stockholders whose shares of inSilicon common stock have been accepted for payment pursuant to
the Offer. For a stockholder to validly tender shares of inSilicon common stock in the Offer (i) the certificate(s) representing the tendered shares, together with the related Letter of Transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, together
with any required signature guarantees and any other required documents, must be received by the Depositary prior to the Expiration Date, (ii) in the case of a tender effected pursuant to the book-entry transfer procedures (a) either the related
Letter of Transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, together with any required signature guarantees, or an Agents Message (as defined in Section 2 of the Offer to Purchase), and any other required documents, must be received by the
Depositary prior to the Expiration Date, and (b) the shares to be tendered must be delivered pursuant to the book-entry transfer procedures described in the Offer to Purchase and a Book-Entry Confirmation (as defined in Section 2 of the Offer to
Purchase) must be received by the Depositary prior to the Expiration Date, or (iii) the tendering stockholder must comply with the guaranteed delivery procedures described in the Offer to Purchase prior to the Expiration Date. 

For purposes of the Offer and as used in this Notice of Offer and the Offer to Purchase, the term Expiration Date
means 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Wednesday, September 4, 2002, unless and until the Purchaser extends the period of time during which the Offer is open in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, in which event the term
Expiration Date will mean the latest time and date on which the Offer, as so extended by the Purchaser, will expire. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Purchaser is obligated to extend the Offer by giving oral or written notice
of such extension to the Depositary, (i) for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission or its staff that is applicable to the Offer, or by any rule, regulation, interpretation
or position of the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. that is applicable to the Offer, or (ii) in the event that any of the conditions to the Offer are not satisfied or waived as of any then scheduled Expiration Date, for successive extension periods of not
more than 10 business days each until such time as either (a) all of the conditions to the Offer are satisfied or waived or (b) the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with it terms. 
Under no circumstances will interest be paid on the
Offer Price for shares of inSilicon common stock that are tendered in the Offer, regardless of any extension of, or amendment to, the Offer or any delay in paying for such shares.

If the Purchaser extends the Offer, the Purchaser will inform the Depositary of that fact and will make a public announcement of the extension not later than 9:00 a.m., New
York City time, on the next business day after the previously scheduled Expiration Date. During any such extension, all shares of inSilicon common stock previously tendered and not withdrawn will remain subject to the Offer, subject to the right of
a tendering stockholder to withdraw such shares. Shares of inSilicon common stock that are tendered in the Offer may be withdrawn pursuant to the procedures described in the Offer to Purchase at any time prior to the Expiration Date, and shares that
are tendered may also be withdrawn at any time after October 4, 2002 unless accepted for payment on or before that date. In the event that the Purchaser provides for a subsequent offering period following the completion of the Offer, (i) no
withdrawal rights will apply to shares tendered during such subsequent offering period and (ii) no withdrawal rights will apply to shares that were previously tendered in the Offer and accepted for payment. 

For a withdrawal of shares of inSilicon common stock previously tendered in the Offer to be effective, a written or facsimile transmission
notice of withdrawal must be timely received by the Depositary at one of its addresses listed on the back cover of the Offer to Purchase, specifying the name of the person having tendered the shares to be withdrawn, the number of shares to be
withdrawn and the name of the registered holder of the shares to be withdrawn, if different from the name of the person who tendered the shares. If certificates for shares have been delivered or otherwise identified to the Depositary, then, prior to
the physical release of such certificates, the serial numbers shown on such certificates must be submitted to the Depositary and, unless such shares have been tendered by a financial institution (including most commercial banks, savings and loan
associations and brokerage houses) that is a participant in the Security Transfer Agents Medallion Program, Nasdaq Stock Market Medallion Signature Guarantee Program or the Stock Exchange Medallion Program (each an Eligible Institution),
any and all signatures on the notice of withdrawal must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution. If shares have been tendered pursuant to the book-entry transfer procedures described in Section 2 of the Offer to Purchase, any notice of withdrawal
must also specify the name and number of the account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility (as defined in Section 2 of the Offer to Purchase) to be credited with the withdrawn shares and otherwise comply with the Book-Entry Transfer Facilitys
procedures. Withdrawals of tenders of shares may not be rescinded, and any shares properly withdrawn will thereafter be deemed not validly tendered for purposes of the Offer. Withdrawn shares may be re-tendered in the Offer, however, by again
following one of the procedures described in Section 2 of the Offer to Purchase at any time prior to the Expiration Date. All questions as to the form and validity (including time of receipt) of any notice of withdrawal will be determined by the
Purchaser in its sole discretion, which determination will be final and binding. None of the Purchaser, Synopsys, inSilicon, the Depositary, D.F. King & Co., Inc. the information agent for the Offer (the Information Agent) or any
other person will be under any duty to give notification of any defects or irregularities in any notice of withdrawal or incur any liability for failure to give any such notification. 

Under Rule 14d-11 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and subject to conditions described in the Offer to Purchase, the Purchaser may elect to provide for a
subsequent offering period, immediately following the Expiration Date, of not less than three business days nor more than 20 business days in length. In addition, the Purchaser will be obligated to provide for a subsequent offering period
immediately following the Expiration Date of 10 business days in length, in the event that more than 85% (but less than 90%) of the then outstanding shares of inSilicon common stock are validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn prior
to the Expiration Date. If provided, a subsequent offering period would be an additional period of time, following the Expiration Date and the acceptance for payment of, and the payment for, any shares of inSilicon common stock that are validly
tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date, during which holders of shares of inSilicon common stock that were not previously tendered in the Offer may tender such shares to the Purchaser in exchange for the Offer
Price on the same terms and conditions that applied to the Offer. A subsequent offering period is not the same as an extension of the Offer, which will have been previously completed if a subsequent offering period is provided. The Purchaser will
accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of inSilicon common stock that are validly tendered to the Purchaser during a subsequent offering period, if provided, as promptly as practicable after any such shares are validly tendered to the Purchaser
during such subsequent offering period, for the same price paid to holders of shares of inSilicon common stock that were validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date, net to the holders thereof in cash. Holders of
shares of inSilicon common stock that are validly tendered to the Purchaser during a subsequent offering period, if provided, will not have the right to withdraw such tendered shares. 

inSilicon has provided the Purchaser with a list, and security position listings, of inSilicons stockholders for the purpose of disseminating the Offer to holders of
shares of inSilicon common stock. The Offer to Purchase, and the related Letter of Transmittal and other materials related to the Offer will be mailed to record holders of shares of inSilicon common stock, and will be furnished to brokers, dealers,
commercial banks, trust companies and other nominees whose names, or the names of whose nominees, appear on the list of inSilicons stockholders, or, if applicable, who are listed as participants in a clearing agencys security position
listing, for subsequent transmittal to beneficial owners of shares of inSilicon common stock. 

The receipt of cash
pursuant to the Offer or the Merger will be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and may also be a taxable transaction under applicable state, local or foreign
income or other tax laws. Generally, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. stockholder tendering shares of inSilicon common stock in the Offer will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received by the
stockholder in the Offer or the Merger and the stockholders aggregate adjusted tax basis in the shares tendered by the stockholder and purchased in the Offer or converted into cash in the Merger, as the case may be. If shares of inSilicon
common stock that are tendered in the Offer are held by a tendering U.S. stockholder as capital assets, gain or loss recognized by such stockholder will be capital gain or loss, which will be long-term capital gain or loss if such stockholders
holding period for such shares exceeds one year. All stockholders should consult with their own tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences of the Offer and the Merger to them, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum
tax and any state, local or foreign income and other tax laws and of changes in such tax laws. For a more complete description of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Offer (and the related Merger), see Section 5 of the Offer to
Purchase. 

The Purchaser expressly reserves the right (but shall not be obligated), at any time and from time to
time, to increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, which provides that certain conditions may not be waived and certain modifications may not be made
without the consent of inSilicon. 

The information required to be disclosed by paragraph (d)(1) of Rule 14d-6 of the
General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is contained in the Offer to Purchase and is incorporated herein by reference. 

The Offer to Purchase and Letter of Transmittal contain important information and should be read carefully and in their entirety before any decision is made with respect
to the Offer. 

Questions regarding the Offer, and requests for assistance in connection with the Offer, may be
directed to the Information Agent, as set forth below. Requests for copies of the Offer to Purchase, the Letter of Transmittal and all other materials related to the Offer may be directed to the Information Agent, as set forth below, or brokers,
dealers, banks, trust companies or other nominees, and copies will be furnished promptly at Purchasers expense. No fees or commissions will be payable to brokers, dealers or other persons for soliciting tenders of shares of inSilicon common
stock in the Offer.

CERTAIN CANADIAN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS 

The following summary describes the principal Canadian federal income tax consequences generally applicable to a holder of shares of inSilicon common stock
who disposes of shares of inSilicon common stock pursuant to the Offer or pursuant to the transactions described under Section 12 of the Offer to Purchase Purpose of the Offer; Plans for inSilicon; The Merger Agreement; The Tender and Voting
Agreements. This summary is based upon the current provisions of the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the Canadian Tax Act) and the regulations thereunder, advice the Purchaser has received from legal counsel regarding the current
published administrative and assessing practices of the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA) and the proposed amendments to the Canadian Tax Act and regulations publicly announced by the Minister of Finance prior to the date hereof
(the Proposed Amendments). This summary assumes that the Proposed Amendments will be enacted as proposed but does not take into account or anticipate any other changes in law whether by way of judicial, legislative or governmental
decision or action, nor does it take into account provincial, territorial or foreign income tax legislation or considerations. 

This summary is generally applicable to a holder of shares of inSilicon common stock who, for purposes of the Canadian Tax Act, is resident or deemed to be resident in Canada, holds the shares of inSilicon common stock as capital
property, and who deals at arms length with the Purchaser at all relevant times up to and including the completion of the offer or the merger.

Shares of inSilicon common stock will generally constitute capital property to a holder unless the holder of the shares is a trader or dealer in respect of the shares of inSilicon common stock, has
acquired the shares of inSilicon common stock in a transaction or transactions considered to be an adventure in the nature of trade or is a financial institution subject to the mark-to-market rules within the meaning of the Canadian Tax
Act. This summary is therefore not applicable to such stockholders. 

This discussion does not apply to a holder with respect to
whom inSilicon is a foreign affiliate within the meaning of the Canadian Tax Act. 

For purposes of the Canadian Tax Act, all
amounts relating to the disposition of the shares of inSilicon common stock, including adjusted cost base and proceeds of disposition, must be converted into Canadian dollars based on the prevailing U.S. dollar exchange rate at the time such amounts
arise. In computing a holders liability for tax under the Canadian Tax Act, any cash amounts received by a holder in U.S. dollars must be converted in the Canadian dollar equivalent. 

This summary is of a general nature only and is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or tax advice to any particular holder. Accordingly, holders should consult
their own independent tax advisors for advice with respect to the income tax consequences to them of their disposing of their shares of inSilicon common stock having regard to their particular circumstances. 

The Offer 

A holder who sells shares of inSilicon common stock in the Offer will recognize a capital gain (or capital loss) in respect of the disposition of the shares of inSilicon common stock to the extent
that the cash proceeds of disposition, net of any reasonable costs of disposition, exceed (or are less than) the total adjusted cost base of the shares of inSilicon common stock to the holder. 

Taxation of Capital Gains and Capital Losses 

A holder will be required to include in income for the taxation year in which the sale occurs one-half of any such capital gain and, subject to certain specific rules in the Canadian Tax Act, will generally be able to deduct
one-half of the amount of any such capital loss against taxable capital gains realized by the holder in the same taxation year, in any of the three preceding taxation years or in any subsequent taxation year. 

Capital gains realized by an individual or trust, other than certain specified trusts, may give rise to alternative minimum tax under the Canadian Tax Act.

A holder that is throughout the year a Canadian-controlled private corporation (as defined in the Canadian Tax Act)
may be liable to pay an additional refundable tax of 6

/

% on its aggregate investment income for
the year which will include an amount in respect of taxable capital gains. 

The Merger 

The Offer is being made pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 23, 2002, by and among Synopsys, the Purchaser and inSilicon pursuant to
which, following the consummation of the Offer and the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, the Purchaser will be merged with and into inSilicon, with inSilicon surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Synopsys. As a result of
the Merger, each outstanding share of inSilicon common stock (other than shares owned by Synopsys, the Purchaser, inSilicon or any subsidiary of Synopsys or inSilicon, or by stockholders, if any, who are entitled to and properly exercise appraisal
rights under Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive the price per share paid pursuant to the Offer in cash, without interest thereon. 

Each share of inSilicon common stock of a holder that is not tendered in the Offer and that is converted in connection with the Merger into cash equal to the price per share paid pursuant to the Offer, without interest
thereon, as described under Section 12 of the Offer to PurchasePurpose of the Offer; Plans for inSilicon; The Merger Agreement; The Tender and Voting Agreements, will be subject to the same tax consequences, as described above
under the heading, The Offer. 

Where a holder does not tender his shares of inSilicon common stock in the Offer and
complies in all respects with the appraisal rights provisions of section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the holder would recognize a capital gain (or a capital loss) to the extent that the proceeds of disposition received for such
shares of inSilicon common stock, net of any reasonable costs of disposition, exceed (or are less than) the adjusted cost base of the shares of inSilicon common stock so disposed. The taxation of capital gains and capital losses is described above
under the subheading, Taxation of Capital Gains and Capital Losses. Any court awarded interest must be fully included in computing the holders income. Holders who fail to perfect, or otherwise withdraw or lose their rights to

CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

Prepared by R.R. Donnelley Financial -- Confidentiality Agreement

Exhibit (d)(4) 

CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT 

In connection with the consideration of a possible
negotiated transaction among Synopsys, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, affiliates and divisions, 
Synopsys
), inSilicon Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, affiliates and divisions, excluding Phoenix,

inSilicon
) and Phoenix Technologies Ltd. (together with its subsidiaries, affiliates and divisions, excluding inSilicon, 
Phoenix
) (each of Synopsys, inSilicon and Phoenix being hereinafter referred to as a

Company
 and collectively as the 
Companies
), regarding an acquisition of shares of the outstanding capital stock of inSilicon (the 
Possible Transaction
), (i) each of inSilicon and Phoenix is
prepared to make available to Synopsys certain information concerning the business, financial condition, operations, assets and liabilities of inSilicon and (ii) Synopsys is prepared to make available to inSilicon and Phoenix certain information
concerning the business, financial condition, operations, assets and liabilities of Synopsys (each Company in its capacity as a provider of information hereunder being referred to as a 
Provider
 and each Company in its capacity as
a recipient of information hereunder being referred to as a 
Recipient
). As a condition to such information being provided to each Recipient and its Recipient Representatives (as hereinafter defined), each Recipient agrees to treat
any information concerning the Provider (whether prepared by or on behalf of the Provider, its Recipient Representatives or otherwise and irrespective of the form of communication), which has been furnished in the past (including such information
that was furnished pursuant to the Agreements dated April 30, 2001 and May 3, 2001, respectively, by and between Phoenix and Synopsys, and the Agreement dated May 8, 2002 by and among Phoenix, Synopsys and InSilicon (collectively, the 
Prior
Agreements
)) or is furnished now or in the future to the Recipient and its Recipient Representatives by or on behalf of the Provider in connection with a Possible Transaction, 
provided
 that such information is in writing and
reasonably identified in writing as confidential or, if such information is verbal, that it is either reasonably identified as confidential prior to the verbal disclosure or the Provider promptly (and in any event within 30 days following such
disclosure) sends each Recipient and its Recipient Representatives to whom such information was provided by the Provider a written notice identifying such information as confidential (herein collectively referred to, with respect to information
furnished by or on behalf of any Company in its capacity as a Provider to any other Company in its capacity as a Recipient, subject to the immediately following paragraph, as the 
Evaluation Material
), in accordance with the
provisions of this agreement, and to take or abstain from taking certain other actions as hereinafter set forth. As used in this agreement, 
Recipient Representatives
 shall include the directors, officers, employees, agents,
partners or advisors of such Recipient (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers, financing sources and financial advisors) and those of such Recipients parent company, subsidiaries and affiliates.
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, each Company reserves the right not to make available hereunder any information, the provision of which is determined by it, in its sole discretion, to be inadvisable, inappropriate or subject to other
restrictions or disclosure, whether contractual, legal or fiduciary. 

The term 
Evaluation
Material
 also shall be deemed to include all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations or other documents prepared by a Recipient or its Recipient 

Representatives which contain, reflect or are based upon, in whole or in part, the information constituting Evaluation Material furnished to
such Recipient or its Recipient Representatives pursuant hereto. The term Evaluation Material does not include information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the Recipient or its
Recipient Representatives, (ii) was within the Recipients or its Recipient Representatives possession prior to its being furnished to the Recipient or its Recipient Representatives by or on behalf of the Provider pursuant hereto, provided that
the source of such information was not bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the Provider or any other party with respect to such information, (iii) becomes available to
the Recipient or its Recipient Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Provider or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, partners or advisors (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants,
consultants, bankers and financial advisors) (collectively, 
Provider Representatives
), provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of
confidentiality to, the Provider or any other party with respect to such information, (iv) is independently developed by the Recipient or its Recipient Representatives without the use of any Evaluation Material, or (v) is approved for release by the
Provider in writing. 

Each Recipient hereby agrees that such Recipient will, and will use its best efforts to
cause its Recipient Representatives to, use the Evaluation Material solely for the purpose of evaluating the Possible Transaction and for no other purpose, use reasonable care, but in no event less than the same degree of care that it uses to
protect its own confidential and proprietary information of similar importance, to keep the Evaluation Material confidential and prevent the disclosure of any Evaluation Material in any manner whatsoever; 
provided, however
, that (i) the
Recipient may make any disclosure of such information to which the Provider gives its prior written consent, (ii) any of such information may be disclosed to its Recipient Representatives who need to know such information for the sole purpose of
evaluating the Possible Transaction, who are subject to an obligation of confidentiality with respect thereto in favor of Recipient and (iii) subject to any other confidentiality agreement entered into by a Company, any Company may disclose to any
other Company Evaluation Material it receives or produces concerning another Company, and each such disclosing Company may also disclose such Evaluation Material concerning such other Company to its Representatives, on the same basis as provided in
clause (ii) of this paragraph (upon receipt of any such information from a disclosing party, the receiving party shall be deemed a Recipient thereof for the purposes hereof). In any event, each Recipient agrees to undertake reasonable precautions to
safeguard and protect the confidentiality of the Evaluation Material and at such Recipients sole expense to take all reasonable measures (including but not limited to court proceedings) to restrain its Recipient Representatives from prohibited
or unauthorized disclosure or uses of the Evaluation Material. 

In addition, each Recipient agrees that, without
the prior written consent of the Provider, such Recipient and its Recipient Representatives will not disclose to any other person (other than the other Companies and their Representatives) the fact that the Evaluation Material has been made
available to such Recipient, that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a Possible Transaction or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect thereto (including the status thereof); 
provided, however
, that such
Recipient may make such disclosure if it has received the advice of outside counsel that such disclosure must be made by it in order that it not commit a violation of law, rule or regulation (including a Nasdaq rule or regulation); and further

provided that any such permitted disclosure shall not otherwise effect or impair the Recipients obligations with respect to the Evaluation
Material. 

In the event that any Recipient or any of its Recipient Representatives are requested or required (by
oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) to disclose any of the Evaluation Material, such Recipient shall provide the Provider with
prompt written notice of any such request or requirement so that the Provider may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order or other
remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the Provider, the Recipient or any of its Recipient Representatives are nonetheless, in the written opinion of counsel, legally compelled to disclose Evaluation Material to any tribunal or else stand liable for
contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, such Recipient or its Recipient Representatives may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such tribunal only that portion of the Evaluation Material which such counsel advises the Recipient is legally
required to be disclosed, provided that the Recipient exercises its best efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the Evaluation Material, including, without limitation, by cooperating with the Provider to obtain an appropriate protective order or
other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Evaluation Material by such tribunal. 

Each Company understands that a Company may currently or in the future be developing information internally, or receiving information from other parties that may be similar to another Companys information. Accordingly, nothing
in this agreement will be construed as a representation or inference that a Company will not develop products, have products developed for it or provide services that without violation of this Agreement, compete with the products, systems or
services contemplated by another Companys Evaluation Material. 

If any Company decides that it does not wish
to proceed with the Possible Transaction, it will promptly inform the other Company of that decision. In that case, or at any time upon the request of any Provider for any reason, the notified Recipient will promptly either (i) deliver to the
notifying or requesting Provider or (ii) destroy, all Evaluation Material (and all copies thereof) whether (a) furnished to the notified or requested Recipient or its Recipient Representatives by or on behalf of the notifying or requesting Provider
pursuant hereto or (b) prepared by the notified or requested Recipient or its Recipient Representatives; provided, however, that one copy thereof may be retained by legal counsel for the Recipient for archival purposes (and for no other purposes),
and the Recipient shall provide to the notifying or requesting Provider a certificate of compliance with this sentence. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Evaluation Material, the notified or requested Recipient and its Recipient
Representatives will continue to be bound by such Recipients respective obligations of confidentiality and other obligations hereunder. 

Each Company understands and acknowledges that no Company, in its capacity as a Provider, nor its Provider Representatives makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy
or completeness of the Evaluation Material furnished by or on behalf of such Provider and shall have no liability to any other Company in its capacity as a Recipient or to any of its Recipient Representatives relating to or resulting from the use of
the Evaluation Material furnished to such Recipient or any errors therein or omissions therefrom. Only those 

representations or warranties which are made in a final definitive agreement regarding a Possible Transaction when, as and if executed, and
subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified therein, will have any legal effect. 

In
consideration of the Evaluation Material being furnished to a Recipient, the Recipient hereby agrees that, for a period of one year from the date of this agreement, neither it nor any of its affiliates (excluding Phoenix in the case of inSilicon)
will solicit (other than general solicitations not directed at (i) any specific individuals or (ii) individuals who are employed by the Provider in particular) to employ any of the officers or employees of the Provider with whom it has had contact
or who was specifically identified to it by the Provider or any of its Provider Representatives for purposes hereof during the period of the Recipients investigation of the Provider, so long as they are employed by the Provider, without
obtaining the prior written consent of the Provider. 

To the extent that any Evaluation Material may include
materials subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, each Company understands and agrees that the Companies
have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is the desire, intention and mutual understanding of all Companies that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the
confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All Evaluation Material provided by any Company that is entitled to protection under the
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine. 

To the extent the Evaluation Material includes or otherwise involves intellectual property, technical data, technology, processes, trade
secrets or know-how, disclosure thereof by or on behalf of a Provider shall not be construed as the grant of any license or any right to use the same by any party. 

Each Company, in its capacity as a Recipient, acknowledges and agrees that such Recipient is aware (and that its Recipient Representatives are aware or, upon receipt of any
Evaluation Material, will be advised by such Recipient) of the restrictions imposed by the United States federal securities laws and other applicable foreign and domestic laws on a person possessing material non-public information about a public
company and that such Recipient and such its Recipient Representatives will comply with such laws. 

Each Company
agrees that no Evaluation Material, or any portion thereof, will be exported to any country in violation of the export laws and regulations of the United States. 

Each Company understands and agrees that no contract or agreement providing for a Possible Transaction shall be deemed to exist among the parties unless and until a final written definitive agreement
has been executed and delivered, and each Company hereby waives, in advance, any claims (including, without limitation, breach of contract) in connection with any Possible Transaction involving another Company unless and until such other Company
shall have entered into a final written definitive agreement regarding the Possible Transaction. Each 

Company also agrees that unless and until a final written definitive agreement regarding the Possible Transaction has been executed and
delivered, no Company will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such a transaction by virtue of this agreement, except for the matters specifically agreed to herein. Each Company further acknowledges and agrees that
each other Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject any and all proposals made by a Company or any of the persons who are Recipient Representatives or Provider Representatives with respect to such Company with regard to a
Possible Transaction, and to terminate discussions and negotiations with any Company at any time. Each Company further agrees that (i) each of the other Companies and the persons who are Recipient Representatives or Purchaser Representatives with
respect to the other Companies shall be free to conduct any process for a Possible Transaction, if and as they in their sole discretion shall determine (including, without limitation, negotiating with any interested parties and entering into a
definitive agreement therewith without prior notice to any Company or any other person), (ii) any procedures relating to such process or transaction may be changed at any time without notice to a Company or any other person and (iii) a Company shall
not have any claims whatsoever against another Company, the persons who are Recipient Representatives or Provider Representatives with respect to such other Company or any of its directors, officers, stockholders, owners, affiliates or agents
arising out of or relating to any Possible Transaction (other than those as against the parties to a final written definitive agreement in accordance with the terms thereof) nor, unless a definitive agreement is entered into with a Company, against
any third party with whom a transaction is entered into; except with respect to matters specifically agreed to herein or in any future binding written agreement (including a separate no-shop or exclusivity agreement among the Companies) by or among
one or more of the Companies (in which case this exception shall apply solely to such Companies). Neither this paragraph nor any other provision in this agreement can be waived or amended in favor of any Company except by written consent of the
other Companies, which consent shall specifically refer to this paragraph (or such provision) and explicitly make such waiver or amendment. 

It is understood and agreed that no failure or delay by any Company in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder. 

It is further understood and agreed that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this agreement by any Company or any of its Representatives and that the Company against which such breach is committed shall
be entitled to equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach by any Company of this agreement but shall be in addition to
all other remedies available at law or equity to the Company against which such breach is committed. In the event of litigation relating to this agreement, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that there has been a willful breach of this
agreement, then the Company which is determined to have so willfully breached shall be liable and pay to the other Company the reasonable legal fees incurred by the other Company in connection with such litigation, including any appeal therefrom.

This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California
applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within such 

State. Each Company also hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of
California and of the United States of America located in the State of California for any actions, suits or proceedings arising out of or relating to this agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and each Company agrees not to commence
any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto except in such courts, and further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such Companys address set forth below shall be effective service of
process for any action, suit or proceeding brought against such Company in any such court). Each Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this
agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in the courts of the State of California located in Santa Clara county and/or the courts of the United States of America located in the Northern District of California, and hereby further
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. 

This agreement shall terminate on the earlier of (i) two years of the date of this agreement or (ii) the closing of a Possible
Transaction; 
provided, however
 that any Recipients obligation to keep a Providers Evaluation Material confidential and to prevent its disclosure shall expire on the later of (A) two years from the date of this agreement and (B)
two years from the date of disclosure. 

This agreement contains the entire agreement among the Companies regarding
the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, arrangements and discussions among the Companies regarding such subject matter. In particular, without limitation, this agreement supercedes the Prior Agreements.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this agreement shall limit the remedies of any person for a breach of any of the Prior Agreements that occurred prior to the date hereof. 

This agreement may be signed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which shall be deemed to constitute a single instrument. 

[Signature Page Follows] 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each Company has caused this agreement to be signed by its
duly authorized representatives as of the date written below.

San Jose, CA 95134 

Gentlemen: 

This letter sets forth the terms upon which Synopsys, Inc. (Synopsys) agrees to continue
discussions looking toward a possible strategic combination with inSilicon Corporation (the Company) and certain related matters (the Combination). In consideration of the mutual covenants set forth below, Synopsys, the
Company and Phoenix Technologies Ltd. (Phoenix) agree as follows: 

1.    
Other Negotiations
. 

(a)  Between the date of this
letter and July 12, 2002, or such earlier date as Synopsys, Phoenix and the Company mutually agree to discontinue discussions regarding the Combination (the Expiration Date and such period being referred to as the Exclusivity
Period), neither the Company nor Phoenix will, nor will either of them authorize or permit its respective officers, directors, employees, affiliates and legal, accounting and financial advisors to, take any action to solicit, initiate, seek,
encourage or support any inquiry, proposal or offer from, furnish any information to, or participate in any negotiations with, any corporation, limited liability company, partnership, person or other entity or group, other than negotiations and
discussions with Synopsys (Permitted Discussions), regarding any asset purchase, stock purchase, merger, consolidation, share exchange or other business combination with or involving the Company, or any acquisition of the stock or assets
of the Company (other than (i) acquisitions of inventory or asset sales made in the ordinary course of the Companys current business consistent with past practice and (ii) issuances of stock of the Company pursuant to the exercise or
conversion of currently outstanding options, warrants, convertible securities or other equity equivalents of the Company) or options or other rights with respect thereto (an Alternate Transaction). 

(b)  The Company and Phoenix agree that any negotiations relating to an Alternate Transaction (other than Permitted Discussions)
will be suspended during the Exclusivity Period and that in no event will the Company or Phoenix accept or enter into an agreement concerning an Alternate Transaction during the Exclusivity Period with any party other than Synopsys. Each of the
Company and Phoenix represents and warrants that it has the legal right to enter into discussions with Synopsys regarding the Combination and to terminate or suspend any pending negotiations relating to an Alternate Transaction and agrees to
indemnify Synopsys, its officers, directors, employees, affiliates and advisors from and against any claims by any person based upon or arising out of its respective compliance with the terms of this letter agreement. 

inSilicon Corporation 

Phoenix Technologies Ltd. 

June 7, 2002

(c)  During the Exclusivity Period, the Company and Phoenix
will notify Synopsys immediately after receipt by the Company or Phoenix (or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, affiliates or advisors) of any unsolicited proposal for, or inquiry respecting, an Alternate Transaction or any
request for non-public information or for access to the properties, books or records of the Company in connection with such a proposal or inquiry or any communication by any person or entity that informs the Company or Phoenix that it is, or for
which it is otherwise reasonably foreseeable that it is, considering making such a proposal or inquiry (other than Permitted Discussions). Such notice to Synopsys will be made orally and in writing and will indicate in reasonable detail the material
terms and conditions of such proposal or inquiry (but excluding the identity of the person making the proposal or inquiry). The notice obligations of this paragraph 1(c) with respect to any such proposal or inquiry shall be limited to the extent
necessary for each of the Company and Phoenix to comply with the provisions of their respective confidentiality obligations, if any, pursuant to contracts with the person making such proposal or inquiry in effect prior to the date of this letter.

2.    
No Public Announcement; No Disclosure
.  The parties shall make no public announcement
concerning this letter, their discussions or any other memoranda, letters or agreements between the parties relating to the Combination. Any of the parties, but only after consultation with the others, may at any time make disclosure if it is
advised by independent legal counsel that such disclosure is required under applicable law or regulatory authority. Except as permitted by the preceding sentence, under no circumstances will any party (or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees or affiliates) discuss or disclose the existence or terms of this letter (or that the Company, Phoenix or any of them are holding discussions with Synopsys) with or to any third party other than such legal, accounting, and financial
advisors of such party who have a need to know such information solely for purposes of assisting such party in regard to the Combination. 

3.    
Governing Law
.  This letter shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts wholly executed and performed in the State of Delaware. 

4.    
Non-Binding Nature
.  The obligations of the parties to consummate the Combination shall be subject in all
respects to the negotiation, execution and delivery of definitive agreements and the satisfaction of the conditions contained in the definitive agreements. However, the obligations of Synopsys, the Company and Phoenix pursuant to paragraphs 1, 2 and
3 of this letter are intended to be binding and enforceable obligations of Synopsys, the Company and Phoenix. The Company will not be liable for any breach of this Agreement by Phoenix; and Phoenix will not be liable for any breach of this Agreement
by the Company.
