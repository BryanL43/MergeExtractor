                             New York, N.Y. 10118

Dear Fellow Shareholder:

     As you may know, on July 2, 2002, Garan, Incorporated entered into an
agreement and plan of merger, which we refer to as the merger agreement, with
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. pursuant
to which we will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. A
special meeting of our shareholders will be held on [day], [o, 2002], at o
[a.m./p.m.] New York City time, to vote on a proposal to approve the merger
agreement so that the merger can occur. The meeting will be held at o in New
York, New York. Notice of the special meeting is enclosed.

     Upon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive $60.00 in
cash for each share of Garan common stock that you own. This price represents
a 13% premium over the average closing price per share for the 20 trading
days, and a 37% premium over the average closing price per share for the one
year, in each case prior to the public announcement that Garan and Berkshire
Hathaway had entered into the merger agreement.

     This proxy statement gives you detailed information about the special
meeting and the merger and includes the merger agreement as Annex A. The
receipt of cash in exchange for shares of common stock in the merger will
constitute a taxable transaction to U.S. taxpayers for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. We encourage you to read the proxy statement and the merger
agreement carefully.

     Our board of directors has, by a unanimous vote, approved the merger
agreement and determined that the merger agreement and the merger are fair to
and in the best interests of Garan and our shareholders. In connection with
its evaluation of the merger, the board of directors considered a number of
factors, including the written opinion of Goldman, Sachs & Co., delivered on
July 2, 2002, to our board of directors to the effect that, based upon and
subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in that opinion, as of July
2, 2002, the $60.00 in cash per share to be received by holders of shares of
Garan common stock pursuant to the merger agreement, is fair from a financial
point of view to those holders. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a
recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Garan common stock should
vote with respect to the merger. The written opinion of Goldman Sachs is
attached as Annex B to the proxy statement, and you should read it carefully.

     Your vote is important. We cannot complete the merger unless holders of
more than two-thirds of all outstanding Garan shares entitled to vote on the
merger vote to approve the merger agreement. Our board of directors recommends
that you vote "FOR" the proposal to approve the merger agreement. THE FAILURE
OF ANY SHAREHOLDER TO VOTE ON THE PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE MERGER AGREEMENT
WILL HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS A VOTE AGAINST THE MERGER.

     Our board of directors has fixed the close of business on o, 2002, as the
record date for the special meeting and only holders of common stock on the
record date are entitled to vote at the special meeting. On the record date,
there were o shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote.

     Shareholders owning or controlling a total of 958,750 shares of common
stock representing approximately 21.0% of all outstanding shares, have entered
into a stockholders agreement in which they agreed to vote in favor of
approving the merger agreement. In addition, each of our directors and
executive officers (including those who have entered into the stockholders
agreement) has indicated that he intends to vote his own shares in favor of
the proposal to approve the merger agreement.

     WHETHER OR NOT YOU PLAN TO ATTEND THE SPECIAL MEETING, PLEASE COMPLETE,
SIGN AND DATE THE ACCOMPANYING PROXY CARD AND RETURN IT IN THE ENCLOSED
PREPAID ENVELOPE.

     Our board of directors and management appreciate your continuing support
of our company, and we hope you will support this exciting transaction.

                                           Sincerely,

                                           Seymour Lichtenstein

               Virginia corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire
               Hathaway Inc., and Garan, Incorporated, as the merger agreement
               may be amended from time to time.

         We urge you to read the accompanying proxy statement carefully as it
sets forth details of the proposed merger and other important information
related to the merger.

         The board of directors has fixed the close of business on o, 2002, as
the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of

as of that date will be entitled to notice of and to vote at the special
meeting or any adjournment thereof.

The Special Meeting (see page 11)

      Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting

         The special meeting is scheduled to be held as follows:

                  Date:    o, 2002

                  Time:    o , New York City time

                  Place:   o

      Proposal to Be Considered at the Special Meeting

         At the special meeting, you will be asked to vote on a proposal to
approve the agreement and plan of merger, which we will refer to in this proxy
statement as the merger agreement. A copy of the merger agreement is attached
as Annex A to this proxy statement.

      Record Date

         Our board of directors has fixed the close of business on o, 2002, as
the record date for the special meeting and only holders of record of our
common stock on the record date are entitled to vote at the special meeting.
On the record date, there were outstanding and entitled to vote o shares of
common stock.

      Voting Rights; Vote Required for Approval

         Each share of our common stock entitles its holder to one vote on all
matters properly coming before the special meeting. The presence in person or
representation by proxy of shareholders entitled to cast a majority of the
votes of all issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote on the proposal to
approve the merger agreement, considered together, shall constitute a quorum
for the purpose of considering that matter.

         If you hold your shares in an account with a broker or bank, you must
instruct the broker or bank on how to vote your shares. If an executed proxy
card returned by a broker or bank holding shares indicates that the broker or
bank does not have authority to vote on the proposal to approve the merger
agreement, the shares will be considered present at the meeting for purposes
of determining the presence of a quorum, but will not be voted on the proposal
to approve the merger agreement. This is called a broker non-vote. Your broker
or bank will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote
by following the instructions provided to you by your broker or bank.

         Under Virginia law and our articles of incorporation, approval of the
merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of more than two-thirds of all
outstanding Garan shares entitled to vote. Abstentions and broker non-votes
will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to approve the merger
agreement.

         Four of our employee-directors holding 958,750 shares of our common
stock, representing approximately 21.0% of the total votes entitled to be cast
at the special meeting, have entered into a stockholders agreement with
Berkshire Hathaway obligating those shareholders, subject to certain
limitations, to vote their shares in favor of the proposal to approve the
merger agreement. In addition, each of our directors and executive officers
(including those who have entered into the stockholders agreement) has
indicated that he intends to vote his own shares in favor of the proposal to
approve the merger agreement. If our directors and officers (including those
who have entered into the stockholders agreement) vote their shares in favor
of approving the merger agreement, 23.4% of the outstanding voting power of
shares of common stock will have voted for the proposal to approve the merger
agreement. This means that holders of an additional 43.3% of the voting power
of all shares entitled to vote at the meeting would need to vote for the
proposal to approve the merger agreement in order for it to be approved.

      Voting and Revocation of Proxies

         After carefully reading and considering the information contained in
this proxy statement, you should complete, date and sign your proxy card and
mail it in the enclosed return envelope as soon as possible so that your

shares are represented at the special meeting. You can also vote in person at
the meeting, but we encourage you to submit your proxy now in any event.
Unless you specify to the contrary on your proxy card, all of your shares
represented by valid proxies will be voted "for" the proposal to approve the
merger agreement.

         Please do not send in your stock certificates with your proxy card.
If the merger is completed, a separate letter of transmittal will be mailed to
you which will enable you to exchange your stock certificates for the merger
consideration.

         Until exercised at the special meeting, you can revoke your proxy and

Recommendation of Our Board of Directors (see page 15)

          After careful consideration, our board of directors unanimously:

          o    determined that the merger agreement, the merger and the
               transactions contemplated thereby are fair to, and in the best
               interests of, Garan and its shareholders;

          o    approved and declared advisable the merger agreement; and

          o    recommended that our shareholders vote to approve the merger
               agreement.

         Our board of directors recommends that you vote "for" the proposal to
approve the merger agreement at the special meeting.

         For a discussion of the material factors considered by our board of
directors in reaching its conclusions and the reasons why our board of
directors determined that the merger is fair, see "The Merger -- Reasons for
the Merger."

Opinion of Financial Advisor (see page 16)

         Goldman Sachs delivered its written opinion to Garan's board of
directors to the effect that, as of July 2, 2002, and based upon and subject
to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $60.00 per share in cash
to be received by the holders of Garan common stock in the merger is fair from
a financial point of view to such holders.

         The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated July 2,
2002, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the
opinion, is attached as Annex B. Goldman Sachs provided its opinion for the
information

and assistance of Garan's board of directors in connection with its
consideration of the merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion does not constitute a
recommendation as to how any holder of Garan common stock should vote with
respect to the merger. You are urged to read the opinion in its entirety.

Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (see page 22)

         In considering the recommendation of our board of directors that you
vote for the proposal to approve the merger agreement so that the merger can
occur, you should be aware that some of our executive officers and members of
our board of directors have interests in the merger that may be in addition to
or different from the interests of our shareholders generally. The members of
our board of directors were aware of these interests and considered them at
the time they approved the merger. These interests include the following:

          o    Four of our executive officers, Seymour Lichtenstein, our
               chairman and chief executive officer, Jerald Kamiel, our
               president and chief operating officer, William J. Wilson, our
               vice president-finance and administration, and Rodney Faver,
               our vice president-manufacturing, are each parties to
               employment agreements and, in the case of Mr. Lichtenstein, an
               employment and consulting agreement, with us, each of which
               agreements is hereinafter referred to as an employment
               agreement. On July 2, 2002, each of these employment agreements
               was amended to provide that, upon completion of the merger,
               each employment agreement will terminate, each of the four
               executives will continue in his current position with Garan as
               an at-will employee, and Messrs. Lichtenstein, Kamiel, Wilson
               and Faver will receive a cash retention payment equal to
               $4,300,617, $3,568,067, $2,033,200 and $1,325,567,
               respectively. The amount of each respective cash retention
               payment equals the amount each of these respective executives
               otherwise would have been entitled to receive under the
               employment agreements in the form of change-of-control payments
               if the executive terminated his employment following the
               merger.

          o    After the merger, the surviving corporation will continue
               indemnification arrangements for our present and former
               directors and officers, other than with respect to our existing
               directors' and officers' liability insurance policy.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences (see page 22)

         The receipt of $60.00 in cash for each share of our common stock
pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction to U.S. taxpayers for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, each
of our shareholders generally will realize taxable gain or loss as a result of
the merger measured by the difference, if any, between $60.00 per share and
the adjusted tax basis in that share owned by the shareholder. That gain or
loss will be a capital gain or loss if the share is held as a capital asset in
the hands of the shareholder, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if
the share has been held for more than one year at the time of the consummation
of the merger. Shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to
the particular tax consequences to them of the merger.

Regulatory Approvals (see page 21)

         Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended, which we refer to as the HSR Act, and the rules promulgated
thereunder by the Federal Trade Commission, the merger may not be completed
until notifications have been given and certain information has been furnished
to the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the
applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated. We expect to file
notification and report forms under the HSR Act with the FTC and the Antitrust
Division during July 2002. It is a condition to the closing of the merger that
the waiting period under the HSR Act with respect to the merger expires, or
the FTC and the Antitrust Division grant early termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act.

The Merger Agreement (see page 25)

      Conditions to the Merger (see page 28).

         The completion of the merger depends on the satisfaction or waiver of
a number of conditions, including the following:

          o    The merger agreement must have been approved by the affirmative
               vote of the holders of more than two-thirds of all outstanding
               Garan shares entitled to vote;

          o    No legal prohibition to the merger may be in effect;

          o    All domestic governmental consents, orders and approvals
               required for the completion of the merger must be obtained and
               be in effect, or applicable waiting periods must have
               terminated or expired;

          o    Our and Berkshire Hathaway's respective representations and
               warranties in the merger agreement must be true and correct in
               all material respects; and

          o    Garan and Berkshire Hathaway must have performed all material
               obligations that each is required to perform under the merger
               agreement.

      Termination of the Merger Agreement (see page 30).

         The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
completion of the merger, whether before or after shareholder approval has
been obtained:

          o    By mutual consent of Garan and Berkshire Hathaway;

          o    By either Garan or Berkshire Hathaway, if:

               o    Any final, non-appealable governmental order, decree,
                    ruling or other action prohibits the completion of the
                    merger, except that the party seeking to terminate must
                    have used all reasonable efforts to challenge that order,
                    decree, ruling or other action; or

               o    The merger is not completed on or before the outside date
                    of November 15, 2002, except that

                    o    This right to terminate will not be available to any
                         party whose failure to comply with the merger
                         agreement results in the failure of the merger to be
                         completed by that date; and

                    o    The outside date of November 15, 2002, will be
                         extended day-by-day for each day any party is subject
                         to a nonfinal order, decree, ruling or action
                         restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
                         completion of the merger, but that outside date will
                         not be extended beyond December 15, 2002; or

               o    By Berkshire Hathaway, if:

                    o    Our shareholders fail to approve the merger agreement
                         at the special meeting;

                    o    Our board of directors withdraws or modifies in a
                         manner adverse to Berkshire Hathaway its
                         recommendation for approval of the merger agreement
                         or recommends to our shareholders any takeover
                         proposal by a third party; or

                    o    We have breached any of our representations or
                         warranties or any of our material obligations under
                         the merger agreement where that breach cannot be
                         cured within 30 business days after Berkshire
                         Hathaway delivers written notice of the breach, other
                         than any failures or breaches that individually or in
                         the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to
                         have a material adverse effect on us; or

               o    By Garan, if:

                    o    Our shareholders fail to approve the merger agreement
                         at the special meeting;

                    o    Our board of directors withdraws or modifies in a
                         manner adverse to Berkshire Hathaway its
                         recommendation for approval of the merger agreement
                         or recommends to our shareholders a superior
                         acquisition proposal by a third party, provided that
                         we have complied with our obligations under the
                         merger agreement described under "The Merger
                         Agreement -- No Solicitation of Other Offers," and
                         provided that we have paid to Berkshire Hathaway the
                         $8 million termination fee and the out-of-pocket
                         expenses of Berkshire Hathaway and Merger Sub not to
                         exceed $1 million as described under "The Merger
                         Agreement -- Termination Fees"; or

                    o    Berkshire Hathaway has breached any of its
                         representations or warranties or any of its material
                         obligations under the merger agreement where that
                         breach cannot be cured within 30 business days after
                         we deliver written notice of the breach, other than
                         any failures or breaches that individually or in the
                         aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a
                         material adverse effect on Berkshire Hathaway.

      Termination Fees (see page 31).

         In certain circumstances, the board of directors has the right to
terminate the merger agreement in connection with the receipt of a superior
acquisition proposal, as further described in "The Merger Agreement --
Termination of the Merger Agreement." In that event, and in certain other
specified circumstances, the merger agreement provides that upon termination
we must pay to Berkshire Hathaway a termination fee of $8 million and the
out-of-pocket expenses of Berkshire Hathaway and Merger Sub not to exceed $1
million. See "The Merger Agreement -- Termination Fees."

No Dissenters' Rights

         Under Virginia law, any shareholder opposed to the merger will not
have statutory dissenters' rights and will only be entitled to receive $60.00
in cash, without interest, for each share of Garan common stock owned by him
or her.

                              The Special Meeting

         This proxy statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation
of proxies by our board of directors in connection with a special meeting of
our shareholders.

Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting

         The special meeting is scheduled to be held as follows:

                  Date:    o, 2002

                  Time:    o, New York City time

                  Place:   o

Proposal to Be Considered at the Special Meeting

         At the special meeting, you will consider and vote upon a proposal to
approve an agreement and plan of merger, dated as of July 2, 2002, by and
among Berkshire Hathaway, Merger Sub and Garan. A copy of the merger agreement
is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement.

Record Date

         Our board of directors has fixed the close of business on o, 2002, as
the record date for the special meeting and only holders of record of common
stock on the record date are entitled to vote at the special meeting. On the
record date, there were outstanding and entitled to vote o shares of common
stock.

Voting Rights; Vote Required for Approval

         Each share of common stock entitles its holder to one vote on all
matters properly coming before the special meeting. The presence in person or
representation by proxy of shareholders entitled to cast a majority of the
votes of all issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote on the proposal to
approve the merger agreement, considered together, shall constitute a quorum
for the purpose of considering that matter.

         If you hold your shares in an account with a broker or bank, you must
instruct the broker or bank on how to vote your shares. If an executed proxy
card returned by a broker or bank holding shares indicates that the broker or
bank does not have authority to vote on the proposal to approve the merger
agreement, the shares will be considered present at the meeting for purposes
of determining the presence of a quorum, but will not be voted on the proposal
to approve the merger agreement. This is called a broker non-vote. Your broker
or bank will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote
by following the instructions provided to you by your broker or bank.

         Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the
holders of more than two-thirds of all outstanding Garan shares entitled to
vote.

         Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote
against the proposal to approve the merger agreement.

         Four of our employee-directors holding 958,750 shares of our common
stock, representing approximately 21.0% of the total votes entitled to be cast
at the special meeting, have entered into a stockholders agreement with
Berkshire Hathaway obligating those shareholders, subject to certain
limitations, to vote their shares in favor of the proposal to approve the
merger agreement. In addition, each of our directors and executive officers
(including those who have entered into the stockholders agreement) has
indicated that he intends to vote his own shares in favor of the proposal to
approve the merger agreement. If our directors and officers (including those
who have entered into the stockholders agreement) vote their shares in favor
of approving the merger agreement, 23.4% of the voting power of the
outstanding shares of common stock will have voted for the proposal to approve
the merger agreement. This means that holders of an additional 43.3% of the
voting power of all shares entitled to vote at the meeting

would need to vote for the proposal to approve the merger agreement in order
for it to be approved. See "The Merger Agreement -- Stockholders Agreement."

Voting and Revocation of Proxies

         Shareholders of record may submit proxies by mail. Shareholders who
wish to submit a proxy by mail should mark, date, sign and return the proxy
card in the envelope furnished. Shareholders who hold shares beneficially
through a nominee (such as a bank or broker) may be able to submit a proxy by
telephone or the Internet if those services are offered by the nominee.

         Proxies received at any time before the special meeting, and not
revoked or superseded before being voted, will be voted at the special
meeting. Where a specification is indicated by the proxy, it will be voted in
accordance with the specification. Where no specification is indicated, the
proxy will be voted "for" the proposal to approve the merger agreement.

         Please do not send in your stock certificates with your proxy card.
When the merger is completed, a separate letter of transmittal will be mailed
to you which will enable you to receive the merger consideration.

          Until your proxy is exercised at the special meeting, you can revoke
your proxy and change your vote in any of the following ways:

          o    by delivering written notification to Garan at our executive
               offices at 350 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10118, Attention:
               Marvin S. Robinson, Secretary;

          o    by delivering a proxy of a later date in the manner described
               herein;

          o    by attending the special meeting and voting in person. Your

                                  The Merger

Background

         From time to time over the last several years, Garan has been
approached by investment banking professionals and others regarding the
possibility of Garan engaging in a strategic transaction. Garan did not
seriously entertain any of those proposals. In March 2002, Garan was
approached by an investment banking representative of another apparel company
regarding the possibility of a strategic transaction. Garan's senior
management determined that they should meet with that third party, and
following discussions with members of its board of directors, determined that
it would be an appropriate time to engage advisors to consider Garan's
strategic alternatives.

         On April 3, 2002, Garan engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial
advisor. On April 9, 2002, members of Garan's senior management met with
representatives of Goldman Sachs, who presented an overview of strategic
alternatives for Garan, including possible acquirors.

         On April 11, 2002, representatives of Garan met with representatives
of the apparel company that had expressed interest in the possibility of
acquiring Garan. Shortly thereafter, representatives of that company notified
Garan's CEO that it was not interested in pursuing a transaction with Garan.

         Following discussions with other members of its board of directors,
members of Garan's senior management determined to pursue the possibility of a
strategic sale of Garan. At Garan's request, Goldman Sachs analyzed potential
acquirors of Garan. Garan's senior management, after consultation with Goldman
Sachs, determined that an open and widely-marketed auction was not likely to
maximize shareholder value. Garan's senior management also discussed with
Goldman Sachs the advisability of conducting a narrowly-directed auction
process directed at a short list of more probable potential acquirors, or
approaching individually one or more of the most likely candidates, and
determined to prepare for the possibility of either approach. Goldman Sachs
commenced a due diligence inquiry of Garan and the preparation of offering
materials.

         In late April and again in late May, Garan and Goldman Sachs were
contacted by the investment banker who had originally suggested a strategic
transaction in March 2002. That investment banker suggested that Garan
consider a transaction with a different potential strategic acquiror, and
offered to arrange an introductory meeting. Garan indicated that that it was
not ready to entertain any inquiries, but that it would advise the investment
banker if it was interested in a meeting.

         Representatives of Garan (including six members of its board of
directors) and Goldman Sachs met again in early June to review the process of
analyzing Garan's strategic alternatives and potential acquirors. At that
time, Garan's management and representatives of Goldman Sachs agreed that
Berkshire Hathaway was the most likely and attractive potential acquiror.
Representatives of Goldman Sachs advised Garan that Berkshire Hathaway, based
upon its past practice and public statements, would be unlikely to participate
in an auction process and unlikely to be interested if not approached on an
exclusive basis. Garan determined to have a representative of Goldman Sachs
contact Warren Buffett, the Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, to determine
whether Berkshire Hathaway would be interested in acquiring Garan at a
specific price per share, which price was in excess of $60.00.

         On June 12, 2002, representatives of Goldman Sachs contacted Mr.
Buffett regarding a potential strategic acquisition of Garan and the proposed
price at which Garan would be interested in pursuing a transaction. The
following day, Mr. Buffett advised Goldman Sachs that Berkshire Hathaway would
be interested in pursuing an acquisition of Garan at $60.00 per share in cash,
and requested that members of Garan's senior management meet with him at
Berkshire Hathaway's headquarters the following week to discuss a possible
transaction. Further conversations with Mr. Buffett confirmed that the $60.00
offer was firm and not negotiable. He also said that he would not be
interested in Garan if other potential purchasers were contacted. In addition,
Mr. Buffett expected the existing Garan management team to agree to remain
with Garan after a transaction. On June 14, 2002, members of Garan's senior
management team met with representatives of Goldman Sachs and, following
consultation with other directors, determined that they would be interested in
a transaction with Berkshire Hathaway at $60.00 per share.

         On June 17, 2002, Berkshire Hathaway executed a confidentiality
agreement with Garan. During the afternoon of June 18, 2002, Seymour
Lichtenstein, Garan's chairman and chief executive officer, Jerald Kamiel,
president and chief operating officer, and William J. Wilson, vice president -
finance and administration, met in Omaha, Nebraska, with Mr. Buffett to
discuss the terms of a potential transaction. Mr. Buffett reiterated that he
was only interested in pursuing a transaction if existing management agreed to
remain with Garan and continue to run Garan, and that he expected that the
existing employment agreements Garan had entered into with several members of
senior management would be terminated in connection with the transaction. Mr.
Buffett agreed that any change-of-control payments that would be due under
those employment agreements would be paid out in connection with the
transaction. Garan's senior management agreed in principle to recommend the
proposed transaction to the other members of its board of directors, subject
to the negotiation of definitive documentation.

         On June 20, 2002, Berkshire Hathaway's lawyers delivered a draft
merger agreement and stockholders agreement to Garan and its lawyers. Garan's
lawyers prepared drafts of the amendments to the employment agreements of four
senior Garan executives that would, among other things, terminate those
employment agreements upon the closing of the transaction and provide cash
retention payments to those executives in lieu of any change-of-control
payments they otherwise would have been entitled to receive if they terminated
their employment following consummation of the merger. An amendment to Garan's
rights agreement was also prepared for the purpose of excepting the
transaction from the rights agreement. The terms of these various agreements
were negotiated over the course of the next twelve days.

         On July 1, 2002, Garan convened a special meeting of the non-employee
members of Garan's board of directors to update them regarding the proposed
transaction and the discussions with Berkshire Hathaway to date.
Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Garan's lawyers (including Tannenbaum
Dubin & Robinson, LLP, general counsel to Garan, Hunton & Williams, Virginia
counsel to Garan, and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, special counsel to Garan)
were present and led the discussion. Goldman Sachs advised the non-employee
directors of the progress of negotiations and the process by which Berkshire
Hathaway was approached regarding a potential transaction. Goldman Sachs also
discussed with the non-employee directors other strategic options available to
Garan. The non-employee directors discussed with Goldman Sachs the likelihood
that other likely potential acquirors would be interested in making a superior
offer to acquire or merge with Garan. The non-employee directors asked
numerous questions relating to the process by which Berkshire Hathaway was
approached and the possibility that any other potential acquirors could
present Garan with an alternative transaction following the announcement of a
transaction with Berkshire Hathaway.

         In the early afternoon on July 2, 2002, the non-employee members of
the board of directors again met with Garan's lawyers. After discussion and
questions, the non-employee members of the board of directors determined that
they were inclined to support approval of the transaction, subject to the
discussion at the upcoming full board meeting.

         Later in the afternoon of July 2, 2002, Garan convened a special
meeting of its board of directors to consider approval of the acquisition of
Garan by Berkshire Hathaway for $60.00 in cash per share. Garan's lawyers and
Goldman Sachs were present. Garan's board of directors was advised of events
relating to the transaction and the status of meetings of the non-employee
directors of Garan. Garan's lawyers advised Garan's board of directors of its
legal duties in connection with the proposed transaction and reviewed with the
board of directors the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, the
stockholders agreement, the amendments to the employment agreements and the
amendment to Garan's rights agreement. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then
reviewed with Garan's board of directors Goldman Sachs' financial analyses
with respect to the proposed transaction. Following this presentation, Goldman
Sachs orally delivered its opinion to the board of directors of Garan, which
was subsequently confirmed in writing as of July 2, 2002, to the effect that,
based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its
opinion, as of July 2, 2002, the $60.00 in cash per share to be received by
the holders of Garan common stock pursuant to the merger agreement is fair,
from a financial point of view, to those holders. After extensive discussion
and deliberation and based on the factors described below, Garan's board of
directors unanimously determined that the merger agreement, the stockholders
agreement, the merger and the transactions contemplated thereby are fair to
and in the best interests of Garan and its shareholders, approved and declared
advisable the merger agreement and resolved to recommend that the Garan
shareholders vote to approve the merger agreement.

         Following the special meeting of Garan's board of directors, the
merger agreement, the stockholders agreement, the amendments to the employment
agreements and the rights agreement amendment were executed, and Garan and
Berkshire Hathaway issued a joint press release publicly announcing the
execution of the merger agreement and other agreements.

Reasons for the Merger

         In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and to
recommend that our shareholders approve the merger agreement, our board of
directors consulted with management and Goldman Sachs and Garan's lawyers. Our
board of directors considered a number of factors, including, without
limitation, the following:

          1. the current and historical market prices of our common stock
relative to the merger consideration, and the fact that the $60.00 per share
merger consideration represented a 13% premium over the average closing price
of our common stock over the 20 trading days prior to July 2, 2002 and a 37%
premium over the average closing price per share over the one year prior to
July 2, 2002;

          2. the fact that the merger consideration is all cash, which
provides certainty of value to holders of our common stock compared to a
transaction in which shareholders would receive stock or other securities;

          3. the fact that Berkshire Hathaway has the financial capability to
consummate the merger expeditiously;

          4. the potential shareholder value that could be expected to be
generated from the other strategic options available to us, including (a)
remaining independent and continuing to implement our strategy and (b)
pursuing other strategic alternatives, as well as the risks and uncertainties
associated with those alternatives;

          5. the financial presentation performed by Goldman Sachs on July 2,
2002 and the written opinion of Goldman Sachs delivered on July 2, 2002 to our
board of directors to the effect that, based upon and subject to the factors
and assumptions set forth in that opinion, as of July 2, 2002, the $60.00 per
share in cash to be received by holders of our common stock pursuant to the
merger agreement is fair from a financial point of view to those holders;

          6. discussions by our management regarding the business strategy,
strategic options and prospects of Garan (as well as the risks involved in
achieving these prospects), the nature of the apparel industry in which we
compete, and current industry, economic and market conditions, both on an
historical and on a prospective basis;

          7. that Garan will no longer exist as an independent company and its
shareholders will no longer participate in the growth of Garan or the pursuit
of its stand-alone business plan;

          8. the terms of the merger agreement, as reviewed by our board of
directors with our lawyers, including:

               o    the absence of a financing condition or other unusual
                    conditions to the merger; and

               o    our ability to (a) furnish information to and conduct
                    negotiations with a third party with regard to a superior
                    acquisition proposal until August 7, 2002, and (b)
                    terminate the merger agreement and enter into an agreement
                    relating to a superior proposal under certain
                    circumstances, in each case as more fully described under
                    "The Merger Agreement -- No Solicitation of Other Offers";

          9. the fact that under the terms of the merger agreement, we cannot
solicit other proposals and must pay to Berkshire Hathaway a termination fee
and expenses if we terminate the merger agreement under certain circumstances,
which may deter others from proposing an alterative transaction that may be
more advantageous to our shareholders; and

          10. the fact that gains from an all-cash transaction would be
taxable to our U.S. shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

         During its consideration of the transaction with Berkshire Hathaway
described above, our board of directors was also aware that some of our
directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are
different than or in addition to those of our shareholders generally,
described under "The Merger -- Interests of Directors and Executive Officers
in the Merger."

         This discussion of the information and factors considered and given
weight by our board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but is
believed to address the material information and factors considered by our
board of directors. In view of the number and variety of these factors, our
board of directors did not find it practicable to make specific assessments
of, or otherwise assign relative weights to, the specific factors and analyses
considered in reaching its determination. The determination to approve the
merger agreement was made after consideration of all of the factors and
analyses as a whole. In addition, individual members of our board of directors
may have given different weights to different factors.

Opinion of Garan's Financial Advisor

         Goldman Sachs delivered its written opinion to Garan's board of
directors to the effect that, as of July 2, 2002, and based upon and subject
to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $60.00 per share in cash
to be received by the holders of Garan common stock in the merger is fair from
a financial point of view to such holders.

         The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated July 2,
2002, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the
opinion, is attached as Annex B. Goldman Sachs provided its opinion for the
information and assistance of Garan's board of directors in connection with
its consideration of the merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion does not constitute
a recommendation as to how any holder of Garan common stock should vote with
respect to the merger. You are urged to read the opinion in its entirety.

         In connection with rendering the opinion described above and
performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs, among other things:

          o    reviewed the merger agreement;

          o    reviewed Annual Reports to Stockholders and Annual Reports on
               Form 10-K of Garan for the five years ended September 30, 2001;

          o    reviewed certain interim reports to shareholders and Quarterly
               Reports on Form 10-Q of Garan;

          o    reviewed certain other communications from Garan to its
               shareholders;

          o    reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for
               Garan prepared by its management;

          o    held discussions with members of the senior management of Garan
               regarding the past and current business operations, financial
               condition and future prospects of Garan;

          o    reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the
               Garan's common stock;

          o    compared certain financial and stock market information for
               Garan with similar information for certain other companies the
               securities of which are publicly traded; and

          o    reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business
               combinations in the apparel industry specifically and in other
               industries generally and performed such other studies and
               analyses as it considered appropriate.

         Goldman Sachs relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial, accounting and other information discussed with or reviewed by it
and assumed such accuracy and completeness for purposes of rendering its
opinion. In addition, Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or
appraisal of the assets and liabilities of Garan or any of its subsidiaries
and Goldman Sachs was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal.

         The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by
Goldman Sachs in connection with rendering the opinion described above. The
following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of
the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs. The order of analyses described, and
the results of those analyses, do not represent relative importance or weight
given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the
financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order
to understand such analyses, the tables must be read together with the full
text of each summary. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative
information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market
data as it existed on or before July 2, 2002 and is not necessarily indicative
of current market conditions.

         Stock Price and Trading History. Goldman Sachs reviewed the
historical prices of Garan common stock from July 2, 2001 to July 1, 2002,
both separately and in relation to Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Goldman Sachs also
reviewed the volume of shares of Garan common stock traded at various price
ranges in various periods over the same approximate timeframe.

         Analysis of Transaction Price. Using the closing price of Garan
common stock on July 1, 2002, Goldman Sachs analyzed the $60.00 in cash to be
paid for each share of Garan common stock to derive premiums over the latest
twelve months high, median, mean and low closing prices, and the closing
prices on the last trading day one month, three months, six months, one year,
three years and five years prior to July 1, 2002, as well as the July 1, 2002,
closing price for the Garan common stock. The results of this analysis are set
forth below.

          5 years (7/1/97)................................        194%

         In addition, Goldman Sachs reviewed certain implied multiples for the
merger, using the transaction price of $60.00 in cash per share of Garan
common stock. The multiples reviewed included: enterprise value as a multiple
of sales; enterprise value as a multiple of earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, commonly referred to as EBITDA; enterprise
value as a multiple of earnings before interest and taxes, commonly referred
to as EBIT; and equity consideration (diluted) as a multiple of net income.
This analysis was based on estimates prepared by the management of Garan. The
results of this analysis are set forth below:

The historical financial data used from the latest publicly available
financial statements for each of the selected companies and the market data
and earnings estimates were as of July 1, 2002. Projected EBITDA for 2002 was
based on equity research analysts' estimates. Projected earnings per share and
five year earnings per share compounded annual growth rates for the selected
companies were based on analysts' estimates from the Institutional Brokerage
Estimate System, or I/B/E/S, a data service that compiles estimates of
securities research analysts, as of July 1, 2002. Projected EBITDA, earnings
per share and five year earnings per share compounded annual growth rate for
Garan were based on estimates prepared by the management of Garan.

         Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Goldman Sachs performed a discounted
cash flow analysis to determine a range of implied present values per share of
Garan common stock. All cash flows were discounted to the end of June 2002 and
terminal values were based upon estimated 2006 EBITDA multiples. In performing
this analysis, Goldman Sachs used projections supplied by the management of
Garan. Using discount rates ranging from 10% to 18%, and terminal EBITDA
multiples ranging from 4.0x to 5.0x, this analysis resulted in a range of
implied present values of $56.65 to $77.55 per share of Garan common stock.

         Using the same set of projections, Goldman Sachs also performed a
sensitivity analysis to illustrate the effect of increases or decreases in
sales growth and EBIT margin. The analysis was based on a 14% discount rate
and a terminal EBITDA multiple of 4.5x, and used a range of changes in sales
growth of -6.0% to 6.0% and a range of changes in EBIT margin from -5.0% to
5.0%. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of $44.14 to
$97.63 per share of Garan common stock.

         The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not
necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting
portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without
considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the
processes underlying Goldman Sachs' opinion. In arriving at its fairness
determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and
did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered
by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the
basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the
results of all its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above
analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Garan, Berkshire Hathaway
or the merger.

         Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses solely for purposes of Goldman
Sachs' providing its opinion to the Garan board of directors. The analyses do
not purport to be appraisals, nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at
which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon
forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future
results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by
these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty,
being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties
or their respective advisors, none of Garan, Berkshire Hathaway, Goldman Sachs
or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are different
from those forecast.

         As described above, Goldman Sachs' opinion to Garan's board of
directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Garan board
of directors in making its determination to approve the merger agreement. The
foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the
analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion
and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of
Goldman Sachs attached as Annex B.

         Goldman Sachs, as part of its investment banking business, is
continually engaged in performing financial analyses with respect to
businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions,
negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions of
listed and unlisted securities and private placements as well as for estate,
corporate and other purposes. Goldman Sachs is familiar with Garan having
acted as its financial advisor in connection with, and having participated in
certain of the negotiations leading to, the merger agreement. The Garan board
of directors selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an
internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial
experience in transactions similar to the merger.

          Goldman Sachs has also provided certain investment banking services
to Berkshire Hathaway or its subsidiaries from time to time, including having
acted as sole bookrunner and manager in the issuance of $400 million of SQUARZ
(a unit security) of Berkshire Hathaway in May 2002, and may provide
investment banking services to Berkshire Hathaway or its subsidiaries in the
future. In addition, Goldman Sachs has acted as counterparty to Berkshire
Hathaway in other banking-related activities in the ordinary course of Goldman
Sachs' business and may do so in the future. Goldman Sachs provides a full
range of financial advisory and securities services and, in the course of its
normal trading activities, may from time to time effect transactions and hold
positions in securities, including derivative securities, of Garan or
Berkshire Hathaway for its own account and for the accounts of customers.

         Pursuant to a letter agreement dated April 3, 2002, Garan engaged
Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with the
contemplated merger. Pursuant to the terms of this engagement letter, Garan
has agreed to pay Goldman Sachs a customary transaction fee, a portion of
which was payable upon announcement of the transaction and the substantial
portion of which will be paid upon consummation of the merger. In addition,
Garan has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, including attorneys' fees, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs against
certain liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal
securities laws.

Antitrust Approvals

         Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder by the FTC,
the merger may not be completed until we and Berkshire Hathaway file a
notification and report form under the HSR Act and the applicable waiting
period has expired or been terminated. We expect to file notification and
report forms under the HSR Act with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice in July 2002, and that the waiting period under the HSR
Act with respect to the merger will expire, or the FTC and the Antitrust
Division will grant early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act,
before the effective time of the merger. At any time before or after
completion of the merger, notwithstanding whether early termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act has been granted, the Antitrust Division or
the FTC could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary
or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the
completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of Garan
or Berkshire Hathaway. At any time before or after the completion of the
merger, and notwithstanding whether early termination of the waiting period
under the HSR Act has been granted, any state could take such action under the
antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such
action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking
divestiture of substantial assets of Garan or Berkshire Hathaway. Private
parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under
certain circumstances.

         While there can be no assurance that the merger will not be
challenged by a governmental authority or private party on antitrust grounds,
we and Berkshire Hathaway believe that the merger can be effected in
compliance with federal and state antitrust laws.

Financing of the Merger

         Berkshire Hathaway has informed us that it estimates that
approximately $275 million will be required to complete the purchase of shares
of our common stock and options pursuant to the merger and pay its related
fees and expenses. Berkshire Hathaway expects to fund this amount through
internally available funds. The merger is not conditioned on any financing
arrangements.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger to Our Shareholders

         The following is a summary of United States federal income tax
consequences of the merger to shareholders whose shares of our common stock
are converted into the right to receive cash under the merger. The discussion
is for general information only and does not purport to consider all aspects
of United States federal income taxation that might be relevant to our
shareholders. The discussion is based on current law which is subject to
change, possibly with retroactive effect. The discussion applies only to
shareholders who hold shares of our common stock as capital assets, and may
not apply to shares of our common stock received in connection with the
exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation, or to certain
types of shareholders (such as insurance companies, banks, tax-exempt
organizations, financial institutions and broker-dealers) who may be subject
to special rules. This discussion does not discuss the tax consequences to any
shareholder who, for United States federal income tax purposes, is a
non-resident alien individual, foreign corporation, foreign partnership or
foreign estate or trust, and does not address any aspect of state, local or
foreign tax laws.

         The receipt of cash for shares of our common stock in the merger will
be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes. In
general, a shareholder who surrenders shares of our common stock for cash in
the merger will recognize capital gain or loss for United States federal
income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of
cash received and the shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the shares of our
common stock surrendered. Gain or loss will be determined separately for each
block of shares (i.e., shares acquired at the same cost in a single
transaction) surrendered for cash pursuant to the merger. Such gain or loss
will be long-term capital gain or loss provided that a shareholder's holding
period for such shares is more than 12 months at the time of the consummation
of the merger. Long-term capital gains of individuals are eligible for reduced
rates of taxation. There are limitations on the deductibility of capital
losses.

         Backup withholding will apply to all cash payments to which a holder
of shares or other payee is entitled pursuant to the merger agreement, unless
the shareholder or other payee provides a taxpayer identification number
(social security number, in the case of individuals, or employer
identification number, in the case of other shareholders), certifies that such
number is correct, and otherwise complies with the backup withholding tax
rules. Each of our shareholders and, if applicable, each other payee, should
complete and sign the Substitute Form W-9 included as part of the letter of
transmittal and return it to the paying agent, in order to provide the
information and certification necessary to avoid backup withholding tax,
unless an exemption applies and is established in a manner satisfactory to the
paying agent.

         Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld
under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit
against your United States federal income tax liability provided the required
information is furnished to the IRS.

         The United States federal income tax consequences set forth above are
for general information purposes only and are not intended to constitute a
complete description of all tax consequences relating to the merger. Because
individual circumstances may differ, each shareholder should consult the
shareholder's tax advisor regarding the applicability of the rules discussed
above to the shareholder and the particular tax effects to the shareholder of
the merger, including the application of state, local and foreign tax laws.

Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

         Members of our board of directors and our executive officers have
various interests in the merger described in this section that may be in
addition to, or different from, the interests of our shareholders generally.
The members of our board of directors were aware of these interests and
considered them at the time they approved the merger agreement. You should
keep this in mind when considering the recommendation of our board of
directors for the proposal to approve the merger agreement.

      Stock Options.

         All outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock are
currently vested and exercisable. The merger agreement provides that, for each
share covered by an outstanding option at the time of the merger, the holder
of the option will receive a cash payment. The amount of this payment will
equal the excess of the merger consideration of $60.00 in cash per share of
our common stock over the per share exercise price of the option,

reduced by applicable withholding taxes. Our directors and executive officers
do not hold any options to purchase our common stock.

      Executive Employment Agreements.

         Jerald Kamiel, Seymour Lichtenstein and William J. Wilson, all
executive officers and directors of Garan, and Rodney Faver, an employee and
director of Garan, are parties to employment agreements with Garan, which
agreements were amended and restated as of May 1, 2001. The term of the
employment agreements with Messrs. Faver, Lichtenstein and Wilson expire on
September 30, 2003. The term of Mr. Kamiel's employment agreement expires on
September 30, 2004, subject to extension each April 1 and October 1 for six
months unless either party notifies the other of his or its intention to
terminate the employment agreement at the end of the then existing term. Mr.
Lichtenstein's employment agreement provides for a five-year consulting term
after the expiration of his full time employment for a consulting fee equal to
66 2/3% of the greater of his last annual total compensation as a full time
employee and the total of his last base salary as a full time employee plus
the average of his last two annual bonuses. The employment agreements provide
that each individual shall be compensated at a rate at least equal to his base
salary for fiscal 2001 and provide for a death benefit equal to 150% of his
annual total compensation at the date of his death. The employment agreements
also require Garan to provide each of those individuals with specified life
insurance benefits. In addition to delineating the duties and responsibilities
of the individual, each employment agreement provides that if Garan terminates
the individual's employment and, as to Mr. Lichtenstein, his consulting
arrangement, other than for cause as defined in his employment agreement, as
to Messrs. Faver and Wilson, if his employment term ends and is not renewed,
and, as to Mr. Kamiel, if his employment term is not extended, (a) the
individual shall be entitled to receive a multiple of his annual total
compensation at the time of termination, (b) the individual shall continue to
receive certain fringe benefits for a period specified in his employment
agreement, and (c) Mr. Kamiel can terminate his employment. The employment
agreements also provide that each individual has the right to terminate his
employment within six months of a change in control of Garan, as that term is
defined in his employment agreement, and, as to Mr. Kamiel, if he is not made
chief executive officer of Garan within six months after a vacancy occurs, and
receive a lump sum payment equal to 2.99 times the average of the three
highest of his annual total compensation from Garan over the previous five
fiscal years plus a gross-up payment for any excise taxes. The employment
agreements provide that if an individual's employment is terminated by Garan,
Garan has the option to invoke certain covenants of non-competition.

         In connection with, and as a condition to Berkshire Hathaway's
willingness to enter into, the merger agreement, each of these employment
agreements was amended on July 2, 2002, which amendment becomes effective only
upon completion of the merger. The amended employment agreements provide that
promptly following the completion of the merger, Garan will pay Mr.
Lichtenstein a cash retention payment of $4,300,617, Mr. Kamiel a cash
retention payment of $3,568,067, Mr. Wilson a cash retention payment of
$2,033,200 and Mr. Faver a cash retention payment of $1,325,567. In each case
if any payment to the executive under the employment or any other agreement
with or plan of Garan subjects the executive to the excise tax described under
Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the executive
will be entitled to a gross-up payment in respect of any excise tax liability.
The amount of each respective cash retention payment equals the amount each of
these respective executives otherwise would have been entitled to receive
under the employment agreements in the form of change-of-control payments if
the executive terminated his employment following the merger. After completion
of the merger and the payment of these cash retention payments, each
employment agreement will terminate pursuant to these amendments and each
executive will continue employment with Garan on an at-will basis in the same
position held by the executive immediately prior to the completion of the
merger. Each amended employment agreement provides that the executive will
receive cash compensation and cash bonuses consistent with Garan's past
practice with respect to that executive, except that, in general, the
executive will not be entitled to receive any severance payment upon, or
medical health insurance coverage after, the termination of his employment
with Garan. Each amended employment agreement also requires Garan to provide
the executive with specified life insurance benefits. If an executive's
employment terminates with Garan for any reason other than for cause in a year
in which Garan pays a discretionary bonus to any other senior executive, the
executive will receive a fractional bonus for that year based upon his last
annual bonus multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
months in the fiscal year the termination of the executive's employment
occurred to and including the month of the date of termination and the
denominator of which is 12.

      Director Compensation.

         Stephen J. Donohue, Richard A. Lichtenstein, Frank Martucci, and
Perry Mullen each receives annual compensation of $12,500 and reimbursement of
related travel expenses for services as a director of Garan. Marvin S.
Robinson, a member of Tannenbaum Dubin & Robinson, LLP, which serves as legal
counsel to Garan, is paid for his services as a director at his usual billing
rates for legal services. The directors who are full time employees of Garan
(Rodney Faver, Jerald Kamiel, Seymour Lichtenstein and William J. Wilson) do
not receive separate compensation for their services as directors. All
directors and officers of Garan have the opportunity to receive without cost
long-term care and travel insurance coverage.

      Discretionary Bonus Program.

         The merger agreement provides that Berkshire Hathaway or the
surviving corporation will pay discretionary bonuses to Garan officers and
employees for the fiscal year in which the merger is completed, consistent
with Garan's past practice with respect to discretionary bonuses.

      Indemnification.

         The merger agreement provides that, for six years after the merger,
the surviving corporation's articles of incorporation and by-laws will contain
the provisions with respect to indemnification, expense advancement and
exculpation as set forth in our current articles of incorporation and by-laws.
The merger agreement also requires Berkshire Hathaway and the surviving
corporation to indemnify and hold harmless any of our former or current
officers or directors against any losses in connection with any threatened or
actual action, suit, or proceeding, based in whole or in part on, or arising
in whole or in part out of, the fact that the person is or was our officer or
director, subject to certain limitations set forth in the merger agreement.

         It is expected that, following the merger, Garan will cease to carry
directors' and officers' liability insurance.

     Positions with Surviving Corporation.

         Upon completion of the merger, our current officers will be the
officers of, and the directors of Merger Sub will be the directors of, the
surviving corporation until their successors have been duly elected, appointed
or qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the articles of incorporation and by-laws of the surviving
corporation.

                             The Merger Agreement

         This section of the proxy statement describes the material provisions
of the merger agreement but does not purport to describe all of the terms of
the merger agreement. The following summary is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the complete text of the merger agreement, which is attached as
Annex A to this proxy statement and incorporated into this proxy statement by
reference. We urge you to read the full text of the merger agreement because
it is the legal document that governs the merger.

The Merger

     The merger agreement provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and into
Garan upon the terms, and subject to the conditions, of the merger agreement.
As the surviving corporation, we will survive the merger and continue to exist
as a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway. The merger will be
effective at the time the State Corporation Commission of the Commonwealth of
Virginia duly issues a certificate of merger (or at a later time, if agreed
upon by the parties and specified in the articles of merger we will file with
the Commission). We expect to complete the merger as promptly as practicable
after we receive shareholder approval and required regulatory approvals of the
merger.

         We or Berkshire Hathaway may terminate the merger agreement prior to
the completion of the merger in some circumstances, whether before or after
the approval of the merger agreement by shareholders. Additional details on
termination of the merger agreement are described in "The Merger Agreement --
Termination of the Merger Agreement."

Merger Consideration

         Each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately
before the merger (other than treasury shares and shares held by Berkshire
Hathaway or Merger Sub) will automatically be canceled and will cease to exist
and will be converted into the right to receive $60.00 in cash, without
interest. After the merger is effective, each holder of a certificate
representing any of these shares of our common stock will no longer have any
rights with respect to the shares, except for the right to receive the merger
consideration. Each share of our common stock held by us as treasury shares or
held by Berkshire Hathaway or Merger Sub at the time of the merger will be
canceled without any payment.

Directors and Officers

         Upon completion of the merger, the directors of Merger Sub will be
the directors of the surviving corporation and the officers of Garan at the
time immediately before the merger is completed will remain the officers of
the surviving corporation after the merger. All Garan officers will hold their
positions until their successors are duly elected, appointed or qualified or
until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal.

Treatment of Stock Options

         The merger agreement provides that, upon completion of the merger,
each option, with an exercise price of less than $60.00 per share, to purchase
shares of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the completion of
the merger will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to
the excess of $60.00 over the exercise price per share of the stock option
multiplied by the number of shares of common stock subject to the stock
option. All amounts payable are subject to applicable withholding taxes.

Payment for the Shares

         Before the merger, Berkshire Hathaway will designate a paying agent
reasonably acceptable to us to make payment of the merger consideration as
contemplated by the merger agreement. When and as needed, Berkshire Hathaway
will deposit in trust with the paying agent the funds appropriate to pay the
merger consideration to the shareholders on a timely basis.

         At the close of business on the day of the completion of the merger,
we will close our stock ledger. After that time, the surviving corporation
will not transfer common stock on its stock transfer books.

         As promptly as practicable after the completion of the merger, the
paying agent will send you a letter of transmittal and instructions advising
you how to surrender your certificates in exchange for the merger
consideration. The paying agent will promptly pay you your merger
consideration after you have (1) surrendered your certificates to the paying
agent and (2) provided to the paying agent any other items specified by the
letter of transmittal. Interest will not be paid or accrue in respect of cash
payments. The surviving corporation will reduce the amount of any merger
consideration paid to you by any applicable withholding taxes. You should not
forward your stock certificates to the paying agent without a letter of
transmittal, and you should not return your stock certificates with the
enclosed proxy.

         If the paying agent is to pay some or all of your merger
consideration to a person other than you, you must have your certificates
properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer, and you must pay
any transfer or other taxes payable by reason of the transfer or establish to
the surviving corporation's satisfaction that the taxes have been paid or are
not required to be paid.

         The transmittal instructions will tell you what to do if you have
lost your certificate, or if it has been stolen or destroyed. You will have to
provide an affidavit to that fact and, if required by the paying agent,
Berkshire Hathaway or the surviving corporation, post a bond in an amount that
the paying agent, Berkshire Hathaway or the surviving corporation, as the case
may be, reasonably directs as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against those parties in respect of the certificate.

each made representations and warranties relating to, among other things:

          o    corporate organization and existence;

Conduct of Business Pending the Merger

         With limited exceptions we agreed in the merger agreement that, until
the earlier of the completion of the merger or termination of the merger
agreement, we and each of our subsidiaries will:

          o    conduct our respective businesses in the usual, regular and
               ordinary course consistent with past practice; and

          o    use all reasonable efforts to preserve intact our business
               organization and the good will of those having business
               relationships with us and to retain the services of our present
               officers and key employees.

         We have also agreed that, until the earlier of the completion of the
merger or termination of the merger agreement, except as expressly
contemplated or permitted by the merger agreement, required by applicable law
or consented to in writing by Berkshire Hathaway, we will not, and will not
permit any of our subsidiaries to:

          o    issue, sell, grant, dispose of, pledge or otherwise encumber,
               or authorize or propose the issuance, sale, disposition or
               pledge or other encumbrance of (a) any additional shares of our
               capital stock or any securities or rights convertible into,
               exchangeable for, or evidencing the right to subscribe for any
               shares of our capital stock, or any rights, warrants, options,
               calls, commitments or any other agreements of any character to
               purchase or acquire any shares of our capital stock or any
               securities or rights convertible into, exchangeable for, or
               evidencing the right to subscribe for, any shares of our
               capital stock or any of our subsidiaries, or (b) any other
               securities in respect of, in lieu of, or in substitution for,
               any shares of our capital stock or any of our subsidiaries
               outstanding on the date of the merger agreement, other than
               pursuant to the exercise of any stock options for our capital
               stock outstanding as of the date of the merger agreement;

          o    redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire, or propose to redeem,
               purchase or otherwise acquire, any of our outstanding shares of
               capital stock or of the capital stock of any of our
               subsidiaries;

          o    split, combine, subdivide or reclassify any shares of our

               distribution, in respect of any shares of our capital stock or
               otherwise make any payments to our shareholders in their
               capacity as such, other than (a) dividends and distributions by
               a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Garan to its

               our capital stock, not in excess of $0.25 per share, for the
               quarter ended June 30, 2002, provided that we may accelerate
               our usual quarterly dividend record and payment dates such that
               those dates precede the date of completion of the merger;

          o    other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with
               past practice, incur any indebtedness for borrowed money or
               guarantee any such indebtedness except for amounts not in
               excess of $1 million in the aggregate;

          o    sell, transfer, mortgage, encumber or otherwise dispose of any

               $10 million to any individual, corporation or other entity
               other than a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary, or
               cancel, release or assign any indebtedness in excess of $1
               million to any such person or any claims held by any such
               person, in each case that is material to Garan and our
               subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except (a) in the ordinary
               course of business consistent with past practice, or (b)
               pursuant to contracts or agreements in force on the date of the
               merger agreement;

          o    make any material acquisition or investment in a business
               either by purchase of stock or securities, merger or
               consolidation, contributions to capital, loans, advances,
               property transfers, or purchases of any property or assets of
               any other individual, corporation or other entity other than a
               wholly owned subsidiary of Garan;

          o    increase in any manner the compensation of any of our
               directors, officers or employees or enter into, establish,
               amend or terminate any employee benefit plan, for or in respect
               of, any shareholder, officer, director, other employee, agent,
               consultant or affiliate other than (a) as required pursuant to
               the terms of agreements in effect on the date of the merger
               agreement, and (b) increases in salaries, wages and benefits of
               our directors, officers, or employees made in the ordinary
               course of business and in a manner consistent with past
               practice;

          o    amend our articles of incorporation or by-laws;

          o    waive or fail to enforce any provision of any confidentiality
               or standstill agreement to which we are a party (including the
               Agreement dated as of July 27, 2001, between Garan and Private
               Capital Management, L.P. and the Standstill Agreement dated as
               of November 7, 2001, among Garan, Royce & Associates, Inc.,
               Brandywine Asset Management, Inc., and Legg Mason, Inc.);
               however, we shall not be prohibited from consenting to a
               request from one or more of the parties to those agreements
               that it be permitted to make a proposal to acquire Garan on
               terms superior to those made by Berkshire Hathaway as
               contemplated by the merger agreement or a proposal that may
               reasonably be expected to lead to a proposal to acquire Garan
               on terms superior to those made by Berkshire Hathaway as
               contemplated in the merger agreement; or

          o    make any commitment to take any of the above actions.

Efforts to Complete the Merger

         Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the merger
agreement, each of the parties to the merger agreement has agreed to use all
reasonable efforts to (a) take, or cause to be taken, all actions that are
necessary, proper or advisable to achieve the completion of the merger as
promptly as practicable, including the taking of all acts necessary to satisfy
the conditions necessary for the completion of the merger, (b) obtain any
consent, authorization or order from or approval of, or any exemption by, any
governmental entity and any other third party required to be obtained by the
merger agreement, (c) lift or rescind any injunction or restraining or other
order adversely affecting the ability of the parties to complete the merger
and (d) defend any litigation seeking to enjoin, prevent or delay the
completion of the merger or seeking material damages.

          Conditions to Each Party's Obligations. Each party's obligation to
complete the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following
conditions:

          o    the merger agreement must have been approved by the affirmative
               vote of the holders of more than two-thirds of all outstanding
               Garan shares entitled to vote; and

          o    no statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order or injunction
               shall have been promulgated, entered, enforced, enacted, or
               issued or be applicable to the merger by any governmental
               entity which prohibits, restrains, or makes illegal the
               completion of the merger; provided that each party will use all
               reasonable efforts to cause any such statute, rule, regulation,
               judgment, order or injunction to be vacated or lifted or any
               such action or proceeding to be dismissed; and all domestic
               governmental

               consents, orders, approvals and waiting periods
               required for the completion of the merger shall have been
               obtained and shall be in effect, or with respect to waiting
               periods shall have expired or been terminated, at the time the
               merger becomes effective.

         Conditions to Berkshire Hathaway's and Merger Sub's Obligations. The
obligation of Berkshire Hathaway and Merger Sub to complete the merger is
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the further conditions that (a) our
representations and warranties must be true and correct in all material
respects as of the closing date, except representations and warranties that
speak as of an earlier date, and in the case of the failure of any
representation or warranty, for changes specifically permitted by the merger
agreement and (b) we must have complied with all of our material obligations
and covenants under the merger agreement on or prior to the closing date.

         Conditions to Garan's Obligations. Our obligation to complete the
merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the further conditions that
(a) the representations and warranties of Berkshire Hathaway and Merger Sub
must be true and correct in all material respects as of the closing date,
except representations and warranties that speak as of an earlier date, and in
the case of the failure of any representation or warranty, for changes
specifically permitted by the merger agreement and (b) Berkshire Hathaway and
Merger Sub must have complied with all of their material obligations and
covenants under the merger agreement on or prior to the closing date.

No Solicitation of Other Offers

         The merger agreement provides that neither we nor our representatives
will:

          o    solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or take any action
               intended to facilitate, the submission of any takeover
               proposal, as described below; or

          o    participate in any discussions or negotiations concerning a
               takeover proposal.

         We may, however, in response to an unsolicited bona fide written
takeover proposal that our board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with our financial advisor and outside counsel, is a superior
proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal, as
described below, request information from the party making that takeover
proposal for the purpose of our board of directors informing itself about the
takeover proposal and the party making it; and, at any time prior to August 7,
2002:

          o    furnish information regarding Garan to the person making that
               takeover proposal pursuant to a confidentiality agreement that
               is no less favorable to us than the confidentiality agreement
               we entered with Berkshire Hathaway and provided that we advise
               Berkshire Hathaway of the nonpublic information we deliver to
               the third party making the takeover proposal; and

          o    participate in negotiations with the party making that takeover
               proposal regarding that takeover proposal.

         In addition, we have agreed that neither our board of directors nor
any of its committees will:

          o    withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify,
               in a manner adverse to Berkshire Hathaway, the approval of,
               determination of advisability of, or recommendation with
               respect to, the merger agreement or the merger, or

          o    approve, determine to be advisable, or recommend, or propose
               publicly to approve, determine to be advisable, or recommend,
               the approval of any takeover proposal, or

          o    cause us to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
               principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement
               related to any takeover proposal;

provided that our board of directors may, if it determines in good faith, in
response to a superior proposal that was unsolicited and made after the date
of the merger agreement in circumstances not otherwise involving a breach of
the merger agreement, after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to do any of the above would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
to our shareholders, and if we have given Berkshire Hathaway two business
days' written notice of the receipt of the superior proposal, the material
terms and conditions of the superior

proposal and the identity of the person making the superior proposal, (a)
withdraw or modify its approval, determination of advisability, or
recommendation of the merger agreement or the merger or (b) determine to be
advisable or recommend a superior proposal.

         We also have agreed to cease any discussion or negotiations with any
third parties conducted on or before the date of the merger agreement with a
view toward a takeover proposal, and to notify Berkshire Hathaway of any
takeover proposal, its material terms and conditions including the identity of
the party making the takeover proposal and to keep Berkshire Hathaway informed
of the status of that takeover proposal.

         Nothing described above limits our ability to take and disclose
actions to comply with certain rules under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, or make any disclosure to our shareholders.

         For purposes of the merger agreement, the term "takeover proposal"
means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person relating to:

          o    any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 25% or more
               of the assets of Garan or our subsidiaries or 25% or more of
               any class of equity securities of Garan or any of our
               subsidiaries;

          o    any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
               result in any person beneficially owning 25% or more of any
               class of equity securities of Garan or any of our subsidiaries;
               or

          o    any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
               combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
               similar transaction involving us or any of our subsidiaries,

in each case other than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

         For purposes of the merger agreement, the term "superior proposal"
means:

          o    any bona fide written offer from any person for a direct or
               indirect acquisition or purchase of 50% or more of the assets
               of Garan or any of our subsidiaries taken as a whole, or 50% or
               more of any class of equity securities of Garan or any of our
               subsidiaries;

          o    any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
               result in any person beneficially owning 50% or more of any
               class of equity securities of Garan or any of our subsidiaries;
               or

          o    any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
               combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
               similar transaction involving us or any of our subsidiaries,

in each case other than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
which provides for consideration on a per share basis to our shareholders with
a value that our board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel, to be more
favorable from a financial point of view to our shareholders than the merger
consideration. Any superior proposal is a takeover proposal.

Termination of the Merger Agreement

         The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
completion of the merger, whether before or after shareholder approval has
been obtained:

          o    by mutual written consent of Garan and Berkshire Hathaway;

          o    by either Garan or Berkshire Hathaway, if:

               o    any final, non-appealable governmental order, decree,
                    ruling or other action prohibits the completion of the
                    merger, except that the party seeking to terminate shall
                    have used all reasonable efforts to challenge that order,
                    decree, ruling or other action; or

               o    the merger is not completed on or before the outside date
                    of November 15, 2002, except that:

                    (a)  this right to terminate will not be available to any
                         party whose failure to comply with the merger
                         agreement results in the failure of the merger to be
                         completed by that date; and

                    (b)  the outside date will be extended day-by-day for each
                         day any party is subject to a nonfinal order, decree,
                         ruling or action restraining, enjoining or otherwise
                         prohibiting the consummation of the merger, but that
                         outside date shall not be extended beyond December
                         15, 2002; or

          o    by Berkshire Hathaway if:

               o    our shareholders, at the special meeting or at any
                    adjournment thereof, fail to approve the merger agreement;

               o    our board of directors withdraws or modifies in a manner
                    adverse to Berkshire Hathaway its recommendation for
                    approval of the merger agreement or recommends to our
                    shareholders any takeover proposal by a third party; or

               o    we have breached any of our representations or warranties
                    or any of our material obligations under the merger
                    agreement where that breach cannot be cured within 30
                    business days after Berkshire Hathaway delivers written
                    notice of the breach, other than any failures or breaches
                    that individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably
                    be expected to have a material adverse effect on us; or

          o    by Garan if:

               o    our shareholders, at the special meeting or at any
                    adjournment thereof, fail to approve the merger agreement;

               o    our board of directors withdraws or modifies its approval,
                    determination of advisability, or recommendation of the
                    merger agreement or determines to be advisable or
                    recommends a superior proposal concurrently with that
                    termination, provided that we have complied with the
                    provisions of the merger agreement described above under
                    "The Merger Agreement -- No Solicitation of Other Offers,"
                    and provided that we have paid to Berkshire Hathaway the
                    $8 million termination fee and their out-of-pocket
                    expenses not to exceed $1 million as described below; or

               o    Berkshire Hathaway has breached any of its representations
                    or warranties or any of its material obligations under the
                    merger agreement where that breach cannot be cured within
                    30 business days after we deliver written notice of the
                    breach, other than any failures or breaches that
                    individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be
                    expected to have a material adverse effect on Berkshire
                    Hathaway.

Termination Fees

         We must pay to Berkshire Hathaway a termination fee of $8 million
plus all of Berkshire Hathaway's and Merger Sub's reasonably documented
out-of-pocket fees and expenses not to exceed $1 million if the merger
agreement is terminated under any of the following circumstances:

               o    either party terminates because:

                    o    the merger has not been completed by the outside date
                         as described above under "The Merger Agreement --
                         Termination of the Merger Agreement"; or

                    o    the shareholder approval necessary to complete the
                         merger is not obtained at the special meeting of
                         shareholders or any adjournment thereof, as described
                         above under "The Merger Agreement -- Termination of
                         the Merger Agreement";

                    and

                    o    a takeover proposal had been communicated or
                         disseminated prior to the termination;

                    and

                    o    that takeover proposal is consummated within one year
                         of the termination; or

               o    we terminate because our board of directors withdraws or
                    modifies its approval, determination of advisability, or
                    recommendation of the merger agreement or determines to be
                    advisable, or recommends, a superior proposal, as
                    described above under "The Merger Agreement -- Termination
                    of the Merger Agreement"; or

               o    Berkshire Hathaway terminates because our board of
                    directors withdraws or modifies its approval,
                    determination of advisability, or recommendation of the
                    merger agreement or determines to be advisable, or
                    recommends, any takeover proposal, as described above
                    under "The Merger Agreement -- Termination of the Merger
                    Agreement."

Employee Benefits

         Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to honor and cause the surviving
corporation to honor all employee benefit plans that have been disclosed by
us. In addition, Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to maintain, for at least 24
months after the completion of the merger, compensation and benefits to
employees, former employees, directors or former directors of Garan and our
subsidiaries no less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation and
benefits provided to those individuals immediately prior to the completion of
the merger, provided that the surviving corporation will not be obligated to
provide, except as required by law, retiree medical health insurance benefits,
other than to Perry Mullen, one of our directors who is the only retiree
currently receiving retiree medical benefits.

         Berkshire Hathaway will, or will cause the surviving corporation to,
pay discretionary bonuses to our officers and employees in respect of the
fiscal year in which the merger is completed, consistent with our past
practices with respect to discretionary bonuses.

         Berkshire Hathaway will, or will cause the surviving corporation to,
honor existing employment agreements with Messrs. Lichtenstein, Kamiel, Wilson
and Faver, as those employment agreements have been amended as of the date of
the merger agreement. See "The Merger -- Interests of Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger--Executive Employment Agreements."

Amendment, Extension and Waiver

         The parties may amend the merger agreement at any time before
completion of the merger. All amendments to the merger agreement must be in
writing signed by us, Berkshire Hathaway and Merger Sub.

         At any time before the completion of the merger, each of the parties
to the merger agreement may, by written instrument:

          o    extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
               or other acts of the other parties;

          o    waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
               the other parties contained in the merger agreement or in any
               document delivered pursuant to the merger agreement; or

          o    waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
               contained in the merger agreement.

         However, after approval of the merger agreement by our shareholders,
no amendment or waiver may be made which by law requires further approval by
our shareholders, unless we obtain that further approval.

Amendment to Rights Agreement

         In accordance with the merger agreement, as of July 2, 2002, we
amended the amended and restated rights agreement, dated as of April 21, 1993,
as amended on October 1, 2001, between us and JPMorgan Chase Bank (successor
to Chemical Bank), as rights agent, to provide that none of the execution of
the merger agreement or the stockholders agreement, the consummation of the
merger or the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by those
agreements will cause the rights under the rights agreement to be adjusted or
become

exercisable. The amendment also provides that none of the merger, the
merger agreement or the stockholders agreement will cause Berkshire Hathaway
or Merger Sub or any of their affiliates or associates to become an "acquiring
person" under the rights agreement. In addition, the amendment amends the
rights agreement to provide that (1) a "stock acquisition date" will not be
deemed to occur as a result of the execution of the merger agreement or the
stockholders agreement, the consummation of the merger or the consummation of
the other transactions contemplated by those agreements; and (2) neither a
"triggering event" nor a "distribution date" will be deemed to occur as a
result of the execution of the merger agreement or the stockholders agreement,
the consummation of the merger or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by those agreements. In addition, pursuant to the rights
amendment, JPMorgan Chase Bank resigned as rights agent and Mellon Investor
Services LLC was appointed as its successor.

Stockholders Agreement

         A stockholders agreement has been entered into between Berkshire
Hathaway, Merger Sub and Seymour Lichtenstein, Jerald Kamiel, William J.
Wilson and Rodney Faver obligating those employee shareholders to vote their
shares, among other things, in favor of the merger and, if directed by
Berkshire Hathaway, against any competing takeover proposal (as defined in the
merger agreement) or other proposals that could adversely affect the
consummation of the merger. The shareholders that are party to the voting
agreement own 958,750 shares of our common stock representing approximately
21.0% of the total votes entitled to be cast at the special meeting. The
stockholders agreement will terminate upon the earlier to occur of (a) the
completion of the merger, (b) the termination of the merger agreement, (c) an
amendment of the merger agreement reducing the merger consideration or
changing the form of merger consideration to other than cash, and (d) December
31, 2002. However, in the event of a termination of the merger agreement
relating to a takeover proposal received or publicly disseminated after August
7, 2002, shares owned by Seymour Lichtenstein representing approximately 9.8%
of the outstanding shares of Garan will remain subject to the terms of the
voting agreement for a twelve-month period. See "The Merger Agreement --
Termination of the Merger Agreement." This description is qualified in its
entirety by the complete text of the stockholders agreement. The form of the
stockholders agreement is included as Exhibit A to the merger agreement, which
is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement. We urge you to read the full
text of the form of stockholders agreement.

(2)       Berkshire Hathaway, Merger Sub and Messrs. Seymour Lichtenstein,

          agreement pursuant to which those shareholders have agreed to vote
          their shares of Garan common stock in favor of the merger and

          with Securities and Exchange Commission guidance LMI is not deemed
          to be the beneficial owner of the Garan common stock owned by those
          entities. PCM, Royce, and Brandywine have each agreed not to acquire
          additional shares of common stock without the consent of Garan, and
          LMI has agreed to instruct all of its investment advisory
          subsidiaries other than Legg Mason Wood Walker, Incorporated to
          refrain from purchasing Garan common stock so long as all LMI
          subsidiaries, in the aggregate, own more than 20% of the outstanding
          shares of common stock.

(5)       David A. Dorsky, Noah P. Dorsky, and Karen A. Dorsky own

Other Matters for Action at the Special Meeting

         Pursuant to our by-laws, no other matters may be presented for action
at the special meeting other than those described in this proxy statement.
When considering a motion to adjourn the special meeting to another time
and/or place (including, without limitation, for the purpose of soliciting
additional proxies or allowing additional time for the satisfaction of
conditions to the merger), the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy and
acting by the authority in the proxy generally will have discretion to vote on
adjournment using their best judgment. However, the persons named in the
proxies will not use their discretionary authority to use proxies voting
against the merger agreement to vote in favor of adjournment or postponement
of the special meeting.

Shareholder Proposals

         Due to the contemplated consummation of the merger, we do not
currently expect to hold a 2003 annual meeting of shareholders because,
following the merger, we will not be a publicly held company. If the merger is
not consummated for any reason, under the rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, we must receive proposals of shareholders intended to be presented
at and included in the proxy statement for the 2003 annual meeting of
shareholders at our principal executive offices no later than September 30,
2002, subject to the following specific procedures.

         For nominations of directors or other business to be properly brought
before an annual meeting by a shareholder, our shareholders must comply with

               Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

         The Securities and Exchange Commission encourages companies to
disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a
company's future prospects and make informed investment decisions. These
statements may be made directly in this proxy statement referring to us, and
they may also be made a part of this proxy statement by reference to other
documents filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is
known as "incorporation by reference."

         Words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project,"
"intend," "plan," "believe," "target," "objective," "strategy," "goal" and
words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of
future operating or financial performance, or the acquisition of us by
Berkshire Hathaway, identify forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking
statements are based on the management's current views about future events and
are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking
statements. The following risks related to our business and the merger, among
others, could cause or contribute to actual results differing materially from

          o    dependence on relationship with Wal-Mart;

          o    attracting and retaining key employees;

          o    growing and improving operating efficiencies;

          o    changes in retail trends and consumer preferences;

          o    introduction of new products or pricing changes by our
               competitors or other competitive factors;

          o    seasonal fluctuations in the children's apparel market;

          o    loss of key members of our senior management team;

          o    various governmental regulations and environmental risks
               applicable to our business;

          o    financial strength of the retail industry, including, but not
               limited to, business conditions and the general economy,
               natural disasters, risk of non-payment of accounts receivable,
               the unanticipated loss of a major customer, our ability to
               correctly balance the level of our commitments with actual
               orders, risks associated with terrorist activities, as well as
               risks associated with foreign operations;

          o    the inability to ship our products within agreed timeframes due
               to unanticipated manufacturing and/or distribution system
               delays or the failure of our contractors to deliver products
               within scheduled timeframes;

          o    availability, terms and development of capital;

          o    business abilities and judgment of personnel;

          o    quality of management;

          o    general economic, business and financial market conditions;

          o    the ability to satisfy the conditions to closing set forth in
               the merger agreement; and

          o    other factors described in our filings with the SEC.

(the "Company").

          WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent, the Board of Directors of
Merger Sub, and the Board of Directors of the Company have approved, and
determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of their respective
companies and stockholders to consummate, the merger of Merger Sub with and
into the Company (the "Merger"), with the Company as the surviving corporation

October 1, 2001 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the "Rights
Agreement") between the Company and J.P. Morgan Chase (then Chemical Bank), as
rights agent, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(as defined in Section 1.2), other than shares described in Section 2.1(b),
will be converted into the right to receive $60.00 per Share (including
associated Rights) in cash (the "Merger Consideration"); and

          WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger; and

          WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and as a condition to Parent's and Merger Sub's willingness to enter
into this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have entered into a Stockholders

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective

corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, (b) the Company shall
be the successor or surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving

Company may agree) with the State Corporation Commission of the Commonwealth
of Virginia (the "Commission") as provided in the VSCA. The Merger shall
become effective on the date on which the certificate of merger has been duly
issued by the Commission or such later time as is agreed upon by the parties
and designated in the Articles of Merger as the effective time of the Merger,

in Article VI hereof (the "Closing Date"), at or directed from the offices of
Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP, 355 South Grand Avenue, Los Angeles, California
90071, unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto.

          Section 1.4. Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.
The directors of Merger Sub and the officers of the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the

and use its reasonable efforts (A) to obtain and furnish the information
required to be included by the federal securities laws (and the rules and
regulations thereunder) in the Proxy Statement (as hereinafter defined) and,

approvals of the Merger and this Agreement by its stockholders as soon as

                   (iii) include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of
the Board that stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the approval of the

authorizes such inclusion, which authorization the Company will request;

               (b) Parent shall provide the Company with the information

Statement. Parent shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares (if any)
then owned by it, Merger Sub or any of its other subsidiaries and affiliates in
favor of the approval of the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE II

                           CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

          Section 2.1. Conversion of Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of
any shares of Company Common Stock or of the common stock, no par value, of
Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock"):

                                     A-2

               (a) Merger Sub Common Stock. Each issued and outstanding share
of Merger Sub Common Stock shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, no par value, of
the Surviving Corporation.

               (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. All
shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock,
all shares of Company Common Stock owned by any subsidiary of the Company and
any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, in each case including associated Rights,
shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

               (c) Conversion of Shares. Each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock (including associated Rights), other than Shares to be
canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) hereof, shall be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash, without interest, payable
to the holder thereof upon surrender of the certificate formerly representing
such share of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 2.2 hereof.
All such shares of Company Common Stock (including associated Rights), when so
converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon
the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2 hereof,
without interest, and any dividends declared and unpaid as of the Effective
Time. Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to the
holders of certificates as of the Effective Time any unpaid dividends declared
in respect of the Company Common Stock with a record date prior to the
Effective Time and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

          Section 2.2. Exchange of Certificates.

               (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
designate a bank or trust company (the "Paying Agent") reasonably acceptable
to the Company to make the payments of the funds to which holders of shares of
Company Common Stock shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c) hereof.
When and as needed, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent such funds in
trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock for
exchange in accordance with Section 2.1, for timely payment hereunder. Such
funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; provided
that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States
of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Corporation,
respectively. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced
by, such investments will be payable to Parent.

               (b) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time but in no event more than ten (10) days thereafter, Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate
or certificates, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and associated Rights (the
"Certificates"), whose shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c) into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions
as Parent and the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration (subject to
subsection (e) below) multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment
that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been paid
or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the

                                     A-3

Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in cash as contemplated by this Section 2.2.

               (c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company
Common Stock. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock (and associated Rights) on the
records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates evidencing ownership of shares of Company Common Stock (and
associated Rights) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares (and associated Rights),
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for Merger Consideration in
the proper amount of cash as provided in this Article II.

               (d) Return of Funds; No Liability. At any time following 270
calendar days after the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds
(including any interest received with respect thereto) which had been
deposited with the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders
of Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment
of any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any
Certificates such stockholder holds, as determined pursuant to this Agreement,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder
of a Certificate for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

               (e) Withholding Taxes. If so specified in the Proxy Statement,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of
Shares pursuant to the Merger such amounts as Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "Code") or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law.
To the extent amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of
which the deduction and withholding was made.

          Section 2.3. Company Option Plans. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee
administering the Option Plans (as defined below)) shall adopt such
resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect the
following:

               (a) Adjust the terms of all outstanding stock options to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock ("Company Stock Options") granted
under the Company's 1989 Stock Option Plan or 1998 Stock Option Plan, each
as amended (the "Option Plans"), to provide that each Company Stock Option
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, with an exercise price of
less than the Merger Consideration, shall be canceled at the Effective Time in
exchange for a payment from the Surviving Corporation (subject to any
applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (1) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option and (2) the
excess of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, payable in cash immediately
following the Effective Time.

               (b) Except as provided in subsection (a) above, the Company
Stock Options, the Option Plans and any other plan, program or arrangement
providing for the issuance or grant of any interest in respect of the capital
stock of the Company or any subsidiary, including the Rights Agreement, shall
terminate as of the Effective Time, and following the Effective Time no holder
of a Company Stock Option nor any participant in any such plan, program or
arrangement shall have any right thereunder to acquire capital securities of
the Surviving Corporation or of Parent.

                                     A-4

                                 ARTICLE III

                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

          The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as
follows:

          Section 3.1. Corporate Organization.

               (a) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization and has the requisite corporate power and
authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted. Each of the Company and its
subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or
location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such
licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below) on the
Company ("Company Material Adverse Effect"). The copies of the Restated
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company, and amendments thereto
(the "Company Charter" and "Company Bylaws"), as most recently filed with the
Company's SEC Documents (as hereinafter defined), are true, complete and
correct copies of such documents as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement.

               (b) As used in this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse
Effect" means any state of facts, change, development, effect, occurrence or
condition that has a material adverse effect on (i) the business, results of
operations, properties, assets, liabilities or financial condition of the
Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or Parent and its subsidiaries
taken as a whole, as applicable, or (ii) a party's or parties' ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (except to the extent caused
by any action or inaction of Parent or Merger Sub in the case of a Company
Material Adverse Effect, or of the Company or its subsidiaries in the case of
a Parent Material Adverse Effect, in breach of this Agreement); provided,
however, that a "Material Adverse Effect" shall not include the following or
any combination of the following: any state of facts, change, development,
effect, occurrence or condition (A) resulting from or attributable to
general national, international or regional economic or financial conditions,
(B) resulting from or attributable to the announcement, pendency or
consummation of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or
(C) generally affecting the industries in which the Company or its subsidiaries
operate (including legal and regulatory changes), or (D) described as a risk
factor in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2001. For purposes of analyzing whether any state of facts,
change, development, effect, occurrence or condition has resulted in a Company
Material Adverse Effect, Merger Sub will not be deemed to have knowledge of
any state of facts, change, development, effect, occurrence or condition
relating to the Company or its subsidiaries unless it is disclosed in the
Company's SEC Documents or the Company Disclosure Schedule (as defined below).
As used in this Agreement, the word "subsidiary" when used with respect to any
party means any corporation, partnership or other organization, whether
incorporated or unincorporated, of which at least a majority of the securities
or other interests having by their terms voting power to elect a majority of
the board of directors or others performing similar functions with respect to
such corporation or other organization is directly or indirectly beneficially
owned or controlled by such party or by any one or more of its subsidiaries,
or by such party and one or more of its subsidiaries.

          Section 3.2. Capitalization.

               (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of
15,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, no par value, and 500,000 shares of
Preferred Stock, par value $10.00 per share (the "Preferred Stock"). At the
date hereof, there were (i) 4,523,975 shares of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding and an equal number of shares of Company Common Stock reserved
for issuance upon exercise of Rights under the Rights Agreement, (ii) 37,167
shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding
Company Stock Options (all of which are presently vested and exercisable)
pursuant to the Option Plans, and (iii) no shares of Preferred Stock issued or
outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Stock have
been (and any shares of Company Common Stock issued upon the exercise of
Company Stock Options will be) duly authorized and validly issued and are (or
will be) fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. Except as
set forth above or in Section 3.2(a) of the Company's disclosure schedule
delivered to Parent concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the
"Company Disclosure Schedule"), as of the date

                                     A-5

hereof, there are not and, as of the Effective Time there will not be, any
shares of Company Common Stock, Preferred Stock, or other capital stock issued
and outstanding or any subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or
agreements of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any
securities of the Company, including any securities representing the right to
purchase or otherwise receive any Company Common Stock or Preferred Stock.

               (b) The Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued
and outstanding shares of capital stock of each of its subsidiaries, free and
clear of any liens, charges, encumbrances, adverse rights or claims and
security interests whatsoever ("Liens"), and all of such shares are duly
authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights. None of the Company's subsidiaries has or is bound by any
outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements
of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any security of such
subsidiary, including any securities representing the right to purchase or
otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of
such subsidiary.

               (c) Disclosed in Section 3.2(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule is a true and complete list of all outstanding Company Stock Options
as of the date hereof, the exercise price therefor, and the holder thereof.

          Section 3.3. Authority.

               (a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, subject to obtaining the approval of holders of more than
two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Company
Stockholder Approval") prior to the consummation of the Merger in accordance
with Section 13.1-718 of the VSCA. The Company Stockholder Approval is the
only vote of the holders of any class or series of the Company's securities
necessary to approve this Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of
this Agreement, and the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated
hereby, have been duly authorized by its Board of Directors and, except for
obtaining the approval of its stockholders as contemplated by Section 1.5
hereof and as required by the VSCA, no other corporate action on the part of
the Company is necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by the
Company of this Agreement and the consummation by it of the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the Company and, assuming due and valid authorization, execution and delivery
hereof by the other parties thereto, constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, except that such enforceability (i) may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating to the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (ii) is subject to general
principles of equity.

               (b) The Board of Directors of the Company has approved and
taken all corporate action required to be taken by the Board of Directors for
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

          Section 3.4. Consents and Approvals; No Violations.

               (a) Except for (i) the consents and approvals set forth in
Section 3.4(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (ii) the filing with the
SEC of the preliminary proxy statement and the Proxy Statement, (iii) the
filing of the Articles of Merger with the Commission pursuant to the VSCA,
(iv) the adoption of this Agreement by the requisite vote of the stockholders
of the Company, and (v) filings, permits, authorizations, consents and
approvals as may be required under, and other applicable requirements of, (A)
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), (B) the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR
Act"), (C) any filings required under the rules and regulations of the
American Stock Exchange ("AMEX"), and (D) if required, the Federal Law of
Economic Competition (Mexico), as amended (the "Mexican Competition Act"), no
consents or approvals of, or filings, declarations or registrations with, any
federal, state or local court, administrative or regulatory agency or
commission or other governmental authority or instrumentality, domestic or
foreign (each a "Governmental Entity") are necessary for the consummation by
the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Stockholders
Agreement, other than such other consents, approvals,

                                     A-6

filings, declarations or registrations that, if not obtained, made or given,
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

               (b) Except as set forth in Section 3.4(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Company nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby, nor compliance by the Company with any of the terms or
provisions hereof, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Stockholders Agreement or compliance with the terms and provisions
thereof, will (i) conflict with or violate any provision of the Company
Charter or Company Bylaws or any of the similar organizational documents of
any of its subsidiaries or (ii) assuming that the authorizations, consents and
approvals referred to in Section 3.4(a) and the authorization hereof by the
Company's stockholders in accordance with the VSCA are duly obtained, (x)
violate any statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ,
decree or injunction applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
any of their respective properties or assets, or (y) subject to obtaining the
third-party consents set forth in Section 3.4(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, violate, conflict with, result in the loss of any material benefit
under, constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time,
or both, would constitute a default) under, result in the termination of or a
right of termination or cancellation under, accelerate the performance
required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective
properties or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries under, any of
the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to
which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or
any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected, except,
in the case of clause (ii) above, for such violations, conflicts, breaches,
defaults, losses, terminations of rights thereof, accelerations or Lien
creations which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

          Section 3.5. SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities. The
Company has filed all required reports, schedules, forms and registration
statements with the SEC since October 1, 2000 (collectively, and in each case
including all exhibits, schedules, and amendments thereto and documents
incorporated by reference therein, the "SEC Documents"; provided that, in
respect of the Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2001, "SEC
Documents" shall refer only to the Form 10-K/A for the year ended September
30, 2001). As of their respective dates, the SEC Documents complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and
the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such
SEC Documents, and none of the SEC Documents (including any and all financial
statements included therein) as of such dates contained any untrue statement
of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The consolidated
financial statements of the Company included in the SEC Documents (the "SEC
Financial Statements") comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") (except, in the case of unaudited
consolidated quarterly statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated otherwise in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the
case of unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments).
Since September 30, 2001, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries, has
incurred any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise) required, if known, to be reflected or
reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company prepared in
accordance with GAAP except (i) as and to the extent set forth on the audited
balance sheet of the Company and its subsidiaries as of September 30, 2001
(including the notes thereto) included in the SEC Documents, (ii) as incurred
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) as
incurred after September 30, 2001 in the ordinary course of business and
consistent with past practice, (iv) as described in the SEC Documents filed
since September 30, 2001 (the "Recent SEC Documents"), or (v) as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

          Section 3.6. Broker's Fees. Except for the Financial Advisor's
fee set forth in Section 3.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the
Company nor any subsidiary of the Company nor any of their respective officers
or directors on behalf of the Company or such subsidiaries has employed any
financial advisor, broker or finder or incurred any liability for any
financial advisory fee, broker's fees, commissions or finder's fees in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

                                     A-7

          Section 3.7. Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as
set forth in the Recent SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof or in
Section 3.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, since September 30, 2001, the
Company and its subsidiaries have conducted their businesses in all material
respects in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past practice
and, since such date, there has not been any event that, individually or in
the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Since March 31, 2002, neither the Company nor any of
its subsidiaries has taken, or failed to take, any action that would have
constituted a breach of Section 5.1(a), 5.1(b), or 5.1(e) hereof had the
covenants therein applied since that date.

          Section 3.8. Legal Proceedings.

               (a) Except as set forth in Section 3.8 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or as disclosed in the Recent SEC Documents, there is no
action, suit or proceeding, claim, arbitration or investigation pending or, to
the Company's knowledge, threatened against the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, and neither the Company nor any or its subsidiaries is a party
to any action, suit or proceeding, arbitration or investigation, which,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

               (b) Except as set forth in Section 3.8 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or as disclosed in the Recent SEC Documents, there is no
injunction, order, judgment, decree or regulatory restriction imposed upon the
Company, any of its subsidiaries or the assets of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries which, when aggregated with all other such injunctions, orders,
judgments, decrees and restrictions, would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

          Section 3.9. Compliance with Applicable Law. Except as
disclosed in Section 3.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or in the Recent
SEC Documents, the Company and each of its subsidiaries hold all material
licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful
conduct of their respective businesses as presently conducted and are in
compliance with the terms thereof, except where the failure to hold such
license, franchise, permit or authorization or such noncompliance would not,
when aggregated with all other such failures or noncompliance, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, and neither the Company
nor any of its subsidiaries knows of, or has received notice of, any material
violations of any applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation, policy
and/or guideline of any Governmental Entity relating to the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, which, in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

          Section 3.10. Company Information. The information relating to the
Company and its subsidiaries to be provided by the Company for inclusion in
the Proxy Statement or in any other document filed with any other Governmental
Entity in connection herewith at the respective times filed with the SEC or
such other Governmental Entity and first published, sent or given to
stockholders of the Company and, in addition, in the case of the Proxy
Statement, at the date it or any amendment or supplement is mailed to holders
of the shares of Company Common Stock and at the time of the Special Meeting,
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they are made, not misleading (except that no
representation or warranty is made by the Company as to such portions thereof
that relate only to Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their subsidiaries or to
statements made therein based on information supplied by or on behalf of
Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein). The
Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the
provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

          Section 3.11. Employee Matters.

               (a) The Company has delivered or made available to Parent full
and complete copies or descriptions of each material employment, severance,
bonus, change-in-control, profit sharing, compensation, termination, stock
option, stock appreciation right, restricted stock, phantom stock, performance
unit, pension, retirement, deferred compensation, welfare or other employee
benefit agreement, trust fund or other employee benefit arrangement and any
union, guild or collective bargaining agreement maintained or contributed to or
required to be contributed to by the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates
(as defined below), for the benefit or welfare of any director, officer,
employee or former employee of the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates
(such

                                     A-8

plans and arrangements being collectively the "Company Benefit Plans").
Except as set forth in Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
each of the Company Benefit Plans is in material compliance with all
applicable laws including the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
as amended ("ERISA"), and the Code except where such noncompliance would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as
set forth in Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Internal
Revenue Service has determined that each Company Benefit Plan that is intended
to be a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and
the Company is aware of no event occurring after the date of such
determination that would adversely affect such determination, except where
such event would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Except as set forth in Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no condition exists that is reasonably likely to subject the Company
or any of its subsidiaries to any direct or indirect liability under Title IV
of ERISA or Section 4976 of the Code that would reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect and that is not reflected on such balance
sheet or that is reasonably likely to result in any loss of a federal tax
deduction under Section 280G of the Code. Except as set forth in Section
3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no pending or to the
Company's knowledge, threatened, claims (other than routine claims for
benefits or immaterial claims) by, on behalf of or against any of the Company
Benefit Plans or any trusts related thereto except where such claims would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. "ERISA

               (b) Except as expressly permitted in this Section 5.2(b),
neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall

of Directors of the Company may (subject to compliance with this and the

withdraw or modify its approval, determination of advisability, or

Parent in writing of any request for confidential information in connection
with a Takeover Proposal, of any Takeover Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of such request or the Takeover Proposal, the identity of the
person making such request or Takeover Proposal, and any requests made by the
Company for information about the Takeover Proposal or the party that made it;
and the Company shall keep Parent promptly advised of all significant
developments in respect of such Takeover Proposal.

               (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 shall prohibit the
Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
disclosure to the Company's stockholders; provided, however, neither the
Company nor its Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall, except as
in accordance with Section 5.2(b), withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to
withdraw or modify, its approval, determination or recommendation or approve,
determine to be advisable, or recommend, or propose publicly to approve,

                    (ii) For purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal"
means a bona fide written offer from any person (other than Parent and its
subsidiaries, affiliates and representatives) for a direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of 50% or more of the assets of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries taken as a whole, or 50% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, any tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially
owning 50% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, or any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries, in each case other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which provides for consideration
on a per share basis to the stockholders of the Company with a value (it being
understood that securities retained by the Company's stockholders be included
for purposes of that determination) that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with independent financial
advisors and outside counsel and taking into account all relevant factors,
including whether financing for such offer is committed and the likelihood of
such offer resulting in a consummated transaction) to be more favorable from a
financial point

                                     A-15

of view to the Company's stockholders than the Merger Consideration. Any
Superior Proposal is a Takeover Proposal.

          Section 5.3. Publicity. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company. Thereafter, so long as this Agreement is
in effect, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, nor any of their
respective affiliates, shall issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other announcement with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or
the other transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consultation of
the other parties, except any publication of any press release or other
announcement made in connection with any Superior Proposal or as may be
required by law or by any listing agreement with a national securities
exchange as determined in the good faith judgment of the party wanting to make
such release.

          Section 5.4. Notification of Certain Matters. Each of the Company
and Parent shall give prompt notice to the other if any of the following occur
after the date of this Agreement: (i) receipt of any notice or other
communication in writing from any person alleging that the consent or approval
of such third party is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) receipt of any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Entity or the AMEX or New York Stock
Exchange (or any other securities market), as applicable, in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (iii) the occurrence of an
event which would be reasonably likely to (A) have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or prevent or delay the consummation of the Merger or (B) cause any
condition to the Merger to be unsatisfied at any time prior to the Outside
Date (as defined in Section 7.1(b)); provided, however, that the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall not limit or otherwise affect
the remedies of the parties available hereunder.

          Section 5.5. Access to Information.

               (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws
relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall, and shall cause
each of its subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel and other representatives of the Parent, during normal business hours
during the period prior to the Effective Time, reasonable access to all its
properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and to its officers,
employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives and, during such
period, the Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, make available
to Parent (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other
document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal securities laws and (ii) all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as such other party may
reasonably request. Parent shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries and
Representatives to, hold in strict confidence all Evaluation Material (as
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) concerning the Company and it
subsidiaries furnished to it in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, pursuant to this Section 5.5(a) or otherwise, in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement.

               (b) No investigation by any of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the other set forth herein.

          Section 5.6. Further Assurances.

               (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each
of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, use all
reasonable efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary,
proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements which may
be imposed on such party or its subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and,
subject to the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation,
the Merger, as promptly as practicable and (ii) to obtain (and to cooperate
with the other party to obtain) any consent, authorization, order or approval
of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party
which is required to be obtained by the Company or Parent or any of their
respective subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to comply with the terms and
conditions of any such consent, authorization, order or approval.

               (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each
of Parent and the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all

                                     A-16

things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, as
soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, using all reasonable
efforts to lift or rescind any injunction or restraining order or other order
adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and using all reasonable efforts to defend any litigation
seeking to enjoin, prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or seeking material damages.

          Section 5.7. Indemnification.

               (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement
or who becomes such prior to the Effective Time, an officer, director or
fiduciary of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties")
against (i) any and all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), fines, liabilities or judgments or
amounts that are paid in settlement with the approval of Parent (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of or in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on
or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a
director, officer or fiduciary of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
whether pertaining to any action or omission existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or
after, the Effective Time ("Indemnified Liabilities"), and (ii) all
Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or
in part out of, or pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, however, that, in the case of the Company and
the Surviving Corporation such indemnification shall be to the fullest extent
a corporation is permitted under Section 13.1-704 of the VSCA to indemnify its
own directors, officers or fiduciaries, and in the case of Parent such
indemnification shall not be limited by the VSCA but such indemnification
shall not be applicable to any claims made against the Indemnified Parties to
the extent that a judgment or other final adjudication established that (A)
their acts or omissions were committed in bad faith or were the result of
active and deliberate dishonesty and were material to the cause of action so
deliberated or (B) arising out of, based upon or attributable to the gaining
in fact of any financial profit or other advantage to which they were not
legally entitled. Parent, the Company, and the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, will pay all expenses of each Indemnified Party in advance of the
final disposition of any such action or proceeding to the fullest extent
permitted by law upon receipt of any undertaking contemplated by Section
13.1-699 of the VSCA. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation is brought against any
Indemnified Party (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i)
the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them and
Parent and Merger Sub, (ii) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received, and (iii)
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use all reasonable
efforts to assist and cooperate in the vigorous defense of any such matter,
provided that none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable for any settlement of any claim effected without its written consent,
which consent, however, shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 5.7,
upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
shall notify Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation (but the failure
so to notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability
which it may have under this Section 5.7 except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices such party), and shall deliver to the Merger Sub and the
Surviving Corporation the undertaking contemplated by Section 13.1-699 of the
VSCA. The Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm (in
addition to local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction if reasonably
required) to represent them with respect to each such matter unless there is,
under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any
significant issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnified
Parties. In the event any Indemnified Party is required to bring any action to
enforce rights or to collect moneys due under this Agreement and is successful
in such action Parent shall reimburse such Indemnified Party for all its
expenses in bringing and pursuing such action. Each Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to the advancement of expenses to the full extent contemplated in
this Section 5.7(a) in connection with any such action.

               (b) Successors. In the event Parent or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any person, then and in either such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the continuing or surviving entity or transferee, as appropriate,
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.7.

                                     A-17

               (c) Survival of Indemnification. To the fullest extent not
prohibited by law, from and after the Effective Time, all rights to
indemnification as of the date hereof in favor of the directors, officers and
fiduciaries of the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to their
activities as such prior to the Effective Time, as provided in their
respective certificates of incorporation and bylaws or comparable documents in
effect on the date hereof, or otherwise in effect on the date hereof, shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of
not less than six years from the Effective Time, provided that in the event
any claim or claims are asserted or made within such six-year period, all such
rights to indemnification in respect of such claim or claims shall continue
until the final disposition thereof.

          Section 5.8. Employee Benefit Plans. For purposes of all employee
benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) and other employment
agreements, arrangements and policies of Parent under which an employee's
benefits depends, in whole or in part, on length of service, credit will be
given to current employees of the Company for service with the Company prior
to the Effective Time, provided that such crediting of service does not result
in duplication of benefits. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, honor in accordance with their terms all employee benefit
plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) and the other Company Benefit
Plans; provided, however, that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may amend,
modify or terminate any individual Company Benefit Plan in accordance with its
terms and applicable law (including obtaining the consent of the other parties
to and beneficiaries of such Company Benefit Plan to the extent required
thereunder) provided, further, that, for a period of two years, no such
amendment, modification or termination shall result in compensation and
benefits to the employees, former employees, directors or former directors of
the Company and its subsidiaries (the "Company Employees") that are less
favorable, in the aggregate, than the compensation and benefits that are
provided to the Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries shall not, after the
Effective Time, provide retiree medical health insurance benefits without the
consent of Parent except as may be required by law or as is provided as of the
date hereof to the officer or director set forth in Section 5.8 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

          Section 5.9. Bonus Payments; Employment Agreements.

               (a) The Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, pay discretionary bonuses to officers and employees of the Company in
respect of the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs, consistent with the
Company's past practice with respect to such bonuses.

              (b) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
honor in accordance with their terms, each of the four employment agreements
filed or incorporated by reference as exhibits to the Company's Annual Report
on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001, as such
agreements are amended as of the date hereof.

          Section 5.10. Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the
Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises
of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each
party to this Agreement and their respective subsidiaries shall take all such
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense
of, Parent.

                                  ARTICLE VI

                           CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER

          Section 7.1. Termination. Anything herein or elsewhere to the
contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
contemplated herein may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after stockholder approval thereof:

               (a) By the mutual consent of the Parent and the Company.

               (b) By either of the Company or Parent:

                    (i) if any Governmental Entity shall have issued an order,
decree or ruling or taken any other action in each case permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have
become final and non-appealable; provided that the party seeking to terminate

before November 15, 2002 (the "Outside Date"), provided, that a party may not
terminate the Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)(ii) if its failure to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement results in the failure of
the Effective Time to occur by such time, provided, however, that the Outside
Date shall be extended day-by-day for each day during which any party shall be
subject to a nonfinal order, decree, ruling or action restraining, enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, provided further,
however, that the Outside Date shall not be extended past December 15, 2002;

                    (i) if the required approval of the stockholders of the

                    (iii) if the representations and warranties of Parent or
Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement that are qualified by materiality shall
not be true and correct in any respect, or if the representations and
warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement that are not
so qualified shall not be true and correct in all material respects, in each
case as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as if made on

any material respect to perform or comply with any material obligation,
agreement or covenant required by this Agreement to be performed or complied

within thirty (30) business days after the Company gives written notice of
such inaccuracy or breach to Parent, except, in the case of the failure of
any representation or warranty, for changes specifically permitted by this
Agreement, for those representations and warranties that address matters only
as of a particular date and are true and correct as of such date, and for such
failures as do not individually or in the aggregate have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

               (d) By Parent:

                    (i) if the required approval of the stockholders of the
Company shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the
required vote upon a vote held at a duly held meeting of stockholders or at any
adjournment thereof;

Company or any committee thereof shall have resolved to take any of the
foregoing actions; or

Company set forth in this Agreement that are not so qualified shall not be
true and correct in all material respects, in each case as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing Date as if made on such date, or the Company
shall have breached or failed in any material respect to perform or comply
with any material obligation, agreement or covenant required by this Agreement
to be performed or complied with by it, which inaccuracy or breach cannot be
cured or has not been cured within thirty (30) business days after Parent
gives written notice of such inaccuracy or breach to the Company, except, in
the case of the failure of any representation or warranty, for changes
specifically permitted by this Agreement, for those representations and
warranties that address matters only as of a particular date and are true and
correct as of such date, and for such failures as do not individually or in
the aggregate have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                                     A-20

          Section 7.2. Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination
of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, written notice thereof shall
forthwith be given to the other party or parties specifying the provision
hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement (other
than Sections 7.2, 7.3, 8.4, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9, and 8.11 hereof) shall
forthwith become null and void, and there shall be no liability on the part of
the Parent or the Company, except as provided in Section 7.3; provided,
however, that nothing in this Section shall relieve any party for any
intentional breach prior to any such termination of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements set forth in this
Agreement.

          Section 7.3. Termination Fee; Expenses. Except as provided in this
Section 7.3 and except for the filing fee under the HSR Act (which filing fee
in all events shall be borne by Parent), all fees and expenses incurred by the
parties hereto shall be borne solely by the party which has incurred such fees
and expenses. In the event that (i) a Takeover Proposal shall have been made
known to the Company or shall have been made directly to its stockholders
generally or any person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or
not conditional) to make a Takeover Proposal and thereafter this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(ii), 7.1(c)(i), or 7.1(d)(i) hereof and
such Takeover Proposal is consummated within one (1) year of such termination
or (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii),
or is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii), then the
Company shall pay to Parent within one business day of such termination, or in
the case of subclause (i) upon such consummation, a termination fee equal to
$8 million (the "Termination Fee"), payable by wire transfer of same day
funds. The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into
this Agreement. In the event the Termination Fee becomes payable pursuant to
this Section 7.3, the Company shall also promptly pay upon Parent's request,
all reasonably documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by Parent
and Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (not exceeding $1 million in the aggregate), which
payments shall be in addition to the Termination Fee. The fee arrangement
contemplated hereby shall be paid pursuant to this Section 7.3 regardless of
any alleged breach by Parent of its obligations hereunder, provided, that no
payment made by the Company pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall operate or be
construed as a waiver by the Company of any breach of this Agreement by Parent
or Merger Sub or of any rights of the Company in respect thereof. The
Termination Fee, if paid, shall be credited against any damages recovered by
Parent or Merger Sub from the Company arising from a breach of this Agreement
by the Company.

                                 ARTICLE VIII

                                MISCELLANEOUS

          Section 8.1. Amendment and Modification. Subject to applicable law,
this Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented in any and all
respects, whether before or after any vote of the stockholders of the Company
contemplated hereby, by written agreement of the parties hereto at any time
prior to the Closing Date with respect to any of the terms contained herein;
provided, however, that no amendment, modification or supplement of this
Agreement shall be made following the approval of this Agreement by the
stockholders unless, to the extent required, approved by the stockholders.

the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject to the proviso of
Section 8.1, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

          Section 8.3. Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties. None of
the representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any schedule,
instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the Effective Time.

2002, is made and entered into among Berkshire Hathaway Inc., a Delaware

                             W I T N E S S E T H:

          WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, each Stockholder is the beneficial
owner ("beneficial owner," "beneficial ownership," "beneficially," and related
terms, wherever used herein, within the meaning of Section 13(d)(1) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of the number of shares of common
stock, no par value ("Company Common Stock"), of Garan, Incorporated, a

name on Exhibit A hereto (the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
beneficially owned by the Stockholder, and any other Company Common Stock or
any stock option that the Stockholder acquires, as record or beneficial
holder, whether by means of purchase, dividend, distribution, or otherwise,
prior to the termination of this Agreement, together with all associated
Rights, being collectively referred to as the "Shares");

          WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Company, Parent, and Merger Sub are entering into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") of even date herewith, which (upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein) provides for the

          WHEREAS, as a condition to their willingness to enter into the
Merger Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have requested each Stockholder to

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements hereinafter set forth,
the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

                                  ARTICLE I

                 STOCKHOLDERS' REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

          Each Stockholder hereby severally, and not jointly, represents and

          Section 1.1 Due Organization and Authorization. Stockholder (if not

organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is formed. Stockholder possesses the requisite power
and authority to execute, deliver, and perform this Agreement, to appoint or
cause to be appointed Merger Sub and Parent (or any nominee thereof) as its
Proxy (as defined below), and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. The execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement, the

duly authorized by all requisite action of Stockholder. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by or on behalf of Stockholder and

Shares whose consent is required for the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or for the consummation by Stockholder of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

          Section 1.2 No Conflicts; Required Filings and Consents. (a) The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Stockholder do not, and the
performance of this Agreement by Stockholder will not, (i) conflict with or
violate the certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other

or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give to others any
rights of termination, acceleration, or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a lien or encumbrance on any assets of Stockholder, including,
without limitation, the Shares, pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise, or other
instrument or obligation to which Stockholder is a party or by which
Stockholder or any of Stockholder's assets is bound or affected, except in the
case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for such matters as would not prevent or in
any way impair Stockholder's ability to perform its obligations under this
Agreement.

               (b)  The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Stockholder
do not, and the performance of this Agreement by Stockholder will not, require
any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or
notification to, any governmental or regulatory authority, domestic or
foreign, other than (i) filings under the HSR Act and any similar foreign
requirements, and (ii) any necessary filing under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended.

          Section 1.3 Title to Shares. Stockholder is the beneficial owner of

other than restrictions imposed by securities laws or pursuant to this
Agreement. Exhibit A also sets forth the record owner of the Shares. As of the
date hereof, Stockholder does not own beneficially or of record any other
shares of Company Common Stock or option to acquire any such shares.

stockholders to consider the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

          Section 1.5 Acknowledgment. Stockholder, on behalf of itself and its
affiliates, acknowledges and agrees that neither it nor they shall be paid or
shall otherwise be entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's, or

          Each Stockholder hereby severally, and not jointly, covenants to

and in any action by written consent of the stockholders of the Company, in
each case before the Effective Time, Stockholder shall vote (or direct the
record owner of its Shares to vote) its Shares (i) in

                                     A-26

favor of the Merger and the Merger Agreement, (ii) if so directed by Parent,
against any Takeover Proposal and against any proposal for action or agreement
that would result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or
any other obligation or agreement of the Company under the Merger Agreement or
which could reasonably be expected to result in any of the Company's
obligations under the Merger Agreement not being fulfilled, any change in the
composition of the board of directors of the Company (except as contemplated
by the Merger Agreement), any change in the present capitalization of the
Company or any amendment to the Company's corporate structure or business, or
any other action which could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with,
delay, postpone or materially adversely affect the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the Merger Agreement or the likelihood of such
transactions being consummated, and (iii) in favor of any other matter
necessary for consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement which is considered at any such meeting of shareholders or in such

          Section 2.2 Proxy. Stockholder hereby revokes all prior proxies or
powers of attorney with respect to any of its Shares. During the Term,
Stockholder hereby constitutes and appoints Parent and Merger Sub, or any
nominee designated by Parent and Merger Sub, with full power of substitution
and resubstitution at any time during the Term, as its true and lawful
attorney and proxy ("Proxy"), for and in its name, place, and stead, in the
Proxy's discretion to demand that the Secretary of the Company call a special
meeting of the stockholders of the Company for the purpose of considering any
matter referred to in Section 2.1 and to vote each Share held by Stockholder
as its Proxy in respect of any such matter, at every annual, special,
adjourned, or postponed meeting of the stockholders of the Company, including
the right to sign its name as stockholder (or to direct the record owner to
sign its name as stockholder) to any consent, certificate, or other document
relating to the Company that the law of the Commonwealth of Virginia might
permit or require. THE FOREGOING PROXY AND POWER OF ATTORNEY ARE IRREVOCABLE
AND COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST THROUGHOUT THE TERM. Stockholder will take such
further action and execute such other documents as may be necessary to
effectuate the intent of this Section 2.2.

          Section 2.3 Restrictions on Transfer, Proxies and Non-Interference.
Stockholder hereby agrees, until the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 3.2, and except as contemplated hereby, not to (i) sell, transfer,
pledge, encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract,
option or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale,
transfer, pledge, encumbrance, assignment or other disposition of, any of the
Shares (other than to an affiliate of such Stockholder who agrees to comply
with the terms and provisions hereof with respect to the transferred Shares),
(ii) grant any proxies, deposit any Shares into a voting trust or enter into a
voting agreement with respect to any Shares, or (iii) take any action that
would make any representation or warranty of Stockholder contained herein
untrue or incorrect in any material respect or have the effect of preventing
or disabling Stockholder from performing Stockholder's obligations under this
Agreement.

          Section 2.4 No Solicitation. Stockholder covenants and agrees that,
during the Term, it shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate,
knowingly encourage, or take any other action designed to facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal from any person (other than from
Parent or Merger Sub) relating to any transaction that constitutes a Takeover
Proposal. Stockholder further covenants and agrees that, during the Term, it
shall not participate in any discussions or negotiations (except with Parent
or Merger Sub) regarding, or furnish to any person (other than Parent or
Merger Sub or if required by law or compelled by subpoena or similar legal
process) any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way
with, or assist or participate in or facilitate or encourage, any effort or
attempt by any person (other than Parent and Merger Sub) to make, any
transaction that may constitute a Takeover Proposal. Stockholder immediately
shall cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or
negotiations of Stockholder and its agents or other representatives with any
person (other than Parent and Merger Sub) with respect to any of the
foregoing. Stockholder shall notify Parent and Merger Sub promptly of any
specific proposal or offer made to Stockholder relating to a Takeover
Proposal, or any substantive inquiry or contact made to Stockholder
specifically relating to a Takeover Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to
Parent and Merger Sub, indicate in reasonable detail the identity of the
person making such proposal, offer, inquiry, or contact and the material terms
and conditions of such proposal, offer, inquiry, or contact. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if Stockholder or (if Stockholder is an entity) any officer,
director, partner, agent or representative of Stockholder is an officer of the
Company or a member of the Board of Directors of the Company,

                                     A-27

such Stockholder may, in his or her capacity as such, take such actions, if
any, as are permitted by Section 5.2 of the Merger Agreement.

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL

July 2, 2002

Board of Directors
Garan, Incorporated
350 Fifth Avenue
New York, NY  10118

Gentlemen:

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of
view to the holders of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, no par value
(the "Shares"), of Garan, Incorporated (the "Company") of the $60.00 per Share
in cash to be received by holders of Shares in the Merger (as defined below)
pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 2, 2002 (the
"Agreement"), by and among Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ("Parent"), BG Merger Sub
Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and the Company.
Pursuant to the Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged into the Company (the
"Merger") and each outstanding Share will be converted into the right to
receive $60.00 in cash.

Goldman, Sachs & Co., as part of its investment banking business, is
continually engaged in performing financial analyses with respect to
businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions,
negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions of
listed and unlisted securities and private placements as well as for estate,
corporate and other purposes. We are familiar with the Company having acted as
its financial advisor in connection with, and having participated in certain
of the negotiations leading to, the Agreement. We also have provided certain
investment banking services to Parent or its subsidiaries from time to time,
including having acted as sole bookrunner and manager in the issuance of $400
million of SQUARZ (a unit security) of the Parent in May 2002 and may provide
investment banking services to Parent or its subsidiaries in the future. In
addition, we have acted as counterparty to Parent in other banking-related
activities in the ordinary course of our business and may do so in the future.
Goldman, Sachs & Co. provides a full range of financial advisory and
securities services and, in the course of its normal trading activities, may
from time to time effect transactions and hold positions in securities,
including derivative securities, of the Company or Parent for its own account
and for the accounts of customers.

In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the
Agreement; Annual Reports to Stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of
the Company for the five fiscal years ended September 30, 2001; certain
interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the
Company; certain other communications from the Company to its

                                     B-1

stockholders; and certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the
Company prepared by its management. We also have held discussions with members
of the senior management of the Company regarding the past and current
business operations, financial condition and future prospects of the Company.
In addition, we have reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the
Shares, compared certain financial and stock market information for the
Company with similar information for certain other companies the securities of
which are publicly traded, reviewed the financial terms of certain recent
business combinations in the apparel industry specifically and other
industries generally and performed such other studies and analyses as we
considered appropriate.

We have relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial,
accounting and other information discussed with or reviewed by us and have
assumed such accuracy and completeness for purposes of rendering this opinion.
In addition, we have not made an independent evaluation or appraisal of the
assets and liabilities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and we have
not been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Our advisory
services and the opinion expressed herein are provided for the information and
assistance of the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with its
consideration of the transaction contemplated by the Agreement and such
opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of Shares
should vote with respect to the Merger.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing and based upon such other matters as
we consider relevant, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the
$60.00 per Share in cash to be received by the holders of Shares in the Merger
is fair from a financial point of view to such holders.

Very truly yours,

                                     B-2
