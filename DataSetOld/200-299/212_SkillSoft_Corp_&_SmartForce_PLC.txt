Summary of the Merger 

The following questions and answers are intended to address
briefly some commonly asked questions regarding the merger. These questions and answers may not address all the questions that may be important to you. Please refer to the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus including the merger agreement and the exhibits and other documents attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents referenced in it. 

We are Proposing a Merger of SmartForce and SkillSoft 

Q:

What is the proposed merger? (see page 49) 

A:

In the proposed merger, SmartForce and SkillSoft will merge in a stock-for-stock transaction. The transaction is structured as a merger of SkillSoft with a
newly formed subsidiary of SmartForce, with SkillSoft surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of SmartForce. In exchange for their shares in SkillSoft, the SkillSoft stockholders will receive ordinary shares of SmartForce, represented by American
Depositary Shares, or ADSs. The merger agreement is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as 
Annex A
. You are encouraged to read it carefully. 

Q:

Am I being asked to vote on anything else? (see page 132) 

A:

Yes. 



If you are a SkillSoft common stockholder, the SkillSoft board of directors is asking you to authorize SkillSoft to adjourn or postpone the SkillSoft special
meeting if the number of shares of SkillSoft common stock present or represented and voting in favor of the merger is insufficient to adopt the merger agreement under Delaware law. Adjourning the special meeting to a later date will give SkillSoft
additional time to solicit proxies to vote in favor of the merger. 



If you are a SmartForce shareholder, the SmartForce board of directors is asking you to do the following: 



Approve the merger agreement, the merger and the issuance of SmartForce ordinary shares or ADSs representing such ordinary shares pursuant to the merger;



Approve the increase in the authorized share capital of SmartForce to 27,500,000 divided into 250,000,000 ordinary shares of  0.11 per share;



Approve the amendment of SmartForces memorandum of association and articles of association to reflect the increase in the authorized share capital of
SmartForce; 



Approve the amendment to Article 64 of the articles of association of SmartForce to read as follows: 

The number of directors (other than alternate directors) shall not be more than seven unless otherwise determined by ordinary
resolution; 



Authorize the directors to allot relevant securities up to an amount equal to but not exceeding the authorized but unissued shares in the capital of SmartForce
immediately following the passing of the resolution; and 



Authorize the directors to allot equity securities pursuant to the authority conferred on the directors to allot relevant securities as if Section 23(1) of the
Companies (Amendment) Act, 1983 (Ireland) did not apply to any such allotment. 



Q:

What will I receive in the merger? (see page 49) 

A:

Following the merger: 



SkillSoft common stockholders will receive, in exchange for each of their SkillSoft shares, 2.3674 ordinary shares represented by ADSs of SmartForce. Each ADS
represents one ordinary share of SmartForce. 



Each option to purchase SkillSoft common stock outstanding immediately before the completion of the merger will automatically become an option to purchase
SmartForce ADSs (representing SmartForce ordinary shares). The number of SmartForce ADSs (representing SmartForce ordinary shares) which may be purchased under each assumed option will be equal to the product of the number of SkillSoft shares that
were purchasable upon exercise of the option before the merger multiplied by 2.3674 and rounded down to the nearest whole ADS. The exercise price per share will be the pre-merger exercise price divided by 2.3674 and rounded up to the nearest whole
cent. 



Instead of fractional shares in the merger, SkillSoft stockholders will receive cash in an amount equal to the fraction multiplied by the average of the last
reported sales prices of SmartForce ADSs on the Nasdaq National Market for the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the last full trading day prior to the effective date of the merger. 

Q:

What percentage of the combined company will the SmartForce shareholders and the SkillSoft stockholders own following the merger? (see page 75)

A:

After the merger, based on shares outstanding as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus the current SmartForce shareholders would own
approximately 58% of the outstanding shares of SmartForce and the former SkillSoft stockholders would own approximately 42% of the outstanding shares of SmartForce. 

Q:

When do you expect the merger to be completed? 

A:

SmartForce and SkillSoft are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible. We hope to complete the merger during the third calendar quarter of
2002 promptly following the approval of the merger by the SmartForce shareholders and SkillSoft stockholders. However, the merger is subject to several conditions that could affect the timing of its completion. 

Q:

Are there risks involved in undertaking the merger? (see pages 13-32) 

A:

Yes. In evaluating the merger, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in the section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled 
Risk
Factors
 beginning on page 11. 

Q:

What are the conditions to completion of the merger? (see pages 81-82) 

A:

SmartForces and SkillSofts respective obligations to complete the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified closing conditions.
If either SmartForce or SkillSoft waives any of these conditions, each company will consider the facts and circumstances at that time and make a determination whether a resolicitation of proxies from its respective shareholders or stockholders is
appropriate. 

Q:

Is the merger subject to governmental approvals? (see pages 73-74) 

A:

Yes. This merger is subject to review by the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to determine whether it is in compliance with
applicable antitrust laws. Under the provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, the merger may not be consummated until the specified waiting period requirements of that Act have been satisfied. On July 22,
2002, the specified waiting period expired. However, any time before or after the merger, and notwithstanding that the waiting period has



expired or that the merger may have been consummated, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice or any state could take any action under the applicable antitrust or
competition laws as it deems necessary or desirable. This action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger. Private parties may also institute legal actions under the applicable antitrust laws under some circumstances.

This merger is also subject to review by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and
Employment of Ireland under the Mergers and Take-overs (Control) Acts, 1978 to 1996. The merger may not be consummated until the Minister has approved the merger or the waiting period following notification of the merger to the Minister has elapsed
without the Minister making an adverse decision during such period. 

Q:

What shareholder approvals are required for approval of the merger? (see pages 45 and 46-47) 

A:

The affirmative vote of the holders of 
three-fourths
 of the ordinary shares of SmartForce cast in person or by proxy on the merger proposal must
approve the merger proposal, which includes the approval of the merger agreement and the approval of the merger, the issuance of the SmartForce ordinary shares, represented by the ADSs, in the merger, the increase in the authorized share capital of
SmartForce and the other matters contained in the merger proposal. 

The holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of SkillSoft common stock must adopt the merger agreement. 

Q:

Are there any SmartForce shareholders or SkillSoft stockholders already committed to voting in favor of the merger? (see pages 44 and 47)

A:

You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at your meeting. There are four ways for you to do this:

4.

If you are a holder of SmartForce ordinary shares or SkillSoft common stock, attend



the SmartForce shareholder or SkillSoft stockholder meeting and vote in person. 

Q:

What happens if a SkillSoft stockholder does not vote? (see page 46) 

A:

If you are a SkillSoft stockholder and you fail to submit a proxy or vote at the special meeting, your shares will not be counted as present for purposes of
determining the presence or absence of a quorum and will have the same effect as a vote

 adoption of the merger agreement but will have no effect on the adjournment proposal. 



If you sign and return your proxy and do not indicate how you want to vote, your proxy will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a
quorum and will be voted 
FOR
 adoption of the merger agreement and 
FOR
 approval of the adjournment proposal. 



If you submit a proxy and affirmatively elect to 
ABSTAIN
 from voting, your proxy will be counted as present for the purpose of determining the presence
of a quorum but will not be voted at the special meeting. Consequently, your abstention will have the same effect as a vote

 adoption of the merger agreement but will have no effect on the adjournment proposal. 

Q:

What happens if a SmartForce shareholder does not vote? (see page 42) 

A:

If you are a SmartForce shareholder and do not submit a proxy or vote at the extraordinary general meeting, your shares will not be counted as present for
purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum and will have no effect on the outcome of the merger proposal. 



If you submit a proxy with respect to your SmartForce ADSs and do not indicate how you want to vote, your proxy will be counted as present for the purpose of
determining the presence of a quorum but will not be voted with respect to the merger proposal. Consequently, your failure to indicate how you want to vote will have no effect on the outcome of the merger proposal. For a description of the matters
for which The Bank of New York is not entitled to a discretionary proxy to vote SmartForce ADSs, please see 
Description of American

Depositary SharesVoting Rights
 beginning on page 
106.

 the merger proposal. 



If you submit a proxy and affirmatively elect to 
ABSTAIN

Q:

Am I entitled to dissenters or appraisal rights in connection with the merger? (see page 74) 

A:

No. Under the Irish Companies Acts and Delaware law, neither shareholders of SmartForce nor stockholders of SkillSoft, respectively, are entitled to

$
3.41 per SmartForce ADS, and 



$
8.10 per share of SkillSoft common stock. 

SmartForce and SkillSoft urge you to obtain current market quotations. 

Q:

What are the United States federal income tax consequences of the merger? (see pages 94-97) 

A:

We expect that, in general, SmartForce, SmartForces shareholders, SkillSoft and SkillSofts stockholders will not recognize a gain or loss for United
States federal income tax purposes as a result of the merger, except for a gain or loss attributable to cash received by SkillSoft stockholders instead of fractional shares. 

Set forth in 
Tax MattersMaterial United States Federal Income Tax Considerations
 is a description of the material United States federal tax
consequences of the transaction. The tax consequences to each SkillSoft stockholder will depend on the facts of that stockholders own situation. 
Therefore, SkillSoft stockholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors to determine the
particular tax consequences of the merger to them.

Q:

How will the merger be accounted for? (see page 73) 

A:

The merger will be accounted for as a purchase business combination for financial accounting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Although SmartForce will be acquiring SkillSoft as a legal matter, SkillSoft will be considered the acquirer for accounting purposes. As a result, the cost to the combined company of the acquisition will be allocated
to SmartForces tangible and identifiable intangible assets deemed to be acquired by the combined company and liabilities deemed to be assumed by the combined company based on their fair value with the remaining excess reflected as goodwill.
The results of operations and cash flows of SmartForce will be included in the combined companys financial statements prospectively as of the consummation of the merger. 

In addition, following the merger and consistent with SkillSoft being the accounting acquirer, the combined company intends to adopt SkillSofts
fiscal year ending January 31. Accordingly, if the merger is consummated on or prior to September 30, 2002 (the last day of SmartForces third quarter of its current fiscal year), the combined companys third quarter will end on October
31, 2002. Subsequent to the closing, the combined companys fiscal quarters will end April 30 (1
st

Quarter), July 31 (2
nd
 Quarter), October 31 (3
rd
 Quarter) and January 31 (4
th
 Quarter). 

Q:

Does the merger agreement permit termination of the merger (see page 82) 

A:

Yes. The merger agreement may be terminated prior to the effectiveness of the merger under some circumstances. 

Q:

Could payment of a termination fee be required in connection with the merger? (see pages 83-85) 

A:

Yes. If the merger agreement is terminated upon some specified occurrences, either SmartForce or SkillSoft may be required to pay a termination fee of up to
$8,800,000. 

Q:

May SmartForce or SkillSoft solicit acquisition proposals from other parties? (see pages 78-80) 

A:

No. Both parties have agreed, subject to limited exceptions for responses to unsolicited bona fide offers, not to initiate or engage in discussions with other
parties concerning a business combination with another party while the merger is pending. 

Q:

Are there restrictions on the ability to sell SmartForce ADSs received as a result of the merger? (see page 74) 

A:

All SmartForce ADSs received by SkillSoft stockholders in connection with the merger will be freely transferable unless the holder is considered an affiliate of
either SkillSoft or SmartForce under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. SmartForce ADSs issued in the merger and held by affiliates may only be sold pursuant to a registration statement or an



exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. 

SmartForce has entered into a registration rights agreement with Warburg, Pincus Ventures, L.P., a principal stockholder and affiliate of SkillSoft, granting Warburg the right, on one occasion, to
require SmartForce to register for resale under the Securities Act the SmartForce ADSs that Warburg will receive in the merger. The agreement is intended substantially to replicate the rights which Warburg has under an existing registration rights
agreement between Warburg and SkillSoft. See 
Agreement Related to the MergerRegistration Rights Agreement
 beginning on page 91. 



RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

Recent Developments of SmartForce 

On July 18, 2002, SmartForce announced its fiscal 2002 second quarter financial results, which have not been incorporated into the pro
forma financial statements contained elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. SmartForce reported total revenue of $44.4 million and a net loss (before acquisition-related amortization and restructuring charges) of $8.8 million, or $0.15
per share, for the second quarter ended June 30, 2002. This loss was prior to a restructuring charge of approximately $26.4 million during the second quarter. After the restructuring charge (and acquisition-related amortization), SmartForces
net loss for the second quarter was $37.7 million, or $0.66 per share. 

Recent Developments of SkillSoft 

On June 25, 2002, upon the recommendation of its audit committee, the Board of Directors of SkillSoft dismissed Arthur
Andersen LLP as its independent accountants and engaged Ernst & Young LLP as its independent accountants. Arthur Andersens report on SkillSofts financial statements for each of the two most recent fiscal years (ended January 31, 2001
and January 31, 2002) did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. 

ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES  

UNDER UNITED STATES FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS 

SmartForce is a public limited company organized under the laws of Ireland. Several of SmartForces directors and officers and
experts named in this joint proxy statement/prospectus are non-residents of the United States, and a significant portion of the assets of SmartForce and these persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for
investors to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons or to enforce against them in United States courts judgments under the civil liability provisions of the laws of the United States, including the federal securities
laws. SmartForce has been advised that there is doubt as to the enforceability against such persons in Ireland, whether in original actions or in actions for the enforcement of judgments in United States courts, of civil liabilities based solely
upon the laws of the United States, including the Federal securities laws. 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

You should not place undue reliance upon forward-looking
statements in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. This joint proxy statement/prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus contain forward-looking statements within the safe harbor
provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements relate to SmartForce, SkillSoft and the combined company businesses, financial conditions, results of operations, cash flows, dividends, financing
plans, business strategies, operating efficiencies or synergies, budgets, capital and other expenditures, competitive positions, growth opportunities for existing products, benefits from new technology, plans and objectives of management, markets
for SmartForces ordinary shares or ADSs and SkillSofts stock and other matters relating to SmartForce and SkillSoft. We use words such as anticipates, believes, plans, expects,
future, intends, may, will, should, estimates, predicts, potential, continue and similar expressions to identify such forwardlooking
statements. 



These forward-looking statements, wherever they occur in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, are estimates reflecting the present best judgment of the senior management of SmartForce and SkillSoft, respectively, and are not guarantees of future performance. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements should, therefore, be considered in light of various important factors, including those set forth
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include the following: 



combining and successfully integrating the businesses of SmartForce and SkillSoft may cost more or be more difficult than we expect; 



the completion of the proposed merger could be materially delayed or prohibited; 



general economic conditions or conditions in securities markets may be less favorable than we currently anticipate, which may result in, among other things,
lower than expected revenues or results of operations for the combined company; 



cost savings and revenue enhancements that we expect from the merger may not be fully realized or realized within the expected time frame; 



retaining key personnel may be more difficult than we expect; 



contingencies may arise of which we were not aware or of which we underestimated the significance; 



our revenues after the merger may be lower than we expect; 



we may lose more business or customers after the merger than we expect or our operating costs may be higher than we expect; 



the amount (both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales) of SmartForce and SkillSoft expenditures for research and development, selling, general
and administrative and capital acquisitions and improvements may be materially greater or less than those expected; 



development costs, anticipated completion, introduction and projected revenues from SmartForces and SkillSofts new and developing products and
technologies may be materially different than anticipated; 



changes in technology may increase the number of competitors SmartForce or SkillSoft faces or require significant capital expenditures to provide competitive
products and services; 



the effects of vigorous competition in the markets in which SmartForce and SkillSoft operate may be materially different from that anticipated; 



adverse changes may occur in the securities markets; or 



the risks described under 
Risk Factors
 beginning on page 
13 or other risks may occur. 

SmartForce shareholders and SkillSoft stockholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements contained
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, which speak only as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus or the date of the documents incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus in which they appear. 

This joint proxy statement/prospectus also contains forward-looking statements attributed to third parties relating to their
estimates regarding the growth of certain markets. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, levels of activity, performance, achievements and prospects to be
materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among others, those identified under 
Risk Factors
 and elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. 

Neither SmartForce nor SkillSoft is under any obligation, and each expressly disclaims any
obligation, to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking statements discussed in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus might not materialize. 



RISK FACTORS 

The merger and the business of the combined company involves a high
degree of risk. By voting in favor of the proposals submitted to you, current SkillSoft stockholders will be choosing to invest in SmartForce ADSs, and current SmartForce shareholders will face dilution of their ownership interest in SmartForce. An
investment in SmartForce ADSs involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference, you should carefully consider all of the following
risk factors relating to the proposed merger, SkillSoft, SmartForce and the combined company in deciding whether to vote for the proposals submitted to you. References below to we, us, our and ours
refer to the combined company and its consolidated subsidiaries. 

Risks Related to the Proposed Merger 

The combined company may face challenges in
integrating SkillSoft with SmartForce and, as a result, may not realize the expected benefits of the merger. 

The combined company may not be successful in integrating SkillSofts and SmartForces respective businesses. Integrating SkillSofts operations and personnel with SmartForces will be a complex process. The
integration may not be completed rapidly or achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. The successful integration of the two businesses will require, among other things, the following: 



integration of the two companies products and services, sales and marketing, information and software systems and other operations; 



retention and integration of management and other key employees; 



coordination of ongoing and future research and development efforts and marketing activities; 



retention of existing customers of both companies and attraction of additional customers; 



retention of strategic partners of each company and attraction of new strategic partners; 



developing and maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; 



identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets; 



effectively leveraging SmartForces indirect sales presence; 



capitalizing on cross-selling opportunities; 



minimization of disruption of each companys ongoing business and distraction of its management; and 



limiting expenses related to integration. 

The combined company may not succeed in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with the merger. The diversion of the attention of management and any difficulties
encountered in the process of combining the companies could cause the disruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of the combined companys business or could cause the impairment of relationships with customers and business
partners. Further, the process of combining SkillSofts business with SmartForces could negatively affect employee morale and the combined companys ability to retain some key SmartForce and SkillSoft employees after the merger, and
could cause customers to cancel existing license agreements or choose not to purchase new products from the combined company. In addition, the companies intend after the merger to develop new products and services that combine both companies
assets. Difficulties in incorporating acquired technology and rights into the products and service offerings of the combined company could result in disruption of customer service and longer sales cycles and product implementations, which could
cause existing customers to reduce or cease doing business with the combined company altogether, and could cause revenue and operating income to fluctuate and fail to meet expectations. 



The value of SmartForce ADSs issued in the merger will depend on their
market price at the time of the merger, and no adjustment will be made as a result of changes in the market price of SmartForces ADSs. 

Upon completion of the merger, each share of SkillSoft common stock will be exchanged for 2.3674 SmartForce ADSs representing SmartForce ordinary shares. The exchange ratio will not be adjusted for
changes in the market price of SkillSoft common stock or SmartForce ADSs. As a result, the specific dollar value of SmartForces ADSs that SkillSoft stockholders will receive and that SmartForce shareholders will retain upon completion of the
merger will depend on the market value of SmartForce ADSs when the merger is completed, and may increase or decrease from the date you submit your proxy or the time of the stockholder meetings of SmartForce and SkillSoft. The market prices of
SmartForce ADSs and SkillSoft common stock are subject to the general price fluctuations in the market for publicly traded equity securities and have recently experienced significant volatility. We cannot predict or give you any assurances as to the
market price of SmartForce ADSs at any time before or after the completion of the merger and, therefore, we cannot value with any degree of certainty the consideration that will be received in the merger. 

Certain aspects of the merger could harm the financial results of the combined company. 

In connection with the merger of SkillSoft and SmartForce, certain aspects of the structure of the business combination and the
integration of the two companies moving forward could harm the financial results of the combined company. For example, although SmartForce will be acquiring SkillSoft as a legal matter, SkillSoft will be considered the acquirer for accounting
purposes. Because the merger will be accounted for as a purchase business combination for financial accounting purposes, the combined company will lose an amount of SmartForces deferred revenue to goodwill. Additionally, purchase
accounting is expected to create intangible assets (separate from goodwill) that will result in a non-cash, quarterly amortization expense and a one-time charge for transaction related expenses (separate from any other nonrecurring and/or
restructuring charges that might be incurred). One-time restructuring charges will be incurred in connection with the merger resulting from the elimination of redundant facilities, personnel and assets. The combined company will also incur deal
costs relating to legal, accounting, banking and other professional fees as well as costs relating to Irish capital duty payable in relation to SmartForce ordinary shares issued pursuant to the merger. 

In addition, the combined company intends to make certain changes in contracting practices following the merger, which will have certain
attendant accounting implications. Specifically, SmartForce currently records certain revenues under contracts that provide for perpetual licenses to software. On a going forward basis, the combined company intends to contract with its customers
with respect to such business in such a manner that the combined company will contract to deliver a bundled offering including services, which will be recognized as revenues as the services are delivered, rather than upon the shipment of the
software. This will have the effect of deferring the recognition of revenues. 

Further, the integration of the
two businesses is expected to result in certain categories of lost revenue in the near term as a result of the merger. For example, although the products and customer bases of the two companies are complementary and should provide us with numerous
cross selling opportunities, we do expect some degree of commercial overlap that could negatively impact revenue. Also, we intend to de-emphasize growth in customer service revenue activities to focus on higher margin segments of the business, which
we expect will result in lost revenue. 

If the benefits of the merger do not exceed the associated costs, or
if costs related to the merger exceed estimates, including costs associated with integrating the two companies, lost or deferred revenues and dilution of SmartForces shareholders resulting from the issuance of SmartForce ADSs in connection
with the merger, the combined companys financial results, including earnings per share, could be materially harmed. 



The market price of SmartForces ADSs may decline as a result of the
merger. 

The market price of SmartForces ADSs may decline as a result of the merger for a number of
reasons, including if: 



the integration of SmartForce and SkillSoft is unsuccessful or not completed in a timely and efficient manner; 



the combined company does not achieve the expected benefits of the merger as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts;



the effect of the merger on the combined companys financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts; and



significant shareholders of SmartForce following the merger decide to dispose of their shares because the results of the merger are not consistent with their
expectations. 

Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact the market price of
SmartForce ADSs and SkillSoft common stock and the future business and operations of each company. 

If the
merger is not completed for any reason, SmartForce and SkillSoft will be subject to a number of material risks, including: 



under the circumstances described in the merger agreement, SkillSoft could be required to pay SmartForce, or SmartForce could be required to pay SkillSoft, a
termination fee in the amount of up to $8.8 million; 



the market price of SmartForces ADSs and SkillSofts common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of such shares reflects a
market assumption that the merger will be completed; 



each companys costs related to the merger, such as legal and accounting fees and a portion of the investment banking fees, must be paid even if the merger
is not completed; 



benefits that each company expects to realize from the merger would not be realized; and 



the diversion of management attention from the day-to-day businesses of SmartForce and SkillSoft, the scaling back of marketing and capital spending and the
unavoidable disruption to their employees and their relationships with customers and suppliers during the period before consummation of the merger may make it difficult for SmartForce and SkillSoft to regain their financial and market positions if
the merger does not occur. 

During the pendency of the merger, each of SmartForce and
SkillSoft may not be able to enter into a merger or business combination with another party at a favorable price because of restrictions in the merger agreement. 

Covenants in the merger agreement impede the ability of each of SmartForce and SkillSoft to make acquisitions or complete other transactions that are not in the ordinary
course of business but that could be favorable to them and their respective stockholders pending completion of the merger. As a result, if the merger is not consummated, each of SmartForce and SkillSoft may be at a disadvantage to its competitors.
In addition, while the merger agreement is in effect and subject to very narrowly defined exceptions, each of SmartForce and SkillSoft is prohibited from soliciting, initiating, encouraging or entering into certain extraordinary transactions, such
as a merger, sale of assets or other business combination outside the ordinary course of business, with any third party. 

Charges to earnings resulting from the application of the purchase method of accounting may adversely affect the market value of SmartForce ADSs following the merger. 

In accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, the combined company will account for the merger using the
purchase method of accounting, which will result in charges to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on the market value of SmartForce ADSs following completion of the merger. Although SmartForce will be acquiring SkillSoft as a legal
matter, SkillSoft will be considered the acquirer for



accounting purposes. Under purchase accounting, the combined company will record as the cost of the merger the market value of the merger consideration and the amount of direct transaction costs.
The combined company will allocate the cost of the merger to SmartForces net tangible assets, amortizable intangible assets, intangible assets with indefinite lives and in-process research and development, if any, based on their fair values as
of the date of completion of the merger, and record the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill. The portion of the estimated purchase price allocated to in-process research and development will be expensed by the combined
company in the quarter in which the merger is completed. The combined company may incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in connection with the
merger. In addition, to the extent the value of these assets, including goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives becomes impaired, the combined company may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets.
These depreciation, amortization, in-process research and development and potential impairment charges will have a negative effect on the net income of the combined company for the foreseeable future, which could have a material impact on the
combined companys results of operations and the market value of its ADSs following the merger. 

Action
by governmental regulators could prevent or delay consummation of the merger, or require a modification of its terms which could hurt the combined companys business. 

The merger is subject to review by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and U.S. Department of Justice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Improvements Act of 1976 or the HSR Act. In
addition, other filings with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment of Ireland under the Mergers and Take-overs (Control) Acts, 1978 to 1996, with respect to the merger and other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, relating
primarily to antitrust issues, must be made prior to the consummation of the merger. Under each of these statutes, SmartForce and SkillSoft are required to make pre-merger notification filings and to await the expiration or early termination of
statutory waiting periods and clearance prior to completing the merger. On July 22, 2002, the waiting period under the HSR Act expired. However, at any time before or after the merger, and notwithstanding any termination of the waiting period or
consummation of the merger, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, or any state or the Irish authorities could take any action under the applicable antitrust or competition laws as it deems necessary or desirable. This
action could include delaying the consummation of the merger, seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, requiring SmartForce or SkillSoft to dispose of certain businesses or assets, or requiring a modification of the terms of the merger, any
of which could be detrimental to SmartForce, SkillSoft or the combined company. Private parties may also institute legal actions under the antitrust laws under some circumstances. We may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals in a
timely fashion or at all. 

If we are unable to take advantage of opportunities to market and sell
SmartForces and SkillSofts products and services to each others traditional customers, distribution channels and business partners, we may not realize some of the expected benefits of the merger. 

Prior to the merger, SmartForce and SkillSoft have each maintained separate and distinct customer bases, distribution channels and
business partners specific to their respective businesses. Following the merger, the combined company expects to take advantage of the customer bases and distribution channels of the formerly separate businesses in order to promote and sell the
products and services of one company to the traditional customers and business partners of the other company. The products and services of SmartForce and SkillSoft are highly technical and the salespersons of one company may not be successful in
marketing the products and services of the other company. In the event that the traditional customers and business partners of either SmartForce or SkillSoft are not receptive to the products and services of the other, we may not realize some of the
expected benefits of the merger, and the business of the combined company may be harmed. 

SmartForce and
SkillSoft may lose key personnel, customers and business partners due to uncertainties associated with the merger. 

Current and prospective employees, customers and business partners of SmartForce and SkillSoft may experience uncertainty about their future relationships with the combined company. Such uncertainty may



adversely affect the combined companys ability to attract and retain key management, sales, marketing and technical personnel. Current and prospective customers and business partners may,
in response to the announcement or consummation of the merger, delay or cancel purchasing decisions as they evaluate the likelihood of successful integration of the combined company or may instead purchase products or services from competitors.
Additionally, some of these customers and business partners may feel that the combined company poses new competitive threats to their businesses and as a result may seek to discontinue their relationships with SmartForce or SkillSoft or avoid
renewing or entering new relationships with the combined company. Any delay in, or cancellation of, purchasing decisions could adversely affect the business of the combined company. 

Some of SmartForces and SkillSofts current officers and directors have conflicts of interest that may influence them to support or approve the merger.

The directors and officers of SmartForce and SkillSoft participate in arrangements and have continuing
indemnification against liabilities that provide them with interests in the merger that are different from or are in addition to yours, including the following: 



Messrs. Gregory M. Priest, Jeffrey N. Newton, Paul Henry and Colm M. Darcy of SmartForce and Messrs. Charles E. Moran, Thomas J. McDonald, Jerald A. Nine and
Mark A. Townsend of SkillSoft will become executive officers of the combined company following the merger. In addition, Messrs. Priest, Moran, James S. Krzywicki, Ferdinand von Prondzynski, Stewart K.P. Gross and William T. Coleman will become
directors of the combined company. Certain of these officers and directors hold shares of SmartForce and/or SkillSoft stock, or options to purchase such shares. 



In connection with the merger, Messrs. Priest, Moran, Newton and Nine have entered into employment agreements, conditioned and effective upon the completion of
the merger, whereby each has been provided with certain incentives to remain employed by the combined company following the merger. 



In connection with the merger, SmartForce has agreed to amend certain of the outstanding option agreements of its current directors who will not be directors of
the combined company, including Messrs. Ronald C. Conway, John M. Grillos and Patrick J. McDonagh, so that each option held by them which is existing and vested on the closing date of the merger will remain exercisable following the termination of
the relevant optionees service as a director on the SmartForce board of directors for a period equal to the remaining unexpired portion of the options ten-year term. This action will not give any SmartForce director any rights to
purchase shares with respect to any options unvested at the time of the merger or that he would not otherwise have the right to purchase at the time of the merger. 



On July 12, 2002, following discussions of the boards of directors of both SmartForce and SkillSoft, SmartForce granted options to purchase an aggregate of
3,135,000 SmartForce ordinary shares (represented by SmartForce ADSs) at an exercise price of $3.30 per share to Messrs. Priest, Newton, Darcy and Henry as an incentive for their continued service with the combined company following the merger.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, SkillSoft is permitted to grant options for up to 2,400,000 shares of its common stock (equivalent to 5,681,760 SmartForce ordinary shares represented by ADSs based on the exchange ratio with respect to the
merger) between the execution of the merger agreement and the closing of the merger. Prior to the merger, SkillSofts board of directors anticipates granting options to Messrs. Moran, McDonald, Nine and Townsend as an incentive for their
continued service with the combined company following the merger. 



In connection with the merger, SkillSoft has agreed to amend the outstanding option agreement of Mr. John J. Neuhauser, a current SkillSoft director who
will not be a director of the combined company, so that the option to the extent existing and vested will remain exercisable following the termination of Mr. Neuhausers service as a director on the SkillSoft board of directors for a period of
four years from the grant date of the option. Pursuant to the terms of the SkillSoft 1999 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan, Mr. Neuhausers option will automatically vest and become immediately exercisable in full upon the completion of
the merger. 



SmartForce has agreed to cause its wholly owned subsidiary, SmartForce (USA), to indemnify each present and former SkillSoft officer and director against
liabilities arising out of such persons services



as an officer or director. SmartForce will also cause SmartForce (USA) to maintain officers and directors liability insurance to cover any such liabilities for a period of six years from
the effective time of the merger. 

Please see the summary of the terms of the employment agreements in the
section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled 
Employment Agreements
 under 
Agreements Related to the Merger
 on page 86 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. In addition, please see the summary of
the terms of the other arrangements described above in the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled 
Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger
 under 
The Proposed Merger
 on page 70 of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus. 

The receipt of compensation or other benefits in or contingent upon the merger,
or the continuation of indemnification arrangements for current officers or directors of SmartForce or SkillSoft may influence such persons to support or approve the merger. 

The combined company expects to operate under a new name, which may adversely affect its results of operations. 

Following the consummation of the merger, we intend to change the name of the combined company from SmartForce to a new name. The
adoption of this new name may prevent the combined company from taking advantage of certain goodwill existing customers and strategic partners of SmartForce and SkillSoft currently associate with their respective names. Further, we expect to incur
significant expense in effecting the name change and in marketing efforts to promote brand recognition of the new name, and these efforts may prove to be a distraction to the management of the combined company. During the process of selecting a new
name, SmartForce has undertaken a search of trademarks in multiple U.S. and international jurisdictions to evaluate the potential risk associated with the names we are considering. However, despite our efforts, our right to use the selected name in
a jurisdiction in which we now operate or may operate in the future may be challenged. Any claim, with or without merit, could result in costly administrative proceedings or litigation or require the combined company to cease use of such name, pay
damages or incur settlement expenses each of which could have a material adverse effect on the combined companys business. 

Risks Related to the Combined Company 

SmartForce and SkillSoft each have
experienced net losses in the past, and the combined company may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability. 

Although it recorded net income of $3.0 million in its fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, SmartForce has incurred substantial net losses both recently and in the past, including a net loss of $37.7 million in the three months ended
June 30, 2002, $19.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2002 and a net loss of $28.7 million in its fiscal year ended December 31, 2000. In addition, since SkillSoft began operations, it has incurred substantial net losses in every
fiscal quarter except for its fiscal quarters ended January 31, 2002 and April 30, 2002, in which it recorded net income of $926,000 and $282,000, respectively. SkillSoft had net losses of $8.3 million in the fiscal year ended January 31, 1999,
$22.9 million in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2000, $21.9 million in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2001 and $9.6 million in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2002. As a result of ongoing operating losses, SkillSoft had an accumulated
deficit of $63.6 million on January 31, 2002. We expect to incur significant expenses in connection with the integration of SkillSoft into SmartForce and the continued expansion of this combined business, and, as a result, the business will
need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability. We cannot predict whether the business of SmartForce, SkillSoft or the combined company will achieve or sustain profitability in any future period. 

SkillSoft and several of its executives, three of its key employees and its largest investor are defendants in litigation
with NETg which alleges, among other things, misappropriation of trade secrets; this litigation will continue to be costly, may divert the efforts of the combined companys management and may ultimately restrict the combined companys
ability to do business. 

SkillSoft, several of its executives, three of its key employees and its largest
investor are defendants in a lawsuit brought by National Education Training Group, Inc. (NETg), the former employer of these individuals.



NETg alleges in substance that the defendants breached their fiduciary and contractual obligations to NETg in connection with the organization and operation of SkillSoft, misappropriated trade
secrets from NETg, tortiously interfered with NETgs business and employees and breached provisions of a license agreement with NETg relating to the use of its software. NETg maintains that the trade secrets allegedly misappropriated by
SkillSoft and the other defendants include, among other things: 



various aspects of the design and functionality of its education and training software and products; 



customer lists and information; 



relationships with service providers; and 



NETgs soft skills product line business plan. 

The claims seek injunctive relief against the defendants demanding the return, and no future use by these defendants, of the alleged trade secrets. The claims also seek compensatory damages of $400
million and exemplary damages in the additional amount of $400 million, compensatory, incidental and consequential damages in an unspecified amount and punitive damages totaling $50 million or such other amount as the court deems just or
appropriate. Named as defendants in the lawsuit, in addition to SkillSoft, are Charles E. Moran, Jerald A. Nine, Jr., Mark A. Townsend, Lee A. Ritze, Dennis E. Brown, Sally H. Hovis, Warburg, Pincus Ventures, L.P., SkillSofts largest investor,
and each general partner of Warburg. 

In addition, NETg also filed suit against SkillSoft in July 2000 alleging
that its educational and training software products infringe a patent allegedly owned by NETg. The complaint seeks both monetary damages and injunctive relief. SkillSoft has filed an answer and a counterclaim for a declaration of invalidity of the
NETg patent. The lawsuit has been stayed pending resolution of SkillSofts efforts to have the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office declare the patent invalid. 

These lawsuits are still in discovery, and it is currently difficult to assess the potential liability of SkillSoft, the combined company or the other defendants. SkillSoft or the combined
companys failure to prevail in these cases could have any or all of the following significant adverse effects on the combined companys business and financial performance: 



injunctive relief against SkillSoft, the combined company and our officers and employees, which could significantly restrict the combined companys ability
to conduct its business; 



an adverse judgment against the combined company for monetary damages; 



a settlement on unfavorable terms to the combined company; 



obligations on the part of the combined company to indemnify its employees and directors for liabilities and expenses they incur in connection with the
lawsuits; 



obligations to customers for breach of warranties of noninfringement; or 



a requirement to reengineer the combined companys products to avoid patent infringement, which would likely result in additional expense and delay.

In addition, these cases, regardless of their outcome, will continue to result in significant
expenses in defending the lawsuits. SkillSofts legal expenses related to the defense of these lawsuits totaled approximately $1.9 million in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2000, $1.4 million in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2001 and
$1.7 million in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2002. Moreover, these lawsuits may divert the efforts and attention of the combined companys management team from normal business operations. 



The combined companys quarterly operating results may fluctuate
significantly. This limits your ability to evaluate historical financial results and increases the likelihood that the combined companys results will fall below market analysts expectations, which could cause the price of SmartForce ADSs
to drop rapidly and severely. 

SmartForce and SkillSoft have in the past experienced fluctuations in their
quarterly operating results, and we anticipate that these fluctuations will continue and could intensify in the future for the combined company. As a result, we believe that the combined companys quarterly revenue, expenses and operating
results are likely to vary significantly in the future. Thus, it is likely that in some future quarters, the combined companys results of operations will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, which could have a
severe adverse effect on the price of SmartForce ADSs. For example, SmartForces revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 1998 did not increase at a rate comparable to prior quarters. As a direct result, the trading price of SmartForce ADSs
decreased rapidly and significantly, having an extreme adverse effect on the value of an investment in its securities. SmartForces revenues and profits for the first quarter of 2002 also did not meet its expectations, causing a significant
reduction in the price of its shares. 

SmartForces and SkillSofts operating results have historically
fluctuated, and the combined companys operating results may in the future continue to fluctuate, as a result of factors, which include: 



the size and timing of new and renewal agreements; 



the number and size of outsourcing agreements or other agreements providing for professional services or the resale of instructor-led training; 



the mix of revenue between access to hosted content or platform services, up-front software licenses, software rental, professional services, maintenance and
resale of third parties products and services; 



royalty rates; 



the announcement, introduction and acceptance of new products, product enhancements and technologies by the combined company and its competitors; 



the mix of sales between the combined companys field sales force, its other direct sales channels and its telesales channels; 



the impact of any unanticipated decline in net revenues in any particular quarter as compared to the relatively fixed nature of the combined companys
expense levels in the short term; 



general conditions in the U.S. or the international economy; 



general conditions in the combined companys market or the markets served by its customers; 



the loss of significant customers; 



delays in availability of existing or new products; 



product or service quality problems; 



the spending patterns of the combined companys customers; 



litigation costs and expenses; 



non-recurring charges related to acquisitions; 



currency fluctuations; and 



the length of the combined companys sales cycles. 



The combined company will be managed by a management team consisting of
current SmartForce and SkillSoft executives, and this management team may undertake a strategy and business direction which is different from that which would be undertaken by SmartForces current management team. 

After the business combination, the new management team of the combined company will consist of certain current SmartForce and
SkillSoft executives. The manner in which the new management team conducts the business of the combined company, and the direction in which the new management team moves the business, may differ from the manner and direction in which the current
management of either SmartForce or SkillSoft would direct the combined or separate companies on a stand-alone basis. Such control by the new management team, together with the effects of future market factors and conditions, could ultimately evolve
into an integration and business strategy that, when implemented, differs from the strategy and business direction currently recommended by SmartForces or SkillSofts current management and board of directors. The new management team, and
any change in business or direction, may not improve, and could adversely impact, the combined companys financial condition and results of operations. 

Demand for the combined companys products and services may be especially susceptible to adverse economic conditions. 

The combined companys business and financial performance may be damaged by adverse financial conditions affecting its target customers or by a general weakening of
the economy. Some companies may not view training products and services as critical to the success of their businesses. If these companies experience disappointing operating results, whether as a result of adverse economic conditions, competitive
issues or other factors, they may decrease or forego education and training expenditures before limiting their other expenditures. For example, general economic weakness contributed to a reduction in SmartForces revenues in the first quarter
of 2002. 

In addition, the general condition of the economy, and by extension the combined companys
business, can be affected by social, political and military conditions. For example, the terrorist events of September 11, 2001 and their aftermath had a material adverse effect on SmartForces bookings in the second half of 2001 and may have
contributed to weakness in its bookings in the first quarter of 2002. It is not possible to predict the outcome of the escalation of hostilities between the United States and certain countries and persons related to the events of September 11. The
continuation of these hostilities could result in further weakness in the economy that would have an adverse impact on the combined companys operating results and financial condition. 

SmartForces experience in selling fully integrated, Internet-based learning solutions are relatively limited. 

In the fourth quarter of 1999, SmartForce introduced SmartForce e-Learning, its Internet-based learning solution. While the results of
SmartForces efforts to market these solutions to its customers have been positive, SmartForce has relatively limited experience with these solutions, which makes its historical results of limited value in predicting the potential success of
this initiative. The ultimate success of this initiative will depend on the combined companys ability to continue to expand and enhance its e-Learning offerings, to market and sell the new e-Learning solutions to existing and prospective
customers, to host, operate and manage its site, and to attract and retain key management and technical personnel. The combined company may not be successful in these efforts and the economic terms of any arrangements that might result from these
efforts may not be as favorable as the traditional licensing agreements. We believe that a lack of success in this regard could have a material adverse effect on the combined company. 

SmartForces and SkillSofts operating results have been, and the combined companys operating results will be, subject to seasonal fluctuations which
may adversely impact its business. 

SmartForces and SkillSofts operating results have been,
and the combined companys operating results will be, subject to seasonal fluctuations, based in part on customers annual budgetary cycles and in part on the annual nature of sales quotas. These seasonal trends have in the past caused
bookings in the first quarter of a year



to be less, perhaps substantially so, than bookings for the immediately preceding fourth quarter. We expect that these seasonal trends could continue to adversely affect the combined
companys operating results. In addition, SmartForce and SkillSoft have in past years added significant headcount in the sales and marketing and research and development functions in the first quarter, and to a lesser extent, the second
quarter. Because these headcount additions do not immediately contribute significant revenues, SmartForces and SkillSofts operating margins in the earlier part of the year have tended to be significantly lower than in the later parts of
the year. In addition, many technology companies also experience a seasonal downturn in demand during the summer months. These seasonal trends may have a material adverse effect on the combined companys results of operations. 

SmartForce and SkillSoft rely on strategic alliances for product development and marketing. Such alliances may be
terminated or fail to meet our requirements in the future. 

SmartForce and SkillSoft have developed
strategic alliances to develop and market many of their respective products, and believe that an increasing proportion of the combined companys future revenues may be attributable to products developed and marketed through these and other
future alliances. In addition, SkillSofts Books24x7.com Group relies on third party publishers to provide all of the content incorporated into its referenceware products. However, these relationships are not exclusive and the combined company
may be unable to continue to develop future products through these alliances in a timely fashion or may be unable to negotiate additional alliances in the future on acceptable terms, if at all. 

In the event that the combined company is unable to maintain or expand its current development and marketing alliances or enter into new development and marketing
alliances, its operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, it will be required to pay royalties to the combined companys development and marketing partners on products developed with them,
which could reduce the combined companys gross margins. We expect that cost of revenues may fluctuate from period to period in the future based upon many factors, including the revenue mix and the timing of expenses associated with development
and marketing alliances. In addition, the collaborative nature of the development process under these alliances may result in longer development times and less control over the timing of product introductions than for e-Learning offerings developed
solely by the combined company. The combined companys strategic alliance partners may from time to time renegotiate the terms of their agreement with the combined company, which could result in changes to the royalty or other arrangements,
adversely affecting the combined companys results of operations. 

Our strategic partners may aid our
competitors, or compete with us directly. 

The independent third party strategic partners we rely on for
educational content and product marketing may compete with us, harming our results of operations. Our agreements with these third parties generally do not restrict them from developing courses on similar topics for our competitors or from competing
directly with us. As a result, our competitors may be able to duplicate some of our course content and gain a competitive advantage. The product development and marketing efforts of the combined companys strategic partners may also disrupt its
direct sales efforts. The combined companys development and marketing partners could pursue their existing or alternative training programs in preference to and in competition with those being developed by the combined company. 

The combined companys success depends on its ability to meet the needs of the rapidly changing market.

The market for interactive education and training is influenced by rapidly changing technology, evolving
industry standards, changes in customer requirements and preferences and frequent introductions of new products and services embodying new technologies. New methods of providing interactive education in a technology-based format are being developed
and offered in the marketplace, including intranet and Internet offerings. Many of these new offerings involve new and different business models and contracting mechanisms. In addition, multimedia and other product functionality features are being
added to educational software. Accordingly, the



combined companys future success will depend upon the extent to which it is able to develop and implement products which address these emerging market requirements on a cost effective and
timely basis. Product development is risky because it is difficult to foresee developments in technology, coordinate technical personnel and identify and eliminate design flaws. Any significant delay in releasing new products could have a material
adverse effect on the ultimate success of the combined companys products and could reduce sales of predecessor products. The combined company may not be able to introduce new products on a timely basis. In addition, new products introduced by
the combined company may fail to achieve a significant degree of market acceptance or, once accepted, may fail to sustain viability in the market for any significant period. If the combined company is unsuccessful in addressing the changing needs of
the marketplace due to resource, technological or other constraints, or in anticipating and responding adequately to changes in customers software technology and preferences, the combined companys business and results of operations would
be materially adversely affected. 

The success of the combined companys e-Learning strategy depends on
the reliability and consistent performance of its information systems and Internet infrastructure. 

The
success of the combined companys e-Learning strategy is highly dependent on the consistent performance of its information systems and Internet infrastructure. If the combined companys Web site fails for any reason or if it experiences
any unscheduled down times, even for only a short period, the combined companys business and reputation could be materially harmed. SmartForce and SkillSoft have in the past experienced performance problems and unscheduled downtime, and these
problems could recur. SmartForce and SkillSoft currently rely on, and the combined company will rely on, third parties for proper functioning of computer infrastructure, delivery of its e-Learning applications and the performance of its destination
site. The combined companys systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins, earthquake, financial patterns of hosting providers and similar events. Any system failures
could adversely affect customer usage of the combined companys solutions and user traffic results in any future quarters, which could adversely affect the combined companys revenues and operating results and harm the combined
companys reputation with corporate customers, subscribers and commerce partners. A key element of the combined companys strategy will be to generate a high volume of traffic to the Web site and create a significant subscriber base.
Accordingly, the satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of the combined companys Web site and computer infrastructure is critical to the combined companys reputation and ability to attract and retain corporate customers,
subscribers and commerce partners. We cannot accurately project the rate or timing of any increases in traffic to the combined companys Web site and, therefore, the integration and timing of any upgrades or enhancements required to facilitate
any significant traffic increase to the Web site are uncertain. SmartForce and SkillSoft have in the past experienced difficulties in upgrading their site infrastructure to handle increased traffic, and these difficulties could recur. The failure to
expand and upgrade the Web site or any system error, failure or extended down time, could materially harm the combined companys business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. 

The e-Learning market is a developing market, and the combined companys business will suffer if e-Learning is not widely
accepted. 

The market for e-Learning is a new and emerging market. Corporate training and education has
historically been conducted primarily through classroom instruction and has traditionally been performed by a companys internal personnel. Many companies have invested heavily in their current training solutions. Although technology-based
training applications have been available for several years, they currently account for only a small portion of the overall training market. 

Accordingly, the combined companys future success will depend upon the extent to which companies adopt technology-based solutions and use the Internet in connection with their training
activities, and the extent to which companies utilize the services or purchase products of third-party providers. Many companies that have already invested substantial resources in traditional methods of corporate training may be reluctant to adopt
a new strategy that may compete with their existing investments. Even if companies implement technology-based



training or Internet learning solutions, they may still choose to design, develop, deliver or manage all or part of their education and training internally. If technology based learning and the
use of the Internet for learning does not become widespread, or if companies do not use the products and services of third parties to develop, deliver or manage their training needs, then the combined companys products and service, may not
achieve commercial success. 

The combined company may fail to integrate adequately acquired products,
technologies and businesses. 

SmartForce and SkillSoft regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities
and have made, and will likely in the future continue to make, acquisitions that would provide additional product or service offerings, additional industry expertise or an expanded geographic presence. For example, in April 2001, SmartForce acquired
icGlobal Corporation, a provider of learning management system software. In August 2001, SmartForce acquired substantially all of the assets of Impaxselling.com Ltd., a sales performance company providing global enterprises with web-based learning
solutions designed to improve sales and account management performance. In October 2001, SmartForce acquired SkillScape Solutions, Inc., a provider of competency management systems. In December 2001, SkillSoft acquired Books24x7.com, Inc., a
provider of Web-based digital, technical and reference content. In January 2002, SmartForce acquired certain assets of M2S Prokoda GmbH, an e-Learning vendor with its key operations in Germany. In June 2002, SmartForce acquired certain assets of
Frontline Telcom Training and Performance Company (Nova Scotia), and Frontline Telcom Training and Performance Company (Georgia), providers of training outsourcing. The combined company may be unable to locate attractive opportunities or acquire any
opportunities that it locates on attractive terms. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other
intangible assets, which could materially adversely affect the combined companys results of operations. 

Product and technology acquisitions also entail numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations, technologies and products, diversion of managements attention to other business concerns, risks
of entering markets in which the combined company has no or limited prior experience and the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies. The combined company may be unable to integrate successfully, or identify and eliminate redundancies
or underperforming assets or properties resulting from, any operations, personnel or products that have been acquired or that might be acquired in the future. Further, the revenues from the acquired businesses may not be sufficient to support the
costs associated with those businesses, without adversely affecting the combined companys operating margins in the future. The combined companys failure to successfully complete the integration of acquired businesses in a timely fashion,
if at all, or to generate sufficient revenues from acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. 

The combined companys failure to manage its rapid expansion effectively could hurt the combined companys operations and business. 

SmartForce and SkillSoft have recently experienced rapid expansion of their operations, which has placed, and is expected to continue to
place, significant demands on the combined companys executive, administrative, operational and financial personnel and systems. The combined companys future operating results will substantially depend on the ability of its officers and
key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve its operational, financial control and reporting systems. In particular, the combined company will require significant improvement in its order entry, fulfillment and
management information systems in order to support its expanded operations. If the combined company is unable to respond to and manage changing business conditions, its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

SmartForces and SkillSofts expense levels are fixed in the short term. As a result, the
combined company may be unable to adjust spending to compensate for unexpected revenue shortfalls. 

SmartForces and SkillSofts expense levels are based in significant part on their respective expectations regarding future revenues and are fixed to a large extent in the short term. Accordingly, following the merger, the



combined company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. Any significant revenue shortfall would therefore have a material adverse
effect on the combined companys results of operations. This risk materialized for SmartForce in the three months ended March 31, 2002 and in the third quarter of 1998, where profit was dramatically negatively affected by a shortfall in
revenues compared to managements expectations. 

SmartForces restructuring plan may be
ineffective or may limit the combined companys ability to compete. 

Actions SmartForce has taken in
response to the recent decrease in its revenues could have long-term adverse effects on the combined companys business. To bring its cost base in line with decreased revenues, on April 18, 2002, SmartForce announced details of a restructuring
and a cost reduction plan, which it proceeded to implement immediately following the announcement. At the time of the announcement, SmartForce anticipated that the restructuring plan would require reducing its workforce by over 20%, implementing
hiring and pay freezes, consolidating facilities and other activities. There are several risks inherent in these efforts to transition to a new cost structure. These include the risk that SmartForce will not be successful in achieving its planned
cost reductions, and that even if SmartForce is successful in doing so, it will still not be able to reduce expenditures quickly enough to restore profitability, and hence that SmartForce or the combined company may have to undertake further
restructuring initiatives that would entail additional charges and create additional risks. In addition, there is the risk that cost-cutting initiatives will impair the ability of SmartForce or the combined company to effectively develop and market
products and remain competitive. Each of the above measures could have long-term effects on the combined companys business by reducing its pool of talent, decreasing or slowing improvements in its products, making it more difficult for the
combined company to respond to customers, limiting its ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for its products increases and limiting its ability to hire and retain key personnel. These circumstances could cause the combined
company earnings to be lower than they otherwise might be. 

The combined company will depend on a few key
personnel to manage and operate the business and must be able to attract and retain highly qualified employees. 

The combined companys success will be largely dependent on the personal efforts and abilities of its senior management, including Charles E. Moran, the intended Chief Executive Officer of the combined company and the current
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of SkillSoft, and Gregory M. Priest, the intended Chairman and Chief Strategy Officer of the combined company and the current Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of SmartForce. Failure to
retain these executives, or the loss of certain additional senior management personnel or other key employees, could have a material adverse effect on the combined companys business and future prospects. Further, in connection with
SmartForces restructuring, following the first quarter of 2002, certain of its top executives were no longer employed by SmartForce. If the combined company fails to manage this transition effectively, the results of operations of the combined
company could be negatively affected. 

The combined company will also be dependent on the continued service of its
key sales, content development and operational personnel and on its ability to attract, train, motivate and retain highly qualified employees. In addition, the combined company will depend on writers, programmers, Web designers and graphic artists.
We expect to continue to hire additional content development, programming, sales and marketing, information systems and accounting staff. However, the combined company may be unsuccessful in attracting, training, retaining or motivating key
personnel. In particular, SmartForces recent adverse operating results, stock price performance and restructuring and cost reduction plans could create uncertainties that materially and adversely affect its ability to attract and retain key
personnel. The inability to hire, train and retain qualified personnel or the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect upon the combined companys business, new product development efforts and future business
prospects. 



Increased competition may result in decreased demand for the combined
companys products and services, which may result in reduced revenues and gross margins and loss of market share. 

The market for business education training solutions is immature, highly fragmented and competitive, and is subject to rapid technological change. We expect the market to become increasingly competitive due to the lack of significant
barriers to entry. In addition to increased competition from new companies entering into the market, established companies are entering into the market through acquisitions of smaller companies, which directly compete with SmartForce and SkillSoft,
and this trend is expected to continue. The combined company may also face competition from publishing companies and vendors of application software, including those vendors with whom SmartForce or SkillSoft have formed development and marketing
alliances. 

SmartForces and SkillSofts primary source of direct competition comes from third-party
suppliers of instructor-led information technology, business, management and professional skills education and training as well as suppliers of computer-based training and e-Learning solutions. SmartForce and SkillSoft also face indirect competition
from internal education and training departments of their potential customers. With respect to different aspects of SkillSofts collaboration solution, competition occurs from a variety of software and service vendors. SmartForce and SkillSoft
also compete to a lesser extent with consultants, value-added resellers and network integrators. Certain of these value-added resellers also market products that compete with those of SmartForce and SkillSoft. We expect that as organizations
increase their dependence on outside suppliers of training, the combined company will face increasing competition from these other suppliers as education and training managers more frequently compare training products provided by outside suppliers.

Growing competition may result in price reductions, reduced revenue and gross margins and loss of market share,
any one of which would have a material adverse effect on the combined companys business. Many of SmartForces and SkillSofts current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and
other resources, as well as greater name recognition, and we expect to face increasing price pressures from competitors as managers demand more value for their training budgets. Accordingly, following the merger, the combined company may be unable
to provide e-Learning solutions that compare favorably with new instructor-led techniques, other interactive training software or new e-Learning solutions or competitive pressures may require the combined company to reduce its prices significantly.

The combined companys business will be subject to currency fluctuations that could adversely affect
its operating results. 

Due to SmartForces multinational operations, SmartForces business is
currently subject to, and the combined companys business will be subject to, fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates between the currencies in which revenues are collected or expenses are paid. In particular, the value of the
U.S. dollar against the euro and related currencies will impact the combined companys operating results. The combined companys expenses will not necessarily be incurred in the currency in which revenue is generated, and, as a result, the
combined company will be required from time to time to convert currencies to meet its obligations. 

These currency
conversions are subject to exchange rate fluctuations, and changes to the value of the euro, pound sterling and other currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the combined companys business and results of operations.

The combined companys corporate tax rate may increase, which could adversely affect the combined
companys cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. 

The combined companys
corporate tax rate may increase, which could adversely affect the combined companys cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. SmartForce currently has significant foreign operations and generates a majority of its taxable
income in the Republic of Ireland, and some of SmartForces Irish operating subsidiaries are taxed at rates substantially lower than tax rates in effect in the United States and other countries in which SmartForce has operations. As
SkillSofts assets and properties are substantially located



in, and its business operations are principally conducted in, the United States, the combined company will be required to reorganize SkillSofts operations and repatriate certain assets to
Ireland in order to maintain a combined company effective tax rate at the level currently applicable to SmartForce. If following the merger the combined company is unable to effect such a reorganization, or if at any time following the combined
companys Irish subsidiaries were no longer to qualify for these lower tax rates or if the applicable tax laws were rescinded or changed, the combined companys operating results could be materially adversely affected. Moreover, because
the combined company will incur income tax in several countries, an increase in the combined companys profitability in one or more of these countries could result in a higher overall tax rate. In addition, if U.S. or other foreign tax
authorities were to change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge the manner in which the combined companys subsidiaries profits are currently recognized, the combined companys taxes could increase, and the combined
companys business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Although SmartForce will be acquiring SkillSoft as a legal matter, SkillSoft will be considered the acquirer for accounting
purposes, and as such no financial statement benefit will be available to the combined company for pre-existing net operating losses of SmartForce. There may be limitations imposed on the level and timing of utilization of historic net operating
losses for tax purposes as a result of the merger. These limitations may apply to either or both SmartForce and SkillSoft and may adversely impact cash flow depending on the extent of any such limitation. These limitations may also adversely impact
operating results if they apply to SkillSofts historic net operating losses. 

The combined
company may be unable to protect its proprietary rights. Unauthorized use of the combined companys technology may result in development of products or services that compete with those of the combined company. 

The success of the combined company depends to a significant degree upon the protection of its rights in intellectual property and its
trade secrets. SmartForce currently relies upon, and the combined company will rely upon, a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and customer license agreements, and other methods to protect its proprietary rights.
SmartForce and SkillSoft have also entered into, and the combined company will continue to enter into, confidentiality agreements with their employees, consultants and third parties to seek to limit and protect the distribution of their proprietary
information. However, neither SmartForce nor SkillSoft has signed protective agreements in every case. 

Although
SmartForce and SkillSoft have taken steps to protect their respective proprietary technologies, these steps may be inadequate. Existing patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws offer only limited protection, Moreover, the laws of other
countries in which SmartForce and SkillSoft market their products may afford little or no effective protection of their intellectual property. Additionally, unauthorized parties may copy aspects of the combined companys products, services or
technology or obtain and use information that the combined company will regard as proprietary. Other parties may also breach confidentiality agreements and other protective contracts SmartForce or SkillSoft have executed or the combined company will
in the future execute. The combined company may not become aware of, or have adequate remedies in the event of, a breach. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce the combined companys intellectual property rights, to protect trade
secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Even if the combined company were to prevail, this litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources. 

Pending and any future claims that SmartForce, SkillSoft or the combined company infringes upon the intellectual property
rights of others could result in costly litigation or royalty payments to third parties, or require the combined company to reengineer or cease sales of its products or services. 

Third parties have in the past and could in the future claim that SmartForces or SkillSofts current or the combined companys future products infringe
their intellectual property rights. Any claim, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation or require the combined company to reengineer or cease sales of the combined companys products or services, any of which could have a
material adverse effect on the combined companys



business. Infringement claims could also result in an injunction in the use of the combined companys products or require the combined company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.
Licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to the combined company or at all. On April 23, 2002, IP Learn, LLC (IP Learn) filed a lawsuit against SmartForce alleging that SmartForce infringed five United States
patents assigned to IP Learn, and asking the court for a preliminary and permanent injunction as well as unspecified damages. SmartForce is presently in the process of evaluating IP Learns claims and is vigorously defending itself. On May 31,
2002, IP Learn filed a lawsuit against SkillSoft alleging that SkillSoft infringes on four patents assigned to IP Learn, and asking the court for a preliminary and permanent injunction as well as unspecified damages. SkillSoft is presently in the
process of evaluating IP Learns claims and is vigorously defending itself. On June 13, 2002, Lionet Limited, a limited liability company incorporated and doing business in Ireland, filed a claim against SmartForce in Dublin, alleging, among
other things, that SmartForce breached the terms of its software license agreement with Lionet Limited in that it permitted or failed to prevent the decompilation of the provided software products and has failed to cooperate in audits to determine
the nature of such alleged copying or de-compilation. Lionet Limited is seeking damages for lost license fees of $6.8 million and seeks other damages. SmartForce is in the process of reviewing the statement of claim and intends to vigorously
defend itself in this matter. In addition, SkillSoft and certain of its employees, officers and investors are currently defendants in a lawsuit filed by NETg alleging, among other things, trade secret misappropriation, as discussed in greater detail
above. From time to time SmartForce and SkillSoft learn of parties that claim broad intellectual property rights in the e-Learning area that might implicate SmartForces and SkillSofts offerings. These parties or others could initiate
actions against the combined company in the future. 

SmartForce is subject to other pending legal
proceedings and the combined company may become subject to additional legal proceedings. Adverse determinations in these proceedings could materially harm the combined companys business. 

Since the end of the third quarter of 1998, a class action lawsuit has been pending in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California against SmartForce, one of SmartForces subsidiaries, SmartForce USA, and certain of SmartForces former and current officers and directors, alleging violation of the federal securities laws. It has been alleged in
this lawsuit that SmartForce misrepresented or omitted to state material facts regarding SmartForces business and financial condition and prospects in order to artificially inflate and maintain the price of SmartForces ADSs, and
misrepresented or omitted to state material facts in SmartForces registration statement and prospectus issued in connection with SmartForces merger with Forefront, which also is alleged to have artificially inflated the price of
SmartForces ADSs. 

SmartForce believes that this action is without merit and intends to vigorously defend
itself. Although SmartForce cannot presently determine the outcome of this action, an adverse resolution of this matter could significantly negatively impact the combined companys financial position and results of operations. 

The combined company may be from time to time involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary
course of business. An adverse resolution of these matters could significantly negatively impact the combined companys financial position and results of operations. 

The combined companys non-U.S. operations will be subject to risks which could negatively impact its future operating results. 

We expect that international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of the combined companys revenues, and
intend to continue to expand the combined companys operations outside of the United States. Operations outside of the United States are subject to inherent risks, including: 



difficulties or delays in developing and supporting non-English language versions of the combined companys products and services; 



political and economic conditions in various jurisdictions; 





difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations; 



longer sales and account receivable payment cycles; 



multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations; 



foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; 



protectionist laws and business practices that may favor local competitors; 



difficulties in finding and managing local resellers; 



potential adverse tax consequences; and 



the absence or significant lack of legal protection for intellectual property rights. 

Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the combined companys future operations outside of the United States, which could negatively impact
the combined companys future operating results. 

Because many users of the combined companys
e-Learning solutions will access them over the Internet, factors adversely affecting the use of the Internet could harm the combined companys business. 

Many of SmartForces and SkillSofts users currently access, and the combined companys users will access, their e-Learning solutions over the Internet. Any
factors that adversely affect Internet usage could disrupt the ability of those users to access the combined companys e-Learning solutions, which would adversely affect customer satisfaction and therefore the combined companys business.

For example, the combined companys ability to increase the effectiveness and scope of its services to
customers is ultimately limited by the speed and reliability of both the Internet and its customers internal networks. Consequently, the emergence and growth of the market for the combined companys products and services depends upon the
improvements being made to the entire Internet as well as to its individual customers networking infrastructures to alleviate overloading and congestion. If these improvements are not made, the ability of the combined companys customers
to use its products and services will be hindered, and its revenues may suffer. 

Additionally, a requirement for
the continued growth of accessing e-Learning solutions over the Internet is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Failure to prevent security breaches into the combined companys products or its
customers networks, or well-publicized security breaches affecting the Internet in general could significantly harm its growth and revenue. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments
may result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms the combined company uses to protect content and transactions, its products or its customers proprietary information in its databases. Anyone who is able to circumvent the combined
companys security measures could misappropriate proprietary and confidential information or could cause interruptions in its operations. The combined company may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against
such security breaches or to address problems caused by security breaches. The privacy of users may also deter people from using the Internet to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential information. 

The market price for SmartForces ADSs may fluctuate and may not be sustainable. 

The market price of SmartForces ADSs has fluctuated significantly since SmartForces initial public offering and is likely to
continue to be volatile. We believe that many factors, including the following, could cause the price of SmartForces ADSs to fluctuate, perhaps substantially: 



announcements of developments related to the combined companys or its competitors business; 



announcements of new products or enhancements by the combined company or its competitors; 





the combined companys success and timing in developing and introducing new products and enhancements to existing products; 



changes in pricing policies by the combined company or its competitors; 



the length of the combined companys sales cycle; 



cancellations of, or failure to renew, contracts by existing customers; 



changes in customer buying patterns; 



market entry by new competitors; 



sales of SmartForces ADSs into the public market; 



developments in the combined companys relationships with its customers, partners and distributors; 



shortfalls or changes in revenues, gross margins, earnings or losses or other financial results which differ from public market expectations; 



changes in the public market expectation of the combined companys performance or industry performance; 



changes in market valuations of competitors; 



regulatory developments; 



additions or departures of key personnel; 



fluctuations in results of operations; and 



general conditions in the combined companys markets or the markets served by the combined companys customers or in the U.S. and/or the international
economy. 

In addition, in recent years the stock market in general, and the market for shares
of technology stocks in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. The market price of SmartForces ADSs may continue to experience
significant fluctuations in the future, including fluctuations that are unrelated to the combined companys performance. To succeed, the combined company must continue to expand its content offerings, upgrade its technology and distinguish its
solution. The combined company may not be able to do so successfully. Any failure by the combined company to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences or any significant delays in content development or
implementation could impact the combined companys ability to capture market share. 

The combined
companys sales cycle may make it difficult to predict its operating results. 

SmartForce and
SkillSoft have long sales cycles because they generally need to educate potential customers regarding the benefits of their live online e-Learning and business collaboration products and services prior to sale. SmartForces and SkillSofts
sales cycle vary depending on the size and type of customer contemplating a purchase and whether they have conducted business with a potential customer in the past. Potential customers frequently need to obtain approvals from multiple decision
makers within their organization prior to making purchase decisions. These long sales cycles which typically range from three to twelve months or more, make it difficult to predict the quarter in which sales may occur. Delays in sales could cause
significant variability in the combined companys revenues and operating results for any particular period. 

The combined companys business could be adversely affected if its products contain errors. 

Software products as complex as the combined companys may contain undetected errors or bugs that result in product failures. From time to time SmartForce and SkillSoft have identified errors in their products



after commercial introduction of the products. The occurrence of errors could result in loss of or delay in revenues, loss of market share, diversion of product development resources, injury to
reputation or damage to efforts to build brand awareness, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the combined companys business, operating results and financial condition. 

The combined company could incur substantial costs resulting from product liability claims relating to its customers use of the combined companys
products and services. 

Many of the business interactions supported by SmartForces and
SkillSofts products and services are critical to their customers businesses. Any failure in a customers business interaction or other collaborative activity caused or allegedly caused in the future by the combined companys
products and services could result in a claim for substantial damages against the combined company, regardless of its responsibility for the failure. Although the combined company will maintain general liability insurance, including coverage for
errors and omissions, there can be no assurance that existing coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in amounts sufficient to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as
to any future claim. 

We could be subjected to legal actions based upon the content we obtain from third
parties over whom we exert limited control. 

It is possible that we could become subject to legal actions
based upon claims that our course content infringes the rights of others or is erroneous. Any such claims, with or without merit, could subject us to costly litigation and the diversion of our financial resources and management personnel. The risk
of such claims is exacerbated by the fact that our course content is provided by third parties over whom we exert limited control. Further, if those claims are successful, we may be required to alter the content, pay financial damages or obtain
content from others. 

Risks Relating to SkillSofts engagement of Arthur Andersen LLP as its auditors 

SkillSoft has not obtained the consent of Arthur Andersen LLP to be named in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as
having audited the SkillSoft financial statements. This may limit your ability to assert claims against Arthur Andersen. 

Effective June 19, 2002, the partner in charge of auditing SkillSoft left Arthur Andersen LLP and joined Ernst & Young LLP. Effective June 25, 2002, SkillSoft engaged Ernst & Young LLP as its independent auditors.
After reasonable efforts, SkillSoft has been unable to obtain the consent of Arthur Andersen LLP to the incorporation into the registration statement, of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part, of their report with respect to the
consolidated financial statements of SkillSoft which appear in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2002. Under these circumstances, Rule 437(a) under the Securities Act permits the registration statement to be filed without
a written consent from Arthur Andersen LLP. The absence of such consent may limit your recovery on certain claims. In particular, and without limitation, you will not be able to assert claims against Arthur Andersen LLP under Section 11 of the
Securities Act for any untrue statement of a material fact contained in SkillSoft's consolidated financial statements which appear in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2002 or any omission to state a material fact
required to be stated therein. 

The conviction of Arthur Andersen LLP on obstruction of justice
charges may adversely affect Arthur Andersen LLPs ability to satisfy any claims arising from the provision of auditing services to SkillSoft and may impede the combined companys access to capital markets after the merger.

Arthur Andersen LLP audited SkillSofts financial statements incorporated by reference in
the registration statement, of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part, for the years ended January 31, 2002,



January 31, 2001 and January 31, 2000. On March 14, 2002, an indictment was unsealed charging it with federal obstruction of justice arising from the government's investigation of Enron
Corp. On June 15, 2002, Arthur Andersen LLP was convicted of these charges. It is possible that the effect of this conviction on Arthur Andersen LLPs financial condition may adversely affect the ability of Arthur Andersen LLP to satisfy any
claims arising from its provision of auditing services to SkillSoft. 

Should SmartForce seek to access
the public capital markets after the merger is completed, SEC rules will require SmartForce to include or incorporate by reference in any prospectus three years of audited financial statements. The SECs current rules would require SmartForce
to present audited financial statements for one or more fiscal years audited by Arthur Andersen LLP and use reasonable efforts to obtain its consent until the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2005 become available.
If prior to that time the SEC ceases accepting financial statements audited by Arthur Andersen LLP, it is possible that the available audited financial statements for the years ended January 31, 2002, January 31, 2001 and January 31, 2000 audited by
Arthur Andersen LLP might not satisfy the SECs requirements. In that case, SmartForce would be unable to access the public capital markets unless Ernst & Young LLP, SmartForces current independent accounting firm, or another
independent accounting firm, is able to audit the financial statements originally audited by Arthur Andersen LLP. Any delay or inability to access the public capital markets caused by these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on the
combined companys business, profitability and growth prospects.

SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA OF SKILLSOFT

SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL DATA 

The following selected
unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial data have been provided to illustrate what the results of operations and financial position of the combined business of SmartForce and SkillSoft might have looked like had the merger occurred at an
earlier date. This information is provided for illustrative purposes only and does not show what the results of operations or financial position of the combined company would have been if the merger actually occurred on the dates assumed. In
addition, this information does not indicate what the combined companys future consolidated operating results or consolidated financial position will be. 

How the pro forma financial data was prepared 

These statements give effect to the
proposed merger of SmartForce and SkillSoft using the purchase method of accounting. Although SmartForce will be acquiring SkillSoft as a legal matter, SkillSoft will be considered the acquirer for accounting purposes. The unaudited pro forma
combined condensed statement of operations data for the year ended January 31, 2002 and the three months ended April 30, 2002 assumes the merger took place on February 1, 2001. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet data assumes
the merger took place on April 30, 2002. 

These pro forma financial statements have been based on assumptions 

The selected unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial data is based on estimates and assumptions described in the notes
to them. This data is presented for information purposes only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated results of operations or financial condition of SmartForce that would have been reported had the merger been
completed as of the dates presented, and should not be taken as representative of future consolidated results of operations or financial condition of SmartForce. 

You should read these summary pro forma financial statements with the historical financial statements 

This selected unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial data should be read in conjunction with the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements and notes thereto appearing on page 121 of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus and the historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of SmartForce, the historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of SkillSoft, and other financial information pertaining to the two
companies incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See

COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA 

The following table presents unaudited comparative
historical per share data of SmartForce and SkillSoft and unaudited combined pro forma per share data after giving effect to the merger as a purchase by SkillSoft of SmartForce assuming the merger had been consummated at the beginning of the period
presented below. The following data assumes 2.3674 SmartForce ordinary shares, represented by ADSs, will be issued in exchange for each share of SkillSoft common stock in connection with the merger and assumes the assumption of SkillSoft options
based upon the same exchange ratio. This data has been derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the selected historical financial data, selected unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial data, unaudited pro forma combined
condensed financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and the separate audited financial statements of SmartForce and SkillSoft and notes thereto, that are incorporated by reference in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus. The unaudited pro forma per share data is presented for information purposes only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated results of operations or financial condition of the combined
company that would have been reported had the merger been completed as of the dates presented, and should not be taken as representative of the future consolidated results of operations or financial condition of the combined company.

Computed by dividing total shareholders equity by the number of shares of capital stock outstanding at the end of the period on a historical and pro forma
combined basis, as applicable. 

(2)

Basic pro forma loss per share is calculated based on the exchange of 14,921,000 and 17,367,000 shares of SkillSoft common stock outstanding on a weighted
average basis during the twelve-month period ended January 31, 2002 and during the three month period ended April 30, 2002, respectively, for SmartForce ordinary shares at the merger exchange ratio of 2.3674 SmartForce ordinary shares per share of
SkillSoft common stock. Diluted pro forma loss per share was the same as basic pro forma loss per share due to anti-dilutive impact of common stock equivalents. 

(3)

Computed by multiplying pro forma combined information by the inverse of the exchange ratio of 2.3674, or 0.422, as SkillSoft is deemed to be the acquirer in
the merger for accounting purposes. 



COMPARATIVE PER SHARE MARKET PRICE DATA 

SmartForce ADSs trade on the Nasdaq
National Market under the symbol SMTF. SkillSoft common stock trades on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol SKIL. The following table shows the high and low per share sale prices of SmartForce ADSs and SkillSoft
common stock each as reported on the Nasdaq National Market on (1) June 10, 2002, the last full trading day preceding the public announcement that SkillSoft and SmartForce had entered into the merger agreement and (2) July 26, 2002, the last full
trading day for which high and low prices were available at the time of the printing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The table also includes the comparable high and low per share sale price of SkillSoft common stock on those dates. This
comparable high and low per share price data reflects the fluctuating value of the SmartForce ADSs that SkillSoft stockholders would receive in exchange for each share of SkillSoft common stock if the merger was completed on either of those dates,
applying the exchange ratio of 2.3674 SmartForce ordinary shares, represented by ADSs, for each share of SkillSoft common stock. As of June 10, 2002, there were approximately 
102 holders of record of SkillSoft common stock and 336 holders of
record of SmartForce ADSs.

produced to the meeting and initialed by the Chairman for the purposes of identification (a copy of which was included in the joint proxy statement/prospectus circulated to all of the members of SmartForce on 
August 8, 2002) relating to the
merger of Slate Acquisition Corp. (a wholly owned subsidiary of SmartForce) with and into SkillSoft and the automatic conversion of each share of common stock of SkillSoft outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the merger into a right
to receive 2.3674 ordinary shares of 0.11 each in the capital of SmartForce (or American Depositary Shares, or ADSs, representing such ordinary shares) and the assumption by SmartForce of all outstanding options to purchase shares of SkillSoft
common stock, such merger and the issuance of ordinary shares of 0.11 each in the capital of SmartForce (or ADSs representing such ordinary shares) pursuant to the merger;

might require equity securities to be allotted after such expiry and the directors may allot equity securities pursuant to any such offer or agreement as if the power thereby conferred had not expired. 

For more information regarding the proposals described above, see 
Proposal to SmartForce Shareholders To Be Voted
On At SmartForce Extraordinary General Meeting 
on page 132. 

Record Date 

Record Date for Holders of SmartForce Ordinary
Shares
.    Holders of SmartForce ordinary shares, or Members, whose names appear in the Register of Members, maintained by our registrars, Computershare Investor Services (Ireland) Limited, on the date materials are mailed to
Members are entitled to receive notice of the extraordinary general meeting or any adjournment of the extraordinary general meeting. In addition, any person who is a Member on the date of the extraordinary general meeting is entitled to attend and
vote at the extraordinary general meeting and any adjournment of the annual general meeting. 

Record Date
for Holders of SmartForce ADSs
.    The Bank of New York, as the registrar and transfer agent for our ADSs, as well as the depositary for SmartForce ordinary shares represented by the ADSs, has fixed the close of business on
August 2, 2002 as the record date for determining the ADS holders entitled to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights at the extraordinary general meeting and any adjournment of the extraordinary general meeting. 

As of the ADS record date, there were 
[            ]

SmartForce ordinary shares, par value 0.11 per share, issued and outstanding (or 
[            ]
 equivalent ADSs) held by approximately

[            ]
 holders of record. Each ADS represents one SmartForce ordinary share. The ADSs are quoted on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol SMTF. As of the
record date, there were approximately 
[            ]
 registered holders of SmartForce ADSs. The SmartForce ordinary shares represented by the ADSs are owned of record by AIB
Custodial Nominees Limited on behalf of The Bank of New York. 



Quorum 

To conduct business at the extraordinary general meeting, a quorum must be
present. SmartForces articles of association provide that the presence at an extraordinary general meeting, either in person or by proxy, of three persons entitled to vote at the extraordinary general meeting, and who together hold not less
than one-third of SmartForce voting share capital in issue, each being a Member or a proxy for a Member or a duly authorized representative of a corporate Member, constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business. SmartForce will treat ordinary
shares represented by a properly signed and returned proxy, including abstentions, as present at the meeting for the purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business. 

Voting of Ordinary Shares 

Generally
.    Votes may be given
at the extraordinary general meeting either personally or by proxy. Voting at the extraordinary general meeting will be by a show of hands, unless a poll (a count of the number of shares voted) is duly demanded. On a show of hands, each shareholder
present in person and every proxy shall have one vote, provided that no individual shall have more than one vote, and, on a poll, each shareholder shall have one vote for each share of which he, she or it is the holder. Where there is a tie, whether
on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of the meeting is entitled to a casting vote in addition to any other vote he may have. A proxy has the right to demand or join in demanding a poll. Whether a poll will be taken shall be determined in
accordance with Irish law and SmartForces articles of association. On a poll, a person entitled to more than one vote need not use all his, her or its votes or cast all the votes he, she or it uses in the same way. 

Proxies
.    SmartForce ordinary shares represented by a properly signed and dated proxy will be voted at the
extraordinary general meeting in accordance with instructions indicated on the proxy. Proxies that are properly signed and dated but which do not contain voting instructions will be voted 
FOR
 approval of the proposal presented at the
extraordinary general meeting as more fully described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. A proxy holder may vote the proxy in his, her or its discretion as to any other matter which may properly come before the extraordinary general meeting.

Abstentions
.    SmartForce will count a properly executed proxy marked 
ABSTAIN

as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present, but the shares represented by that proxy will not be voted at the extraordinary general meeting. Your abstention, however, will not have an effect on the vote for any of the
proposals to be voted upon at the meeting. 

Voting of ADSs 

Generally
.    Holders of ADSs may not vote
at the extraordinary general meeting. The Bank of New York has the right, subject to certain limitations set forth in the deposit agreements among SmartForce, The Bank of New York and the owners and beneficial owners of ADSs, to vote all of the
SmartForce ordinary shares represented by SmartForce ADSs. Under the terms of the deposit agreements, however, The Bank of New York is required to cast its votes with respect to those SmartForce ordinary shares for which it receives instructions
from the holders of the ADSs representing such ordinary shares in accordance with the instructions received. 

Record Date; Notice of Extraordinary General Meeting
.    Under the terms of the deposit agreements, whenever The Bank of New York receives notice of any meeting of holders of ordinary shares, The Bank of
New York is required to fix a record date, which shall be the record date, if any, established by SmartForce for the purpose of such meeting or, if different, as close to the date established by SmartForce as practicable, for the determination of
the owners of ADSs who will be entitled to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights at any such meeting, subject to the provisions of the deposit agreements. 



Upon receipt of notice of any meeting of SmartForce or the solicitation for
consents or proxies from the holders of ordinary shares, The Bank of New York is required, if so requested in writing by SmartForce, as soon as practicable thereafter, to mail to all owners of ADSs a notice, the form of which shall be in the sole
discretion of The Bank of New York, containing: 



the information contained in the notice of meeting received by The Bank of New York from SmartForce; 



a statement that the owners of ADSs at the close of business on a specified record date are entitled, subject to any applicable provisions of Irish law and of
SmartForces articles of association, to instruct The Bank of New York as to the exercise by The Bank of New York of the voting rights, if any, pertaining to the number of ordinary shares represented by their respective ADSs; 



a statement that owners of ADSs who instruct The Bank of New York as to the exercise of their voting rights will be deemed to have instructed The Bank of New
York or its authorized representative to call for a poll with respect to each matter for which instructions are given, subject to any applicable provisions of Irish law and of SmartForces articles of association; and 



a statement as to the manner in which the instructions may be given, including an express indication that instructions may be given or deemed to be given in
accordance with the next paragraph, and if no instruction is received, to The Bank of New York to give a discretionary proxy to a person designated by SmartForce. 

Voting of Ordinary Shares Underlying SmartForce ADSs
.    Upon the written request of an owner of ADSs on the record date, received on or before
the date established by The Bank of New York for the purpose of such meeting, The Bank of New York will, insofar as practicable, vote or cause to be voted the number of ordinary shares represented by such ADSs in accordance with the instructions set
forth in such request. Accordingly, pursuant to SmartForces articles of association and applicable Irish law, The Bank of New York will cause its authorized representative to attend each meeting of holders of ordinary shares and call for a
poll as instructed for the purpose of effecting such vote. The Bank of New York will not vote or attempt to exercise the rights to vote that attach to the ordinary shares other than in accordance with such instructions or deemed instructions.

Discretionary Proxies
.    The deposit agreements provide that if no instructions
are received by The Bank of New York from any owner of ADSs with respect to any of the ordinary shares represented by the ADSs on or before the date established by The Bank of New York for the purpose of such meeting, The Bank of New York will deem
such owner of ADSs to have instructed The Bank of New York to give a discretionary proxy to a person designated by SmartForce with respect to such ordinary shares and The Bank of New York will give a discretionary proxy to a person designated by
SmartForce to vote such ordinary shares, under circumstances and according to the terms as set forth in the deposit agreements. However, no such instructions will be deemed given and no such discretionary proxy will be given when SmartForce notifies
The Bank of New York, and it has agreed to provide such notice as promptly as practicable in writing, that the matter to be voted upon is one that is set forth in the deposit agreements as more fully described in 
Description of American
Depositary SharesVoting Rights
 on page 106. 

The proposal to be acted upon at the
extraordinary general meeting is one for which The Bank of New York is not entitled to give discretionary proxy. The Bank of New York, will therefore not give a discretionary proxy to a person designated by SmartForce to vote such ordinary shares
for which no instruction has been given for this proposal. 

Inspection of
Reports
.    The Bank of New York will make available for inspection by the owners of ADSs at its Corporate Trust Office any reports and communications, including any proxy soliciting material, received



from SmartForce, which are both (a) received by The Bank of New York as the holder of the ordinary shares and (b) generally made available to the holders of ordinary shares by SmartForce. The
Bank of New York, when requested by SmartForce, will also send to the owners of ADSs copies of such reports when furnished by SmartForce pursuant to the deposit agreements. 

Expenses of Solicitation of Proxies 

SmartForce will pay its own costs of
soliciting proxies and will share equally with SkillSoft the expenses incurred in connection with the filing and printing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Following the original mailing of the proxies and other solicitation materials,
SmartForce will request banks, brokers, dealers and voting trustees or other nominees, including The Bank of New York in the case of the ADSs, to solicit their customers who are owners of shares listed of record and names of nominees, and will
reimburse them for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of such solicitation. SmartForce expects to engage the proxy solicitation firm of 
InnisFree M&A Incorporated in connection with the extraordinary general meeting and will pay a fee of
approximately $10,000 plus reasonable expenses for these services. 

In addition to solicitation by mail,
directors, officers and key employees of SmartForce may solicit proxies in person or by telephone, telegram or other means of communications. These persons will receive no additional compensation for solicitation of proxies but may be reimbursed for
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. 

How to Revoke a Proxy 

You may revoke your proxy before it is voted by:

THE SKILLSOFT MEETING 

We are sending you this document to provide you with important
information regarding the merger in connection with the solicitation of proxies by SkillSofts board of directors for use at the special meeting of its stockholders and at any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting. 

This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being mailed to SkillSoft stockholders on August 8, 2002. 

Date, Time and Place of the SkillSoft Special Meeting 

The date, time and place of the
special meeting of SkillSoft stockholders are as follows: 

September 6, 2002, 

at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time 

at the offices of Hale and Dorr LLP, 60 State Street,

Boston, Massachusetts 02109 

Purpose of the Special Meeting 

At the SkillSoft special meeting, SkillSoft
stockholders will be asked to consider and vote upon the following proposals: 

1.

To adopt the merger agreement. 

2.

To grant SkillSoft management the discretionary authority to adjourn or postpone the special meeting in order to enable the SkillSoft board of directors to
solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the originally scheduled time of the special meeting to adopt the merger agreement. 

3.

To consider and vote upon any other matters that may properly come before the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting.
SkillSoft is not currently aware of any other matter that will come before the special meeting. 

Record Date 

The SkillSoft board of directors has fixed the close of business on
August 2, 2002 as the record date for determining the SkillSoft stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting. Only holders of record of SkillSoft common stock as of the close of business on that date are entitled to vote at the special
meeting. As of the record date, there were              shares of SkillSoft common stock issued and outstanding, constituting all of the outstanding voting stock of SkillSoft. Each share of
SkillSoft common stock issued and outstanding as of the record date entitles its holder to cast one vote at the special meeting. 

Quorum 

To conduct business at the special meeting, a quorum must be present. The
holders of a majority of the shares of SkillSoft common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting constitutes a quorum. Holders of shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy (including holders of
shares who abstain or do not vote with respect to one or more of the matters presented for stockholder approval) will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists at the meeting. If a quorum is not present at the special meeting,
the special meeting may be adjourned or postponed to solicit additional proxies. 

Vote Required 

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of
SkillSoft common stock outstanding on the record date is required to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. The affirmative vote of the



holders of shares of common stock representing a majority of the votes cast on the adjournment proposal at the special meeting is required to approve the adjournment proposal. 

Voting of Shares 

General
.    Shares represented by a
properly signed and dated proxy will be voted at the special meeting in accordance with the instructions indicated on the proxy. Proxies that are properly signed and dated but which do not contain voting instructions will be voted 
FOR

adoption of the merger agreement and 
FOR
 the adjournment proposal. The proxy holder may vote the proxy in its discretion as to any other matter which may properly come before the meeting. 

Abstentions
.    The shares represented by a properly executed proxy marked 
ABSTAIN
 as to a particular proposal will not be voted with
respect to that proposal at the special meeting. Because the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of SkillSoft common stock is required to adopt the merger agreement, if you mark your SkillSoft proxy 
ABSTAIN
, it will have
the effect of a vote against adoption of the merger agreement. Because a majority of the votes cast is required to pass the adjournment proposal, if you mark your SkillSoft proxy 
ABSTAIN
, it will have no effect on the adjournment proposal.

Broker Non-Votes
.    If your shares of SkillSoft common stock are held by your broker,
your broker will vote your shares for you only if you provide instructions to your broker on how to vote your shares. You should follow the directions provided by your broker regarding how to instruct your broker to vote your shares. Your broker
cannot vote your shares of SkillSoft common stock without specific instructions from you. Because the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of SkillSoft common stock is required to adopt the merger agreement, if you do not
instruct your broker how to vote, it will have the effect of a vote 
AGAINST
 adoption of the merger agreement. Because a majority of the votes cast is required to pass the adjournment proposal, if you do not instruct your broker how to vote,
it will have no effect on the adjournment proposal. 

Voting Shares in Person that Are Held through
Brokers
.    If your shares are held by your broker or another nominee and you wish to vote those shares in person at the special meeting, you must obtain from the nominee holding your SkillSoft common stock a properly
executed legal proxy identifying you as a SkillSoft stockholder, authorizing you to act on behalf of the nominee at the special meeting and identifying the number of shares with respect to which the authorization is granted. 

How to Revoke a Proxy 

Any proxy may be revoked by a SkillSoft stockholder at any time
before its exercise by delivering to the Secretary of SkillSoft a written revocation or a subsequently dated proxy or by voting in person at the special meeting. Attendance at the special meeting will not itself have the effect of revoking a proxy
unless the stockholder gives affirmative notice at the meeting that the stockholder intends to revoke the proxy and vote in person. 

Voting Agreements 

As of the record date, SkillSoft directors, executive officers
and a principal stockholder holding as a group approximately 39.6% of the outstanding shares of SkillSoft common stock entitled to vote on the merger agreement have agreed to vote all of their shares of SkillSoft common stock in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement and have executed and delivered to SmartForce irrevocable proxies to vote their shares in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. For more information, see 
Agreements Related to the
MergerSkillSoft Voting Agreements
 on page 
87. 

Adjournment of the Special Meeting 

If at the SkillSoft special meeting on

September 6, 2002, the number of shares of SkillSoft common stock present or represented and voting in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is insufficient under



Delaware law to adopt the merger agreement, SkillSoft management intends to move to adjourn the special meeting in order to enable the SkillSoft board of directors to solicit additional proxies
in favor of the proposal. In that event, SkillSoft will ask its stockholders to vote only upon the adjournment proposal and not upon the merger proposal. 

In the adjournment proposal, SkillSoft is asking its stockholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the SkillSoft board of directors to vote in favor of granting SkillSofts
management the discretionary authority to adjourn or postpone the SkillSoft special meeting, and any later adjournments, in order to enable the SkillSoft board of directors to solicit additional proxies in favor of the merger proposal. If the
stockholders approve the adjournment proposal, SkillSofts management could adjourn or postpone the special meeting, and any adjourned session of the special meeting, and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies in favor of the
merger proposal, including the solicitation of proxies from stockholders that have previously voted against the merger proposal. Among other things, approval of the adjournment proposal could mean that, even if SkillSoft had received proxies
representing a sufficient number of votes against the merger proposal to defeat it, SkillSofts management could adjourn the special meeting without a vote on the merger proposal and seek during that period to convince the holders of those
shares to change their votes to votes in favor of the merger proposal. 

The SkillSoft board of directors believes
that if the number of shares of SkillSoft common stock present or represented at the special meeting and voting in favor of the merger proposal is insufficient to approve the merger proposal, it is in the best interests of the stockholders of
SkillSoft to enable the board of directors, for a limited period of time, to continue to seek to obtain a sufficient number of additional votes in favor of the merger proposal to bring about its approval. 

Expenses of Solicitation of Proxies 

SkillSoft will pay its own costs of soliciting
proxies, including the costs of any proxy solicitor it may elect to employ, and will share equally with SmartForce the expenses incurred in connection with the filing and printing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. SkillSoft will reimburse
brokers, banks, fiduciaries, nominees and others for the out-of-pocket expenses and other reasonable clerical expenses they incur in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of SkillSoft common stock held in their names. Certain directors,
officers and employees of SkillSoft may solicit proxies, without additional remuneration, by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail, telegraph and in person. 

Stockholder Proposals 

SkillSofts By-laws limit the business that may be
transacted at a special meeting of stockholders to matters relating to the purposes of the meeting stated in the notice of the meeting. Accordingly, stockholders may not submit other proposals for consideration at the special meeting. 

SkillSoft will hold a 2003 Annual Meeting of Stockholders only if the merger is not completed. Proposals of stockholders
submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to be presented at the 2003 Annual Meeting of Stockholders must be received by SkillSoft at its principal executive offices no later than January 14, 2003 in order to be
considered for inclusion in SkillSofts proxy materials for that meeting. 

Recommendation of the Board of Directors 

After careful consideration, the
SkillSoft board of directors has unanimously approved the merger, the merger agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The SkillSoft board of directors has determined the merger is consistent with, and in furtherance
of, SkillSofts long-term business strategy and that the merger is fair to, advisable and in the best interests of SkillSoft and its stockholders and unanimously recommends that SkillSoft stockholders vote 
FOR
 the adoption of the merger
agreement. The SkillSoft board of directors also recommends that the SkillSoft stockholders vote 
FOR
 the adjournment proposal. For more information on this recommendation, see 
The Proposed MergerSkillSofts Reasons for the
Merger and Recommendation of SkillSofts Board of Directors
 beginning on page 55. 



THE PROPOSED MERGER 

This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus
describes the material aspects of the proposed merger. While SmartForce and SkillSoft believe that the following summary describes the material terms of the merger and the related transactions, this summary may not contain all of the information
that is important to you. You should carefully read this entire document and the other documents SmartForce and SkillSoft refer to for a more complete understanding of the merger. In addition, we incorporate important business and financial
information about SmartForce and SkillSoft into this joint proxy statement/prospectus by reference. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus without charge by following the instructions in
the section entitled Where You Can Find More Information on page 
137 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

The Merger 

In the proposed merger, SmartForce and SkillSoft will merge in a
stock-for-stock transaction. In accordance with the merger agreement and Delaware law, the transaction is structured as a merger of SkillSoft with a newly formed subsidiary of SmartForce, Slate Acquisition Corp., with SkillSoft surviving the merger
as a wholly-owned subsidiary of SmartForce. In exchange for their shares in SkillSoft, the SkillSoft stockholders will receive ordinary shares of SmartForce, represented by American Depositary Shares, or ADSs. The stockholders of SkillSoft will
become shareholders of SmartForce. The SmartForce Memorandum and Articles of Association and the laws of Ireland will govern their rights as shareholders. See 
Comparison of Shareholder Rights
 on page 
114 of this proxy
statement. 

Merger Consideration 

In the merger, SkillSoft stockholders will receive 2.3674
SmartForce ordinary shares, represented by ADSs, for each share of SkillSoft common stock they hold. However, no adjustment in the exchange ratio will be made for changes in the relative market prices of SmartForce ADSs and SkillSoft shares. The
exchange ratio that SkillSoft stockholders will receive in the merger will be appropriately adjusted for any stock splits, combinations and other similar events that occur between the date of the merger agreement and the completion of the merger.
SmartForce will not issue fractional SmartForce ADSs in the merger. Instead, each SkillSoft stockholder otherwise entitled to a fractional share will receive cash, without interest, in lieu of a fraction of a SmartForce ADS. Specifically, the
exchange agent in the merger will, as promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, notify SmartForce of such amount, and SmartForce will deposit such amount with the
exchange agent and will cause the exchange agent to forward payments to the owners of fractional interests. 

Treatment of SkillSoft Stock Options 

At the effective time of the merger, each
outstanding SkillSoft stock option will cease to represent a right to acquire shares of SkillSoft common stock and will be converted into an option to purchase a number of ordinary shares of SmartForce represented by SmartForce ADSs equal to the
number of shares of SkillSoft common stock subject to such option multiplied by 2.3674, at a per share exercise price equal to the existing per share exercise price of such option divided by 2.3674. 

Background of the Merger 

Both SmartForce and SkillSoft regularly evaluate different
strategies for improving their competitive positions and enhancing shareholder value, including opportunities for mergers with other companies, acquisitions of other companies, and marketing and development alliances. 

During the spring of 2001, representatives of SmartForce and SkillSoft discussed the possibility of a merger of the two companies. After a
series of meetings and discussions, it was jointly agreed that it was not in the best



interests of either party to proceed with a merger at that time. At various times over the next several quarters, Gregory M. Priest, SmartForces Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
Charles E. Moran, SkillSofts President and Chief Executive Officer, and Stewart Gross, a director of SkillSoft and a managing director of Warburg, Pincus Ventures L.P., SkillSofts largest shareholder, had conversations about the
possibility of reengaging in discussions about a potential combination, but none of these conversations resulted in any significant discussions. 

In early March 2002, Mr. Gross and Mr. Priest had a conversation about the potential for reengaging in discussions regarding a potential merger, but agreed to defer further discussions. 

In early April 2002, Mr. Priest and Mr. Moran had a conversation about the potential for reengaging in discussions regarding a
potential merger, following which they agreed to meet in person. On April 9, 2002, at a meeting of SmartForces board of directors, Mr. Priest informed the board that he planned to meet with Mr. Moran and Mr. Gross to discuss a potential merger
between the companies. 

On April 11, 2002, Mr. Priest, Mr. Moran and Mr. Gross met in New York City. They
discussed the potential strategic rationales for a merger of the two companies, including the potential benefits and synergies that would result from such a merger and the potential risks of the transaction. They concluded that it was advisable to
continue discussions concerning the potential of a merger and to seek the input of their respective boards of directors on such a transaction. Economic terms of a potential merger were not discussed. In connection with this meeting, SmartForce and
SkillSoft executed a Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement dated as of April 11, 2002. 

On April 17, 2002, at a meeting
of SmartForces board of directors, Mr. Priest updated the board on the status of the discussions and was directed to continue to move forward with the discussions on behalf of SmartForce. 

Over the course of the next several weeks, representatives of SmartForce and SkillSoft exchanged certain business and financial information and continued to discuss
the merits of a merger of the two companies. 

On April 30, 2002, Mr. Priest, Mr. Moran, Tom McDonald,
SkillSofts Chief Financial Officer, and Eric Murphy, SmartForces Vice President of Finance, met in Palo Alto, California to further discuss the merits of a potential merger of the companies. Economic terms of a potential merger were not
discussed. The parties present agreed to continue to pursue a more comprehensive exchange of information and a discussion of the potential for a transaction. Following the meeting, Mr. Priest and Mr. Moran each updated their board of directors on
the status of discussions. It was the consensus of each companys board of directors that management should continue to pursue discussions of a potential merger between the companies. 

Between May 1, 2002 and May 8, 2002, representatives of SmartForce and SkillSoft continued to exchange information and discuss the transaction. On May 3, 2002, Mr. Priest
met with representatives of Credit Suisse First Boston regarding a potential merger and discussed the possibility of retaining Credit Suisse First Boston to represent SmartForce in connection with potential merger discussions. 

On May 
4, 2002, SmartForce retained Credit Suisse First Boston as its financial advisor in connection with a potential
merger with SkillSoft. 

On May 7, 2002, SkillSoft retained Banc of America Securities LLC as its financial advisor
in connection with a potential merger with SmartForce. 

On May 8, 2002, Mr. Priest, Mr. Moran and Mr. Gross had a
conference call to discuss a potential merger and to consider the economic terms on which such a merger might be contemplated. 

On May 9, 2002, representatives of SmartForce, Credit Suisse First Boston, SkillSoft and Banc of America Securities participated in a meeting concerning the potential merger. The participants discussed the rationale for



the potential merger, valuation metrics and potential exchange ratios for the merger, and transaction structure and terms. At the conclusion of the call, the participants agreed to engage their
law firms to begin work on a merger agreement and other documentation for the potential merger. 

On May 10, 2002,
SmartForces board of directors held a special meeting. Mr. Priest updated the board on the status of discussions with SkillSoft, including the proposed structure and terms of the merger. The board authorized and directed Mr. Priest to proceed
with the negotiations.

Mr. Moran updated the directors on the status of discussions with SmartForce, including the proposed structure and terms of the merger. The directors authorized and directed Mr. Moran to proceed with the negotiations. 

During the week of May 13, 2002, representatives of SkillSoft, Warburg, and Banc of America Securities traveled to California to meet with
representatives of SmartForce and Credit Suisse First Boston. The parties held several days of meetings at which additional business and financial information was exchanged and the parties discussed the two companies businesses, strategies,
products and finances. Also during this week, Hale and Dorr LLP, legal counsel to SkillSoft, distributed to SkillSoft, SmartForce and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, legal counsel to SmartForce, drafts of a merger agreement and related
transaction documents. 

During the three-week period beginning May 20, 2002, representatives of SmartForce and
SkillSoft and their financial advisors continued their exchange and review of information concerning the companies, and representatives of SmartForce and SkillSoft and their legal counsel continued to negotiate and exchange drafts of the various
merger documents. In addition, representatives of SmartForce, SkillSoft and Arthur Andersen LLP, SkillSofts independent auditors, had a series of discussions with the SEC concerning the appropriate accounting treatment for the transaction.

On May 24, 2002, SmartForces board of directors held a special meeting. Mr. Priest updated the board on the
status of discussions with SkillSoft, including the proposed structure of the merger and the status of the due diligence process. The board authorized and directed Mr. Priest to continue to proceed with the negotiations. 

On June 7, 2002, SmartForces board of directors held a special meeting to consider the proposed merger with SkillSoft. At this
meeting, Mr. Priest summarized the strategic rationale for and the terms of the proposed merger. Representatives of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati reviewed with the directors their fiduciary duties and reported to the board on the material
terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the related transaction documents and their due diligence review of SkillSoft. Representatives of Credit Suisse First Boston presented various financial analyses to the SmartForce board of directors.

directors, and indicated that they expected to render an opinion to the SmartForce board of directors, at the close of trading on June 10, 2002, that the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to SmartForce. The SmartForce board of
directors asked various questions and discussed the potential merger, following which, by unanimous vote, it determined that the merger was fair, advisable and in the best interests of SmartForce and its shareholders, and approved the merger, the
issuance of SmartForce ordinary shares (represented by ADSs) in the merger and related matters.

SmartForces Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of SmartForces Board of Directors 

At a meeting held on June 10, 2002, the board of directors of SmartForce concluded that the merger is consistent with and in furtherance of the long-term business strategy of SmartForce and is fair to, and in the best interests of,
SmartForce and SmartForce shareholders. Accordingly, the board of directors of SmartForce determined to recommend that the SmartForce shareholders approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger and the issuance of the SmartForce
ordinary shares, represented by SmartForce ADSs, in the merger. The summary set forth below briefly describes certain of the reasons, factors and information taken into account by the SmartForce board in reaching its conclusion. The SmartForce board
did not assign any relative or specific weights to the factors considered in reaching such determination, and individual directors may have given differing weights to different factors. 

In reaching its determination, the SmartForce board consulted with SmartForces management and legal and financial advisors, and carefully considered a number of
factors, including: 



The potential strategic benefits of the merger, including without limitation, the ability to expand and enhance SmartForces comprehensive e-Learning
solutions; 



Historical information concerning SmartForces and SkillSofts respective businesses, financial performance and condition, operations, technology and
management, including public reports concerning results of operations during recent fiscal periods for each company filed with the SEC; 



SmartForce managements view of the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of SmartForce and SkillSoft before and after giving effect to
the merger and the mergers effect on shareholder value; 



Current financial market conditions and historical market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to SmartForces ADSs and SkillSofts
common stock; 



The consideration to be received by SkillSofts stockholders in the merger and the relationship between the current and historical market values of
SmartForces ADSs and SkillSofts common stock and a comparison of comparable merger transactions; 



The composition of the board and the executive management team following the merger; 



The belief that the terms of the merger agreement, including the parties respective representations, warranties and covenants, and the conditions to their
respective obligations, are reasonable; 



The potential for other parties to enter into strategic relationships with or to acquire SmartForce or SkillSoft; 



Detailed financial analysis and pro forma and other information with respect to the companies presented to the SmartForce board, including the opinion of Credit
Suisse First Boston, dated as of June 10, 2002, to the effect that as of such date, and based upon and subject to various considerations set forth in the opinion, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to SmartForce. This
opinion is subject to assumptions and limitations noted in the opinion and described under 
Opinion of SmartForces Financial Advisor
, and you should carefully read both that section and the opinion that is attached to
this document as 
Annex B
; 





The impact of the merger on SmartForces customers and employees; and 



Reports from management, legal, financial and accounting advisors as to the results of the due diligence investigation of SkillSoft. 

In its decision to recommend and approve the merger, the share issuance and the related matters, the
most important benefits identified by the board of directors of SmartForce were the following: 



SmartForce managements belief that the merger would enhance the opportunity for the potential realization of SmartForces strategic objective to
become the worlds leading provider of e-Learning solutions; 



The belief that the combination of SmartForces IT, sales and CRM content library with SkillSofts interpersonal and business skills library would
solidify the combined companys position as the leader in e-Learning content with over 3,000 courses and simulations and over 2,000 Referenceware products; 



The potential impact on SmartForces financial condition, results of operations and businesses including additional benefits from incremental bookings;



The benefits derived from the combination of members of two respected management teams with complementary strengths; 



The synergies and cost saving opportunities that could potentially be realized by leveraging the strengths of both organizations while eliminating redundancies
and underperforming operations and assets; 



The potential revenue synergies due to cross selling opportunities and utilization of SmartForces and SkillSofts complementary sales and
distribution approaches; 



The increased customer base of the combined company, including SmartForces more than 2,500 corporate customers, and SkillSofts 500 corporate
customers, 
only approximately 200 of whom are SmartForce customers; 



The benefits of becoming a larger organization with almost 1800 employees, which would provide access to greater financial, development, distribution channel
and other resources; 



The opportunity to leverage the significant research and development capabilities of the two companies, which include a combined 2001 research and development
investment of over $69 million, allowing duplicate resources to be re-deployed to facilitate faster introduction and additional feature developments of the products of the combined company; 



More substantial resources and a larger capital base to enable faster growth and expansion in the rapidly-evolving e-Learning market; 



The belief that the combined company could further pursue opportunities relating to business processes within the enterprise involving the transfer of knowledge
not formally part of the training function such as managing contact centers, launching products and getting sales hires up to quota productivity; and 



The opportunity for SmartForces shareholders to participate in the potential growth of the combined company after the merger. 

Potential risks or other negative factors identified by the SmartForce board of directors include the
following: 



The risk that the potential benefits and costs synergies of the merger may not be realized; 



The challenges of integrating the businesses of the combined company and management and employee disruption associated with the merger, including the risk that
despite the efforts of the combined company, key personnel might not remain employed by the combined company; 





The risk that the combined companys financial results will not meet expectations given the current e-Learning market environment and the combined
companys customer base; 



The risk of disruption of sales momentum as a result of uncertainties created by the announcement of the merger; 



The adverse accounting consequences caused by the structuring of the transaction such as the loss of a significant amount of SmartForces balance sheet
deferred revenue to goodwill and the creation of intangible assets requiring a non-cash quarterly amortization expense; 



The negative impact on projected revenue of the combined company resulting from the planned changes to the contracting practices and attendant changes to
revenue recognition of the two companies; 



Commercial overlap of customers that is expected to initially result in a reduction in revenue for the combined company; 



The risk that the merger might not be consummated on a timely basis, if at all, despite the parties efforts, and even if approved by each companys
shareholders; 



The substantial charges to be incurred in connection with the merger, including costs of integrating the businesses and transaction expenses arising from the
merger; 



The negative impact on projected revenues that could be caused by changes in business strategy such as de-emphasizing custom service revenue activities to focus
on higher margin segments of the business; 



The effect of public announcement of the merger and the possibility that the merger might not be consummated on (a) SmartForces sales and operating
results, (b) SmartForces ability to attract and retain key management, marketing and technical personnel and (c) the progress of certain development projects; and 



Other applicable risks described in the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled 
Risk Factors
 on page 13. 

The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the SmartForce board of directors
is not intended to be exhaustive but includes the material factors considered by the SmartForce board of directors. In view of the complexity and wide variety of information and factors, both positive and negative, considered by the SmartForce board
of directors, it did not find it practical to quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative or specific weights to the factors considered. In addition, the SmartForce board did not reach any specific conclusion with respect to each of the factors
considered, or any aspect of any particular factor. Instead, the SmartForce board of directors conducted an overall analysis of the factors described above, including discussions with SmartForces management and legal, financial and accounting
advisors. In considering the factors described above, individual members of the SmartForce board of directors may have given different weight to different factors. The SmartForce board considered all these factors as a whole and believed the factors
supported its determination to approve the merger. 

After taking into consideration all of the factors set
forth above, SmartForces board of directors unanimously concluded that the merger is consistent with and in furtherance of the long-term business strategy of SmartForce and is fair to, and in the best interests of, SmartForce and SmartForce
shareholders and that SmartForce should proceed with the merger. SmartForces board of directors recommends that its shareholders vote FOR the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the merger, the issuance of the
SmartForce ordinary shares, represented by the ADSs, in connection with the merger, the increase in the share capital, and the other matters contained in the merger proposal. 



SkillSofts Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of SkillSofts Board of Directors 

In reaching its decision to approve the merger, SkillSofts board of directors identified and considered a number of potential benefits for SkillSoft and its stockholders that supported the boards decision to approve the
merger. These potential benefits include the following: 



the fact that the combination of the product lines, sales channels and financial resources of SmartForce and SkillSoft should result in a combined company that
is a leader in the e-Learning market, with the ability to offer comprehensive e-Learning solutions from a single vendor that existing and potential customers would find attractive; 



the complementary nature of the product lines of SmartForce and SkillSoft, with SmartForces focus on information technology and SkillSofts focus on
business skills training; 



the strong customer base of each company, which should provide opportunities for each company to introduce its product line into the customer base of the other
company; 



the fact that the merger would combine two experienced and respected management teams, resulting in a combined management team that is stronger than the
management teams of each of the individual companies; 



the opportunity for SkillSofts current management and directors to participate in the management and oversight of SmartForce following the merger through
the appointment of Chuck Moran as Chief Executive Officer and Tom McDonald as Chief Financial Officer of SmartForce and the election of three current SkillSoft directors and a fourth person designated by SkillSoft to the seven-member SmartForce
board of directors; 



the synergies and cost-saving opportunities that should result from the combination of the two organizations, as redundant operations are eliminated or
streamlined; 



the fact that the Irish tax resident status of certain SmartForce entities offers SkillSoft the possibility of securing a lower corporate tax rate on earnings
than that currently applicable following the implementation of appropriate planning strategies; 



the larger public float of SmartForce and the corresponding likelihood of increased trading liquidity for SkillSoft stockholders as a result of the merger; and



the fact that the merger will be tax-free to SkillSofts U.S. stockholders who receive SmartForce ADSs in exchange for their SkillSoft common stock in the
merger (except to the extent they received cash for any fractional shares). 

In addition to the
potential benefits accruing to SkillSoft and its stockholders from the merger, the SkillSoft board of directors also considered a number of other factors in approving the merger, including the following: 



SkillSoft managements view of the business and prospects of SkillSoft and SmartForce as stand-alone companies and as a combined company; 



historical information concerning SkillSofts and SmartForces respective businesses and financial performance; 



historical stock market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to SkillSoft common stock and SmartForce ADSs; 



the number of SmartForce ADSs to be exchanged in the merger for each share of SkillSoft common stock; 



the financial analyses and presentation of Banc of America Securities delivered to the SkillSoft board of directors on June 10, 2002, as well as the opinion of
Banc of America Securities dated June 10, 2002 that, as of such date, the exchange ratio of 2.3674 SmartForce ordinary shares represented by ADSs for



each share of SkillSoft common stock in the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of SkillSoft common stock (a copy of Banc of America Securities written
opinion is attached as 
Annex C
 to this joint proxy statement/prospectus); 



the results of the due diligence investigation of SmartForce conducted by SkillSofts management, financial advisor, accountants and legal counsel;



the accounting treatment of the merger; 



the contractual terms of the merger agreement and related transaction documents; and 



the interest that certain SkillSoft officers and directors may have in the merger, in addition to their interest as SkillSoft stockholders (see

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger
 on page 
70). 

In
reaching its decision to approve the merger, SkillSofts board of directors also identified and considered a number of potentially negative factors that could result from the merger, including the following: 



the historical volatility and recent trends of the market price of SmartForce ADSs; 



the negative impact on the projected revenue of the combined company resulting from the reconciliation of the accounting practices of the two companies and
areas of business overlap; 



the risks that the integration of the businesses, products and personnel of the two companies will not be successfully implemented and may require a significant
amount of management time and resources; 



the fact that the restructuring announced by SmartForce in April 2002 may present additional challenges for the combined management of SmartForce following the
merger; 



the risk that the potential synergies and cost-saving opportunities identified by SmartForce and SkillSoft will not be fully realized; 



the risk that the merger may not be well received by customers, business partners and employees of the two companies; 



the significant cost that will be incurred in seeking to consummate the merger; 



the risk that the merger may not be completed; and 



the other risks described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus under the heading 
Risk Factors
 on page 
13. 

The SkillSoft board of directors evaluated all of the factors described above in light of their
knowledge of SkillSofts business, financial condition and prospects, SmartForces business, financial condition and prospects, and the market for e-Learning solutions. In view of the variety of factors considered by the SkillSoft board of
directors in its evaluation of the merger, the SkillSoft board of directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to the specific factors considered in reaching its decision. In addition,
individual members of the SkillSoft board may have given different weight to different factors. The list of factors described in this section as having been considered by the SkillSoft board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive but is
believed to include all of the material factors considered by the SkillSoft board. 

After considering all of
the information and factors described in this section, SkillSofts board of directors unanimously approved the merger, the merger agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. SkillSofts board of directors
believes that the merger is consistent with, and in furtherance of, SkillSofts long term business strategy and that the merger is fair to, advisable and in the best interests of SkillSoft and its stockholders. SkillSofts board of
directors has unanimously recommended that the SkillSoft stockholders vote FOR the adoption of the merger agreement. 



Opinion of SmartForces Financial Advisor 

SmartForce retained Credit
Suisse First Boston to act as its financial advisor in connection with the merger. In connection with Credit Suisse First Bostons engagement, SmartForce requested that Credit Suisse First Boston evaluate the fairness of the exchange ratio to
SmartForce, from a financial point of view. On June 7 and 10, 2002, the SmartForce board of directors met to review the proposed merger and the terms of the merger agreement. During this meeting, Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed with the
SmartForce board of directors certain financial analyses, as described below, and rendered its oral opinion to the SmartForce board of directors, subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of June 10, 2002 and based upon and subject to the various
considerations set forth in the Credit Suisse First Boston opinion, the exchange ratio was fair to SmartForce, from a financial point of view. 

The full text of the Credit Suisse First Boston opinion, which sets forth, among other things, assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the scope of the review
undertaken by Credit Suisse First Boston in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Holders of SmartForce ADSs or SmartForce ordinary shares are urged
to, and should, read the Credit Suisse First Boston opinion carefully and in its entirety. The Credit Suisse First Boston opinion addresses only the fairness of the exchange ratio to SmartForce, from a financial point of view, as of the date of the
Credit Suisse First Boston opinion, and does not constitute a recommendation to any holders of SmartForce ADSs or SmartForce ordinary shares as to how such holder should vote or act on any matter relating to the merger. The summary of the Credit
Suisse First Boston opinion in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Suisse First Boston opinion. 

In connection with its opinion, Credit Suisse First Boston, among other things, 



reviewed the merger agreement and certain related documents; 



reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to SmartForce and SkillSoft; 



reviewed certain other information relating to SmartForce and SkillSoft, including publicly available financial forecasts (as adjusted by the managements of
SmartForce and SkillSoft), provided to or discussed with Credit Suisse First Boston by SmartForce and SkillSoft, and met with the managements of SmartForce and SkillSoft to discuss the businesses and prospects of SmartForce and SkillSoft,
respectively; 



considered certain financial and stock market data of SmartForce and SkillSoft and compared that data with similar data for other publicly held companies in
businesses which Credit Suisse First Boston deemed similar to those of SmartForce and SkillSoft; 



considered, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of certain other business combinations and other transactions which have recently been
effected or announced; and 



considered such other information, financial studies, analyses and investigations and financial, economic and market criteria which Credit Suisse First Boston
deemed relevant. 

In connection with its review, Credit Suisse First Boston did not assume any
responsibility for independent verification of any of the foregoing information and relied on such information being complete and accurate in all material respects. With respect to the publicly available financial forecasts of SmartForce and
SkillSoft (as adjusted by the managements of SmartForce and SkillSoft) that Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed, Credit Suisse First Boston has reviewed and discussed such forecasts with the managements of SmartForce and SkillSoft, respectively, and
was advised, and Credit Suisse First Boston assumed with SmartForces consent, that such forecasts as adjusted represent reasonable estimates and judgments as to the future financial performance of SmartForce and SkillSoft, respectively. In
addition, Credit Suisse First Boston relied upon, without independent verification, the assessments of the managements of SmartForce and SkillSoft as to: 



the existing and future technology and products of SmartForce and SkillSoft and the risks associated with such technology and products; 





the potential cost savings and other synergies (including the amount, timing and achievability of such cost savings and other synergies) and strategic benefits
anticipated by the managements of SmartForce and SkillSoft to result from the merger; 



their ability to integrate the businesses of SmartForce and SkillSoft; and 



their ability to retain key employees of SmartForce and SkillSoft. 

Credit Suisse First Boston assumed, with SmartForces consent, that in the course of obtaining necessary regulatory and third party approvals and consents for the
merger, no modification, delay, limitation, restriction or condition will be imposed that will have an adverse effect on SmartForce or SkillSoft or the contemplated benefits of the merger. Credit Suisse First Boston also assumed, with
SmartForces consent, that the merger will be treated as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and will be tax-free to SmartForce under Irish law. Credit Suisse First Boston was not requested to make, and did not make,
an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of SmartForce or SkillSoft, nor was Credit Suisse First Boston furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals. The Credit Suisse First Boston opinion is
necessarily based upon information made available to it as of the date of its opinion, and upon financial, economic, market, exchange rate and other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on the date of the Credit Suisse First Boston
opinion. The Credit Suisse First Boston opinion does not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to other business strategies that might be available to SmartForce, nor does it address the underlying business decision of SmartForce to
proceed with the merger. Credit Suisse First Boston did not express any opinion as to what the value of SmartForce ADSs actually will be when issued to holders of SkillSoft common stock pursuant to the merger or the prices at which SmartForce ADSs
will trade at any time. 

In preparing its opinion, Credit Suisse First Boston performed a variety of financial and
comparative analyses, including those described below. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Credit Suisse First Boston believes that its analyses
must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and of the factors considered by it, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading view of the processes underlying the Credit Suisse First Boston
opinion. No company or transaction used in the analyses performed by Credit Suisse First Boston as a comparison is identical to SmartForce, SkillSoft or the contemplated merger. In addition, Credit Suisse First Boston may have given various analyses
more or less weight than other analyses, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions, so that the range of valuation resulting from any particular analysis described below should not be taken to be Credit
Suisse First Bostons view of the actual value of SmartForce or SkillSoft. The analyses performed by Credit Suisse First Boston are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than suggested by such analyses. In addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses or assets do not purport to be appraisals or to necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or assets may actually be sold. The analyses
performed were prepared solely as part of Credit Suisse First Bostons analysis of the fairness of the exchange ratio to SmartForce, from a financial point of view, and were provided to the board of directors of SmartForce in connection with
the delivery of the Credit Suisse First Boston opinion. 

The following is a summary of material financial analyses
performed by Credit Suisse First Boston in connection with the preparation of its opinion, and reviewed with the SmartForce board of directors at meetings of the SmartForce board of directors held on June 7 and 10, 2002. Certain of the following
summaries of financial analyses that were performed by Credit Suisse First Boston include information presented in tabular format. In order to understand fully the material financial analyses that were performed by Credit Suisse First Boston, the
tables should be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the material financial analyses. For purposes of its analysis, Credit Suisse First Boston assumed SkillSofts fiscal year
approximates the calendar year, although SkillSofts actual fiscal year ends in January. Credit Suisse First Boston believes this assumption did not materially affect its analysis. 



 Transaction Multiples
.    Credit Suisse First Boston
calculated several values implied by the exchange ratio, including the implied price per SmartForce ADS, the implied premium to SmartForces closing ADS price on June 7, 2002, the trading day prior to the date of the execution of the Merger
Agreement, the implied pro forma fully-diluted ownership of holders of SmartForce ADSs in the combined company and the implied SmartForce fully-diluted equity value and aggregate value. The following table summarizes the results of this analysis:

per SmartForce ADS for calendar year 2003. These implied values were based on SmartForces closing ADS price on June 7, 2002 and the price per SmartForce ADS implied by the exchange ratio. The multiples were calculated using publicly available
forecasts prepared by securities research analysts for calendar years 2002 and 2003. The following table summarizes the results of this analysis:

termination of the acquisition of Centra Software, and the premium/(discount) of the market exchange ratio and the merger exchange ratio to such average exchange ratios. Credit Suisse First Boston also calculated the pro forma fully-diluted
ownership of holders of SmartForce ADSs in the combined company implied by the average market exchange ratio over such periods. The following table summarizes the results of this analysis:

No company utilized as a comparison in the comparable company
trading analysis is identical to SmartForce or SkillSoft. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the average or the median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable company trading data. 

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.
    Using discounted cash flow analysis, Credit Suisse First Boston calculated
certain implied equity values per ADS of SmartForce on a standalone and pro forma combined basis. 

The standalone
discounted cash flow analysis was based on publicly available financial forecasts of SmartForce (as adjusted by the management of SmartForce) as well as various operating assumptions provided by SmartForce management, including assumptions relating
to, among other items, revenue, operating costs, taxes, working capital, capital expenditures and depreciation. Credit Suisse First Bostons analysis used discount rates ranging from 18% to 22% and terminal price to earnings multiples of 10.0x
to 15.0x, which resulted in an implied equity value per SmartForce ADS of $9.23 to $12.12. 



The pro forma combined discounted cash flow analysis was based on publicly
available financial forecasts of SmartForce and SkillSoft (as adjusted by the managements of SmartForce and SkillSoft) as well as various operating assumptions provided by SmartForce and SkillSoft management, including assumptions relating to, among
other items, revenue, operating costs, taxes, working capital, capital expenditures and depreciation. Credit Suisse First Bostons analysis used discount rates ranging from 18% to 22%, terminal price to earnings multiples of 15.0x to 20.0x and
assumed that the portion of the pro forma combined equity value attributable to SmartForce is equivalent to SmartForces fully-diluted ownership of 57.2% of the combined company at the exchange ratio, which resulted in an implied equity value
per SmartForce ADS of $11.26 to $15.25. 

Contribution Analysis
.    Credit Suisse First
Boston analyzed the respective contributions of SmartForce and SkillSoft to the pro forma total revenues, gross profit, operating income and net income of the combined company over various periods, including the last twelve months ended March 31,
2002 for SmartForce and April 30, 2002 for SkillSoft, and estimated values for calendar years 2002 and 2003. Credit Suisse First Boston then calculated certain financial metrics implied by SmartForces contribution to such pro forma
values, including the implied pro forma fully-diluted ownership of holders of SmartForce ADSs in the combined company, the implied exchange ratio and the implied premium/(discount) to the exchange ratio. The following table sets forth the mean,
median, high and low values for each financial metric;

Precedent Exchange Ratio Premiums Analysis
.    Credit
Suisse First Boston reviewed the exchange ratio premiums paid in 101 selected precedent merger-of-equals transactions in all industries since 1991 and in 24 selected merger-of-equals in the technology industry since 1994. For each group of
transactions, Credit Suisse First Boston calculated the average premium implied by the exchange ratio in such transactions relative to the average ratio of the closing stock prices for the target companies and the acquiror companies in the
transactions over various periods prior to public announcement of such transactions. Credit Suisse First Boston then applied such mean premiums to the ratio of the closing price of SkillSoft common stock to the closing price of SmartForce ADSs over
the same periods, to calculate the implied merger exchange ratios. The following tables summarize the results of this analysis:

Accretion/(Dilution)
Analysis.
    Credit Suisse First Boston analyzed certain pro forma effects expected to result from the merger, including, among other things, the expected effect of the merger on SmartForces estimated earnings per
ordinary share for calendar year 2003. The estimated earnings for calendar year 2003 were based on publicly available forecasts prepared by securities research analysts. The following table sets forth the resulting accretion/(dilution) to
SmartForces stand-alone estimated earnings per ordinary share for calendar year 2003 relative to the combined companys pro forma earnings per ordinary share for calendar year 2003 with and without amortization of estimated finite life
intangibles and deferred compensation created as a result of the transaction, assuming either no synergies arising from the merger or estimated cost savings with other synergies, as provided by the managements of SmartForce and SkillSoft,
anticipated to result from the merger:

The actual results achieved by the combined company after the
merger may vary from such estimated results and the variations may be material. 



Credit Suisse First Bostons opinion and presentation to the SmartForce
board of directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by the SmartForce board of directors in making its determination to engage in the merger. Consequently, the analyses described above should not be viewed as determinative of the
opinion of the SmartForce board of directors or the management of SmartForce with respect to the value of SmartForce or whether the SmartForce board of directors would have been willing to agree to a different exchange ratio. 

The SmartForce board of directors retained Credit Suisse First Boston to act as its financial advisor in connection with the
merger. Credit Suisse First Boston was selected by the SmartForce board of directors based on Credit Suisse First Bostons qualifications, expertise and reputation. Credit Suisse First Boston is an internationally recognized investment banking
and advisory firm. Credit Suisse First Boston, as part of its investment banking business, is continuously engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, negotiated
underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary course of its business, Credit Suisse First Boston and its affiliates
may actively trade the debt and equity securities of SmartForce and SkillSoft for their own accounts and for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. 

Pursuant to an engagement letter dated as of May 4, 2002, SmartForce engaged Credit Suisse First Boston to provide financial advisory
services to the SmartForce board of directors in connection with the merger, including, among other things, rendering its opinion. Pursuant to the terms of the engagement letter, SmartForce has agreed to pay Credit Suisse First Boston a customary
fee in connection therewith, a significant portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the merger. Credit Suisse First Boston will also receive a fee for rendering its opinion. In addition, SmartForce has agreed to reimburse Credit
Suisse First Boston for its out-of-pocket expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred in connection with its engagement and to indemnify Credit Suisse First Boston and certain related persons against certain liabilities and expenses arising
out of or in conjunction with its rendering of services under its engagement, including liabilities arising under the federal securities laws. 

Credit Suisse First Boston and its affiliates have in the past provided, and may in the future provide, financial and investment banking services to SmartForce and SkillSoft unrelated to the proposed
merger, for which services Credit Suisse First Boston has received, and expects to receive, compensation. In addition, in the past Credit Suisse First Boston and its affiliates provided certain investment banking services to SkillSoft related to a
potential business combination between SkillSoft and SmartForce for which Credit Suisse First Boston and its affiliates received no compensation, and such services ended prior to Credit Suisse First Bostons engagement by SmartForce. In
addition, Credit Suisse First Boston is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Credit Suisse Group, which directly or indirectly owns a 19.9% passive profit interest in Warburg, Pincus & Co., which in turn directly or indirectly beneficially owns
approximately 32% of the outstanding shares of SkillSoft common stock. 

Opinion of SkillSofts Financial Advisor 

On May 7, 2002, the board of directors
of SkillSoft retained Banc of America Securities LLC to act as financial advisor to SkillSoft in connection with a possible transaction with SmartForce. Banc of America Securities is a nationally recognized investment banking firm. Banc of America
Securities is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations
for corporate and other purposes. SkillSoft selected Banc of America Securities to act as its financial advisor on the basis of Banc of America Securities experience and expertise in transactions similar to the merger, its reputation in the
educational services and technology sectors and the investment community and its historical investment banking relationship with SkillSoft. 

Banc of America Securities delivered its written opinion to the board of directors of SkillSoft that the exchange ratio under the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger was fair to the stockholders
of SkillSoft



from a financial point of view as of the date of the agreement. The exchange ratio was determined by negotiations between SkillSoft and SmartForce and was not based on recommendations from Banc
of America Securities. The board of directors did not limit the investigations made or procedures followed by Banc of America Securities in rendering its opinion. Banc of America Securities did not advise SkillSoft with respect to alternatives to
the merger or SkillSofts underlying decision to proceed with or effect the merger. 

We have attached the
full text of Banc of America Securities written opinion to the board of directors of SkillSoft as Annex C, which is incorporated in its entirety. You should read this opinion carefully and in its entirety in connection with this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. However, we have also included the following summary of Banc of America Securities opinion, which is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. 

Banc of America Securities opinion is directed to the board of directors of SkillSoft. It does not constitute a recommendation to
you on how to vote with respect to the merger. The opinion addresses only the financial fairness of the exchange ratio provided for in the merger. The opinion does not address the relative merits of the merger or any alternatives to the merger, the
underlying decision of the board of directors to proceed with or effect the merger or any other aspect of the merger. In furnishing its opinion, Banc of America Securities did not admit that it is an expert within the meaning of the term
expert as used in the Securities Act, nor did it admit that its opinion constitutes a report or valuation within the meaning of the Securities Act. Statements to that effect are included in the Banc of America Securities opinion.

Banc of America Securities: 



reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of SmartForce and SkillSoft, respectively; 



reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning SmartForce and SkillSoft, respectively; 



analyzed financial forecasts, reports and other information regarding SkillSoft and SmartForce published by certain research analysts from selected investment
banking firms (collectively, the Research Analyst Reports) and certain additional information prepared by the management of SkillSoft and SmartForce and discussed such information with representatives of SkillSofts and
SmartForces management; 



reviewed and discussed with representatives of the management of SkillSoft and SmartForce pro-forma adjustments, provided by SkillSoft, required to be made to
the financial forecasts derived from the combination of the SmartForce and SkillSoft financial forecasts contained in the Research Analyst Reports; 



participated in meetings and discussions with representatives of the management of SkillSoft and SmartForce to discuss the business, operations, historical
financial data and certain other financial and operating data of the respective companies; 



reviewed and discussed with representatives of the management of SkillSoft and SmartForce information, prepared by the management of SkillSoft and SmartForce,
respectively, relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the merger; 



considered the possible accretion and dilution effects of the merger on the forward cash earnings per share of SkillSoft and SmartForce based on projections
contained in the Research Analyst Reports and the pro-forma adjustments provided by SkillSoft, as noted above; 



reviewed and considered in the analysis the relative contributions of SmartForce and SkillSoft to the combined company; 



reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for SmartForce ADSs and SkillSoft common stock; 





compared the financial performance of SmartForce and SkillSoft and the prices and trading activity of SmartForce ADSs and SkillSoft common stock with that of
SkillSoft and SmartForce, respectively, and certain other publicly traded companies deemed relevant; 



compared certain financial terms of the merger to financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other business combination transactions deemed
relevant; 



participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of SmartForce and SkillSoft and their financial and legal advisors; 



reviewed the June 7, 2002 draft of the merger agreement and certain related documents; and 



performed such other analyses and considered such other factors as it deemed appropriate. 

Banc of America Securities reviewed the June 7, 2002 draft merger agreement in its preparation of its opinion. The final merger agreement
was substantially similar to the June 7, 2002 draft merger agreement. 

Banc of America Securities did not assume
any responsibility to independently verify the information listed above and instead relied on the information as being accurate and complete in all material respects. Banc of America Securities also made the following assumptions with the consent of
the board of directors of SkillSoft: 



in connection with rendering its opinion, Banc of America Securities, reviewed and relied upon the Research Analyst Reports in lieu of any internal financial
forecasts prepared by SkillSoft or SmartForce; 



with respect to such financial and other information, including the Research Analyst Reports, the pro-forma adjustments, and information related to certain
strategic, financial and operation benefits anticipated from the merger, Banc of America Securities has assumed that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the future
financial performance of SkillSoft and SmartForce, and assumed at SkillSofts direction that such strategic, financial and operational benefit anticipated from the merger will be realized in all material respects; 



assumed that in connection with the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals for the proposed merger, no restrictions will be imposed that would have a
material adverse effect on SmartForce, SkillSoft, the combined company or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed merger; 



that the final executed merger agreement will be identical in all material respects to the June 7, 2002 draft merger agreement, and that the merger will be
consummated as provided in such draft merger agreement, with full satisfaction of all covenants and conditions and without any waivers thereof; and 



relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment by the management of SkillSoft and SmartForce of their respective technology, products and
services, and the integration of SmartForces technology, products and services with SkillSofts technology, products and services and the timing of the introduction of future products incorporating such technology, products and services
and SkillSofts and SmartForces ability to retain key managers. 

The forecasts from
the Research Analyst Reports and the pro-forma adjustments as noted above, provided by SkillSoft, were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, including factors related to general economic and competitive
conditions. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from the results set forth in the forecasts and the pro-forma adjustments. Banc of America Securities has assumed no liability for the forecasts and the pro-forma adjustments. In
addition, for purposes of its opinion, Banc of America Securities: 



relied on advice of counsel and independent accountants to SkillSoft as to all legal and financial reporting matters with respect to SkillSoft, the merger and
the June 7, 2002 draft merger agreement; and 



did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities of SkillSoft or SmartForce, nor did Banc of America Securities receive
any such appraisals. 



Banc of America Securities opinion was based on economic, market and
other conditions in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of the opinion. Banc of America Securities did not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. 

The following represents a brief summary of the material financial analyses performed by Banc of America Securities in connection with
providing its opinion to the SkillSoft board of directors. Some of the summaries of financial analyses performed by Banc of America Securities include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses
performed by Banc of America Securities, you should read the tables together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the data set forth in the tables without
considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by Banc of America
Securities. 

The legal structure of the transaction provides that SmartForce will be the surviving
corporation in the merger and that stockholders of SkillSoft will receive 2.3674 SmartForce ordinary shares represented by ADSs for each share of SkillSoft common stock. However, SkillSoft is effectively paying a premium to SmartForce shareholders
based on the closing prices at the time of the announcement of the merger, 4 of the 7 members of the board of directors of SmartForce immediately following the merger will be designated by SkillSoft, and the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer of SkillSoft will become the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of SmartForce. As such, from an economic, accounting, and management perspective, Banc of America Securities has performed its analysis on the basis
that SkillSoft is the effective acquirer. In light of these considerations, Banc of America Securities analyses were done on the assumption that SkillSoft is acquiring SmartForce based on an exchange ratio of 0.4224 shares of SkillSoft for
each share of SmartForce (reciprocal of the exchange ratio of 2.3674 ordinary shares of SmartForce represented by ADSs for each share of SkillSoft). 

Valuation Analyses Regarding SmartForce 

Comparable Company Analysis
.    Based on publicly available Wall Street equity analyst projections and other available information, Banc of America Securities calculated the multiples of aggregate value to
calendar year 2002 revenues, for companies that Banc of America Securities deemed to be comparable to SmartForce. 

Banc of America Securities defined aggregate value to mean: 



equity value, defined as the product of the number of shares of common stock outstanding for a company multiplied by its stock price; plus 



outstanding debt; less 



cash and cash equivalents. 

The following table sets forth multiples indicated by this analysis for these companies: 

Range of Multiples

Banc of America Securities noted that the aggregate value of
SmartForce based on the effective exchange ratio of 0.4224x implied a multiple of 1.31x SmartForces calendar year 2002 projected standalone revenues. Banc of America Securities also noted that this multiple was within the range of multiples
for the companies selected as comparable to SmartForce. 

Comparable Transactions
Analysis
.    Based on publicly available Wall Street research analyst projections and other publicly available information, Banc of America Securities reviewed the terms provided for and the



implied financial metrics in acquisitions of companies that Banc of America Securities deemed to be comparable to SmartForce and that have been announced since December 1998. These transactions
were deemed not relevant for the valuation of SmartForce. 

Premiums Paid
Analysis
.    Banc of America Securities reviewed the consideration provided for in (a) merger and acquisition transactions announced since January 2000 and January 2001, respectively, involving U.S. companies in which
the equity value paid was between $50 million and $1 billion and (b) mergers and acquisition transactions announced since January 2000 and January 2001, respectively, involving U.S. companies in which the equity value paid was between $100 million
and $500 million. 

Banc of America Securities also reviewed the consideration paid in merger of equals
transactions (transactions with target ownership between 40% and 60% in the combined company) in the technology industry in the last five years and since January 2000 in industries other than the technology industry. 

Banc of America Securities calculated the premiums paid to the average exchange ratios one day, one week, one month and three months
before the announcement of the acquisition offer. 

This analysis indicated the following median and mean premiums

Banc of America Securities noted that the per share value of the
consideration implied by the exchange ratio of 0.4224x effectively received by SmartForce shareholders in connection with the merger implied a premium of 18.5% over SmartForces closing stock price on June 10, 2002. The premiums implied by the
effective exchange ratio of 0.4224 in the merger over the average exchange ratios of SmartForce and SkillSoft one week, one month and three months before June 10, 2002 were 25.6%, 32.7% and 11.0% respectively. Banc of America Securities also noted
that these premiums were in the range of premiums for the above transactions. 



Synergies Analysis.
    Banc of America Securities
calculated the impact of a range of projected pre-tax synergies, provided by SkillSoft, on the earnings per share of the combined company. To the incremental cash earnings per share attributable to the potential projected pre-tax synergies, Banc of
America Securities applied a range of multiples to derive the possible increment to the stock price of the combined company resulting from these synergies. Banc of America Securities noted that based on the range of potential pre-tax synergies and a
range of equity value to calendar year 2003 cash net income multiples, the value of these synergies could exceed $10.00 per share of the combined company. This analysis was based solely upon the estimates of SkillSoft of the synergies that the
combined company may be able to achieve following the completion of the transaction. The actual synergies achieved by the combined company after the transaction may vary from the potential synergies estimated by SkillSoft and the variation may be
material. 

Contribution Analysis
.    Banc of America Securities used historical
results for SkillSoft and SmartForce contained in their respective filings with the SEC and estimates and forecasts for SkillSoft and SmartForce from the Research Analyst Reports to review the implied pro forma ownership resulting from the estimated
contribution of each company to the (a) revenues, (b) gross profit, (c) operating income and (d) cash net income for each of (1) calendar year 2001, (2) projected calendar year 2002 and (3) projected calendar year 2003, for the combined company.
This analysis did not take into account any potential synergies or pro-forma adjustments following completion of the merger. 

This analysis indicated that SmartForce would contribute:

Banc of America Securities then compared the pro forma ownership
implied by the contribution analysis to the pro forma share ownership of the combined company to be owned by each companys stockholders, assuming the merger was completed under the terms of the June 7, 2002 draft merger agreement. Banc of
America Securities noted that on a pro forma basis, SmartForce shareholders would own approximately 57.5% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis (using treasury stock method), which was a lower percentage than all except the net income
contributions calculated above. 

Exchange Ratio Analysis.
    Banc of America Securities
reviewed the historical ratio of closing price per share of SmartForce ADSs to that of SkillSoft common stock for several time periods since SkillSofts initial public offering in February 2000. During the last twelve months, the historical
exchange ratio calculated on a daily basis has ranged from a low of 0.2754x on May 20, 2002 to a high of 1.3026 on August 17, 2001. 

The average exchange ratios for selected time periods during the last twelve months were:

Banc of America Securities noted that the effective exchange ratio in the merger
of 0.4224 is within the range of average historical exchange ratios over various time periods. 

Accretion/Dilution Analysis.
    Using standalone financial forecasts for SkillSoft and SmartForce from the Research Analyst Reports and taking into consideration certain estimated pro-forma adjustments
related to purchase accounting, change in customer contracting policies and related accounting methods, business realignment, and projected cost synergies provided by SkillSoft, Banc of America Securities reviewed the pro forma effects of the
merger, including a comparison of estimated cash earnings per share on a stand-alone basis for SkillSoft and SmartForce to the estimated cash earnings per share of the combined company for calendar year 2003. Banc of America Securities also
performed this analysis excluding the impact of a non-cash revenue adjustment to the pro-forma financials of the combined company resulting from the impact of purchase accounting on the deferred revenues of SmartForce. 

Banc of America Securities noted that, based on the standalone forecasts and pro-forma adjustments as noted above and assuming
completion of the merger under the terms of the June 7, 2002 draft merger agreement, the merger would be slightly accretive to SkillSoft and SmartForces cash earnings per share for calendar year 2003 including the impact of the deferred
revenue adjustment and significantly accretive to SkillSoft and SmartForces cash earnings per share for calendar year 2003 excluding the deferred revenue adjustment. 

Historical Stock Price Analysis.
    Banc of America Securities reviewed the performance of the per share market price and trading volume of
SmartForce ADSs for the last twelve months. The analysis indicated that the closing market price per share for SmartForce ADSs during this period ranged from $5.18 to $39.50. 

Banc of America Securities also reviewed the average closing price for SmartForce ADSs over a number of periods:

Banc of America Securities noted that the implied equity value per
share to SmartForce shareholders based on the effective exchange ratio of 0.4224x and the closing price of SkillSoft common stock on June 10, 2002 was $6.31, lower than the averages for all time periods except the 30 trading days calculated above.

As noted above, the discussion above is merely a summary of the analyses and examinations that Banc of
America Securities considered to be material to its opinion. It is not a comprehensive description of all analyses and examinations actually conducted by Banc of America Securities. The preparation of a fairness opinion is not susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. Banc of America Securities believes that its analyses and the summary above must be considered as a whole. Banc of America Securities further believes that selecting portions of its analyses and the factors
considered, without considering all analyses and factors, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying the analyses set forth in its presentation to the board of directors of SkillSoft. Banc of America Securities did not assign any
specific weight to any of the analyses described above. The fact that any specific analysis has been referred to in the summary above is not meant to indicate that that analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis. Accordingly, the
ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Banc of America Securities view of the actual value of SmartForce. 

In performing its analyses, Banc of America Securities made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other
matters, many of which are beyond the control



of SkillSoft and SmartForce. The analyses performed by Banc of America Securities are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those suggested by these analyses. These analyses were prepared solely as part of Banc of America Securities analysis of the financial fairness of the exchange ratio provided for in the merger and were provided to the board of
directors of SkillSoft in connection with the delivery of Banc of America Securities opinion. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or the prices at which any securities
have traded or may trade at any time in the future. 

As described above, Banc of America Securities
opinion and presentation to the board of directors of SkillSoft were among the many factors taken into consideration by the board of directors of SkillSoft in making its determination to approve, and to recommend that SkillSofts stockholders
adopt, the merger agreement. 

SkillSoft agreed to pay Banc of America Securities a fixed fee payable upon
the consummation of the merger. The board of directors of SkillSoft was aware of this fee structure and took it into account in considering Banc of America Securities fairness opinion and in approving the merger. The engagement letter calls
for SkillSoft to reimburse Banc of America Securities for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, and SkillSoft has agreed to indemnify Banc of America Securities, its affiliates, and their respective partners, directors, officers, agents,
consultants, employees and controlling persons against particular liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws. 

In the ordinary course of its business, Banc of America Securities actively trades the equity securities of SkillSoft and SmartForce for its own account and for the accounts of customers. Accordingly,
Banc of America Securities may at any time hold a long or short position in those securities. Banc of America Securities also acted as underwriter in connection with public offerings of SkillSofts securities, and it has performed various
investment banking and other financial services for SkillSoft. 

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger 

When considering the recommendations of
the SmartForce and SkillSoft boards of directors, you should be aware that the directors and officers of SmartForce and SkillSoft have interests in the merger and have arrangements that are different from, or are in addition to, those of SmartForce
shareholders and SkillSoft stockholders generally. The boards of directors of SmartForce and SkillSoft were aware of these potential conflicts and considered them in reaching their decisions to approve the merger and to recommend that their
stockholders or shareholders vote in favor of the approval of the merger. These interests include: 



Executive Officers and Directors
.    The following current officers of SkillSoft or SmartForce will be appointed as executive
officers of the combined company following the effectiveness of the merger: 



Gregory M. Priest, Chairman and Chief Strategy Officer; 



Charles E. Moran, President and Chief Executive Officer; 



Thomas J. McDonald, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; 



Jeffrey N. Newton, Executive Vice President of Complex Solutions; 



Jerald A. Nine Jr., Executive Vice President, Content Solutions and General Manager, Books Division; 



Paul Henry, Executive Vice President of Corporate Marketing and Customer Services; 



Colm Darcy, Executive Vice President of Content Development; and 



Mark A. Townsend, Executive Vice President of Software Development. 

In addition, Mr. Priest, James S. Krzywicki and Ferdinand von Prondzynski, each of whom is a current director of SmartForce, will remain on the board of directors of the
combined company, and



Mr. Moran, Stewart K.P. Gross, William T. Coleman III and P. Howard Edelstein will be elected to the board of directors of the combined company following the consummation of the merger.



Employment
.    In connection with the merger, Gregory M. Priest, Charles E. Moran, Jeffrey N. Newton and Jerald A. Nine have entered
into employment agreements with SmartForce, whereby each has been provided with certain incentives to remain employed by the combined company following the effectiveness of the merger. See 
Agreements Related to the MergerEmployment
Agreements
 beginning on page 86 for a description of these agreements. 



Existing Stock Options
.    As of May 31, 2002, executive officers and directors of SkillSoft owned options to purchase a total of
690,000 shares of SkillSoft common stock (equivalent to 1,633,506 SmartForce ordinary shares represented by ADSs), at exercise prices ranging from $15.05 to $30.25 per SkillSoft share (equivalent to a range of $6.36 to $12.78 per SmartForce ADS), of
which 571,670 (equivalent to 1,353,372 SmartForce ordinary shares represented by ADSs) are unvested. SkillSoft options will be assumed by SmartForce in the merger. 



New Stock Option Grants.
    On July 12, 2002, following discussions of the boards of directors of both SmartForce and SkillSoft,
SmartForce granted options to purchase an aggregate of 3,135,000 SmartForce ordinary shares (represented by SmartForce ADSs) at an exercise price of $3.30 per share to Messrs. Priest, Newton, Darcy and Henry as an incentive for their continued
service with the combined company following the merger. Each of these options will vest over a four year period with one fourth (1/4th) of the ordinary shares subject to such option vesting on the one year anniversary of the applicable vesting
commencement date and an additional one forty-eighth (1/48th) of the total number of ordinary shares subject to such option vesting each month thereafter for thirty-six (36) months, based upon such individuals continued relationship with
the combined company. Under the terms of the merger agreement, SkillSoft is permitted to grant options for up to 2,400,000 shares of its common stock (equivalent to 5,681,760 SmartForce ordinary shares represented by ADSs based on the exchange ratio
with respect to the merger) between the execution of the merger agreement and the closing of the merger. Prior to the merger, SkillSofts board of directors anticipates granting options to Messrs. Moran, McDonald, Nine and Townsend as an
incentive for their continued service with the combined company following the merger. 



Non-Employee Directors.
    Mr. John J. Neuhauser, who currently serves on the board of directors of SkillSoft but will not serve as a
member of the board of directors of SmartForce after the closing of the merger, holds an option to purchase 40,000 shares of SkillSoft common stock at an exercise price of $30.25 per share. Mr. Neuhausers option will automatically vest and
become immediately exercisable in full upon the completion of the merger. In contemplation of the merger, the board of directors of SkillSoft extended the term of the option to the extent it is existing and vested at the closing date of the merger
such that it will expire on May 18, 2005. In connection with the merger, SmartForce has agreed to amend certain option agreements previously entered into with its non-employee directors Messrs. Conway, McDonagh and Grillos such that any options to
purchase SmartForce ADSs held by them which are existing and vested by the closing date of the merger will remain exercisable for the remainder of the relevant ten-year option term following a termination of each such non-employee directors
service to SmartForce. This action will not give any of these former directors any rights to purchase shares with respect to any options which are unvested at the time of the merger or that they would not otherwise have the right to purchase at the
time of the merger. 



Registration Rights.
    Warburg, Pincus Ventures, L.P., which is a principal stockholder of SkillSoft, will be an
affiliate of SmartForce following the merger. It will be restricted from selling the SmartForce ADSs it receives in the merger in the manner described in the section entitled 
Certain Securities Laws Considerations

beginning on page 74. Accordingly, Warburg has entered into a registration rights agreement with SmartForce. Under the terms of this agreement, Warburg may, on one occasion, require SmartForce to register for resale under the Securities Act the
SmartForce ADSs it receives in the merger. This agreement is intended substantially to replicate the rights which Warburg 

has under an existing registration rights agreement between Warburg and SkillSoft. See 
Agreements



Related to the MergerRegistration Rights Agreement
 beginning on page 91 for a description of this Agreement. 



Indemnification
.    SmartForce and SkillSoft directors and executive officers have customary rights to indemnification against losses
incurred as a result of actions or omissions occurring prior to the effective time of the merger. The merger agreement provides that, for a period of six years after the completion of the merger, SmartForce shall cause SkillSoft (as a wholly owned
subsidiary) to indemnify each present and former SkillSoft officer and director against liabilities arising out of such persons service as an officer or director. In addition, for a period of six years after the effective time of the merger,
SmartForce will also cause SkillSoft to maintain officers and directors liability insurance to cover any such liabilities. 

As a result, these directors, executive officers and shareholders could be more likely to vote in favor of recommending the merger agreement and the merger than if they did not have these interests.

Completion and Effectiveness of the Merger 

The merger will be completed when all of
the conditions to completion of the merger are satisfied or waived, including adoption of the merger agreement by the stockholders of SkillSoft and approval of the issuance of SmartForce ordinary shares, represented by ADSs, in the merger by the
shareholders of SmartForce. The merger will become effective upon the filing of the certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. 

Exchange of SkillSoft Stock Certificates for SmartForce ADRs 

When the merger is
completed, SmartForces exchange agent will mail to SkillSoft stockholders a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in surrendering SkillSoft stock certificates in exchange for SmartForce ADSs, representing SmartForce ordinary shares.
When former SkillSoft stockholders deliver their SkillSoft stock certificates to the exchange agent along with an executed letter of transmittal and any other required documents, the SkillSoft stock certificates will be canceled, and former
SkillSoft stockholders will receive SmartForce ADRs representing the number of full SmartForce ADSs to which they are entitled under the merger agreement. They will receive payment in cash, without interest, in lieu of any fractional SmartForce ADSs
which would have been otherwise issuable to them in the merger. In this case, the market value of the fractional shares will be based on the average of the last reported sales prices of SmartForce ADSs on the Nasdaq National Market for the ten (10)
consecutive trading days immediately preceding the last full trading day prior to the effective date of the merger. 

SmartForce will only issue SkillSoft stockholders SmartForce ADSs or checks in lieu of fractional shares in the name in which their surrendered SkillSoft stock certificates are registered. If SkillSoft stockholders wish to have their
certificates issued in another name they must present the exchange agent with all documents required to show and effect the unrecorded transfer of ownership and show that they paid any applicable stock transfer taxes. 

SkillSoft stockholders should not submit their SkillSoft stock certificates for exchange until they receive the transmittal
instructions and a form of letter of transmittal from the exchange agent. 

No Dividends 

SkillSoft stockholders are not entitled to receive any dividends or
other distributions on SmartForce ADSs, representing SmartForce ordinary shares, until the merger is completed and they have surrendered their SkillSoft stock certificates in exchange for SmartForce ADRs. Subject to the effect of applicable laws,
promptly following surrender of SkillSoft stock certificates and the issuance of the corresponding SmartForce ADSs, SkillSoft stockholders will be paid the amount, if any, of dividends or other distributions, without interest, paid to ADS holders
with record dates after the completion of the merger but before such stockholders surrendered their SkillSoft stock certificates. 



Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations 

For a summary
description of the material United States federal tax considerations of the merger, see 
Tax MattersMaterial United States Federal Income Tax Considerations
 on page 94. 

Accounting Treatment for the Merger 

The merger will be accounted for as a purchase
business combination for financial accounting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Although SmartForce will be acquiring SkillSoft as a legal matter, SkillSoft will be considered the acquirer for
accounting purposes. 

For purposes of preparing the combined companys consolidated financial statements, the
combined company will establish a new accounting basis for SmartForces assets and liabilities based upon their fair values as of the effective date of the merger, the merger consideration and the costs of the merger. Any excess of cost over
the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of SmartForce will be recorded as goodwill. Pursuant to Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations and No. 142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill will no longer be subject to amortization over its estimated useful life. Rather, goodwill will be subject to at least annual assessment for impairment based on a fair value test. Identifiable intangible
assets with finite lives will be amortized over those lives. A final determination of the intangible asset values and required purchase accounting adjustments, including the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based on their respective fair values, has not yet been made. The combined company will determine the fair value of SmartForces assets and liabilities and will make appropriate business combination accounting adjustments. However, for
purposes of disclosing pro forma information in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the combined company has made a preliminary determination of the purchase price allocation, based upon current estimates and assumptions, which is subject to
revision upon consummation of the merger. 

In addition, following the merger and consistent with SkillSoft being
the accounting acquirer, the combined company intends to adopt SkillSofts fiscal year ending January 31. Accordingly, if the merger is consummated on or prior to September 30, 2002 (the last day of SmartForces third quarter
of its current fiscal year), the combined companys third quarter will end on October 31, 2002. Subsequent to the closing, the combined companys fiscal quarters will end April 30 (1st Quarter), July 31 (2nd Quarter), October 31
(3rd Quarter) and January 31 (4th Quarter). 

Regulatory Filings and Approvals Required to Complete the Merger 

This merger is
subject to review by the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to determine whether it is in compliance with applicable antitrust laws. Under the provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended, the merger may not be consummated until the specified waiting period requirements of that Act have been satisfied. SmartForce and SkillSoft filed notification reports, together with requests for early termination of the waiting period, with
the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. On July 22, 2002, the waiting period expired. At any time before or after the merger, the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice or any state could take any action under the applicable antitrust or competition laws as it deems necessary or desirable. This action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or
requiring SkillSoft or SmartForce to dispose of certain businesses or assets. Private parties may also institute legal actions under the antitrust laws under some circumstances. 

This merger is also subject to review of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment of Ireland under the Mergers and Take-Overs (Control) Acts, 1978 to 1996. The
merger may not be consummated until the Minister has approved the merger or the specified waiting period requirements of that Act have been satisfied. 



In addition, the completion of the merger is subject to the effectiveness of the
registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part and compliance with applicable corporate laws of the State of Delaware and Ireland. 

Certain Securities Laws Considerations 

The SmartForce ordinary shares, represented
by ADSs, to be issued in the merger will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These shares will be freely transferable under the Securities Act, except for SmartForce ADSs issued to any person who is deemed to be an affiliate
of SkillSoft or SmartForce. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with SkillSoft or SmartForce and may include SkillSofts or SmartForces
executive officers and directors, as well as their principal stockholders or shareholders. Neither SkillSofts nor SmartForces affiliates may sell their SmartForce ADSs acquired in the merger except pursuant to: 



an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of those shares; 



an exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act; or 



any other applicable exemption under the Securities Act. 

No Appraisal or Dissenters Rights 

Under Delaware corporate law, holders of
SkillSoft common stock are not entitled to appraisal or dissenters rights in connection with the merger because, on the record date, SkillSoft common stock was designated and quoted for trading on the Nasdaq National Market and will be
converted into SmartForce ADSs, which at the effective time of the merger will be listed on the Nasdaq National Market. 

Under Irish law, holders of SmartForce ordinary shares are not entitled to appraisal or dissenters rights in connection with the merger. 

Listing on the Nasdaq National Market of SmartForce ADSs to be Issued in the Merger 

SmartForce has agreed to cause the SmartForce ADSs to be issued and to be reserved for issuance in connection with the merger to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq National Market, subject to official notice of issuance.

Delisting and Deregistration of SkillSoft Common Stock after the Merger 

If the merger
is completed, SkillSofts common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 



THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes
the merger agreement, which we hereby incorporate by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. While SmartForce and SkillSoft believe that the description covers the material terms of the merger agreement, this summary may not contain
all of the information that is important to you. The merger agreement is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A, and SmartForce and SkillSoft urge you to read it carefully. 

General 

Following the adoption of the merger agreement by SkillSoft stockholders, the
approval by SmartForce shareholders of the merger, the merger agreement, the issuance of SmartForce ordinary shares, represented by ADSs, in the merger and the related matters contained in the merger proposal and the satisfaction or waiver of the
other conditions to the merger, Slate Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of SmartForce, will merge with and into SkillSoft. SkillSoft will survive the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of SmartForce. If all of the conditions to the
merger are satisfied or waived, the merger will become effective at the time of the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. 

The Exchange Ratio and Treatment of SkillSoft Common Stock 

At the effective time
of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of SkillSoft common stock will be converted into the right to receive 2.3674 SmartForce ordinary shares, represented by ADSs. However, any shares owned by SkillSoft, SmartForce or any of their direct
or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries will be cancelled without conversion. SmartForce will adjust the exchange ratio to reflect any reclassification, stock split, stock dividend, reorganization or other similar change with respect to SmartForce
ADSs or ordinary shares or SkillSoft common stock occurring before the effective time of the merger. 

Based
on the exchange ratio of 2.3674, and based on the number of shares of SkillSoft common stock and options to purchase SkillSoft common stock outstanding as of June 5, 2002, a total of approximately 41,327,553 SmartForce ordinary shares, represented
by ADSs, and options to purchase approximately 
7,073,288 SmartForce ordinary shares, represented by ADSs, will be issued or granted in the merger. After the merger, based on shares outstanding as of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, the current SmartForce shareholders would own approximately 58% of the outstanding shares of SmartForce and the former SkillSoft stockholders would own approximately 42% of the outstanding shares of SmartForce. 

Treatment of SkillSoft Stock Options 

At the effective time of the merger, SmartForce
will assume all outstanding options, whether vested or unvested, to purchase shares of SkillSoft common stock and convert them into options to purchase SmartForce ordinary shares, represented by ADSs, subject to the same terms and conditions as were
applicable prior to the effective time of the merger, including, without limitation, any vesting provisions. The number of SmartForce ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of these stock options will be adjusted by multiplying such number by
the exchange ratio. Any fractional SmartForce shares resulting from such adjustment will be rounded down to the nearest whole number. The exercise price per SmartForce share issuable under each SkillSoft option will equal the exercise price per
share of the SkillSoft common stock purchasable under the SkillSoft option divided by the exchange ratio. The exercise price will be rounded up to the nearest whole cent. 

SmartForce will reserve for issuance a sufficient number of its ordinary shares, represented by ADSs, for delivery upon each assumed optionholders exercise of his or
her option. SmartForce will file within 30 days after the completion of the merger a registration statement on Form S-8 for the ordinary shares underlying the SmartForce ADSs issuable with respect to assumed SkillSoft stock options. 



Exchange of Certificates 

Exchange Agent; Exchange Procedures; No Further Ownership
Rights
.    As soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time of the merger, SmartForces exchange agent will mail to each record holder of SkillSoft common stock a letter of transmittal and instructions for
surrendering their certificates. Only those holders who properly surrender their certificates in accordance with the instructions will receive ADRs representing SmartForce ADSs, cash in lieu of any fractional SmartForce ADSs and any dividends or
distributions to which they are entitled. The surrendered certificates representing shares of SkillSoft common stock will be cancelled. After the effective time of the merger, each certificate representing shares of SkillSoft common stock that have
not been surrendered will only represent (1) the number of whole SmartForce ADSs into which such shares have been converted, (2) the right to receive cash in lieu of any fractional SmartForce ADS and (3) the right to receive any dividends or
distributions that may be applicable. Following the effective time of the merger, SkillSoft will not register any transfers of SkillSoft common stock on its stock transfer books. 

No Fractional Shares
.    SmartForce will not issue any fractional ADSs in the merger. Instead, each holder of shares of SkillSoft common stock
exchanged in the merger who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a SmartForce ADS will receive cash, without interest, equal to such fraction multiplied by the average of the last reported sales prices per SmartForce ADS on the
Nasdaq National Market for the ten trading days immediately preceding the last full trading day prior to the effective time of the merger. 

Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares
.    After the effective date of the merger, no dividends or other distributions declared or made after the closing of the merger with respect to
SmartForce ADSs will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered SkillSoft certificate until the holder surrenders its SkillSoft certificate in accordance with the letter of transmittal. 

Lost Certificates
.    If any SkillSoft common stock certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, a SkillSoft stockholder must provide an appropriate
affidavit certifying that fact. SmartForce may require a SkillSoft stockholder to deliver a bond as indemnity against any claim that may be made against SmartForce with respect to any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate. 

Holders of SkillSoft common stock should not send in their certificates until they receive a letter of transmittal from the exchange
agent.

Conduct of Business
. 

No Solicitation by SmartForce and SkillSoft 

SmartForce and SkillSoft further agreed to
cease, as of the date of the merger agreement, any and all existing discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted prior to that date with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal. An
Acquisition Proposal refers to: 



any inquiry, proposal or offer for a merger, consolidation, dissolution, sale of substantial assets, tender offer, recapitalization, share exchange or other
business combination involving SmartForce or SkillSoft or their subsidiaries; 





any proposal for the issuance of over 10% of the equity securities of either party or its subsidiaries; or 



any other proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, over 10% of the equity securities or consolidated total assets of either party;

other than the proposed merger between SmartForce and SkillSoft. 

Until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated, SmartForce and SkillSoft have agreed, on behalf of themselves and
their subsidiaries, officers, directors, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisers or representatives, not to directly or indirectly take any of the following actions: 



solicit, initiate, encourage or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; 



participate in any discussions or negotiations with a third party regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in
any way with, any Acquisition Proposal; 



except as described below relating to a Superior Proposal, withdraw or modify or publicly propose to withdraw or modify the approval or recommendation of the
board with respect to the merger; 



enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement constituting
or relating to any Acquisition Proposal; and 



adopt, approve, or recommend, or propose to adopt, approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal. 

For so long as its shareholders have not already approved the merger, either SmartForces or SkillSofts board of directors, as
the case may be, may, without breaching the merger agreement, respond to a Superior Proposal (as described below) by furnishing information to the party making the Superior Proposal and participating in discussions or negotiations with such party
regarding the Superior Proposal, if all of the following conditions are met: 



the board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that its fiduciary obligations require it to do so, and the
Superior Proposal does not result from a breach by SmartForce or SkillSoft of their nonsolicitation obligations under the merger agreement; and 



an executed confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all non-public information (which limitations must be no
less restrictive to the third party than the corresponding restrictions contained in the confidentiality agreement entered into between SmartForce and SkillSoft in connection with the merger) is obtained from the party making the Superior Proposal.

Either SmartForces or SkillSofts board of directors, as the case may be, may
without breaching the merger agreement, respond to a Superior Proposal by withdrawing or modifying its recommendation with respect to the merger if all of the following conditions are met: 



the board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that its fiduciary obligations require it to do so; and



such withdrawal or modification of its recommendation can be made only at such time that is prior to the applicable shareholders meeting and after the fifth
business day following receipt by the other party of written notice advising it that the board intends to do so and specifying the material terms of the Superior Proposal and the party making such Superior Proposal. 

A Superior Proposal is an unsolicited, bona fide, written proposal to acquire more than 50% of the equity
securities or assets of either SmartForce or SkillSoft pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, merger,



consolidation or sale of assets, on terms which either SmartForces or SkillSofts board of directors, as the case may be, determines in good faith to be more favorable from a financial
point of view to its shareholders than the merger, after considering the advice of an internationally recognized independent financial advisor and taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and provided that such proposal be
reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed and that any financing required to consummate the proposal must already be committed. 

Each party has agreed to immediately inform the other of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information or inquiry which can reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the identity of the person or group making any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. Furthermore, neither SmartForce nor SkillSoft shall provide any information
to or participate in discussions or negotiations with the person or group making a Superior Proposal until two business days after such party has first notified SmartForce or SkillSoft, as the case may be, of such Acquisition Proposal. The party
receiving the Acquisition Proposal has committed to keep the other fully informed, on a current basis, of the status and details, including any change to the terms of such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and shall provide copies of all
correspondence and other written material sent or provided, and if either SmartForce or SkillSoft, as the case may be, shall make a counterproposal, the other party shall consider and cause its financial and legal advisors to negotiate on its behalf
in good faith with respect to the terms of such counterproposal. The party receiving the Superior Proposal shall furnish a copy to the other party of any of the information provided by the maker of the Superior Proposal to the extent that such copy
has not previously been provided. In addition, the party receiving the Superior Proposal shall provide SmartForce or SkillSoft, as the case may be, with 24 hours advance notice of any meeting of its board of directors at which the board of directors
is reasonably expected to consider a Superior Proposal and with at least two business days prior written notice of a meeting in which the board is expected to recommend a Superior Proposal to its stockholders or shareholders together with a copy of
the definitive documentation relating to such Superior Proposal.

a person that owns, or is treated as owning, 10% or more of any class of SmartForce ADSs; 



a person who acquired shares of SkillSoft common stock or SmartForce ADSs through stock option or stock purchase programs or in other compensatory transactions;
or 



a person who is not a U.S. holder. 

For
purposes of the discussion below, a U.S. holder is a beneficial owner of SkillSoft common stock or SmartForce ADSs who or which is: (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or other entity
taxable as a corporation, that was created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof; (iii) an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation, regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust, if a
court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. citizens have the authority to control all of the substantial decisions of the trust. 

If a partnership holds SmartForce ADSs, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and upon the
activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding SmartForce ADSs, you should consult your tax advisor. 

Section 367 of the Internal Revenue Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder impose additional requirements for tax-free reorganization treatment on transactions where, as is the case in the merger, a U.S.
holder exchanges stock in a United States corporation for stock in a foreign corporation. In general, for an exchange of SkillSoft common stock for SmartForce ADSs by a U.S. holder in the merger to qualify for tax-free reorganization treatment (in
addition to meeting the requirements of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code), certain reporting requirements must be satisfied and each of the following conditions must be met: (i) no more than fifty percent of both the total voting power and
the total value of the stock of the transferee foreign



corporation is received, in the aggregate, by the United States transferors (as defined in the Treasury regulations) in the transaction; (ii) no more than fifty percent of each of the
total voting power and the total value of the stock of the transferee foreign corporation is owned, in the aggregate, immediately after the transaction by U.S. holders that are either officers or directors or five-percent stockholders
(as defined in the Treasury regulations and computed taking into account direct, indirect and constructive ownership) of the United States corporation; (iii) either (A) the U.S. holder is not a five-percent stockholder (computed taking
into account direct, indirect and constructive ownership) of the transferee foreign corporation or (B) the U.S. holder is a five-percent stockholder of the transferee foreign corporation and enters into an agreement with the Internal
Revenue Service to recognize gain under certain circumstances; and (iv) the active trade or business test is satisfied as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(3). 

In addition, this discussion does not address any of the tax consequences to any SkillSoft stockholder that will own 5% or more of either the total voting power or the
total value of the outstanding stock of SmartForce (including shares represented by ADSs) after the merger (determined after taking into account ownership under the applicable attribution rules of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury
regulations), and that fails to enter into a valid gain recognition agreement under applicable Treasury regulations. 

The following discussion is based on and subject to the Internal Revenue Code, the regulations promulgated thereunder, and existing administrative rulings and court decisions, all as in effect on the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and all of which are subject to change or varying interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion also is based upon assumptions, limitations, representations and covenants, including those contained in
representation letters of SmartForce, Slate Acquisition Corp., and SkillSoft for purposes of rendering the closing opinions described below under The Merger, and may not be relied upon if any of such assumptions, limitations,
representations or covenants are, or later become, inaccurate. 

The Merger 

Completion of the merger is conditioned on the receipt by SmartForce of an opinion from Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional
Corporation, SmartForces tax counsel, and the receipt by SkillSoft of an opinion from Hale and Dorr LLP, SkillSofts tax counsel, stating that the merger will be a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. These
opinions will be based upon the existing law and the continuing truth and accuracy of the representations of SkillSoft and SmartForce described above, and will be subject to certain assumptions and qualifications, including the assumption that the
merger will be effected pursuant to applicable state law and completed according to the terms of the merger agreement. If either tax counsel does not render a closing tax opinion, such condition nonetheless will be satisfied if tax counsel to the
other party renders an opinion to the party whose tax counsel has not done so. The closing tax opinions (1) will be based on facts, representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in the closing tax opinions, and (2) will rely on certain
representations and covenants of SmartForce, Slate Acquisition Corp. and SkillSoft, including those contained in representation letters delivered to Hale and Dorr LLP and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati Professional Corporation for the purpose
of their rendering the closing tax opinions. The opinions are also subject to the condition that SmartForce, SkillSoft and you comply with all applicable filings required under Section 367 of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder.

Based on the representations contained in the representation letters provided by SmartForce, Slate Acquisition
Corp., and SkillSoft, and subject to the assumptions and limitations discussed above, the following are the material United States federal income tax consequences that will generally result from treatment of the merger as a reorganization described
in Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code: 



no gain or loss will be recognized by SmartForce, SkillSoft or Slate Acquisition Corp. solely as a result of the merger; 



no gain or loss will be recognized by the U.S. holders of SkillSoft common stock upon the receipt of SmartForce ADSs solely in exchange for SkillSoft common
stock in the merger, except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares; 





cash payments received by U.S. holders of SkillSoft common stock in lieu of a fractional share will result in capital gain (or loss) measured by the difference
between the cash payment received and the portion of the tax basis in the shares of SkillSoft common stock surrendered that is allocable to such fractional share. Such gain (or loss) will be long-term capital gain (or loss) if the shares of
SkillSoft common stock allocable to such fractional share have been held for more than one year at the effective time of the merger; 



the aggregate tax basis of the SmartForce ADSs received by SkillSoft stockholders in the merger will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the SkillSoft
common stock surrendered in exchange therefor reduced by any tax basis allocable to a fractional share for which cash is received; and 



the holding period with respect to SmartForce ADSs received by each SkillSoft stockholder in the merger will include the holding period for the SkillSoft common
stock surrendered in exchange therefor. 

The tax opinions are not binding on the Internal
Revenue Service or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service or the courts will not take a contrary view. No ruling from the Internal Revenue Service has been or will be sought. Future legislative, judicial or
administrative changes or interpretations could alter or modify the statements and conclusions set forth herein, and any such changes or interpretations could be retroactive and could affect the tax consequences of the merger to SmartForce,
SkillSoft, or the stockholders of SmartForce and SkillSoft. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions set forth in the closing tax opinions or that a court will not sustain such a challenge. 

Reporting Requirements
.    Each SkillSoft stockholder that receives SmartForce ADSs in the merger
will be required to file a statement with his, her or its federal income tax return setting forth his, her or its tax basis in the SkillSoft common stock surrendered and the fair market value of the SmartForce ADSs and cash, if any, received in the
merger, and to retain permanent records of these facts relating to the merger. 

Ownership of SmartForce ADSs

Distributions
.    SmartForce does not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable
future. If SmartForce does pay any dividends, however, the gross amount of any dividend received by U.S. holders with respect to SmartForce ADSs generally will be taxed at ordinary income tax rates to the extent such dividend does not exceed
SmartForces current or accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To the extent any dividend exceeds SmartForces earnings and profits, the dividend will be treated as a tax-free return of
capital to the extent of a U.S. holders adjusted tax basis in SmartForce ADSs and will be applied against and reduce such basis on a dollar-for-dollar basis (thereby increasing the amount of gain and decreasing the amount of loss recognized on
a subsequent disposition of such stock). To the extent that the distribution exceeds a U.S. holders adjusted tax basis, the distribution will be taxed as if it was gain recognized on a sale or exchange of SmartForce ADSs. See


Sale or Other Disposition of SmartForce ADSs
,
 below. Because SmartForce is not a U.S. corporation, no dividends-received deduction will be allowed to corporations with respect to dividends paid by SmartForce.
Dividends paid with respect to SmartForce ADSs will generally be treated as foreign source passive income for U.S. tax purposes. 

Sale or Other Disposition of SmartForce ADSs
.    In general, in connection with the sale or other taxable disposition of SmartForce ADSs: 



gain or loss will be recognized by the seller in an amount equal to the difference (if any) between the amount realized on such sale or other taxable
disposition and the sellers adjusted tax basis in the SmartForce ADSs; 



gain or loss recognized on the sale or other taxable disposition will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the holding period
for SmartForce ADSs is more than one year at the time of the sale or other disposition; 





any gain or loss recognized on the sale or other taxable disposition will be treated as having a U.S. source for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes; and



the ability to deduct capital losses is subject to limitations. 

Passive foreign investment company.
    U.S. holders generally would be subject to a special, adverse tax regime (that would differ in certain
respects from that described above) if SmartForce is or were to become a passive foreign investment company (PFIC) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. SmartForce believes that it is not a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
However, the determination of PFIC status for the current taxable year cannot be made until the end of the current taxable year. The determination of SmartForces status as a PFIC will depend on, among other things, a valuation of
SmartForces assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets. In calculating goodwill, the value of SmartForces total assets will be based on their total market value which, in turn, is based on the market value of
SmartForces shares and is subject to change. Thus, a significant decrease in the price of SmartForce ADS may result in SmartForce being classified as a PFIC. No assurance can be given that SmartForce will not be classified as a PFIC for the
current year or in future years. 

SmartForce will be classified as a PFIC in a particular taxable year if either
(i) 75% or more of its gross income for the taxable year is passive income, or (ii) at least 50% of the average value of all of SmartForces assets for the taxable year produce or are held for the production of passive income. The Internal
Revenue Service has stated that cash balances, even if held as working capital, are considered to be assets that produce passive income. 

If SmartForce were classified as a PFIC, any gain recognized by a U.S. holder upon the sale of SmartForce ADSs, or the receipt of certain distributions, generally would be treated as ordinary income. Such income would be
allocated over the period that the U.S. holder held SmartForce shares and an interest charge would be imposed on the amount of deferred tax on such income allocated to prior taxable years. If SmartForce were determined to be a PFIC, however, a U.S.
holder could elect to treat his or her shares as an interest in a qualified electing fund (a QEF Election), in which case the U.S. holder would be required to include in income annually his or her proportionate share of SmartForces
income and net capital gain in years in which SmartForce was a PFIC, but any gain subsequently recognized upon the sale by such U.S. holder of the shares would generally be taxed as capital gain. If a QEF Election is made, SmartForce would have to
furnish certain information on an annual basis to U.S. holders who have made the QEF Election. Alternatively, a U.S. holder could make an election (a Mark-to-Market Election), pursuant to which the U.S. holder would be required to
include as ordinary income annually the excess of the fair market value of the SmartForce ADSs over the U.S. holders basis therein. If a U.S. holder makes a Mark-to-Market Election, then any gain recognized upon the sale by such U.S. holder of
his or her SmartForce ADSs generally would be taxed as ordinary income in the year of sale. 

SkillSoft
stockholders should consult with their own tax advisors regarding eligibility for, and the manner and advisability of making the QEF Election or Mark-to-Market Election if SmartForce is treated as a PFIC. 

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
.    Any dividends paid, or proceeds from a sale of, SkillSoft
common stock or SmartForce ADSs to or by a U.S. holder may be subject to U.S. information reporting, and a backup withholding tax may apply. United States federal income tax laws require that, to avoid backup withholding on reportable
payments, each SkillSoft stockholder must (a) provide SmartForce with such stockholders correct taxpayer identification number on Form W-9 and certify as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding or (b) establish a basis for
exemption from backup withholding on a Form W-8 (including a form W-8BEN, W-8ECI, W-8EXP and W-8IMY) or Form W-9, as applicable. The backup withholding rate is currently 30%. Exempt stockholders (including, among others, all corporations and certain
foreign individuals) are not subject to backup withholding and reporting requirements. If SmartForce is not provided with the correct TIN or an adequate basis for exemption, the stockholders may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the Internal
Revenue Service. If withholding is made and results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained provided that the required information is furnished to the Internal Revenue Service. Reportable



payments made pursuant to the merger will be reported to the extent required by the Internal Revenue Code to SkillSoft stockholders and the Internal Revenue Service. 

This discussion is not intended to be a complete analysis or description of all potential U.S. federal income tax consequences or any
other consequences of the merger or the holding of SmartForce ADSs. This discussion does not address any consequences arising under the laws of any state, locality or foreign jurisdiction. This discussion also does not address the tax consequences
of an exchange or conversion of options or warrants for SkillSoft common stock into options or warrants for SmartForce ADSs. 

Accordingly, SkillSoft stockholders are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific tax consequences of the merger, including tax return reporting requirements, the applicability of federal, state, local and
foreign tax laws and the effect of any proposed change in the tax laws. 

Material Irish Tax Considerations 

The following is a general summary of certain of the
Irish tax consequences applicable to Irish and U.S. Holders (as defined below) in respect of the purchase, ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares or ADSs evidenced by ADRs. 

This summary is based on Irish taxation laws currently in force, regulations promulgated thereunder, the current provisions of the Convention between the Government of the
United States of America and the Government of Ireland for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and capital gains (the Treaty), specific proposals to amend any of the
forgoing publicly announced prior to the date hereof and the currently published administrative practices of the Irish Revenue Commissioners, all as of the date hereof. Taxation laws are subject to change, from time to time, and no representation is
or can be made as to whether such laws will change, or what impact, if any, such changes will have on the statements contained in this summary. No assurance can be given that proposed amendments will be enacted as proposed, or that legislative or
judicial changes, or changes in administrative practice, will not modify or change the statements expressed herein. 

Holders of
ordinary shares or ADSs are advised to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the application of Irish Taxation Laws to their particular circumstances in relation to the purchase, ownership or disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs.

This summary is of a general nature only and does not discuss all aspects of Irish taxation that may be
relevant to a particular Irish or U.S. Holder. The summary only applies to Irish and U.S. Holders that legally and beneficially hold their ordinary shares or ADSs evidenced by ADRs as capital assets and does not address special classes of holders
including, but not limited to, dealers in securities, insurance companies, pension schemes, employee share ownership trusts, collective investment undertakings, charities, tax-exempt organizations, financial institutions and close companies, each of
which may be subject to special rules not discussed below. 

Irish Tax Considerations Applicable to Irish Holders 

For the purposes of this
discussion, an Irish Holder means a holder of ordinary shares or ADSs evidenced by ADRs that (i) beneficially owns the ordinary shares or ADRs registered in their name; (ii) in the case of individual holders, are resident, ordinarily
resident and domiciled in Ireland under Irish taxation laws; (iii) in the case of holders that are companies, are resident in Ireland under Irish taxation laws; and (iv) are not also resident in any other country. 

For Irish taxation purposes, Irish Holders of ADSs will be treated as the owners of the underlying ordinary shares represented by such
ADSs. 



Taxation of Dividends
.    We do not expect to pay
dividends in the foreseeable future. Should we begin paying dividends, such dividends will generally be subject to dividend withholding tax (DWT) in Ireland at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20%). Where DWT applies, we will
be responsible for withholding such tax at source. 

Corporate Irish Holders will generally be entitled to claim an
exemption from DWT by delivering a declaration to us in the form prescribed by the Irish Revenue Commissioners. Such corporate Irish Holders will generally not otherwise be subject to Irish tax in respect of dividends received. 

Individual Irish Holders will be subject to income tax on the gross amount of any dividend (for example, the amount of the
dividend received plus any DWT withheld), at their marginal rate of tax (currently either 20% or 42% depending on the individuals circumstances). Individual Irish Holders will be able to claim a credit against their resulting income tax
liability in respect of DWT withheld. 

Individual Irish Holders may, depending on their circumstances, also be
subject to the Irish health levy of 2% and pay related social insurance contribution of up to 3% in respect of their dividend income. 

Disposals of Ordinary Shares or ADSs
.    Irish Holders that acquire ordinary shares or ADSs will be considered, for Irish tax purposes, to have acquired their ordinary shares or ADSs at a base cost
equal to the amount paid for the ordinary shares or ADSs and certain allowable costs of acquisition. On subsequent dispositions, ordinary shares or ADSs acquired at an earlier time will generally be deemed, for Irish tax purposes, to be disposed of
on a first in first out basis before ordinary shares or ADSs acquired at a later time. 

Irish Holders
that dispose of their ordinary shares or ADSs will be subject to capital gains tax (CGT) to the extent that the proceeds realized from such disposition exceed the indexed base cost of the ordinary shares or ADSs disposed of and any
incidental expenses. The current rate of CGT is 20%. 

Irish Holders that realize a loss on the disposition of
ordinary shares or ADSs will generally be entitled to offset such allowable losses against capital gains realized from other sources in determining their capital gains tax liability in a year. Allowable losses which remain unrelieved in a year may
generally be carried forward indefinitely for Irish capital gains tax purposes and applied against capital gains in future years. 

Capital Acquisitions Tax
.    A gift or inheritance of ordinary shares or ADSs will fall within the charge to Irish capital acquisitions tax (CAT). CAT is currently chargeable at a rate of 20% on
the value of gifts or inheritances above specified tax free thresholds. Different classes of tax free thresholds apply depending upon the relationship between the donor and the recipient. Gifts or inheritances taken on or after December 5, 1991 are
aggregated with the same group threshold for the purposes of arriving at the amount of tax on a current gift or inheritance. 

Stamp Duty
.    Irish stamp duty, which is a tax imposed on certain documents, is payable on all transfers of ordinary shares (other than transfers made between spouses, transfers made between 90% associated
companies, or certain other exempt transfers) regardless of where the document of transfer is executed. Irish stamp duty is also payable on electronic transfers of ordinary shares. 

A transfer of ordinary shares made as part of a sale will be stampable at the ad valorem rate of 1% of the value of the consideration received for the transfer, or, if
higher, the market value of the shares transferred. 

Where the consideration for a sale is expressed in a currency
other than euro, the duty will be charged on the euro equivalent calculated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of the transfer. 

Transfers of ordinary shares where no beneficial interest passes (e.g. a transfer of shares from a beneficial owner to a nominee), will generally be exempt from stamp duty if the transfer form contains
an appropriate certification, otherwise a nominal stamp duty rate of 12.50 will apply. 



Transfers of ADRs by Irish Holders are generally exempt from Irish stamp duty. 

Transfers of ordinary shares from the Depositary or the Custodian upon surrender of ADSs for the purposes of withdrawing the underlying
ordinary shares from the ADS/ADR system, and transfers of ordinary shares to the depositary or the custodian for the purposes of transferring ordinary shares onto the ADS/ADR system, will be stampable at the ad valorem rate of 1% of the value of the
shares transferred if the transfer relates to a sale or contemplated sale or any other change in the beneficial ownership of ordinary shares. Such transfers will be exempt from Irish Stamp Duty if the transfer does not relate to or involve any
change in the beneficial ownership in the underlying ordinary shares and the transfer form contains the appropriate certification. In the absence of an appropriate certification, stamp duty will be applied at the nominal rate of 12.50.

The person accountable for the payment of stamp duty is the transferee or, in the case of a transfer by way of
gift or for consideration less than the market value, both parties to the transfer. Stamp duty is normally payable within 30 days after the date of execution of the transfer. Late or inadequate payment of stamp duty will result in liability for
interest, penalties and fines. 

Irish Tax Considerations Applicable to U.S. Holders 

Solely for the purposes of this
summary of certain Irish tax considerations, a U.S. Holder means a holder of ordinary shares that (i) is resident in the United States for the purposes of the Treaty, (ii) is not also resident of, or ordinarily resident in, Ireland for
Irish tax purposes, (iii) is not engaged in any trade or business and does not perform independent personal services through a permanent establishment or fixed base in Ireland, and (iv) where a holder is a corporation, is not ultimately controlled
by persons resident in Ireland. 

For Irish taxation purposes, and for the purposes of the Treaty, U.S. Holders of
ADSs will be treated as the owners of the underlying ordinary shares represented by such ADSs. 

Taxation of
Dividends
.    We do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. Should we begin paying dividends, such dividends will generally be subject to DWT in Ireland at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20%). Where
DWT applies, we will be responsible for withholding such tax at source. 

Dividends paid by us to U.S. Holders of
ordinary shares will be exempt from DWT if, prior to the payment of such dividends, the recipient U.S. Holder delivers to us a declaration, a certificate of residency and, in the case of U.S. Holders that are corporations, an auditors
certificate, each in the form prescribed by the Irish Revenue Commissioners. 

Special DWT arrangements may be
available to U.S. Holders of ADSs evidenced by ADRs should the depositary enter into an intermediary agreement with the Irish Revenue Commissioners prior to the payment of dividends by us. Under such an agreement, it is possible for the depositary
to receive dividends from us and pass such dividends onto U.S. Holders of ADRs on a gross basis, without DWT, if either: 



the ADR register maintained by the depositary shows the U.S. Holder as having a U.S. address on the register; or 



where there is an intermediary between the depositary and the beneficial owner of ADSs, the depositary receives confirmation from the intermediary that the
beneficial owners address in the intermediarys records is in the U.S. 

The
depositary has not, to date, entered into an intermediary agreement with the Irish Revenue Commissioners. 

Where
the above procedures have not been complied with and DWT is withheld from dividend payments to U.S. Holders of ordinary shares or ADSs evidenced by ADRs, such U.S. Holders can apply to the Irish Revenue



Commissioners claiming a full refund of DWT paid by filing a declaration, a certificate of residency and, in the case of U.S. Holders that are corporations, an auditors certificate, each in
the form prescribed by the Irish Revenue Commissioners. 

The DWT rate applicable to U.S. Holders is reduced to 5%
under the terms of the Treaty for corporate U.S. Holders holding 10% or more of our shares, and to 15% for other U.S. Holders. While this will generally entitle U.S. Holders to claim a partial refund of DWT from the Irish Revenue Commissioners, U.S.
Holders will, in most circumstances, likely prefer to seek a full refund of DWT under Irish domestic legislation. 

Capital Gains on Disposals of Ordinary Shares or ADSs
.    U.S. Holders will not be subject to Irish capital gains tax (CGT) on the disposal of ordinary shares or ADSs provided that such ordinary
shares or ADSs are quoted on a stock exchange at the time of disposition. A stock exchange for this purpose includes, among others, the Nasdaq National Market (Nasdaq). While it is our intention to continue the quotation of ADSs
evidenced by ADRs on Nasdaq, no assurances can be given in this regard. 

If, for any reason, our ADSs cease to be
quoted on Nasdaq, U.S. Holders will not be subject to Irish CGT on the disposal of their ADSs evidenced by ADRs provided that the ADSs do not, at the time of the disposal, derive the greater part of their value from land, buildings, minerals, or
mineral rights or exploration rights in Ireland. 

Irish Capital Acquisitions Tax
.    A
gift or inheritance of ordinary shares or ADSs evidenced by ADRs will fall within the charge to Irish capital acquisitions tax (CAT) because our ordinary shares are considered to be Irish property for CAT purposes. CAT is currently
chargeable at a rate of 20% on the value of gifts or inheritances above specified tax free thresholds. Different classes of tax free thresholds apply depending upon the relationship between the donor and the recipient. Gifts or inheritances taken on
or after December 5, 1991 are aggregated with the same group threshold for the purposes of arriving at the amount of tax on a current gift or inheritance. 

In a case where an inheritance of ordinary shares or ADSs is subject to both Irish CAT and U.S. federal estate tax, the Convention between the Government of the United States of America and the
Government of Ireland for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on estates of deceased persons should allow for the crediting, in whole or in part, of the Irish CAT against the U.S. federal
estate tax payable. Similar relief is not available in a case where a gift of ordinary shares or ADSs evidenced by ADRs is subject both to Irish CAT and U.S. federal gift tax since the Estate Tax Convention only applies to estate taxes.

Stamp Duty
.    Irish stamp duty will apply to transfers of ordinary shares or ADSs by
U.S. Holders on the same basis as outlined above for Irish Holders. 



DESCRIPTION OF SMARTFORCE SHARE CAPITAL 

General 

SmartForces authorized share capital is 13,200,000, divided into
120,000,000 ordinary shares, par value 0.11 per share. SmartForces authorized share capital is the number of ordinary shares available for issuance by SmartForce under its memorandum and articles of association. As of June 5, 2002,
57,403,910 equivalent ADSs representing 57,403,910 ordinary shares were issued and outstanding. None of SmartForces ordinary shares are currently held in treasury. 

The following summarizes rights of holders of SmartForces ordinary shares and is based upon SmartForces memorandum and articles of association and applicable
Irish corporate law. The summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to SmartForces memorandum and articles of association, which have been incorporated by reference as exhibits to the registration
statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part. 

In the following description, a
shareholder or a holder of ordinary shares is the person registered in SmartForces register of members as the holder of the relevant ordinary share. AIB Custodial Nominees Limited, registrars, will be the registered holder for those ordinary
shares represented by ADSs for the benefit of The Bank of New York, as depositary. 

Ordinary Shares 

All of the outstanding ordinary shares are fully paid and not
issued in violation of any purchase option, call option, right of first refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or similar right. The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as and when declared by the SmartForce board out
of funds legally available therefor and, in the event of the dissolution of SmartForce, to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities. Each holder of an ordinary share is entitled to one vote for each share held of record on
all matters presented to a vote at a shareholders meeting, including the election of directors. Holders of ordinary shares have no cumulative voting rights or preemptive rights to purchase or subscribe for any shares other securities and there are
no conversion rights or redemption or sinking fund provisions with respect to such shares. 

Share Certificates 

The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive certificates
within two months of the date of issuance of their shares, in a form as may be prescribed by law and by the board of directors, certifying the number and class of shares owned by the shareholder. Each certificate shall have SmartForces
corporate seal affixed to it. 

Transfers of Ordinary Shares 

Except as otherwise established by rules adopted by the
board of directors, and subject to applicable law, ordinary shares may be transferred on SmartForces books by the surrender to SmartForce, or its transfer agent, of a properly stamped and duly executed stock transfer form, a duly executed
certificate representing the ordinary shares and, if executed under a power of attorney, a properly executed written power of attorney, together with any proof of authority or the authenticity of signature as SmartForce or its transfer agent may
otherwise reasonably request. 

Irish Stamp Duty 

For a discussion of the tax imposed on the transfer of ordinary
shares, see 
Tax MattersMaterial Irish Tax Considerations
 on page 98. 



Subscription Rights 

On October 4, 1998 the board of directors of SmartForce
adopted a subscription rights declaration, pursuant to which one subscription right was granted for each ordinary share of SmartForce. These subscription rights apply to both ordinary shares of SmartForce that were outstanding at the time the
subscription rights declaration was adopted and to any ordinary shares that are subsequently issued, including the ordinary shares underlying ADSs to be issued in the merger. Each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from SmartForce one
ordinary share at a price of $65.00 per ordinary share, subject to adjustment. The rights are not currently exercisable, but would be exercisable if certain events occurred related to a person or group acquiring or attempting to acquire beneficially
15% or more of the outstanding ordinary shares (an acquiring person, as more particularly defined in the subscription rights declaration). The rights expire on October 4, 2008, unless cancelled or exchanged earlier by SmartForce. 

In the event that any person becomes an acquiring person, each holder of a subscription right will thereafter generally
have the right to receive upon exercise that number of ordinary shares having a market value of two times the then current purchase price per share. However, after the occurrence of any such event, all subscription rights that are, were or
subsequently become beneficially owned by that acquiring person, any person related thereto or any transferee therefrom will become null and void. 

The rights have certain anti-takeover effects. The rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire SmartForce without conditioning the offer on cancellation of the
rights or on a substantial number of the rights being acquired. Accordingly, the existence of the rights may deter acquirors from making takeover proposals and tender offers. Takeover proposals and tender offers typically result in an increase in
the trading price of the stock of the target company. However, the rights are designed to provide additional protection against abusive takeover tactics such as offers for all shares at less than full value or at an inappropriate time (in terms of
maximizing long-term shareholder value), partial tender offers and selective open-market purchases. The rights are intended to enhance the power of the board of directors of SmartForce to protect shareholders and SmartForce if efforts are made to
gain control of SmartForce in a manner that is not in the best interests of SmartForce and its shareholders. The rights should not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by the board of directors of SmartForce.

On June 10, 2002, prior to approving the merger agreement, the board of directors of SmartForce amended the
rights plan to render it inapplicable to the merger and related transactions described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

Transfer Agent, Registrar and Paying Agent 

The transfer agent and registrar for
SmartForces ordinary shares is Computershare Investor Services (Ireland) Limited, Heron House, Corrig Road, Sandyford Industrial Estate, Dublin 18, Ireland. The telephone number at this location is 353-1-216-3100. The transfer agent and
registrar for the ADSs is The Bank of New York located at 101 Barclay Street, New York, NY 10286. The telephone number at this location is 212-495-1784. 



DESCRIPTION OF AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES 

To facilitate ownership of interests in
SmartForces ordinary shares and trading in the United States, ADSs relating to the ordinary shares are issued by a depositary in New York to persons who deposit the ordinary shares with the depositary. The ADSs are evidenced by ADRs executed
and delivered by The Bank of New York. Subject to the terms of the deposit agreements by and among The Bank of New York, SmartForce and the owners and beneficial owners from time to time of the ADSs, each holder of an ADS is entitled proportionately
to all of the rights and preferences of one ordinary share represented thereby contained in SmartForces memorandum and articles of association. 

Each SmartForce ADS represents one ordinary share deposited under the deposit agreements. The ADR is the receipt which represents the number of ADSs to which you are entitled. You will not own
SmartForces ordinary shares directly unless you withdraw the ordinary shares that you deposit. As a holder of ADRs, your rights will be governed by the deposit agreements. 

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the deposit agreements. For more complete information, you should read the entire agreements including the form of
ADR. The deposit agreements have been incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part. Copies of the deposit agreements and SmartForces memorandum and articles of
association are also available for inspection at the corporate trust office of The Bank of New York, currently located at 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York 10286, and at the principal office of AIB Custodial Nominees Limited, as the
depositarys custodian, currently located at AIB Trade Centre, P.O. Box 518, International Financial Services Centre, Dublin 1, Ireland. The Bank of New Yorks principal executive office is located at One Wall Street, New York, NY 10286.

American Depositary Receipts 

ADRs evidencing the SmartForce ADSs are issuable by The
Bank of New York under the deposit agreements. Each ADR represents an ownership interest in one or more ADSs (and such ADSs represent ordinary shares which SmartForce will deposit with AIB Custodial Nominees Limited, as the custodian, in Ireland).
Each ADR may also from time to time represent securities, cash or other property deposited with the depositary, as a result of distributions SmartForce may from time to time make on the ordinary shares, but which are not distributed to ADR holders.
The circumstances in which the depositary will deliver to a holder of SmartForce ADSs distributions on the ordinary shares are described below. 

You may hold ADRs either directly or indirectly through your broker or other financial institution. If you hold ADRs directly, you are an ADR holder. The ADR will be in physical form if held by you
directly, and may be in book-entry or electronic form if held by a broker or other financial institution on your behalf. This description assumes you hold your ADRs directly. If you hold your ADRs indirectly, you must rely on the procedures of your
broker or other financial institution to assert your rights described in this section. You should consult with your broker or financial institution to find out what those procedures are. 

Because the depositary will actually hold the ordinary shares, you must rely on it to exercise the rights of a shareholder. The obligations of the depositary are described
in the deposit agreements. 

New York law generally governs the deposit agreements and the ADRs. 

Dividends and Other Distributions 

The depositary has agreed to pay to you the cash
dividends or other distributions it or the custodian receives on ordinary shares or other deposited securities, after deducting its fees and expenses. You will receive these distributions in proportion to the number of ordinary shares your ADRs
represent. You must hold the ADRs on



the date established by SmartForce to be eligible for dividends and other distributions. If SmartForce does not establish a date, the depositary may establish it to determine who is eligible.

For a discussion of the cash dividends or other distributions SmartForce may make on the ordinary shares,
including distributions as a result of SmartForces liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, see 
Comparison of Shareholder RightsIssuance of Shares; Dividends; Repurchase of Shares
 and 
Liquidation;
Dissolution; Winding-Up.

Cash 

If SmartForce pays any cash dividend or other cash distributions it declares in a
currency other than U.S. dollars, the depositary will convert any cash dividend or other cash distribution that SmartForce pays on its shares into U.S. dollars if it can do so on a reasonable basis and can transfer the U.S. dollars to the United
States. If that is not possible or if any approval from the government of Ireland is needed and cannot be obtained, the agreement allows the depositary to distribute U.S. dollars only to those ADS holders to whom it is possible to do so. It will
hold the currency it cannot convert into U.S. dollars for the account of the ADS holders who have not been paid. It will not invest the currency it cannot convert and it will not be liable for any interest. 

Before making a distribution, the depositary will deduct any withholding taxes that must be paid under Irish law. For U.S. holders of
ADSs, it will distribute only whole U.S. dollars and cents and will round fractional cents down to the nearest whole cent. If the exchange rates fluctuate during a time when the depositary cannot convert the currency in which the dividend has been
paid into U.S. dollars, you may lose some or all of the value of the distribution. 

Ordinary Shares 

The depositary may distribute new ADSs representing any ordinary
shares which SmartForce distributes as a dividend or free distribution, if SmartForce furnishes it promptly with satisfactory evidence that it is legal to do so. The depositary will distribute new ADSs in proportion to the number of ADSs you already
own. The depositary will only distribute whole ADSs. It will sell ordinary shares which would require it to issue a fractional ADS and distribute the net proceeds in the same way as it does with cash. If the depositary does not distribute additional
ADSs, the number of ordinary shares represented by each outstanding ADS will also be adjusted to reflect the new ordinary shares. 

Rights to receive additional shares
.    If SmartForce offers holders of its securities any rights to subscribe for additional ordinary shares or any other rights, the depositary has discretion to
determine how these rights become available to you as a holder of ADSs. SmartForce must first instruct the depositary to do so and furnish it with satisfactory evidence that it is legal to do so. If SmartForce does not furnish this evidence and/or
give these instructions and the depositary decides it is practical to sell the rights, the depositary will sell the rights and distribute the proceeds in the same way it does with cash. The depositary could decide it is not legal or practical to
make the rights available to you, or it could decide that it is only legal or practical to make the rights available to some but not all holders of the ADSs. The depositary may allow the rights that are not distributed or sold to lapse. In that
case, you will receive no value for them. The depositary is not responsible for a failure in determining whether or not it is legal or practical to distribute the rights. 

If the depositary makes rights available to you, upon instruction from you, it will exercise the rights and purchase the ordinary shares on your behalf. The depositary will
then deposit the ordinary shares and issue ADSs to you. It will only exercise rights if you pay it the exercise price, any other charges the rights require you to pay and the fees and expenses of the deposit. 

United States securities laws may restrict the sale, deposit, cancellation, and transfer of the ADSs issued after exercise of rights. For
example, if you are an affiliate of SmartForce or SkillSoft, you may not be able to



trade the new ADSs issued in the merger freely in the United States. In this case, the depositary may issue the new ADSs under a separate restricted deposit agreement which will contain the same
provisions as the deposit agreements, except for changes needed to put the restrictions in place. 

Other Distributions 

The depositary will send to you anything else SmartForce
distributes on deposited securities by any means it thinks is legal, fair and practical. If it cannot make the distribution in that way, the depositary has a choice. It may decide to sell what SmartForce distributed and distribute the net proceeds,
in the same way as it does with cash or it may decide to hold what SmartForce distributed, in which case the outstanding ADSs will also represent the newly distributed property. 

The depositary is not responsible if it decides that it is unlawful or impractical to make a distribution available to any ADS holders. SmartForce has no obligation to
register ADSs, ordinary shares, rights or other securities under the Securities Act. SmartForce also has no obligation to take any other action to permit the distribution of ADSs, ordinary shares, rights or anything else to ADS holders. This means
you may not receive the distributions SmartForce makes on its ordinary shares or any value for them if it is illegal or impractical to make them available to you. 

Deposit, Withdrawal and Cancellation 

Method for the depositary to issue
ADRs
.    The depositary will issue ADRs if you or your broker deposit ordinary shares or evidence of rights to receive ordinary shares with the custodian. Upon payment of its fees and expenses and of any taxes or charges,
such as stamp taxes or stock transfer taxes or fees, the depositary will register the appropriate number of ADRs in the names you request and will deliver the ADRs at its office to the persons you request. 

Method for an ADR Holder to cancel ADRs and obtain ordinary shares
.    You may turn in your ADRs at the
depositarys office. Upon payment of its fees and expenses and of any taxes or charges, such as stamp taxes or stock transfer taxes or fees, the depositary will deliver (1) the underlying ordinary shares to an account designated by you to the
extent legally permissible and (2) any other deposited securities underlying the ADRs at the office of the custodian or, at your request, risk and expense, the depositary will deliver the ordinary shares at its office. 

Voting Rights 

You do not have the right as an ADS holder to attend
SmartForces shareholder meetings. You may instruct the depositary to vote the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs but only if SmartForce asks the depositary to ask for your instructions. You could exercise your right to vote directly if you
turn in your ADSs and withdraw the ordinary shares. However, you may not know about the meeting far enough in advance to withdraw the ordinary shares. 

When SmartForce notifies the depositary of an upcoming vote, the depositary, if requested in writing by SmartForce, will notify you of the upcoming vote and arrange to deliver SmartForces voting
materials to you. The materials will describe the matters to be voted on, explain how you, if you hold the ADSs on a date specified by the depositary, may instruct the depositary to vote the ordinary shares or other deposited securities underlying
your ADSs as you direct and to request a poll for each matter for which you gave directions. The materials will also include a statement that, if you do not give the depositary instructions, the depositary may give a discretionary proxy to a person
that SmartForce designates. For your instructions to be valid, the depositary must receive them in writing on or before a date specified by the depositary. The depositary will try, as far as practical, subject to Irish law and the provisions of
SmartForces articles of association, to vote or to have its agents vote the ordinary shares or other deposited securities as you instruct. The depositary will only vote or attempt to vote as you instruct. 



If you do not give the depositary instructions, you will be considered to have
instructed the depositary to give a discretionary proxy to a person designated by SmartForce. However, no instruction will be deemed to have been given, and the depositary will not give a discretionary proxy, if the matter to be voted upon:



is a matter not submitted to shareholders by means of a proxy statement comparable to that specified in the United States proxy rules; 



is the subject of a counter-solicitation, or is part of a proposal made by a shareholder which is being opposed by SmartForces management; 



is related to a merger or consolidation, except in limited circumstances involving a merger between SmartForce and a wholly-owned subsidiary; 



authorizes mortgaging of property; 



authorizes or creates indebtedness or increases the authorized amount of indebtedness; 



authorizes or creates preference shares or increases the authorized amount of existing preference shares; 



alters the terms or conditions of any shares then outstanding or existing indebtedness; 



involves the waiver or modification of preemptive rights, except when SmartForces proposal is to waive these rights for ordinary shares being offered
under share option or purchase plans involving the additional issuance of not more than 5% of SmartForces outstanding ordinary shares; 



alters voting provisions or the proportionate voting power of a class of shares, or the number of its votes per share, except where cumulative voting provisions
govern the number of votes per share for election of directors and SmartForces proposal involves a change in the number of its directors by not more than 10% or not more than one; 



changes existing quorum requirements for shareholder meetings; 



authorizes issuance of ordinary shares, or options to purchase ordinary shares, to SmartForces directors, officers, or employees in an amount which
exceeds 5% of the total amount of the class outstanding. However, when no plan is amended to extend its duration, SmartForce shall factor into the calculation the number of ordinary shares that remain available for issuance, the number of ordinary
shares subject to outstanding options and any ordinary shares being added. Should there be more than one plan being considered at the same meeting, all ordinary shares will be aggregated; 



authorizes (a) a new profit-sharing or special remuneration plan, or a new retirement plan, the annual cost of which will amount to more than 10% of
SmartForces average annual income before taxes for the preceding five years, or (b) the amendment of an existing plan which would bring the annual costs above 10% of SmartForces five-year average annual income before taxes. Should there
be more than one plan being considered at the same meeting, all costs are aggregated; exceptions may be made in cases of: (a) retirement plans based on agreement or negotiations with labor unions or which have been or are to be approved by labor
unions, and (b) any related retirement plan for benefit of non-union employees having terms substantially equivalent to the terms of a union-negotiated plan, which is submitted for action of shareholders concurrently with a union-negotiated plan;



changes SmartForces purposes or powers to an extent which would permit SmartForce to change to a materially different line of business and it is
SmartForces stated intention to make such a change; 



authorizes the acquisition of property, assets, or a company, where the consideration to be given has a fair value of 20% or more of the market value of
SmartForces previously outstanding ADSs and ordinary shares; 



authorizes the sale or other disposition of 20% or more of SmartForces assets or earning power as measured prior to the closing of the transaction;





authorizes a transaction which is not in the ordinary course of business in which an officer, director or substantial security holder of SmartForce has a direct
or indirect interest; or 



reduces SmartForces earned surplus by 51% or more, or reduces earned surplus to an amount less than the aggregate of the three previous years
ordinary share dividends computed at the current dividend rate. 

SmartForce cannot assure you
that you will receive the voting materials in time to ensure that you can instruct the depositary on how to vote your shares. In addition, the depositary and its agents are not responsible for failing to carry out voting instructions or for the
manner of carrying out voting instructions. This means that you may not be able to exercise your right to vote and there may be nothing you can do if the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs are not voted as you requested. 

Fees and Expenses 

ADS holders must pay:

For:

$ 5.00 or less per 100 ADSs

Each issuance of an ADS, including as a result of a distribution of ordinary shares or rights or other property

Each cancellation of an ADS, including if the deposit agreements terminate

$ 0.02 or less per ADS

Any cash payment

Registration or transfer fees

Transfer and registration of ordinary shares on the share register of the foreign registrar from your name to the name of the
depositary or its agent when you deposit or withdraw ordinary shares

Expenses of the depositary

Conversion of euros to U.S. dollars

Cable, telex and facsimile transmission expenses, if expressly provided in the deposit agreements

Distribution fees

Distribution of securities equal to fee charged for deposit of securities

Up to $1.50 per certificate

Transfers made pursuant to the terms of the deposit agreements

Taxes and other governmental charges

Any necessary charges the depositary or custodian have to pay on any ADS or ordinary share underlying an ADS, for example, stock
transfer taxes, stamp duty or withholding taxes

Payment of Taxes 

You will be responsible for any taxes or other governmental
charges payable on your ADRs or on the deposited securities underlying your ADRs. The depositary may refuse to transfer your ADRs or allow you to withdraw the deposited securities underlying your ADRs until such taxes or other charges are paid. The
depositary may deduct the amounts of taxes owed from any payments to you. It may also sell deposited securities, by public or private sale, to pay any taxes owed. You will remain liable if the proceeds of the sale are not enough to pay the taxes. If
the depositary sells deposited securities, it will, if appropriate, reduce the number of ADSs to reflect the sale and pay to you any proceeds, or send to you any property remaining after it has paid the taxes. 



Reclassifications, Recapitalizations and Mergers 

If SmartForce:

Changes the nominal or par value of its ordinary shares.

Then:

The cash, shares or
other securities received by the depositary will become deposited securities.

Reclassifies, splits up or consolidates any of the deposited securities.

Each ADS will automatically represent its equal share of the newly deposited securities.

Distributes securities on the ordinary shares that are not distributed to you, or recapitalizes, reorganizes, merges,
liquidates, sells all or substantially all of its assets or takes similar action.

The depositary may, and will if, when SmartForce asks them to, distribute some or all of the securities it received, or cash,
or other consideration in lieu of the securities received. It may also issue new ADRs or ask you to surrender your outstanding ADRs in exchange for new ADRs identifying now deposited securities.

Amendment and Termination 

Amendment of the Deposit
Agreements
.    SmartForce may agree with the depositary to amend the deposit agreements and the ADSs without your consent for any reason. If the amendment adds or increases fees or charges, except for taxes and other
governmental charges or expenses of the depositary, or prejudices an important right of ADS holders, it will only become effective 30 days after the depositary notifies you of the amendment. At the time an amendment becomes effective, you are
considered, by continuing to hold your ADSs, to agree to the amendment and to be bound by the ADSs and the amended deposit agreements. 

Termination of the Deposit Agreements
.    The depositary will terminate the deposit agreements if SmartForce asks it to do so. The depositary may also terminate the deposit agreements if it has
told SmartForce that it would like to resign and SmartForce has not appointed a new depositary bank within 90 days. In both cases, the depositary must notify you at least 90 days before termination. 

After termination, the depositary and its agents will be required to do only the following under the deposit agreements: 



advise you that the deposit agreements are terminated; 



collect distributions on the deposited securities; and 



deliver ordinary shares and other deposited securities upon cancellation of ADRs. 

One year after termination, the depositary will, if practical, sell any remaining deposited securities by public or private sale. After that, the depositary will hold
the money it received on the sale, as well as any other cash it is holding under the deposit agreements for the pro rata benefit of the ADS holders that have not surrendered their ADRs. It will not invest the money and has no liability for interest.
The depositarys only obligations will be to account for the proceeds of the sale and the cash. After termination, SmartForces only obligations will be with respect to indemnification and to pay certain amounts to the depositary.

Limitations on Obligations and Liability to ADS Holders 

Limitations on
SmartForces Obligations and the Obligations of the Depositary; Limitations on Liability to Holders of ADSs
.    The deposit agreements expressly limit SmartForces obligations and the obligations of the depositary.
They also limit SmartForces liability and the liability of the depositary. SmartForce and the depositary: 



are only obligated to take the actions specifically described in the deposit agreements without engaging in negligence or bad faith; 





are not liable if either party is prevented or delayed by law or circumstances beyond its control from performing their obligations under the deposit
agreements; 



are not liable if either party exercises discretion permitted under the deposit agreements; 



have no obligation to become involved in a lawsuit or other proceeding related to the ADSs or the deposit agreements on your behalf or on behalf of any other
party; and 



may rely upon any documents they believe in good faith to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party. 

In the deposit agreements, SmartForce agrees to indemnify the depositary from any liability which may arise out of acts
performed or omitted by the depositary other than those arising out of the depositarys bad faith or negligence. 

Requirements for Depositary Actions 

Before the depositary will issue or register a
transfer of an ADS, make a distribution on an ADS, or permit withdrawal of ordinary shares, the depositary may require: 



payment of stock transfer or other taxes or other governmental charges and transfer or registration fees charged by third parties for the transfer of any
ordinary shares or other deposited securities; 



production of satisfactory proof of the identity and genuineness of any signature or other information it considers necessary; and 



compliance with regulations it may establish, from time to time, consistent with the deposit agreements, including presentation of transfer documents.

The depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer or register transfers of ADRs generally when
the transfer books of the depositary, SmartForces transfer books or those of The Depositary Trust Company, are closed or at any time if the depositary or SmartForce thinks it is advisable to do so. 

Your Right to Receive the Shares Underlying your ADSs 

You have the right to cancel
your ADSs and withdraw the underlying ordinary shares at any time except: 



When temporary delays arise because: 



the transfer books are closed by SmartForce or the depositary; 



the transfer of ordinary shares is blocked to permit voting at a shareholders meeting; or 



SmartForce is paying a dividend on the ordinary shares; 



When you or other ADS holders seeking to withdraw ordinary shares owe money to pay fees, taxes and similar charges; or 



When it is necessary to prohibit withdrawals to comply with any laws or governmental regulations that apply to ADSs or to the withdrawal of ordinary shares or
other deposited securities. 

This right of withdrawal may not be limited by any other provision
of the deposit agreements. 

Pre-Release of ADSs 

In limited circumstances, subject to the provisions of the
deposit agreements, the depositary may issue ADRs before deposit of the underlying ordinary shares. This is called a pre-release of the ADS. The depositary may also deliver ordinary shares upon cancellation of pre-released ADSs, even if the ADSs are
cancelled before the pre-release transaction has been closed out. 



A pre-release is closed out as soon as the underlying ordinary shares are
delivered to the depositary. The depositary may receive ADSs instead of ordinary shares to close out a pre-release. The depositary may pre-release ADSs only under the following conditions: 



before or at the time of the pre-release, the person to whom the pre-release is being made must represent to the depositary in writing that it or its customer
owns the ordinary shares or ADSs to be deposited; 



the pre-release must be fully collateralized with cash or other collateral that the depositary considers appropriate; and 



the depositary must be able to close out the pre-release on not more than five business days notice. 

In addition, the depositary will limit the number of ADSs that may be outstanding at any time as a result of pre-release, although the
depositary may disregard the limit from time to time, if it thinks it is appropriate to do so. 

Disclosure of Interests 

By acquiring ADSs, you agree to comply with
SmartForces memorandum and articles of association and the laws of Ireland regarding any disclosure requirements regarding ownership of ordinary shares, all as if the ADSs were, for this purpose, the ordinary shares they represent. By
purchasing ADSs, you also agree to be bound by provisions of the deposit agreements mandating compliance with the disclosure requirements of Irish company law which require any person who acquires an interest in 5% or more of a companys shares
to notify the company within 5 business days of such acquisition, and thereafter of any changes in interest above or below the 5% level. 

As a public company, the Irish Companies Act, 1990, (as amended) and SmartForces articles of association will permit SmartForce and its directors to request information from you related to your
ownership of the ADSs issued by the depositary. Irish law and SmartForces articles of association impose penalties for failing to comply with the disclosure requirements, including the possibility of having the voting rights of the ordinary
shares underlying the ADSs withdrawn, losing the right to distributions or criminal penalties. 

To facilitate
compliance with the notification requirements, ADS holders may deliver any notification to the depositary, and the depositary will, as soon as practicable, forward the notification to SmartForce and, to the extent practicable and as permitted by
applicable law, any authorities in Ireland as specified by the ADS holder. 

Information Regarding the Depositary

DESCRIPTION OF SKILLSOFT CAPITAL STOCK 

General 

SkillSofts authorized capital stock consists of 50,000,000 shares
of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share. As of June 5, 2002, there were 17,456,937 outstanding shares of common stock and options to purchase an aggregate of 2,987,788 shares
of common stock. No shares of preferred stock are outstanding. The following summary of certain provisions of SkillSofts securities and various provisions of SkillSofts certificate of incorporation and bylaws is not intended to be
complete and reference is made to SkillSofts certificate of incorporation and bylaws. For more information, see 
Where You Can Find More Information
 on page 
137. 

Common Stock 

Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held on
all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders and do not have cumulative voting rights. Accordingly, holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors may elect all of the directors standing for
election. Holders of common stock are entitled to receive proportionately any dividends declared by the board of directors, subject to any preferential dividend rights of outstanding preferred stock. Upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of SkillSoft, the holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably SkillSofts net assets available after the payment of all debts and other liabilities and subject to the prior rights of any outstanding preferred stock. Holders of
common stock have no preemptive, subscription, redemption or conversion rights. The rights, preferences and privileges of holders of common stock are subject to the rights of the holders of shares of any series of preferred stock which SkillSoft may
designate and issue in the future. Under certain circumstances, some of the holders of common stock have the right to require SkillSoft to register their shares of common stock under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 

Preferred Stock 

Under the terms of SkillSofts certificate of incorporation, the
board of directors is authorized to designate and issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without stockholder approval. The board has discretion to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting
rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, of each series of preferred stock. 

The purpose of authorizing the board of directors to issue preferred stock and determine its rights and preferences is to eliminate delays associated obtaining stockholder approval of issuances of preferred stock. The issuance of
preferred stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from attempting to acquire, a
majority of SkillSofts outstanding voting stock. SkillSoft has no present plans to issue any shares of preferred stock. 

Delaware Anti-Takeover Law and Certain Charter and Bylaw Provisions 

SkillSoft is
subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law Statute. In general, these provisions prohibit a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested
stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved by the board of directors and/or stockholders of SkillSoft in a
prescribed manner. A business combination includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, an interested stockholder is a
person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns, or within three years did own, 15% or more of the corporations voting stock. 



SkillSofts certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for the division
of the board of directors into three classes as nearly equal in size as possible with staggered three-year terms. Any vacancy on the board of directors, including a vacancy resulting from an enlargement of the board of directors, may only be filled
by vote of a majority of the directors then in office. The classification of the board of directors and the limitations on the filling of vacancies could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discourage a third party from
attempting to acquire, control of SkillSoft. 

SkillSofts bylaws also provide that any action required or
permitted to be taken by SkillSofts stockholders at an annual meeting or special meeting of stockholders may only be taken if it is properly brought before such meeting and may not be taken by written action in lieu of a meeting. The bylaws
further provide that special meetings of the stockholders may only be called by the Chairman of the Board, President or SkillSofts board of directors, as a whole. In order for a stockholder to have a matter properly brought before a meeting of
the stockholders, a stockholder must comply with certain requirements regarding advance notice and provide certain information to SkillSoft. These provisions could have the effect of delaying until the next stockholders meeting stockholder actions
which are favored by the holders of a majority of SkillSofts outstanding voting securities. These provisions could also discourage a third party from making a tender offer for SkillSofts outstanding common stock, because even if it
acquired a majority of SkillSofts outstanding voting securities, it would be able to take action as a stockholder (such as electing new directors or approving a merger) only at a duly called stockholders meeting and not by written
consent. 

Transfer Agent and Registrar 

The transfer agent and registrar for the common stock is
Mellon Investor Services LLC (formerly, ChaseMellon Shareholder Services L.L.C.). 



COMPARISON OF SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS 

SkillSoft is a corporation incorporated under the
laws of the State of Delaware. The rights of SkillSoft common stockholders are governed by Delaware law and by SkillSofts certificate of incorporation and bylaws. 

SmartForce is a public limited company organized under the laws of Ireland. The rights of the holders of SmartForce ADSs are governed by Irish law, SmartForces
memorandum and articles of association and the deposit agreements. 

If the merger is completed, SkillSoft common
stockholders will become holders of SmartForce ADSs and the rights of such former SkillSoft common stockholders will be governed by Irish law, the SmartForce memorandum and articles of association and the deposit agreements. 

While SmartForce and SkillSoft believe that the following description covers the material differences between the two companies
governing laws and instruments, this summary may not contain all of the information that is important to you. This summary is not intended to be a complete discussion and it is qualified in its entirety to applicable Irish and Delaware laws and the
governing instruments of SmartForce and SkillSoft. You should carefully read the following summary as well as the other documents we refer to for a more complete understanding of the differences between being a SkillSoft common stockholder and being
a holder of SmartForce ADSs. For a description of the rights of the holders of SmartForces ADSs and SkillSofts common stock see 
Description of American Depositary Shares
 and 
Description of SkillSoft Capital
Stock
 on pages 104 and 112, respectively. 

SmartForces and SkillSofts respective
organizational documents are on file with the SEC and will also be sent to you upon request. See 
Where You Can Find More Information
 on page 137. The following summarizes the material differences between the rights of holders of
SkillSoft common stock and SmartForce ADSs: 

Board of Directors 

Size of the Board of
Directors
.    Delaware law permits the board of directors to change the authorized number of directors by amendment to the bylaws or in the manner provided in the bylaws unless the number of directors is fixed in the
certificate of incorporation, in which case a change in the number of directors may be made only by amendment to the certificate of incorporation. The SkillSoft bylaws provide that the number of directors shall be determined by resolution of the
board of directors, but in no event shall be less than three. SkillSoft currently has six directors. 

Under Irish law, companies must have at least two directors. SmartForces articles of association provide for a board size of up to a maximum of ten directors, subject to modification by shareholder resolution. SmartForce
currently has six directors. If the merger proposal is approved, SmartForces articles of association will be amended to provide for a board size of up to a maximum of seven directors. 

Cumulative Voting
.    Delaware law only permits cumulative voting in the election of directors if it is specifically provided for in the
certificate of incorporation. If cumulative voting for directors is permitted, each share of stock normally having one vote may have a number of votes equal to the number of directors to be elected. A stockholder may then cast all such votes for a
single candidate or allocate them among as many candidates as the stockholder chooses. SkillSofts certificate of incorporation does not allow cumulative voting for the election of directors. 

Cumulative voting is essentially unknown under Irish law. As a result, holders of a majority of the ordinary shares entitled to vote may
elect all of the directors standing for election.

Directors
.    Delaware law permits, but does not require, a classified board of directors. SkillSofts bylaws provide for a classified board of directors that is divided into three classes, with each class



serving a three year term and only one class standing for election in any given year. Having a classified board such as SkillSofts under which one-third of the directors of a corporation
are elected for terms of three years makes changing the composition of the board, and thus a potential change in control of a corporation, a lengthier and more difficult process. 

SmartForces articles of association do not provide for a classified board but instead provide for retirement by rotation. SmartForces articles of association
provide that at each annual general meeting of shareholders, one third of the directors, rounded down to the next whole number if it is a fractional number, are required to retire from office. The retiring directors are those who have been in office
for the longest period of time since they were last elected. Retirement for persons who became directors or were reappointed on the same day is determined by lot, unless otherwise agreed. Shareholders may reappoint any director who retires at an
annual general meeting. In contrast to a classified board, retirement by rotation is not based upon the actual year or class of such directors appointment but such persons length of tenure as a director for the company since such
directors last election. 

Removal of Directors
.    Under Delaware law, a director
of a corporation that has a classified board of directors or cumulative voting may be removed only with cause unless otherwise provided in the corporations certificate of incorporation. SkillSofts bylaws require the vote of the holders
of 66

/

% of the stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote at an election of directors, to remove a
director for cause. 

Under the Irish Companies Acts, the shareholders of a company may, by ordinary
resolution, remove a director provided that shareholders have been given no less than 28 days prior notice of such proposed resolution. 

Filling Vacancies on the Board of Directors
.    Delaware law permits vacancies and newly created directorships to be filled by a majority of the remaining directors unless otherwise provided in the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws. Each director elected in this manner holds office until his or her successor is elected at the next annual meeting at which the class to which the directorship belongs is to be elected or at a special meeting
called for that purpose. SkillSofts bylaws provide that any vacancy on the board may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office. 

Under SmartForces articles of association, shareholders may appoint a person as a director to fill a vacancy created by retirement or by increasing the size of the board. The board of directors
may also appoint a person as a director either to fill a vacancy or as an additional director. As a matter of practice, any director appointed by the board in this manner will serve until the companys next annual general meeting of
shareholders and will be subject to re-election at that meeting although this is not required under SmartForces articles of association. 

Shareholders Meetings; Voting 

Annual Shareholders
Meetings
.    Delaware law requires an annual meeting of stockholders. Under SkillSofts bylaws, an annual meeting of stockholders shall be held at a place and time designated by the board of directors, chairman of the
board or president. 

Under Irish law, a general meeting of shareholders must be held each year in Ireland unless
either the shareholders entitled to attend and vote at the meeting unanimously consent in writing to the meeting being held elsewhere or a resolution has been passed at the preceding annual general meeting providing that the meeting be held
elsewhere or the articles of association of the company do not provide that the annual general meeting shall be held in Ireland. Annual general meetings must be held once every year. If a meeting is not held within 15 months after the last meeting,
the Irish Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment may, on the application of any shareholder, call or direct the calling of an annual general meeting. 

Special or Extraordinary Shareholders Meetings
.    Under Delaware law, a special meeting of stockholders may be called by the board of directors or by any other person
authorized to do so in the certificate of



incorporation or the bylaws. Under the SkillSoft bylaws and certificate of incorporation, SkillSofts board of directors may call a special meeting of stockholders. 

Extraordinary general meetings of SmartForce shareholders may be held either within or outside Ireland and may be called by either the
board of directors or at the request of shareholders holding not less than one-tenth of the companys outstanding voting share capital. 

Notice of Shareholders Meetings
.    Under Delaware law, written notice of general and special meetings of SkillSoft stockholders must be given not less than ten nor
more than sixty days before the date of the meeting. 

Unless all the shareholders of a company and the
companys auditors consent to shorter notice, Irish company law requires at least 14 days written notice of a meeting, except that an annual general meeting or a meeting convened for the passing of a special resolution requires at least 21 days
written notice. Meetings for the passing of a special resolution may also be called on shorter notice if so agreed by a majority in number of the shareholders who together hold not less than 90% in nominal value of the shares giving the right to
attend and vote at such meeting. Extended notice of not less than 28 days is required when resolutions of an annual general meeting relate to the appointment of an auditor other than the retiring auditor or provide expressly that a retiring auditor
shall not be reappointed or resolutions at a general meeting relate to the removal of a companys auditors before the expiration of their term of office or the appointment of an auditor to fill a vacancy or the removal of a director before the
expiration of his term in office or the appointment of someone as a director in place of the removed director at the meeting at which he is removed. 

The terms of any resolution, whether special or otherwise, before a general meeting may be amended by ordinary resolution moved at the meeting provided that the terms of the resolution as amended will
still be such that adequate notice of the intention to pass the same can be deemed to have been given. 

Quorum
.    Under SkillSofts bylaws, the holders of a majority of SkillSofts stock that is issued, outstanding and entitled to vote upon the business to be transacted at the meeting, if present,
in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum. 

Under SmartForces articles of association, three or more
shareholders present in person or by proxy, being entitled to vote upon the business to be transacted at the meeting and who together hold not less than one-third of the issued voting shares of SmartForce, constitute a quorum at shareholders
meetings. 

Voting at Shareholders Meetings
.    Under Delaware law, a
companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws govern stockholders voting rights. SkillSofts certificate of incorporation entitles each common stockholder to one vote for each share held on all matters submitted to a vote of the
stockholders. Delaware law also provides that the right to vote by written ballot may be restricted if so provided in the certificate of incorporation. SkillSofts certificate of incorporation does not contain such a restr
