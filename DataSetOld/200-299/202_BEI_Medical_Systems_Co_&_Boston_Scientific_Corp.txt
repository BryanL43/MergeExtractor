                            CALCULATION OF FILING FEE

TRANSACTION VALUATION*                                    AMOUNT OF FILING FEE**
     $94,660,000                                                 $8,709

*Estimated for purposes of calculating the amount of the filing fee only. The
fee was calculated by (i) multiplying $6.8426, the per share tender offer
price for shares of Common Stock, by 9,857,691, the currently outstanding
shares of Common Stock sought in the Offer, which gives an aggregate
consideration of $67,452,236.44 (the "Common Stock Consideration"), and (ii)
multiplying $13.6852, the per share tender offer price for shares of
Preferred Stock, by 1,114,485, the currently outstanding shares of Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock sought in the Offer, which gives an aggregate
consideration of $15,251,950.12 for such Preferred Stock (the "Preferred
Stock Consideration" and together with the Common Stock Consideration, the
"Total Stock Consideration"). The Total Stock Consideration was then added to
$11,955,251.98, being the net consideration for the Subject Company's
2,714,347 in-the-money employee stock options and warrants to arrive at a
total transaction value of approximately $94,660,000.

**Calculated at the rate of $92.00 per $1 million.

      whether any charges or commissions will apply. For more details, please
      see the "Introduction."

HAVE ANY STOCKHOLDERS ALREADY AGREED TO TENDER THEIR SHARES?

    - Yes. Certain of the directors and executive officers of BEI, as well as
      certain holders of Shares have entered into a stockholders agreement with
      us, whereby they have agreed to tender all of their Shares, and have
      granted an option to us to purchase the options and warrants they hold to
      purchase additional Common Shares, in total representing approximately
      24.0% of the outstanding Common Shares (including Common Shares issuable
      upon exercise or conversion of options and warrants held by these
      stockholders), and approximately 98.8% of the outstanding

                                      iii

      Series A Shares, together which comprise approximately 37.4% of the
      outstanding voting securities of BEI. These directors and executive
      officers, together with such stockholders, have also agreed to vote in
      favor of the Merger and against any competing acquisition proposal. For
      more details, please see Section 10.

WHAT ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER?

    - We are not obligated to purchase any Shares unless the Shares validly
      tendered and not properly withdrawn before the expiration of the Offer
      represent at least a majority of the outstanding Common Shares, including,
      all Common Shares issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Shares, or
      upon the conversion or exercise of any options, warrants, rights or other
      convertible securities, and at least a majority of the Series A Shares,
      or, in each case, such higher percentage of such class of securities as
      may be required to approve the Merger pursuant to BEI's Restated
      Certificate of Incorporation, as amended from time to time, or applicable
      law. For more details, please see Section 1 and Section 14.

    - We are not obligated to purchase any Shares unless, prior to the
      expiration of the Offer, the applicable waiting period, if any, under the
      HSR Act has expired or been terminated. Based on the fact that BEI has
      reported both its total worldwide assets and annual worldwide net sales to
      be less than $10,000,000, the parties believe that no filing is required
      under the HSR Act. For more details, please see Sections 14 and 15.

    - The Offer also is subject to a number of other conditions which are
      described in greater detail in Sections 1 and 14.

DO YOU HAVE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO MAKE PAYMENT?

    - Yes. The Offer is not subject to a financing condition. BSC will provide
      the funds necessary to purchase the Shares in the Offer from existing
      resources or borrowing availability. For more details, please see
      Section 9.

IS YOUR FINANCIAL CONDITION RELEVANT TO MY DECISION TO TENDER IN THE OFFER?

    - Because the form of payment consists solely of cash and the Offer is not
      contingent upon our receipt of financing, we do not believe our financial
      condition is relevant to your decision to tender in the Offer.

HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO TENDER IN THE OFFER?

    - You will have at least until 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on
      Wednesday, June 26, 2002, to decide whether to tender your Shares in the
      Offer. If you cannot deliver everything that is required in order to make
      a valid tender by that time, you may be able to use a guaranteed delivery
      procedure which is described in Section 3 of this Offer to Purchase. For
      more details, please see Section 3.

CAN THE OFFER BE EXTENDED, AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES?

    - Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement and applicable law, we can
      extend the period of time during which the Offer remains open. We have
      agreed in the Merger Agreement that we may extend the Offer if certain
      conditions to the Offer have not been satisfied. We have also agreed in
      the Merger Agreement that, at the request of BEI, we will extend the Offer
      if certain conditions to the Offer have not been satisfied. For more
      details, please see Section 1.

                                       iv

HOW WILL I BE NOTIFIED IF THE OFFER IS EXTENDED?

    - If we decide to extend the Offer, we will inform The Bank of New York,
      which is the Depositary for the Offer, of that fact, and will issue a
      press release giving the new expiration date no later than 9:00 a.m., New
      York City time, on the day after the day on which the Offer was previously
      scheduled to expire. For more details, please see Section 1.

WILL THERE BE A SUBSEQUENT OFFERING PERIOD?

    - Following satisfaction or waiver of all the conditions to the Offer and
      the acceptance of and payment for all the Shares tendered during the
      offering period, we may elect to provide a subsequent offering period.
      This would allow us to accept additional Shares that were not tendered
      prior to the expiration of the Offer. During a subsequent offering period,
      you will not be able to withdraw any of the Shares that you have already
      tendered, because such Shares will have already been accepted for payment
      by us, nor any of the Shares that you tender during such subsequent
      offering period. If we elect to provide a subsequent offering period, we
      will announce it by issuing a press release no later than 9:00 a.m., New
      York City time, on the day after the expiration of the Offer. For more
      details, please see Section 1.

HOW DO I TENDER MY SHARES?

    To tender your Shares in the Offer, you must:

    - complete and sign the accompanying Letter of Transmittal (or a manually
      signed facsimile of the Letter of Transmittal) in accordance with the
      instructions in the Letter of Transmittal and mail or deliver it together
      with your share certificates, and any other required documents, to the
      Depositary;

    - tender your Shares pursuant to the procedure for book-entry transfer set
      forth in Section 3; or

    - if your share certificates are not immediately available or if you cannot
      deliver your share certificates, and any other required documents, to the
      Depositary, prior to the expiration of the Offer, or you cannot complete
      the procedure for delivery by book-entry transfer on a timely basis, you
      may still tender your Shares if you comply with the guaranteed delivery
      procedures described in Section 3.

UNTIL WHAT TIME CAN I WITHDRAW PREVIOUSLY TENDERED SHARES?

    - You may withdraw previously tendered Shares any time prior to the
      expiration of the Offer and, unless we have accepted and paid for the
      Shares pursuant to the Offer, you may also withdraw any tendered Shares at
      any time after July 28, 2002. For more details, please see Section 4.

HOW DO I WITHDRAW PREVIOUSLY TENDERED SHARES?

    - To withdraw previously tendered Shares, you must deliver a written or
      facsimile notice of withdrawal with the required information to the
      Depositary while you still have the right to withdraw. If you tendered
      Shares by giving instructions to a broker or bank, you must instruct the
      broker or bank to arrange for the withdrawal of your Shares. For more
      details, please see Section 4.

WHAT DOES BEI'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS THINK OF THE OFFER?

    - We are making the Offer on the basis of the Merger Agreement. The Board of
      Directors of BEI (i) has unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement
      and the transactions contemplated thereby, including each of the Offer and
      the Merger, and the transactions contemplated by the stockholder agreement
      are fair to, and in the best interests of, you, as a holder of Shares,
      (ii) has approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and
      the transactions

                                       v

      contemplated thereby, and (iii) has resolved to recommend that you accept
      the Offer and tender your Shares.

WILL BEI CONTINUE AS A PUBLIC COMPANY?

    - No. If the Merger occurs, BEI will no longer be publicly owned. Even if
      the Merger does not occur, if we purchase all of the tendered Shares,
      there may be so few remaining holders of or publicly held Common Shares
      that the Common Shares will no longer be eligible to be traded through the
      Nasdaq National Market, or other securities market, there may not be a
      public trading market for the Common Shares, and BEI may cease making
      filings with the Commission or otherwise cease being required to comply
      with Commission rules relating to publicly held companies. For more
      details, please see Section 13.

WILL THE OFFER BE FOLLOWED BY A MERGER IF ALL THE SHARES ARE NOT TENDERED?

    - If we accept for payment and pay for Shares that represent not less than
      ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding Shares on an "as-converted" basis,
      Purchaser will merge with and into BEI. If required by applicable law, BEI
      may solicit your vote by providing to you a proxy statement relating to
      approval of the Merger.

    - If the Merger occurs, BEI will become a private, wholly owned subsidiary
      of BSC, and each issued and then outstanding Share, other than any Shares
      held in the treasury of BEI and any Shares held by holders seeking
      appraisal under Delaware law for their Shares, will be canceled and
      converted automatically into the right to receive $6.8426 per Common Share
      and $13.6852 per Series A Share, in cash, or any greater amount per Share
      paid pursuant to the Offer.

IF I DECIDE NOT TO TENDER, HOW WILL THE OFFER AFFECT MY SHARES?

    - If you decide not to tender your Shares in the Offer and the Merger
      occurs, unless you have exercised your rights to seek appraisal of your
      Shares, you will receive in the Merger the same amount of cash per Share
      as if you had tendered your Shares in the Offer. Therefore, if the Merger
      occurs and you have not sought an appraisal, the only difference to you
      between tendering and not tendering your Shares is that you will be paid
      earlier if you tender your Shares. The rights you have to seek appraisal
      of your Shares are described in this Offer to Purchase. For more details,
      please see Section 11.

    - If you decide not to tender your Shares in the Offer and the Merger does
      not occur, if we purchase all the tendered Shares, there may be so few
      remaining holders of Shares and publicly held Common Shares that the
      Common Shares will no longer be eligible to be traded through the Nasdaq
      National Market, or other securities market, there may not be a public
      trading market for the Common Shares, and BEI may cease making filings
      with the Commission or otherwise cease being required to comply with
      Commission rules relating to publicly held companies. For more details,
      please see Section 13.

WHAT IS THE MARKET VALUE OF MY SHARES AS OF A RECENT DATE?

    - On Tuesday, May 28, 2002, the closing price per Common Share, as reported
      on the Nasdaq National Market, was $6.790 per share. On Monday, May 13,
      2002, the last full trading day before we announced our Offer, the closing
      price per share, as reported on the Nasdaq National Market, was $5.52. For
      more details, please see Section 6.

WITH WHOM MAY I TALK IF I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE OFFER?

    - You can call D.F. King & Co., Inc., the Information Agent for the Offer,
      at (800) 848-3402. See the back cover of this Offer to Purchase.

through a broker or other nominee, and your broker or nominee tenders your
Shares on your behalf, your broker or nominee may charge you a fee for doing so.
You should consult your broker or nominee to determine whether any charges or
commissions will apply. However, any holder tendering Shares or other payee who

tax withholding of 30% of the gross proceeds payable to such holder or other

    THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF BEI (THE "BEI BOARD") HAS UNANIMOUSLY
(i) DETERMINED THAT THE MERGER AGREEMENT (AS DEFINED HEREIN), AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, INCLUDING EACH OF THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

HOLDERS OF SHARES, (ii) APPROVED, ADOPTED AND DECLARED ADVISABLE THE MERGER
AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, INCLUDING EACH OF THE OFFER
AND THE MERGER, AND (iii) RESOLVED TO RECOMMEND THAT THE HOLDERS OF SHARES
ACCEPT THE OFFER AND TENDER SHARES PURSUANT TO THE OFFER AND, IF APPLICABLE,

    UBS Warburg LLC, financial advisor to BEI in connection with the Offer ("UBS
Warburg"), has delivered to the BEI Board a written opinion dated May 13, 2002,
to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to certain
matters stated in such opinion, the Per Share Common Consideration to be
received by the holders of Common Shares (other than Parent, Purchaser and their
respective affiliates) in the Offer and the Merger was fair, from a financial
point of view, to such holders. A copy of this opinion is contained in BEI's
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, which has been filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") in connection
with the Offer, and which is being mailed to holders of Shares concurrently
herewith. Holders of Shares are encouraged to read such opinion carefully in its
entirety for a description of the assumptions made, matters considered and
limitations on the review undertaken by UBS Warburg.

    THE OFFER IS CONDITIONED UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, (i) THERE HAVING BEEN
VALIDLY TENDERED AND NOT WITHDRAWN PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE OFFER AT LEAST
THE NUMBER OF SHARES THAT, TOGETHER WITH ANY SHARES OWNED BY BSC, IF ANY, SHALL
CONSTITUTE (a) A MAJORITY OF THE THEN OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES (INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL COMMON SHARES ISSUABLE UPON THE CONVERSION OF THE
SERIES A SHARES OR UPON THE CONVERSION OR EXERCISE OF ANY OPTIONS, WARRANTS,
RIGHTS OR OTHER CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES), OR SUCH HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF SUCH CLASS
OF SECURITIES AS MAY BE REQUIRED TO APPROVE THE MERGER PURSUANT TO THE RESTATED
CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF BEI, AS AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME, OR APPLICABLE
LAW, AND (b) A MAJORITY OF THE OUTSTANDING SERIES A SHARES, OR SUCH HIGHER
PERCENTAGE OF SUCH CLASS OF SECURITIES AS MAY BE REQUIRED TO APPROVE THE MERGER
PURSUANT TO THE RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF BEI, AS AMENDED FROM
TIME TO TIME, OR APPLICABLE LAW, (THE "MINIMUM CONDITION"), AND (ii) THE
APPLICABLE WAITING PERIOD, IF ANY, UNDER THE HART-SCOTT-RODINO ANTITRUST
IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 1976, AS AMENDED (THE "HSR ACT"), HAVING EXPIRED OR BEEN
TERMINATED PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE OFFER (THE "HSR CONDITION"). THE OFFER
IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OTHER CONDITIONS DESCRIBED IN THIS OFFER TO PURCHASE.
THE OFFER IS NOT SUBJECT TO A FINANCING CONDITION. SEE SECTIONS 1 AND 14, WHICH
SET FORTH IN FULL THE CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER.

    The Offer is being made pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of May 13, 2002 (the "Merger Agreement"), among Parent, Purchaser and BEI.
The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that as promptly as
practicable after the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer and the
satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of the other conditions set forth in the
Merger Agreement, and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ("Delaware Law"), Purchaser will be
merged with and into BEI (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, BEI will
continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"), and will
become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. At the effective time of the Merger
(the "Effective Time"), each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Shares held in the treasury of BEI and other than
Shares held by holders of Shares who shall have demanded and perfected appraisal
rights under Delaware Law) shall be canceled and converted automatically into
the right to receive $6.8426 per Common Share and $13.6852 per Series A Share,
in cash, or any higher price that may be paid per Share in the Offer, without
interest. Holders of Shares who demand and fully perfect appraisal rights under
Delaware Law will be entitled to receive, in connection with the Merger, cash
for the fair value of their Shares as determined pursuant to the procedures
prescribed by Delaware Law. For more details, please see Section 11. The Merger
Agreement is more fully described in Section 10. Certain federal income tax
consequences of the sale of Shares pursuant to the Offer and the Merger, as the
case may be, are described in Section 5.

    Simultaneously with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Parent and
Purchaser have entered into a Stockholders Agreement, dated as of May 13, 2002
(the "Stockholders Agreement"), with certain stockholders of BEI (collectively,
the "Supporting Stockholders"), pursuant to which the Supporting Stockholders
have, among other things, (i) agreed to tender into the Offer all Shares owned
by them (which equal approximately 24.0% of the outstanding Common Shares
(including Common Shares issuable upon exercise or conversion of options and
warrants held by such Supporting Stockholders) and 98.8% of the outstanding
Series A Shares, or approximately 37.4% of the outstanding voting securities of
BEI), (ii) agreed to vote and take any actions with respect to all such Shares
owned by the Supporting Stockholders, at any meeting of the stockholders of BEI
in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and against any action,
proposal, agreement or transaction that would result in a breach of any
covenant, obligation, agreement, representation or warranty of BEI under the
Merger Agreement or of the Supporting Stockholders under the Stockholders
Agreement, or that could reasonably be expected to result in any of the
conditions to BEI's obligations under the Merger Agreement not being fulfilled,
or that is intended, or could reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere,
delay, discourage or adversely affect the Merger Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger or the Stockholders Agreement, (iii) granted Purchaser an option,
exercisable under certain limited circumstances, to purchase all such Shares
owned by them at the Per Share Common Consideration or

the Per Share Series A Consideration, as the case may be, to be paid in the
Offer, and to purchase all options, warrants and other rights to acquire Shares
at a price equal to the Per Share Common Consideration payable with respect to
all Shares issuable upon exercise of such options, warrants or other securities
minus the aggregate exercise price of such options, warrants or other
securities, and (iv) elected to convert the Series A Shares into Common Shares
upon consummation of the Offer. The Stockholders Agreement is more fully
described in Section 10.

    The consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
certain conditions, including the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition, as a
result of Purchaser's acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Stockholders Agreement, or
a combination of the foregoing and, if necessary, the adoption of the Merger
Agreement by the requisite vote of the stockholders of BEI. For a more detailed
description of the conditions to the Merger, see Section 10. Under BEI's
Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Certificate of Designation and
Delaware Law, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding Common Shares and Series A Shares voting together as a single class
is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. Consequently, if Purchaser acquires
(pursuant to the Offer or the Stockholders Agreement) at least a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of BEI, then Purchaser will have sufficient voting
power to adopt the Merger Agreement without the vote of any other holder of
Shares. For more details, please see Sections 10 and 11.

    Under Delaware Law, if Purchaser acquires, pursuant to the Offer or
otherwise, including pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, at least 90% of the
then outstanding Common Shares and 90% of the then outstanding Series A Shares,
Purchaser will be able to adopt the Merger Agreement without a vote of the
holders of the Common Shares and Series A Shares. In such event, Parent and
Purchaser shall take all necessary action to cause the Merger to become
effective in accordance with Delaware Law as promptly as reasonably practicable
after such acquisition, without a meeting of BEI's stockholders.

    BEI has advised Purchaser that as of May 13, 2002, 14,801,008 Shares were
issued and outstanding on an as-converted, fully diluted basis, composed of
9,857,691 Common Shares, 1,114,485 Series A Shares and 2,714,347 options and
warrants to purchase Common Shares. As a result, as of such date, the Minimum
Condition would be satisfied if Purchaser acquired 4,928,846 Common Shares, and
557,243 Series A Shares, on a fully diluted basis. Pursuant to, and subject to
the terms and conditions of, the Stockholders Agreement, Parent and Purchaser
expect to acquire approximately 2,121,208 outstanding Common Shares and
1,101,152 outstanding Series A Shares (or approximately 4,642,475 Common Shares
on an as-converted, fully diluted basis).

    BEI has issued one preferred share purchase right (a "Right") for each
outstanding Common Share pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated as of June 30,
1997, as amended by the Amendment to Rights Agreement, dated August 30, 2001,
between BEI and Chasemellon Shareholder Services, LLC (the "Rights Agreement").
BEI has represented in the Merger Agreement that it has amended its Rights
Agreement (the "Rights Amendment") to ensure that (a) none of the execution or
delivery of the Merger Agreement or the Stockholders Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions to be effected pursuant to the Merger Agreement
or the Stockholders Agreement will result in (i) the occurrence of the "flip-in
event" described in the Rights Agreement, (ii) the occurrence of the "flip-over
event" described in the Rights Agreement, or (iii) the Rights becoming evidenced
by, and transferable pursuant to, certificates separate from the certificates
representing Shares, and (b) the Rights will expire pursuant to the terms of the
Rights Agreement at the effective time of the Merger.

    No appraisal rights are available in connection with the Offer. However,
holders of Shares may have appraisal rights in connection with the Merger
regardless of whether the Merger is consummated with or without a vote of BEI's
stockholders. For more details, please see Section 11.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY DECISION

tendered (and not withdrawn in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 4) on or prior to the Expiration Date. "Expiration Date" means 12:00
midnight, New York City time, on Wednesday, June 26, 2002, unless and until
Purchaser (subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement) shall
have extended the period during which the Offer is open, in which case
Expiration Date shall mean the latest time and date at which the Offer, as may
be extended by Purchaser, shall expire.

    The Offer is subject to the conditions set forth under Section 14, including
the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the HSR Condition. Subject to the
applicable rules and regulations of the Commission and subject to the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement, Purchaser expressly reserves the right to
waive any such condition in whole or in part, in its sole discretion, PROVIDED,
that the Minimum Condition may only be reduced or waived with the prior written
consent of BEI. Subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the
Commission and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement,
Purchaser also expressly reserves the right to increase the Per Share Common
Consideration or the Per Share Series A Consideration, as the case may be,
payable in the Offer and to make any other changes in the terms and conditions
of the Offer; PROVIDED, however, that the Purchaser may not decrease the Per
Share Common Consideration or the Per Share Series A Consideration payable in
the Offer, reduce the number of Shares to be purchased in the Offer, change the
form of consideration to be paid in the Offer, extend the Offer except as
provided in the Merger Agreement, amend any other term of the Offer in a manner
adverse to the holders of Shares, or impose conditions to the Offer in addition
to those set forth in Section 14.

    The Merger Agreement provides that Purchaser may, without the consent of
BEI, (i) extend the Offer for a period of not more than 30 business days beyond
the scheduled expiration date, which shall be 20 business days following the
commencement of the Offer, if, at the scheduled expiration of the Offer, any of
the conditions to Purchaser's obligation to accept for payment Shares, shall not
be satisfied or waived, or (ii) extend the Offer for any period required by any
rule, regulation or interpretation of the Commission, or the staff thereof,
applicable to the Offer. The Merger Agreement also provides that, if, on the
initial scheduled expiration date of the Offer, the sole condition remaining
unsatisfied is the failure of the waiting period under the HSR Act to have
expired or been terminated, then Purchaser shall extend the Offer from time to
time until the earlier to occur of (a) December 31, 2002, and (b) the fifth
business day after the public announcement of the expiration or termination of
the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act.

    If certain of the conditions to the Offer shall not have been satisfied, and
in Parent and Purchaser's sole judgment are reasonably capable of being
satisfied within 30 days, Parent will, at the request of BEI, extend the Offer
from time to time unless any such condition is no longer reasonably capable of
being satisfied within such 30 day period in Parent and Purchaser's sole
judgment. In no event will Purchaser be required to extend the Offer beyond
December 31, 2002.

    During any such extension, all Shares previously tendered and not withdrawn
will remain subject to the Offer and subject to the right of a tendering holder
of Shares to withdraw such holder's Shares. For more details, please see
Section 4. Under no circumstances will interest be paid on the purchase price
for tendered Shares, whether or not the Offer is extended. Any extension of the
Offer may be effected by Purchaser giving oral or written notice of such
extension to the Depositary.

    Purchaser shall pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
promptly following the acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer.
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence and subject to the applicable
rules of the Commission and the terms and conditions of the Offer and the Merger
Agreement, Purchaser also expressly reserves the right (i) to extend or
terminate the Offer and not to accept for payment or pay for any Shares not
theretofore accepted for payment or paid for, upon the occurrence of any of the
conditions to the Offer specified in Section 14, and (ii) to amend the Offer or
to waive any conditions to the Offer in any respect consistent with the
provisions of the Merger Agreement described above, in each case by giving oral
or written notice of such delay, termination, waiver or amendment to the
Depositary and by making public announcement thereof.

    Any such extension, delay, termination, waiver or amendment will be followed
as promptly as practicable by public announcement thereof, such announcement in
the case of an extension to be made no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time,
on the next business day after the previously scheduled Expiration Date. Subject
to applicable law (including Rules 14d-4(c), 14d-6(d) and 14e-1 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the "Exchange Act"), which require
that material changes be promptly disseminated to holders of Shares in a manner
reasonably designed to inform them of such changes) and without limiting the
manner in which Purchaser may choose to make any public announcement, Purchaser
will have no obligation to publish, advertise or otherwise communicate any such
public announcement other than by issuing a press release to the Dow Jones News
Service or the Public Relations Newswire.

    If Purchaser makes a material change in the terms of the Offer or the
information concerning the Offer, or if it waives a material condition of the
Offer, Purchaser will extend the Offer to the extent required by
Rules 14d-4(c), 14d-6(d) and 14e-1 under the Exchange Act.

    Subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, Purchaser
may, in its sole discretion, elect to extend the Offer beyond the Expiration
Date for a subsequent offering period of between three business days and 20
business days (the "Subsequent Offering Period"), if, among other things, upon
the Expiration Date (i) all of the conditions to Purchaser's obligations to
accept for payment, and to pay for, the Shares are satisfied or waived, and
(ii) Purchaser immediately accepts for payment, and promptly pays for, all
Shares validly tendered (and not withdrawn in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Section 4) prior to the Expiration Date. SHARES TENDERED DURING THE
SUBSEQUENT OFFERING PERIOD MAY NOT BE WITHDRAWN. For more details, please see
Section 4. Purchaser will immediately accept for payment, and promptly pay for,
all validly tendered Shares as they are received during the Subsequent Offering
Period. Any election by Purchaser to include a Subsequent Offering Period may be
effected by Purchaser giving oral or written notice of the Subsequent Offering
Period to the Depositary. If Purchaser decides to include a Subsequent Offering
Period, it will make an announcement to that effect by issuing a press release
to the Dow Jones News Service or the Public Relations Newswire no later than
9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the next business day after the Expiration
Date.

    For purposes of the Offer, a "business day" means any day on which the
principal offices of the Commission in Washington, D.C. are open to accept
filings, or, in the case of determining a date when any payment is due, any day
on which banks are not required or authorized to close in The City of New York,
and consists of the time period from 12:01 a.m. through 12:00 midnight, New York
City time.

    BEI has provided Purchaser with BEI's stockholder list and security position
listings, including the most recent list of names, addresses and security
positions of non-objecting beneficial owners in the possession of BEI, for the
purpose of disseminating the Offer to holders of Shares. This Offer to Purchase
and the related Letter of Transmittal will be mailed by Purchaser to record
holders of Shares whose names appear on BEI's stockholder list and will be
furnished, for subsequent transmittal to beneficial owners of Shares, to
brokers, dealers, commercial banks, trust companies and similar persons

whose names, or the names of whose nominees, appear on the stockholder list or,
if applicable, who are listed as participants in a clearing agency's security
position listing.

SECTION 2.  ACCEPTANCE FOR PAYMENT AND PAYMENT FOR SHARES.

    Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer (including, if the
Offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of any such extension or
amendment), Purchaser will accept promptly for payment all Shares validly
tendered (and not properly withdrawn in accordance with Section 4) prior to the
Expiration Date. Purchaser shall pay for all Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn promptly following the acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to
the Offer. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence and subject to
applicable rules and regulations of the Commission and the terms of the Merger
Agreement, Purchaser expressly reserves the right to delay payment for Shares in
order to comply in whole or in part with applicable laws. For more details,
please see Sections 1 and 15. If Purchaser decides to include a Subsequent
Offering Period, Purchaser will accept for payment, and promptly pay for, all
validly tendered Shares as they are received during the Subsequent Offering
Period. For more details, please see Section 1.

    In all cases (including during any Subsequent Offering Period), payment for
Shares tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer will be made only
after timely receipt by the Depositary of (i) the certificates evidencing such
Shares (the "Share Certificates") or timely confirmation (a "Book-Entry
Confirmation") of a book-entry transfer of Common Shares into the Depositary's
account at The Depository Trust Company (the "Book-Entry Transfer Facility")
pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 3, (ii) the Letter of
Transmittal (or a manually signed facsimile thereof), properly completed and
duly executed, with any required signature guarantees or an Agent's Message (as
defined below), in connection with the book-entry transfer, and (iii) any other
documents required under the Letter of Transmittal. The term "Agent's Message"
means a message, transmitted by the Book-Entry Transfer Facility to, and
received by, the Depositary and forming a part of the Book-Entry Confirmation
which states that the Book-Entry Transfer Facility has received an express
acknowledgment from the participant in the Book-Entry Transfer Facility
tendering the Common Shares that are the subject of such Book-Entry
Confirmation, that such participant has received and agrees to be bound by the
Letter of Transmittal and that Purchaser may enforce such agreement against such
participant.

    For purposes of the Offer (including during any Subsequent Offering Period),
Purchaser will be deemed to have accepted for payment (and thereby purchased)
Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn as, if and when Purchaser
gives oral or written notice to the Depositary of Purchaser's acceptance for
payment of such Shares pursuant to the Offer. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Offer, payment for Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the
Offer will be made by deposit of the purchase price therefor with the
Depositary, which will act as agent for tendering holders of Shares for the
purpose of receiving payments from Purchaser and transmitting such payments to
tendering holders of Shares whose Shares have been accepted for payment. UNDER
NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL INTEREST ON THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR SHARES BE PAID,
REGARDLESS OF ANY DELAY IN MAKING SUCH PAYMENT.

    If any tendered Shares are not accepted for payment for any reason pursuant
to the terms and conditions of the Offer, or if Share Certificates are submitted
evidencing more Shares than are tendered, Share Certificates evidencing
unpurchased Shares will be returned without expense to the tendering stockholder
(or, in the case of Common Shares tendered by book-entry transfer into the
Depositary's account at a Book-Entry Transfer Facility pursuant to the procedure
set forth in Section 3, such Common Shares will be credited to an account
maintained at such Book-Entry Transfer Facility), as promptly as practicable
following the expiration or termination of the Offer.

    Purchaser reserves the right to transfer or assign, in whole or from time to
time in part, to one or more of its affiliates, the right to purchase all or any
portion of the Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, but any such transfer or
assignment will not relieve Purchaser of its obligations under the Offer and
will in no way prejudice the rights of tendering holders of Shares to receive
payment for Shares validly tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the
Offer.

SECTION 3.  PROCEDURES FOR ACCEPTING THE OFFER AND TENDERING SHARES.

    VALID TENDER OF SECURITIES.  In order for a holder of Shares to tender
Shares validly pursuant to the Offer, the Letter of Transmittal (or a manually
signed facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed, together with
any required signature guarantees or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an
Agent's Message, and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal,
must be received by the Depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the back
cover of this Offer to Purchase and either (i) the Share Certificates evidencing
tendered Shares must be received by the Depositary at such address or such
Shares must be tendered pursuant to the procedure for book-entry transfer
described below and a Book-Entry Confirmation must be received by the Depositary
(including an Agent's Message if the tendering stockholder has not delivered a
Letter of Transmittal), in each case prior to the Expiration Date, or (ii) the
tendering stockholder must comply with the guaranteed delivery procedures
described below.

    The method of delivery of Share Certificates and all other required
documents, including delivery through the book-entry transfer facility, is at
the option and risk of the tendering stockholder, and the delivery will be
deemed made only when actually received by the Depositary. If delivery is by
mail, registered mail with return receipt requested, properly insured, is
recommended. In all cases, sufficient time should be allowed to ensure timely
delivery.

    BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER.  The Depositary will establish accounts with respect to
the Common Shares at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility for purposes of the Offer
within two business days after the date of this Offer to Purchase. Any financial
institution that is a participant in the system of the Book-Entry Transfer
Facility may make a book-entry delivery of Common Shares by causing the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility to transfer such Common Shares into the
Depositary's account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility in accordance with the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility's procedures for such transfer. However, although
delivery of Common Shares may be effected through book-entry transfer at the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility, the Letter of Transmittal (or a manually signed
facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed, together with any
required signature guarantees, or an Agent's Message, and any other required
documents, must, in any case, be received by the Depositary at one of its
addresses set forth on the back cover of this Offer to Purchase prior to the
Expiration Date, or the tendering stockholder must comply with the guaranteed
delivery procedure described below. Delivery of documents to the Book-Entry
Transfer Facility does not constitute delivery to the depositary.

    SIGNATURE GUARANTEES.  Signatures on all Letters of Transmittal must be
guaranteed by a firm which is a member of the Security Transfer Agent Medallion
Signature Program, or by any other "eligible guarantor institution," as such
term is defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act (each of the foregoing
being referred to as an "Eligible Institution"), except in cases where Shares
are tendered (i) by a registered holder of Shares who has not completed either
the box entitled "Special Payment Instructions" or the box entitled "Special
Delivery Instructions" on the Letter of Transmittal, or (ii) for the account of
an Eligible Institution. If a Share Certificate is registered in the name of a
person other than the signer of the Letter of Transmittal, or if payment is to
be made, or a Share Certificate not accepted for payment or not tendered is to
be returned, to a person other than the registered holder(s), then the Share
Certificate must be endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in
either case signed exactly as the name(s) of the registered holder(s) appear on
the Share Certificate, with the signature(s) on such Share Certificate or stock
powers guaranteed by an Eligible Institution. See Instructions 1 and 5 of the
Letter of Transmittal.

    GUARANTEED DELIVERY.  If a stockholder desires to tender Shares pursuant to
the Offer and such stockholder's Share Certificates evidencing such Shares are
not immediately available or such stockholder cannot deliver the Share
Certificates and all other required documents to the Depositary prior to the
Expiration Date, or such holder of Common Shares cannot complete the procedure
for delivery by book-entry transfer on a timely basis, such Shares may
nevertheless be tendered, PROVIDED that all the following conditions are
satisfied:

    - such tender is made by or through an Eligible Institution;

    - a properly completed and duly executed Notice of Guaranteed Delivery,
      substantially in the form made available by Purchaser, is received prior
      to the Expiration Date by the Depositary as provided below; and

    - the Share Certificates (or a Book-Entry Confirmation) evidencing all
      tendered Shares, in proper form for transfer, in each case together with
      the Letter of Transmittal (or a manually signed facsimile thereof),
      properly completed and duly executed, with any required signature
      guarantees or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an Agent's Message,
      and any other documents required by the Letter of Transmittal are received
      by the Depositary within three Nasdaq National Market ("Nasdaq") trading
      days after the date of execution of such Notice of Guaranteed Delivery.

    The Notice of Guaranteed Delivery may be delivered by hand or mail or by
facsimile transmission to the Depositary and must include a guarantee by an
Eligible Institution in the form set forth in the form of Notice of Guaranteed
Delivery made available by Purchaser. The procedures for guaranteed delivery
specified above may not be used during any Subsequent Offering Period. In all
cases (including during any Subsequent Offering Period), payment for Shares
tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer will be made only after
timely receipt by the Depositary of (i) the Share Certificates evidencing such
Shares, or a Book-Entry Confirmation of the delivery of Common Shares, and
(ii) the Letter of Transmittal (or a manually signed facsimile thereof),
properly completed and duly executed, with any required signature guarantees or,
in the case of a book-entry transfer, an Agent's Message, and any other
documents required by the Letter of Transmittal.

    DETERMINATION OF VALIDITY.  All questions as to the form of documents and
the validity, form, eligibility (including time of receipt) and acceptance for
payment of any tender of Shares will be determined by Purchaser, in its sole
discretion, which determination shall be final and binding on all parties.
Purchaser reserves the absolute right to reject any and all tenders determined
by it not to be in proper form or the acceptance for payment of which may, in
the opinion of its counsel, be unlawful. Purchaser also reserves the absolute
right to waive any condition of the Offer to the extent permitted by applicable
law and the Merger Agreement or any defect or irregularity in the tender of any
Shares of any particular stockholder, whether or not similar defects or
irregularities are waived in the case of other holders of Shares. No tender of
Shares will be deemed to have been validly made until all defects and
irregularities have been cured or waived. None of Purchaser, Parent or any of
their respective affiliates or assigns, the Depositary, the Information Agent or
any other person will be under any duty to give notification of any defects or
irregularities in tenders or incur any liability for failure to give any such
notification. Purchaser's interpretation of the terms and conditions of the
Offer (including the Letter of Transmittal and the instructions thereto) will be
final and binding.

    A tender of Shares pursuant to any of the procedures described above will
constitute the tendering stockholder's acceptance of the terms and conditions of
the Offer, as well as the tendering stockholder's representation and warranty to
Purchaser that (i) such stockholder has the full power and authority to tender,
sell, assign and transfer the tendered Shares (and any and all other Shares or
other securities issued or issuable in respect of such Shares), and (ii) when
the same are accepted for payment by Purchaser, Purchaser will acquire good and
unencumbered title thereto, free and clear of all liens, restrictions, charges
and encumbrances and not subject to any adverse claims.

    The acceptance for payment by Purchaser of Shares pursuant to any of the
procedures described above will constitute a binding agreement between the
tendering stockholder and Purchaser upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of the Offer.

    APPOINTMENT AS PROXY.  By executing the Letter of Transmittal as set forth
above, a tendering stockholder irrevocably appoints designees of Purchaser as
such stockholder's agents, attorneys-in-fact and proxies, each with full power
of substitution, in the manner set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, to the
full extent of such stockholder's rights with respect to the Shares tendered by
such stockholder and accepted for payment by Purchaser (and with respect to any
and all other Shares or other securities issued or issuable in respect of such
Shares on or after May 13, 2002). All such powers of attorney and proxies shall
be considered irrevocable and coupled with an interest in the tendered Shares.
Such appointment will be effective when, and only to the extent that, Purchaser
accepts such Shares for payment. Upon such acceptance for payment, all prior
powers of attorney and proxies given by such stockholder with respect to such
Shares (and such other Shares and securities) will be revoked, without further
action, and no subsequent powers of attorney or proxies may be given nor any
subsequent written consent executed by such stockholder (and, if given or
executed, will not be deemed to be effective) with respect thereto. The
designees of Purchaser will, with respect to the Shares for which the
appointment is effective, be empowered to exercise all voting and other rights
of such stockholder as they in their sole discretion may deem proper at any
annual or special meeting of BEI's stockholders or any adjournment or
postponement thereof, by written consent in lieu of any such meeting or
otherwise. Purchaser reserves the right to require that, in order for Shares to
be deemed validly tendered, immediately upon Purchaser's payment for such
Shares, Purchaser must be able to exercise full voting rights with respect to
such Shares (and such other Shares and securities).

    Under the "backup withholding" provisions of U.S. federal income tax law,
the Depositary may be required to withhold 30% of any payments of cash pursuant
to the offer. To prevent backup federal income tax withholding with respect to
payment to holders of Shares of the purchase price of Shares purchased pursuant
to the offer, each such stockholder must provide the Depositary with such
stockholder's correct taxpayer identification number and certify that such
holder of shares is not subject to backup federal income tax withholding by
completing the substitute form W-9 in the Letter of Transmittal. See instruction
1 and 5 of the Letter of Transmittal.

SECTION 4.  WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS.

    Tenders of Shares made pursuant to the Offer are irrevocable except that
such Shares may be withdrawn at any time prior to the Expiration Date and,
unless theretofore accepted for payment and paid for by Purchaser pursuant to
the Offer, may also be withdrawn at any time after July 28, 2002. If Purchaser
extends the Offer, is delayed in its acceptance for payment of Shares, or is
unable to accept Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer for any reason, then,
without prejudice to Purchaser's rights under the Offer, the Depositary may,
nevertheless, on behalf of Purchaser, retain tendered Shares, and such Shares
may not be withdrawn except to the extent that tendering holders of Shares are
entitled to withdrawal rights as described in this Section 4, subject to
Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act. Any such delay will be by an extension of
the Offer to the extent required by law. If Purchaser decides to include a
Subsequent Offering Period, Shares tendered during the Subsequent Offering
Period may not be withdrawn. For more details, please see Section 1.

    For a withdrawal to be effective, a written or facsimile transmission notice
of withdrawal must be timely received by the Depositary at one of its addresses
set forth on the back cover page of this Offer to Purchase. Any such notice of
withdrawal must specify the name of the person who tendered the Shares to be
withdrawn, the number of Shares to be withdrawn and the name of the registered
holder of such Shares, if different from that of the person who tendered such
Shares. If Share Certificates evidencing Shares to be withdrawn have been
delivered or otherwise identified to the Depositary, then, prior to the physical
release of such Share Certificates, the serial numbers shown on such Share

Certificates must be submitted to the Depositary and the signature(s) on the
notice of withdrawal must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution, unless such
Shares have been tendered for the account of an Eligible Institution. If Common
Shares have been tendered pursuant to the procedure for book-entry transfer as
set forth in Section 3, any notice of withdrawal must specify the name and
number of the account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility to be credited with
the withdrawn Common Shares.

    All questions as to the form and validity (including time of receipt) of any
notice of withdrawal will be determined by Purchaser, in its sole discretion,
whose determination will be final and binding. None of Purchaser, Parent or any
of their respective affiliates or assigns, the Depositary, the Information Agent
or any other person will be under any duty to give any notification of any
defects or irregularities in any notice of withdrawal or incur any liability for
failure to give any such notification.

    Withdrawals of Shares may not be rescinded. Any Shares properly withdrawn
will thereafter be deemed not to have been validly tendered for purposes of the
Offer. However, withdrawn Shares may be re-tendered at any time prior to the
Expiration Date (or during the Subsequent Offering Period, if any) by following
one of the procedures described in Section 3 (except Shares may not be
re-tendered using the procedures for guaranteed delivery during any Subsequent
Offering Period).

SECTION 5.  CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES.

    The following is a summary of the principal federal income tax consequences
of the Offer and the Merger to holders whose Shares are purchased pursuant to
the Offer or whose Shares are converted into the right to receive cash in the
Merger (whether upon receipt of the Merger Consideration or pursuant to the
proper exercise of dissenter's rights). The discussion is based on current law,
which is subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. This
summary does not address the tax consequences of the Offer and the Merger to
special classes of holders, such as financial institutions, tax-exempt
organizations, insurance companies, dealers in securities, traders who mark to
market, non-U.S. persons, persons who acquired the Shares pursuant to the
exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation, persons who
hold the Shares as part of a straddle, hedge, or conversion transaction, persons
whose functional currency is other than the United States dollar, and persons
not holding the Shares as a capital asset. This discussion also does not address
any non-income tax consequences, any federal alternative minimum tax
consequences, or any state, local, on non-U.S. tax consequences of the Offer and
the Merger.

    THE TAX DISCUSSION SET FORTH BELOW IS INCLUDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION
PURPOSES ONLY AND IS BASED UPON CURRENT LAW. BECAUSE INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES
MAY DIFFER, EACH HOLDER OF SHARES SHOULD CONSULT SUCH HOLDER'S OWN TAX ADVISOR
TO DETERMINE THE APPLICABILITY TO SUCH STOCKHOLDER OF THE RULES DISCUSSED AND
THE PARTICULAR TAX EFFECTS OF THE OFFER AND THE MERGER ON SUCH STOCKHOLDER,
INCLUDING THE APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. TAX
LAWS.

    The receipt of cash pursuant to the Offer and the receipt of cash pursuant
to the Merger (whether as Merger Consideration or pursuant to the proper
exercise of dissenter's rights) will be a taxable transaction for federal income
tax purposes (and also may be a taxable transaction under applicable state,
local and non-U.S. income tax laws). In general, for federal income tax
purposes, a holder of Shares will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference
between such holder's adjusted tax basis in the Shares sold pursuant to the
Offer or converted to cash in the Merger and the amount of cash received
therefor. Gain or loss must be determined separately for each block of Shares
(i.e., Shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) sold pursuant
to the Offer or converted to cash in the Merger. Such gain or loss will be
capital gain or loss. Non-corporate holders (including individuals) will be
subject to tax on the net amount of such gain at a maximum rate of 20% if the
Shares were held for more than one year. Special rules (and generally lower
maximum rates) apply to non-corporate taxpayers in lower tax brackets. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to certain limitations. Holders of
Shares should consult their own tax advisors in this regard.

    Payments in connection with the Offer or the Merger may be subject to backup
withholding at a 30% rate. Backup withholding generally applies if a stockholder
(i) fails to furnish such stockholder's social security number or taxpayer
identification number ("TIN"), (ii) furnishes an incorrect TIN, (iii) fails
properly to report interest or dividends, or (iv) under certain circumstances,
fails to provide a certified statement, signed under penalties of perjury, that
the TIN provided is such stockholder's correct number and that such stockholder
is not subject to backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional
tax but merely an advance payment, which may be refunded to the extent it
results in an overpayment of tax upon the stockholder's filing of a claim for
refund with the Internal Revenue Service within the time period appropriate to
such claims. Certain persons, including corporations and financial institutions
generally, are exempt from backup withholding. Certain penalties apply for
failure to furnish correct information and for failure to include the reportable
payments in income. Each stockholder should consult with such stockholder's own
tax advisor as to such stockholder's qualifications for exemption from backup
withholding and the procedure for obtaining such exemption.

    Except as otherwise set forth in this Offer to Purchase, all of the
information concerning BEI contained in this Offer to Purchase has been

SECTION 8.  CERTAIN INFORMATION CONCERNING PURCHASER AND PARENT.

    GENERAL.  Purchaser is a newly incorporated Delaware corporation organized
in connection with the Offer and the Merger and has not carried on any
activities other than in connection with the Offer and the Merger. The principal
offices of Purchaser are located at One Boston Scientific Place, Natick,
Massachusetts 01760-1537 and its telephone number at such address is
(508) 650-8000. Purchaser is a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

    Until immediately prior to the time that Purchaser will purchase Shares
pursuant to the Offer, it is not anticipated that Purchaser will have any
significant assets or liabilities or engage in activities other than those
incident to its formation and capitalization and the transactions contemplated
by the Offer and the Merger. Because Purchaser is newly formed and has minimal
assets and capitalization, no meaningful financial information regarding
Purchaser is available.

    PARENT IS A DELAWARE CORPORATION.  Its principal offices are located at One
Boston Scientific Place, Natick, Massachusetts 01760-1537 and its telephone
number at such address is (508) 650-8000. Parent is a worldwide developer,
manufacturer and marketer of less-invasive medical devices. Parent's products
are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties, including
interventional cardiology,

electrophysiology, gastroenterology, neurovascular intervention, pulmonary
medicine, interventional radiology, oncology, urology and vascular surgery. The
products are generally inserted into the human body through natural openings or
small incisions in the skin and can be guided to most areas of the anatomy to
diagnose and treat a wide range of medical problems. These products provide
effective alternatives to traditional surgery by reducing risk, trauma, cost,
procedure time and the need for aftercare.

    The name, citizenship, business address, business telephone number,
principal occupation or employment, and five-year employment history for each of
the directors and executive officers of Purchaser and Parent and certain other
information are set forth in Schedule I hereto. Except as described in this
Offer to Purchase and in Schedule I hereto, none of Parent, Purchaser or, to the
best knowledge of such corporations, any of the persons listed on Schedule I to
the Offer of Purchase has during the last five years (i) been convicted in a
criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors), or
(ii) been a party to any judicial or administrative proceeding (except for
matters that were dismissed without sanction or settlement) that resulted in a
judgment, decree or final order enjoining the person from future violations of,
or prohibiting activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or
finding any violation of such laws.

    NEITHER PARENT NOR PURCHASER OWNS ANY SHARES.  Except as described in this
Offer to Purchase (i) none of Purchaser, Parent nor, to the best knowledge of
Purchaser and Parent, any of the persons listed in Schedule I to this Offer to
Purchase or any associate or majority owned subsidiary of Purchaser, Parent or
any of the persons so listed, beneficially owns or has any right to acquire any
Shares, and (ii) none of Purchaser, Parent nor, to the best knowledge of
Purchaser and Parent, any of the persons or entities referred to above nor any
director, executive officer or subsidiary of any of the foregoing has effected
any transaction in the Shares during the past 60 days.

    Except as provided in the Merger Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement
and as otherwise described in this Offer to Purchase, none of Purchaser, Parent
nor, to the best knowledge of Purchaser and Parent, any of the persons listed in
Schedule I to this Offer to Purchase, has any agreement, arrangement or
understanding, whether or not legally enforceable, with any other person with
respect to any securities of BEI, including, but not limited to, the transfer or
voting of such securities, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or
calls, guaranties of loans, guaranties against loss or the giving or withholding
of proxies, consents or authorizations. Except as set forth in this Offer to
Purchase, neither Purchaser nor Parent nor, to the best knowledge of Purchaser
and Parent, any of the persons listed on Schedule I hereto, has had any
transaction with BEI or any of its executive officers, directors or affiliates
that is required to be reported under the rules and regulations of the
Commission applicable to the Offer. Except as set forth in this Offer to
Purchase, there have been no negotiations, transactions or material contacts
between any of Purchaser, Parent, or any of their respective subsidiaries or, to
the best knowledge of Purchaser and Parent, any of the persons listed in
Schedule I to this Offer to Purchase, on the one hand, and BEI or its
affiliates, on the other hand, concerning a merger, consolidation or
acquisition, tender offer for or other acquisition of any class of BEI's
securities, an election of BEI's directors or a sale or other transfer of a
material amount of assets of BEI.

SECTION 9.  FINANCING OF THE OFFER AND THE MERGER.

    THE OFFER IS NOT CONDITIONED UPON ANY FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS.  The total
amount of funds required by Purchaser to consummate the Offer and the Merger and
to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the
Stock Purchase Agreement, and to pay related fees and expenses is estimated to
be approximately $98.0 million. Purchaser will obtain all of such funds from
Parent. Parent will provide such funds from existing resources or borrowing
availability.

SECTION 10.  BACKGROUND OF THE OFFER; CONTACTS WITH BEI; THE MERGER AGREEMENT
AND RELATED AGREEMENTS.

    On an ongoing basis, management of Boston Scientific Corporation identifies
candidates for acquisitions, business combinations or strategic alliances in
order to further its strategic plan and strengthen its existing core businesses.

    As part of this process, on May 1, 2001, Eric Goorno and David Robertson of
Parent initially met with Samuel Dickstein, Vice President, New Business
Development and Technology of BEI and other representatives of BEI to discuss a
potential relationship between Parent and BEI. A couple of days later, BEI's
representative contacted Mr. Goorno to arrange a meeting between representatives
of BEI and Parent. On May 30, 2001, Mr. Goorno, John Pedersen,
President--Microvasive Urology of Parent, Frank Grillo, Vice President
Marketing--Microvasive Urology and Michael Madden, Vice President--Research and
Development--Microvasive Urology, of Parent met with Richard Turner, President
and Chief Executive Officer of BEI, Mr. Dickstein and other representatives of
BEI at Parent's Headquarters in Natick, Massachusetts.

    From May, 2001 to October, 2001, Lawrence C. Best, Senior Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer of Parent, Mr. Pedersen and Mr. Grillo conducted
numerous discussions with representatives and officers of BEI regarding a range
of possible transactions, including a potential exclusive distribution
relationship relating to BEI's products, and representatives of Parent witnessed
the use of BEI's product in a limited number of cases. In October 2001 these
discussions were discontinued as a result of the parties' inability to agree on
the terms of a transaction.

    Notwithstanding the discontinuation of formal discussions in October, 2001,
the parties sporadically remained in contact through informal telephone
conversations until the middle of February, 2002, when, at the direction of BEI,
UBS Warburg LLC, BEI's financial advisor, contacted Mr. Best with respect to a
possible business combination with BEI. On February 22, 2002, Parent sent a
letter to BEI expressing an interest in a strategic relationship whereby Parent
and BEI would enter into a distribution agreement for a period of one year.

    In early March 2002, representatives of Parent were informed that BEI would
not be interested in pursuing a relationship with Parent on the terms previously
discussed, and BEI and Parent commenced discussions with respect to a possible
business combination between the two companies.

    From March 4, 2002 to March 10, 2002, representatives of BEI and Parent
continued discussions regarding a possible business combination transaction. On
March 11, 2002, BEI and Parent entered into a letter agreement whereby each
agreed to exchange confidential information regarding their respective
businesses.

    On March 13, 2002, Parent was provided with materials in connection with
their respective business and legal due diligence review of BEI.

    On April 9, 2002, Parent submitted to BEI a non-binding expression of
interest to purchase all of the outstanding equity of BEI for $90.0 million plus
any outstanding cash on hand at the closing of such transaction.

    On April 15, 2002, Parent and their counsel, Bingham Dana LLP, were provided
with additional due diligence materials on BEI.

    On April 23, 2002, several representatives of Parent visited BEI's offices
in Teterboro, New Jersey in connection with Parent's due diligence review of
BEI.

    On April 29, 2002, Parent delivered a draft of the Agreement and Plan of
Merger to BEI.

    On April 30, 2002, and continuing through May 2, 2002, several
representatives of Parent visited the facilities of certain of BEI's suppliers
in connection with Parent's due diligence review of BEI.

    On May 1, 2002, and again on May 3, 2002, representatives of Parent and
their counsel held a conference call with BEI's legal advisors, Cooley
Godward LLP, and UBS Warburg to discuss the terms of the Agreement and Plan of
Merger.

    From May 3, 2002 to May 12, 2002, representatives of BEI and Parent,
including their respective legal and financial advisors, continued to negotiate
the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger.

    On May 6, 2002, certain representatives of Parent presented the terms of the
proposed acquisition of BEI to the Strategic Investment Committee, a
sub-committee of the Board of Directors of Parent authorized to review and
approve certain transactions. Following the presentation and a full discussion
of the matters to be considered the Strategic Investment Committee unanimously
approved the transaction and the Merger Agreement, and authorized the officers
of Parent to negotiate any final changes necessary to the Merger Agreement and
related ancillary documents on behalf of Parent.

    On May 8, 2002, senior members of the Microvasive Urology division made a
presentation of the strategic rationale of the transaction to senior executives
of Parent.

    On May 13, 2002, the BEI Board held a special telephonic meeting to discuss
the status of final negotiations with Parent. At this meeting, representatives
of Cooley Godward LLP updated the BEI Board on the changes negotiated to the
draft Agreement and Plan of Merger since the last special meeting of the BEI
Board. Representatives of Cooley Godward LLP reviewed the main legal principles
applicable to the proposed transaction (including the Board's fiduciary duties
and authority in considering the transaction) and responded to questions from
the BEI Board. The BEI Board reviewed and discussed the principal terms of the
proposed transaction, including the tender offer per share price, closing
conditions, termination rights, the termination fee, the Stockholders Agreements
and BEI's ability to consider alternative proposals. Also at such meeting, UBS
Warburg rendered to the BEI Board an oral opinion (which opinion was confirmed
by delivery of a written opinion dated May 13, 2002) to the effect that, as of
the date of the opinion and based upon and subject to certain matters stated in
such opinion, the $6.8426 per share cash consideration to be received in the
Offer and the Merger by holders of Common Shares (other than Parent, Purchaser
and their respective affiliates) was fair, from a financial point of view, to
such holders. After a full discussion of the matters considered by the BEI Board
at such meeting, the BEI Board unanimously approved the proposed transaction and
the Merger Agreement, authorized the officers of BEI to negotiate any final
changes necessary to the Merger Agreement and related ancillary documents on
behalf of BEI and determined to recommend to BEI's stockholders that they accept
the Offer, tender their shares in the Offer and, if required under the DGCL or
BEI's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, vote to adopt the Merger
Agreement.

    On the evening of May 13, 2002, BEI, Parent and Purchaser executed the
Merger Agreement. Contemporaneously with the execution of the Merger Agreement,
Parent, Purchaser and certain directors and stockholders executed the
Stockholders Agreement, pursuant to which such directors and stockholders
agreed, among other things, to tender their Shares in the Offer and to vote
their Shares in favor of the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement. BEI
and Parent issued a joint press release announcing the transaction before the
opening of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on May 14, 2002. Parent
conducted a publicly-announced conference call with analysts on May 14, 2002, to
discuss the transaction.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

    The following is a summary of certain provisions of the Merger Agreement.
This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement,
which is incorporated herein by reference, and a copy of which has been filed as
an exhibit to the Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (the "Schedule TO")
filed by Purchaser and Parent with the Commission in connection with the Offer.
The Merger Agreement may be examined and copies may be obtained at the places
set forth in

Section 7. Defined terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the
respective meanings assigned to those terms in the Merger Agreement.

    THE OFFER.  The Merger Agreement provides for the commencement of the Offer
as promptly as reasonably practicable, but, subject to certain exceptions, in no
event later than seven business days after the initial public announcement of
Purchaser's intention to commence the Offer. The obligation of Purchaser to
accept for payment Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer is subject to the
satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the HSR Condition and certain other
conditions that are described in Section 14 hereof. Purchaser and Parent have
agreed that no change in the Offer may be made which decreases the Per Share
Common Consideration or the Per Share Series A Consideration, which reduces the
maximum number of Shares to be purchased in the Offer, changes the form of
consideration to be paid in the Offer, amends any other terms of the Offer in a
manner adverse to the holders of Shares, or which imposes conditions to the
Offer in addition to those set forth in Section 14 hereof.

    THE MERGER.  The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions thereof, and in accordance with Delaware Law, as of the
Effective Time, Purchaser shall be merged with and into BEI. As a result of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Purchaser will cease and BEI will
continue as the Surviving Corporation and will become a wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent. Upon consummation of the Merger, each issued and then outstanding
Share (other than any Shares held in the treasury of BEI, or owned by Purchaser,
Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or of BEI and
any Shares which are held by holders of Shares who have not voted in favor of
the Merger and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such
Shares in accordance with Delaware Law (the "Dissenting Shares")) shall be
canceled and converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable, without interest, to the holder of such Shares.

    The Merger Agreement provides that the directors of Purchaser immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation and that the officers of Purchaser immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation.
Subject to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Certificate of
Incorporation of Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, will be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.
Subject to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, the By-laws of
Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be the
By-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

    STOCKHOLDER'S MEETING.  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, BEI shall, if
required by applicable law in order to consummate the Merger, as determined by
Parent, (i) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold an annual or special
meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable following the purchase by
Purchaser of Shares pursuant to the Offer, or, if the Offer shall have been
terminated, consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Stockholders
Agreement that would result in Parent or Purchaser acquiring a majority of the
voting securities of BEI on a fully diluted basis, for the purpose of
considering and taking action on the Merger Agreement (the "Stockholder's
Meeting"), and (ii) (A) subject to the exceptions provided in the Merger
Agreement, include in the Proxy Statement, and not subsequently withdraw, amend,
change or modify in any manner adverse to Purchaser or Parent, the
recommendation of the Board that the stockholders of BEI adopt the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and (B) use its best
efforts to obtain such adoption. If Purchaser acquires at least a majority
(after giving effect to the assumed purchase of Shares pursuant to the
Stockholders Agreement as though such purchase had already occurred) of the
outstanding Shares on an "as-converted" basis, and the Series A Shares,
Purchaser will have sufficient voting power to approve the Merger, even if no
other stockholder votes in favor of the Merger.

    PROXY STATEMENT.  The Merger Agreement provides that BEI shall, if approval
of BEI's stockholders is required by applicable law to consummate the Merger,
promptly following the purchase

by Purchaser of Shares pursuant to the Offer, file with the Commission under the
Exchange Act, and use its best efforts to have cleared by the Commission
promptly, a proxy statement and related proxy materials (the "Proxy Statement"),
with respect to the Stockholders' Meeting and shall cause the Proxy Statement
and all required amendments and supplements thereto to be mailed to stockholders
of BEI at the earliest practicable time. The Company has agreed, subject to
certain exceptions provided in the Merger Agreement, to include in the Proxy
Statement, and not subsequently withdraw, amend, change or modify in any manner
adverse to Purchaser or Parent, the recommendation of the Board that the
stockholders of BEI adopt the Merger Agreement. Parent and Purchaser have agreed
to cause all Shares then owned by them and their subsidiaries to be voted in
favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides that,
in the event that Purchaser shall acquire at least 90% of each of the then
outstanding Common Shares and Series A Shares, Purchaser and Parent will take
all necessary actions to cause the Merger to become effective, in accordance
with Delaware Law, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Offer,
without a meeting of BEI's stockholders.

    CONDUCT OF BUSINESS BY BEI PENDING THE MERGER.  Pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, BEI has agreed that, between the date of the Merger Agreement and the
Effective Time, unless Parent shall otherwise agree in writing (or except as
expressly contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the schedules thereto), the
businesses of BEI and its subsidiaries (the "Subsidiaries" and, individually, a
"Subsidiary") shall be conducted only in, and BEI and the Subsidiaries shall not
take any action except in, the ordinary course of business and in a manner
consistent with past practice; and BEI shall use its commercially reasonable
best efforts to preserve substantially intact the business organization of BEI
and the Subsidiaries, to keep available the services of the current officers,
employees and consultants of BEI and the Subsidiaries and to preserve the
current relationships of BEI and the Subsidiaries with customers, suppliers and
other persons with which BEI or any Subsidiary has significant business
relations. The Merger Agreement provides that, by way of amplification and not
limitation, except as contemplated therein, neither BEI nor any Subsidiary
shall, between the date of the Merger Agreement and the Effective Time, directly
or indirectly, do, or propose to do, any of the following, without the prior
written consent of Parent:

        (a) amend or otherwise change its Restated Certificate of Incorporation
    or By-laws or equivalent organizational documents;

        (b) issue, sell, pledge, dispose of, grant, encumber, or authorize the
    issuance, sale, pledge, disposition, grant or encumbrance of (i) any shares

    warrants, convertible securities or other rights of any kind to acquire any
    shares of such capital stock, or any other ownership interest (including,
    without limitation, any phantom interest), of BEI or any Subsidiary (except
    for the securities issuable pursuant to outstanding Company options and
    warrants), or (ii) any assets of BEI or any Subsidiary, except, with respect
    to assets, in the ordinary course of business and in a manner consistent
    with past practice;

        (c) declare, set aside, make or pay any dividend or other distribution,
    payable in cash, stock, property or otherwise, with respect to any of its
    capital stock, except for dividends by any direct or indirect wholly owned
    Subsidiary to BEI or any other Subsidiary;

        (d) reclassify, combine, split, subdivide or redeem, or purchase or
    otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any of its capital stock;

    combination) any corporation, partnership, other business organization or

    expenditure in any manner not reflected in the capital budget of BEI, or
    (vi) enter into or amend any contract, agreement, commitment or binding

    the Merger Agreement;

        (f) take any action that would have the effect, directly or indirectly,
    of paying or discharging any Company Expenses (as defined in the Merger
    Agreement), for an amount in excess of $2,340,000 in the aggregate;

        (g) except as specifically contemplated or provided for in the Merger
    Agreement, increase the compensation payable or to become payable or the
    benefits provided to its directors, officers or employees, except for

    practice;

        (l) commence or settle any litigation, suit, claim, action, proceeding
    or investigation;

        (m) fail to pay, discharge or satisfy any claim, liability or obligation

    or otherwise make a commitment, to do anything set forth in paragraphs
    (a) through (m) above.

    BEI BOARD REPRESENTATION.  The Merger Agreement provides that, promptly upon
the purchase by Purchaser of Shares pursuant to the Offer, and from time to time
thereafter, Purchaser shall be entitled to designate up to such number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the BEI Board as shall give
Purchaser representation on the BEI Board equal to the product of the total
number of directors on the BEI Board (giving effect to the directors elected
pursuant to this sentence), multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate
number of Shares beneficially owned by Purchaser or any affiliate of Purchaser
following such purchase bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding on
a fully-diluted "as-converted" basis, and BEI shall, at such time, promptly take
all actions necessary to cause Purchaser's designees to be elected as directors
of BEI, including increasing the size of the BEI Board or securing the
resignations of incumbent directors (the moment of such election being the
"Appointment Time"). The Merger Agreement also provides that BEI shall use its
best efforts to cause

persons designated by Purchaser to constitute the same percentage as persons
designated by Purchaser shall constitute of the BEI Board of (a) each committee
of the BEI Board, (b) each board of directors of each Subsidiary, and (c) each
committee of each such board, in each case only to the extent permitted by
applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the Effective Time, such
BEI Board shall have at least two directors who are directors of BEI on the date
of the Merger Agreement or such nominees of such directors and who are not
officers or employees of BEI (the "Continuing Directors").

    The Merger Agreement provides that, following the election or appointment of
Purchaser's designees in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph and
prior to the Effective Time, the affirmative vote of at least one Continuing
Director shall be required for BEI to (a) amend or terminate the Merger
Agreement or agree or consent to any amendment or termination of the Merger
Agreement, (b) amend the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of BEI
in a manner that is reasonably likely to adversely affect the interests of the
holders of the Shares (other than Parent or its affiliates), (c) waive any of
BEI's rights, benefits or remedies under the Merger Agreement, (d) extend the
time for performance of Parent's and Purchaser's respective obligations under
the Merger Agreement, or (e) approve any other action by BEI which is reasonably
likely to adversely affect the interests of the holders of the Shares (other
than Parent or its affiliates).

    NO SOLICITATION OF TRANSACTIONS.  Neither BEI nor any Subsidiary shall,
directly or indirectly, through any officer, director, employee, representative,
agent or otherwise (collectively, the "Representatives"), (a) solicit, initiate
or take any action intended to encourage the submission of any Acquisition
Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement), or (b) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person, any information
with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with respect to, or assist or
participate in, or take any action intended to facilitate or encourage, any
proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal. BEI shall, and shall direct or cause its Representatives
to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations
with any parties that may be ongoing with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

    Notwithstanding the above, BEI may negotiate or otherwise engage in
substantive discussions with, and furnish nonpublic information to, any person
in response to an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal by such person if (i) BEI has
complied with the terms of Section 7.05 of the Merger Agreement, (ii) a majority
of the BEI Board determines in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal (as defined in the
Merger Agreement) and, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action could reasonably be deemed to constitute a breach of
its fiduciary duties under applicable law, (iii) such person executes, prior to
receipt of any of such information, a confidentiality agreement on terms no less
favorable to BEI than those contained in the confidentiality agreement entered
into between BEI and Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), (iv) BEI provides
reasonable notice to Parent that it is furnishing information to, or entering
into discussions or negotiations with, such person and provides in any such
notice to Parent in reasonable detail the identity of the person making such
Acquisition Proposal and the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal,
and (v) BEI promptly furnishes to Parent copies of any nonpublic information
provided to such person that has not previously been furnished to Parent.

    Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, and the other terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement, at any time on or after May 13, 2002, and
prior to the Appointment Time, BEI may, upon delivery of written notice to
Purchaser, solicit, initiate, or participate in discussions or negotiations
regarding an equity financing by BEI representing not more than 40% of the
equity securities of BEI.

    BEI has also agreed that neither the BEI Board nor any committee thereof
shall (i) withhold, withdraw, amend, change or modify, or propose to withhold,
withdraw, amend, change or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser,
the approval or recommendation by the BEI Board or any such committee of the
Merger Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by
the Merger Agreement or the Stockholders Agreement (the "Transactions"),
(ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreement with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the BEI Board shall be permitted
(i) not to recommend to its shareholders acceptance of the Offer and/or approval
and adoption of the Merger Agreement and the Merger, (ii) to withdraw, or modify
in a manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation to its shareholders referred
to in the previous clause, (iii) approve or recommend any Superior Proposal, or
(iv) terminate the Merger Agreement and in connection therewith enter into an
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, but, in each case, only if
(w) BEI has complied with the terms of the Merger Agreement with respect to
solicitation of transactions, (x) BEI has received an Acquisition Proposal which
a majority of the BEI Board determines in good faith constitutes a Superior
Proposal, (y) a majority of the BEI Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
could reasonably be deemed to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law, and (z) no such action is taken earlier than the third full
business day following Parent's receipt of written notice of the intention of
the BEI Board to do so.

    BEI has agreed to promptly advise Parent orally (within one business day)
and in writing (within two business days) of (a) any Acquisition Proposal or any
request for information with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, the material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or request and the identity of
the person making such Acquisition Proposal or request, and (b) any changes in
any such Acquisition Proposal or request.

    Except as approved by a majority of the BEI Board as being required by the
BEI Board's fiduciary duties under applicable law after consultation with
outside legal counsel, and after giving notice to Parent, BEI has further agreed
not to release any third party from, or waive any provision of, any standstill
agreement or any material provision of any confidentiality agreement to which
BEI is a party relating to an Acquisition Proposal or other proposed
transaction.

    EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.  The Merger Agreement
provides that prior to, and effective as of, the Effective Time, BEI shall take
all necessary action to (a) terminate, as of the Effective Time, BEI's Amended
1987 Stock Option Plan and 1992 Restricted Stock Plan, each as amended through
the date of the Merger Agreement (the "BEI Stock Plans"), (b) accelerate the
vesting of each outstanding option to purchase Common Shares under the BEI Stock
Plans (each, a "BEI Stock Option") or any remaining restrictions upon any
Company Restricted Shares in accordance with the terms of BEI Stock Plans, and
(c) cancel, as of the Effective Time, each outstanding BEI Stock Option that is
outstanding and unexercised as of such date. Each holder of a BEI Stock Option
that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation immediately after
the Effective Time, in exchange for the cancellation of such BEI Stock Option,
an amount in cash equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the Per Share Common
Amount over (ii) the per share exercise price of such BEI Stock Option,
multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such BEI
Stock Option as of the Effective Time. Any such payment shall be subject to all
applicable federal, state and local tax withholding requirements. Neither BEI
nor the BEI Board shall take any action, pursuant to BEI Stock Plans or
otherwise, to cause Parent, Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation to
(i) assume any BEI Stock Plan, BEI Stock Option or Company Restricted Shares,
(ii) substitute any similar plan, option or restricted share for any BEI Stock
Plan, BEI Stock Option or Company Restricted Shares, or (iii) cause any BEI
Stock Plan, BEI Stock Option or Company Restricted Shares to continue in full
force and effect following the Effective Time. Prior to or promptly following
the Effective Time, BEI or the Surviving Company (as

the case may be) shall mail to each person who is a holder of an outstanding BEI
Stock Option (regardless of whether such BEI Stock Option is or was vested or
exercisable at the Effective Time) a letter describing the treatment of and
payment for such BEI Stock Option pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and
providing instructions for use in obtaining payment for such BEI Stock Option.

    At the Effective Time, the holder of each Warrant shall be entitled to
receive upon surrender of such Warrant an amount of cash equal to the excess, if
any, of the amount which the holder of such Warrant would be entitled to receive
in respect of each of the Shares issuable upon exercise of such Warrant if such
Warrant were exercised immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to
all Shares remaining to be exercised thereunder, over the aggregate exercise
price of each such Warrant with respect to all Shares remaining to be exercised
thereunder, which payment shall be made to each such Warrant holder upon
surrender of such Warrants by the holders thereof, as soon as practicable after
the Effective Time. Any Warrant not surrendered for cancellation as provided
above shall survive the Merger, and shall become a warrant to receive, upon
payment of the exercise price provided for therein, an amount of cash based on
the Per Share Common Consideration in accordance with the merger adjustment
provisions of each such Warrant. The Company shall give notice of the
Transactions to the holders of Warrants within three (3) business days following
the date of the Merger Agreement, take all necessary action required by the
terms of the Warrants, and use commercially reasonable efforts to take such
other actions as may be necessary, to effect the disposition of the Warrants as
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

    The Merger Agreement provides that (a) as of the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor and satisfy all obligations and
liabilities with respect to all employee related contracts, agreements,
arrangement, policies, plans and commitments of BEI and its Subsidiaries;
(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to continue to provide
employees of BEI and its Subsidiaries with benefits (including welfare benefit
and excluding equity compensation) that are substantially similar to the
benefits currently provided by BEI, PROVIDED, however, that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to provide any specific benefits that Parent
does not otherwise provide to its similarly situated employees; and (c) to the
extent that service is relevant for eligibility, vesting or allowances
(including flexible time off), but not for benefit accruals, under any plan,
program or arrangement of Purchaser and/or the Surviving Corporation, then
Parent shall ensure that such plan, program or arrangement shall credit
employees for service prior to the Effective Time with BEI and its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Parent, Purchaser or the Surviving
Corporation retain the right under the Merger Agreement (a) to terminate
employment or change the place of work, responsibilities, status or description
of any employee or group of employees, or (b) to terminate any employee benefit
plan without establishing a replacement plan (to the extent BEI would have had
such right prior to the Effective Time), in each case in their discretion.

    DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INDEMNIFICATION INSURANCE.  The Merger Agreement
further provides that the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the
Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification and limitation of liability for directors, officers, employees,
fiduciaries and agents than are set forth in the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws of BEI, which provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time
in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals
who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees,
fiduciaries or agents of BEI, unless such modification shall be required by law.

    Parent is also obligated to, and to cause the Surviving Corporation in the
Merger to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of BEI under
indemnification agreements with BEI's officers and directors and under BEI's
Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Merger Agreement also
provides that Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect
for six years from the Effective Time, if available, the current directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies maintained by BEI (provided that the
Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least

the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are not materially less
favorable) with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time subject
to certain price limitations.

    Parent, Purchaser and BEI have also agreed that in the event BEI or the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns
(a) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (b) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of BEI or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
or at Parent's option, Parent, shall assume the foregoing indemnity obligations.

    FURTHER ACTION; REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS.  The Merger Agreement provides
that, subject to its terms and conditions, each of the parties thereto shall
(a) make promptly its respective filings, and thereafter make any other required
submissions, under the HSR Act and applicable foreign antitrust laws, if any,
with respect to the Transactions, and (b) use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations to consummate and make effective the Transactions, including,
without limitation, using its reasonable best efforts to obtain all Permits,
consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of Governmental
Authorities and parties to contracts with BEI and the Subsidiaries as are
necessary for the consummation of the Transactions and to fulfill the conditions
to the Offer and the Merger; provided that neither Purchaser nor Parent will be
required to take any action, including entering into any consent decree, hold
separate orders or other arrangements, that (i) requires the divestiture of any
assets of any of Purchaser, Parent, BEI or any of their respective subsidiaries,
or (ii) limits Parent's freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain, BEI and the Subsidiaries or any portion thereof or any of Parent's or
its affiliates' other assets or businesses.

    The Merger Agreement also provides that except where prohibited by
applicable law, and subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, BEI and Parent
each shall promptly (a) supply the other with any information which may
reasonably be required in order to effectuate such filings, and (b) supply any
additional information which reasonably may be required by antitrust,
competition or merger control authorities in any competent jurisdiction and
which the parties may reasonably deem appropriate.

    In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that each of the parties agrees
to cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to vigorously contest and
resist any Action, including administrative or judicial Action, and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and
that restricts, prevents or prohibits consummation of the Transactions,
including, without limitation, by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of
administrative and judicial appeal.

    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  The Merger Agreement contains various
customary representations and warranties of the parties thereto, including
representations by BEI as to its organization, constitutive documents, its
capitalization, its authority to execute and perform under the Merger Agreement,
its filing obligations with respect to the Commission, the absence of conflict
of the Merger Agreement with other agreements of BEI or with governmental
regulations, the absence of certain changes or events concerning BEI's business,
compliance with law, litigation, employee benefit plans, labor matters, property
and leases, intellectual property, taxes, approvals to market and sell its
products, environmental matters, amendments to the Rights Agreement, material
contracts, insurance, brokers and receipt of an opinion of its financial advisor
in connection with the Offer and the Merger.

    CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER.  Under the Merger Agreement, the respective
obligations of each party to effect the Merger are subject to the satisfaction,
at or prior to the Effective Time, of the following conditions:

        (a) if necessary under Delaware Law, the Merger Agreement shall have
    been adopted by the affirmative vote of the stockholders of BEI;

        (b) any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the
    consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act shall have expired or been
    terminated;

        (c) no governmental authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,
    enforced or entered any law (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent)
    which is then in effect and has the effect of making the acquisition of
    Shares by Parent or Purchaser or any affiliate of either of them illegal or
    otherwise restricting, preventing or prohibiting consummation of the
    Transactions; and

        (d) Parent, Purchaser, or any affiliate or permitted assignee thereof
    shall have purchased all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant
    to the Offer that would satisfy the Minimum Condition; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
    that this condition shall not be applicable to the obligations of Parent or
    Purchaser if, in breach of the Merger Agreement or the terms of the Offer,
    Purchaser fails to purchase any Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
    pursuant to the Offer.

    TERMINATION.  The Merger Agreement provides that it may be terminated and
the Merger and the other Transactions may be abandoned, notwithstanding any
requisite adoption of the Merger Agreement by the stockholders of BEI:

        (a) at any time prior to the Effective Time, by mutual written consent
    of each of Parent, Purchaser and BEI duly authorized by the Boards of
    Directors of Parent, Purchaser and BEI; or

        (b) at any time prior to the Effective Time, by either Parent, Purchaser
    or BEI if (i) the Offer has not been consummated on or before December 31,
    2002; provided, however, that the right to terminate the Merger Agreement
    shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation
    under the Merger Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the
    failure of the Offer to have been consummated on or before such date, or
    (ii) any Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,
    enforced or entered any injunction, order, decree or ruling (whether
    temporary, preliminary or permanent) which has become final and
    nonappealable and has the effect of making consummation of the Offer or the
    Merger illegal or otherwise preventing or prohibiting consummation of the
    Offer or the Merger; or

        (c) at any time prior to the Appointment Time, by Parent if due to an
    occurrence or circumstance that would result in a failure to satisfy any
    condition set forth in Conditions to the Offer annexed to the Merger
    Agreement (and as summarized in Section 14 of this Offer to Purchase),
    Purchaser shall have (i) failed to commence the Offer within 30 days
    following the date of the Merger Agreement, (ii) terminated the Offer
    without having accepted any Shares for payment thereunder, or (iii) failed
    to accept Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer within 90 days following
    the commencement of the Offer (provided, however, that the applicable time
    period specified in clause (iii) shall be extended until the earlier to
    occur of (A) the fifth business day following the public announcement of the
    expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR
    Act, and (B) December 31, 2002), unless such action or inaction under
    clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph (c) shall have been caused by
    or resulted from the failure of Parent or Purchaser to perform, in any
    material respect, any of their material covenants or agreements contained in
    the Merger Agreement, or the material breach by Parent or Purchaser of any
    of their material representations or warranties contained in the Merger
    Agreement in which case Parent may not terminate the Merger Agreement; or

        (d) at any time prior to the Appointment Time, by Parent if, whether or
    not permitted to do so, (i) the Board shall have withdrawn or modified in a
    manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser its approval or recommendation of the
    Offer, the Merger or the Merger Agreement, or approved or recommended any
    Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) BEI shall have entered into any agreement with
    respect to any Acquisition Proposal, including a Superior Proposal entered
    into in accordance with the provisions regarding Superior Proposals
    described above (terminations pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) are termed a
    "Parent Termination Upon an Acquisition Proposal"); or

        (e) at any time prior to the Appointment Time, by BEI, upon approval of
    the BEI Board, if Purchaser shall have in breach of the terms of the Merger
    Agreement (i) failed to commence the Offer within 30 days following the date
    of the Merger Agreement, (ii) terminated the Offer without having accepted
    any Shares for payment thereunder, or (iii) failed to accept Shares for
    payment pursuant to the Offer within 90 days following the commencement of
    the Offer (provided, however, that the applicable time period specified in
    clause (iii) shall be extended until the earlier to occur of (A) the fifth
    business day following the public announcement of the expiration or
    termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and
    (B) December 31, 2002), unless such action or inaction under clauses (i),
    (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph (d) shall have been caused by or resulted
    from the failure of BEI or any of the Stockholders to perform, in any
    material respect, any of their respective material covenants or agreements
    contained in the Merger Agreement or the Stockholders Agreement or any
    material breach by BEI or the Stockholder of any of their material
    representations or warranties contained in the Merger Agreement or the
    Stockholders Agreement, in which case BEI may not terminate the Merger
    Agreement; or

        (f) at any time prior to the Effective Time, by BEI, in connection with
    entering into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition
    Proposal, provided (A) that the relevant Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
    Proposal, (B) that BEI has complied with all provisions of the Merger
    Agreement pertaining to Acquisition Proposals, including the notice
    provisions therein, and (C) that BEI makes simultaneous payment of the
    Termination Fee. Terminations meeting such provisos are "BEI Terminations
    Upon a Superior Proposal."

    EFFECT OF TERMINATION.  In the event of the termination of the Merger
Agreement, the Merger Agreement shall forthwith become void, and there shall be
no liability on the part of any party thereto, except (i) as set forth below
under the section entitled "Fees and Expenses" and (ii) nothing in the Merger
Agreement shall relieve any party from liability for any breach of a covenant
thereof prior to the date of such termination, provided, however, that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of the Merger Agreement.

    FEES AND EXPENSES.  The Merger Agreement provides that all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement, the Stockholders
Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses, whether or not any Transaction is consummated.

    BEI shall promptly pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent a fee equal to the
sum of Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000) plus up to Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($750,000) of the Parent Expenses (the "Termination Fee"), payable in
same day funds, if the Merger Agreement is terminated by BEI Upon a Superior
Proposal or by the Parent Upon an Acquisition Proposal. In addition, BEI shall
pay the Termination Fee if (x) the Merger Agreement is terminated by Parent or
BEI, as applicable, pursuant to paragraphs (b) or (c) above, and within nine
months of such termination BEI consummates any Acquisition Proposal with any
party with whom BEI had solicited, initiated or otherwise encouraged,
participated in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnished any
information with respect to, such Acquisition Proposal during the period
beginning on the date of the Merger Agreement and ending on the termination of
the Merger Agreement, provided, that no Termination Fee shall be due solely as a
result of the consummation of an equity financing transaction

contemplated by Section 7.05(g) of the Merger Agreement in compliance with all
of the conditions thereof.

                           THE STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT

    THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE STOCKHOLDERS
AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO WITH THE SUPPORTING STOCKHOLDERS. THIS SUMMARY IS
QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT, WHICH IS
INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE, A COPY OF WHICH HAS BEEN FILED WITH THE
COMMISSION AS AN EXHIBIT TO THE SCHEDULE TO. THE STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT MAY BE
EXAMINED AND COPIES MAY BE OBTAINED AT THE PLACES SET FORTH IN SECTION 7.

    TENDER OF SHARES.  Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, each Supporting
Stockholder agrees to tender, pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of
the Offer, and not withdraw (except following the termination of the Offer in
accordance with its terms), all of such Supporting Stockholder's Shares,
together with any Shares subsequently acquired by such Supporting Stockholder
after the date of the Stockholders Agreement and prior to the consummation of
the Offer.

    VOTING AGREEMENT.  Each Supporting Stockholder agrees that, from and after
the date thereof and until the earlier to occur of the consummation of the Offer
in which such Supporting Stockholder's Shares are purchased and the termination
of the Stockholders Agreement, at any meeting of the stockholders of BEI,
however called, and in any action by consent or otherwise of the stockholders of
BEI, such Supporting Stockholder will vote (or cause to be voted) such
Supporting Stockholder's Shares (a) in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement and otherwise in such manner as may be necessary to consummate the
Merger; (b) against any action, proposal, agreement or transaction that would
result in a breach of any covenant, obligation, agreement, representation or
warranty of BEI under the Merger Agreement or of such Supporting Stockholder
contained in the Stockholders Agreement; and (c) against any action, agreement,
transaction (other than the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated
thereby) or proposal (including any Acquisition Proposal) that could be
reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to BEI's obligations
under the Merger Agreement not being fulfilled or that is intended, or could
reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere, delay, discourage or adversely
affect the Merger Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the Stockholders
Agreement. Any vote by such Supporting Stockholder that is not in accordance
with this paragraph will be null and void.

    IRREVOCABLE PROXY.  According to the Stockholders Agreement, if such
Supporting Stockholder fails to comply with the voting agreement provisions
detailed above, such failure will result in the constitution and appointment of
Parent and each of its officers from and after the date of such determination
until the earlier to occur of the closing under the Stockholders Agreement and
the termination of the Stockholders Agreement (at which point such constitution
and appointment will automatically be revoked) as such Supporting Stockholder's
attorney, agent and proxy, (such constitution and appointment, the "Irrevocable
Proxy") with full power of substitution, to vote and otherwise act with respect
to the Supporting Stockholder's Shares at any meeting of stockholders of BEI.

    GRANT OF OPTION.  The Supporting Stockholders granted Purchaser an option,
exercisable under certain limited circumstances, to purchase all such Shares
owned by them at the Per Share Common Consideration or the Per Share Series A
Consideration, as the case may be, and to purchase all options, warrants and
other rights to acquire Shares at a price equal to the Per Share Common
Consideration payable with respect to all Shares issuable upon exercise of such
options, warrants, or conversion of other securities minus the aggregate
exercise price of such options, warrants or other securities.

    NO DISPOSITION OR ENCUMBRANCE OF SHARES.  Each Supporting Stockholder has
agreed not to (a) sell, transfer, tender (except into the Offer), pledge,
assign, contribute to the capital of any entity, hypothecate, give or otherwise
dispose of, grant a proxy or power of attorney with respect to (other than the
Irrevocable Proxy), deposit into any voting trust, enter into any voting
agreement, or create or permit to exist any Liens (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) of any nature whatsoever (other than pursuant to the Stockholders
Agreement) with respect to, any of such Supporting Stockholder's Shares (or
agree or consent to, or offer to do, any of the foregoing), or (b) take any
action that would make any representation or warranty of such Supporting
Stockholder in the Stockholders Agreement untrue or incorrect in any material
respect or have the effect of preventing or disabling such Supporting
Stockholder from performing such Supporting Stockholder's obligations
thereunder.

    NO SOLICITATION OF TRANSACTIONS.  Each Supporting Stockholder has agreed
that between the date of the Stockholders Agreement and the date of termination
of the Merger Agreement, such Supporting Stockholder will not, directly or
indirectly, through any director, officer, affiliate, employee, representative,
agent or otherwise, except to the limited extent that members of the BEI Board
are permitted to take certain actions under certain sections of the Merger
Agreement pertaining to Acquisition Proposals, (a) solicit, initiate, endorse,
accept or encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, or
(b) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
person any information with respect to, or otherwise participate in, assist,
facilitate, endorse or encourage any proposal that constitutes, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. Such Supporting
Stockholder will, and will direct or cause its directors, officers, affiliates,
employees, representatives and agents to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any discussions or negotiations with any parties that may be ongoing
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Such Supporting Stockholder will
promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal or any
request for information with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, the material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or request and the identity of
the person making such Acquisition Proposal or request.

    CONVERSION OF SERIES A STOCK.  By executing and delivering the Stockholders
Agreement, each Supporting Stockholder has (i) elected and agreed to convert,
pursuant to Section 4 of BEI's Certificate of Designations, Preferences and
Rights of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Certificate of
Designations"), all Series A Shares beneficially owned by such Supporting
Stockholder into shares of Common Stock at the applicable Series A Preferred
Conversion Rate (as defined in the Certificate of Designations), effective
immediately prior to, and conditioned upon, the consummation of the Offer, and
waived any rights to liquidation preferences that such Supporting Stockholder
would otherwise have been entitled to in connection with the Offer or the Merger
if the shares of Series A Stock were not converted into Common Stock in
accordance with the Stockholders Agreement, and (ii) to the extent that the
Supporting Stockholders constitute holders of a majority of the outstanding
Series A Shares on an as-converted basis, elected to cause all of the
outstanding Series A Shares to be converted into Common Shares at the applicable
Series A Preferred Conversion Rate, effective immediately prior to, and
conditioned upon, the Consummation of the Offer. In connection with the
consummation of the Offer, the certificates representing the Series A Shares
held by each Supporting Stockholder shall be deemed to represent the right to
receive that number of Common Shares into which the number of Series A Shares
evidenced by the certificate was converted at the applicable Series Preferred
Conversion Rate, and in connection with the Offer, the right to receive, upon
consummation of the Offer and such Stockholder's tender of the Series A Shares
into the Offer, the Per Share Common Consideration for each Common Share that
the certificate evidencing Series A Shares represents.

    TERMINATION.  The Stockholders Agreement provides that each Supporting
Stockholder's obligation to tender, and not withdraw, its Shares pursuant to the
Offer will terminate on the expiration date of the Offer. The Options will
terminate upon termination of the Merger Agreement. The remaining

provisions of the Stockholders Agreement, and all other rights and obligations
of the parties thereunder, will terminate, and no party will have any rights or
obligations thereunder and the Stockholders Agreement will become null and void
and have no further effect upon the earliest of (i) the Effective Time,
(ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement, and (iii) the date upon which
Parent will have purchased and paid for all of the Shares in accordance with the
terms of the Offer or pursuant to the exercise of the Option granted by the
Supporting Stockholder thereunder.

SECTION 11.  PURPOSE OF THE OFFER; PLANS FOR BEI AFTER THE OFFER AND THE MERGER.

    PURPOSE OF THE OFFER.  The Offer is being made pursuant to the Merger
Agreement. The purpose of the Offer and the Merger is for Parent to acquire the
entire equity interest in BEI. The purpose of the Merger is for Parent to
acquire all of the Shares not purchased pursuant to the Offer and the
Stockholders Agreement. Upon consummation of the Merger, BEI will become a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

    Under Delaware Law, the approval of the BEI Board and the affirmative vote
of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares is required to adopt the
Merger Agreement. The Board of BEI has unanimously determined that the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including each of the Offer
and the Merger, and the transactions contemplated by the Stockholders Agreement
are fair to, and in the best interests of, the stockholders of BEI, has
approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including each of the Offer and the Merger,
and the transactions contemplated by the Stockholders Agreement (such approval
and adoption having been made in accordance with Delaware Law, including,
without limitation, Section 203 thereof) and has resolved to recommend that
holders of Shares accept the Offer and tender their Shares pursuant to the
Offer. Unless the Merger is consummated pursuant to the short-form merger
provisions under Delaware Law described below, the only remaining required
corporate action of BEI is the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting
securities of BEI. Accordingly, if the Minimum Condition is satisfied, Purchaser
will have sufficient voting power to cause the adoption of the Merger Agreement
without the affirmative vote of any other stockholder.

    In the Merger Agreement, BEI has agreed to duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold an annual or special meeting of its stockholders for the
purpose of considering and taking action on the Merger Agreement, if such action
is required by Delaware Law, as promptly as practicable following the purchase
by Purchaser of Shares pursuant to the Offer, or, if the Offer shall have been
terminated, consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Stockholders
Agreement that would result in Parent or Purchaser acquiring a majority of the
voting securities of BEI on a fully diluted basis. Parent and Purchaser have
agreed that all Shares owned by them and their subsidiaries will be voted in
favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

    The Merger Agreement provides that, promptly upon the purchase by Purchaser
of Shares pursuant to the Offer, or, if the Offer shall have been terminated,
upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Stockholders Agreement
that would result in Parent or Purchaser acquiring a majority of the voting
securities of BEI, Purchaser will be entitled to designate representatives to
serve on the BEI Board in proportion to Purchaser's ownership of Shares (on an
"as-converted" basis) following such purchase. For more details, please see
Section 10. Purchaser expects that such representation would permit Purchaser to
obtain majority representation on the BEI Board and control over BEI's conduct
of its business and operations.

    SHORT-FORM MERGER.  Under Delaware Law, if Purchaser acquires, pursuant to
the Offer, the Stockholders Agreement or otherwise, at least 90% of each of the
then outstanding Common Shares and Series A Shares, Purchaser will be able to
approve the Merger without a vote of BEI's stockholders. In such event, Parent,
Purchaser and BEI have agreed in the Merger Agreement to take,

at the request of Purchaser, all necessary and appropriate action to cause the
Merger to become effective as promptly as practicable after such acquisition,
without a meeting of BEI's stockholders. If, however, Purchaser does not acquire
at least 90% of the outstanding Common Shares and Series A Shares pursuant to
the Offer, the Stockholders Agreement or otherwise, and a vote of BEI's
stockholders is required under Delaware Law, a significantly longer period of
time would be required to effect the Merger.

    APPRAISAL RIGHTS.  No appraisal rights are available in connection with the
Offer. However, if the Merger is consummated, holders of Shares who have not
tendered their Shares or, if applicable, voted in favor of the Merger will have
certain rights under Delaware Law to dissent from the Merger and demand
appraisal of, and to receive payment in cash of the fair value of, their Shares.
Holders of Shares who perfect such rights by complying with the procedures set
forth in Section 262 of the Delaware Law ("Section 262") will have the "fair
value" of their Shares (exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger) determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery and will be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to such fair value
for the Surviving Corporation. In addition, such dissenting holders of Shares
would be entitled to receive payment of a fair rate of interest from the date of
consummation of the Merger on the amount determined to be the fair value of
their Shares. Parent does not intend to object, assuming the proper procedures
are followed, to the exercise of appraisal rights by any stockholder and the
demand for appraisal of, and payment in cash for the fair value of, the Shares.
Parent intends, however, to cause the Surviving Corporation to argue in an
appraisal proceeding that, for purposes of such proceeding, the fair value of
each Share is less than or equal to the Merger Consideration.

    The foregoing summary of the rights of dissenting holders of Shares under
Delaware Law does not purport to be a complete statement of the procedures to be
followed by holders of Shares desiring to exercise any dissenters' rights under
Delaware Law. The preservation and exercise of dissenters' rights require strict
adherence to the applicable provisions of Delaware Law.

    GOING PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS.  The Commission has adopted Rule 13e-3 under the
Exchange Act which is applicable to certain "going private" transactions and
which may under certain circumstances be applicable to the Merger or another
business combination following the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer or
the Stockholders Agreement in which Purchaser seeks to acquire the remaining
Shares not held by it. Purchaser believes that Rule 13e-3 will not be applicable
to the Merger. Rule 13e-3 requires, among other things, that certain financial
information concerning BEI and certain information relating to the fairness of
the proposed transaction and the consideration offered to minority stockholders
in such transaction be filed with the Commission and disclosed to stockholders
prior to consummation of the transaction.

    PLANS FOR BEI.  It is expected that, initially following the Merger, the
business and operations of BEI will be integrated with the Microvasive Urology
division of Parent and, except as set forth in this Offer to Purchase, otherwise
be continued by BEI substantially as they are currently being conducted. Parent
will continue to evaluate the business and operations of BEI during the pendency
of the Offer and after the consummation of the Offer and the Merger, and will
take such actions as it deems appropriate under the circumstances then existing.
Parent intends to seek additional information about BEI during this period.
Thereafter, Parent intends to review such information as part of a comprehensive
review of BEI's business, operations, capitalization and management in order to
determine what, if any, changes would be desirable in light of the circumstances
which then exist. Such changes could include, among other things, changes in
BEI's business, corporate structure, restated certificate of incorporation,
by-laws, capitalization or management, including any changes necessary to
integrate BEI into the Microvasive Urology division of Parent.

    Assuming the Minimum Condition is satisfied and Purchaser purchases Shares
pursuant to the Offer or the Stockholders Agreement, Parent intends to promptly
exercise its rights under the Merger

Agreement to obtain majority representation on, and control of, BEI Board. See
"Section 10--Merger Agreement--BEI Board Representation" above. Parent will
exercise such rights by causing BEI to elect to the Board the following
individuals: Lawrence C. Best, Lawrence J. Knopf, Paul W. Sandman and Stephen F.
Moreci. Information with respect to such persons is contained in Annex A to the
Schedule 14D-9 filed by BEI on May 30, 2002. The Merger Agreement provides that,
upon the purchase by Purchaser of the Shares pursuant to the Offer, or, if the
Offer shall have been terminated, upon consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Stockholders Agreement that would result in Parent or
Purchaser acquiring a majority of the voting securities of BEI, Purchaser shall
be entitled to designate up to such number of directors, rounded up to the next
whole number, on the Board as shall give Purchaser representation on the Board
equal to the product of the total number of directors on the Board (giving
effect to the directors elected pursuant to this sentence), multiplied by the
percentage that the aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by Purchaser
or any affiliate of Purchaser following such purchase bears to the total number
of Shares then outstanding on as "as-converted" basis. The Merger Agreement
provides that the directors and officers of Purchaser at the Effective Time of
the Merger Agreement will, from and after the Effective Time, be the initial
directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation.

    In the event the Merger is terminated, Purchaser or an affiliate of
Purchaser may, following the consummation or termination of the Offer, seek to
acquire additional Common Shares through open market purchases, privately
negotiated transactions, a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, upon
such terms and at such prices as it shall determine, which may be more or less
than the price to be paid pursuant to the Offer. Purchaser and its affiliates
also reserve the right to dispose of any or all Shares acquired by them, subject
to the terms of the Merger Agreement.

    Except as indicated in this Offer to Purchase, Parent does not have any
current plans or proposals which relate to or would result in any extraordinary
corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation,
relocation of any operations of BEI or any of its subsidiaries, any purchase,
sale or transfer of a material amount of assets, involving BEI or any of its
subsidiaries, any material change in BEI's current indebtedness, capitalization
or dividend policy, any change in the present Board or management of BEI or any
other material change in BEI's corporate structure or business.

SECTION 12.  DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.

    The Merger Agreement provides that BEI shall not, between the date of the
Merger Agreement and the Effective Time, without the prior written consent of
Parent:

        (a) issue, sell, pledge, dispose of, grant, encumber, or authorize the
    issuance, sale, pledge, disposition, grant or encumbrance of (i) any shares
    of any class of capital stock of BEI or any Subsidiary, or any options,
    warrants, convertible securities or other rights of any kind to acquire any
    shares of such capital stock, or any other ownership interest (including,
    without limitation, any phantom interest), of BEI or any Subsidiary (except
    for the securities issuable pursuant to outstanding Company options and
    warrants), or (ii) any assets of BEI or any Subsidiary, except, with respect
    to assets, in the ordinary course of business and in a manner consistent
    with past practice;

        (b) declare, set aside, make or pay any dividend or other distribution,
    payable in cash, stock, property or otherwise, with respect to any of its
    capital stock, except for dividends by any direct or indirect wholly owned
    Subsidiary to BEI or any other Subsidiary; or

        (c) reclassify, combine, split, subdivide or redeem, or purchase or
    otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any of its capital stock.

SECTION 13.  POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF THE OFFER ON THE MARKET FOR SHARES, NASDAQ
LISTING, MARGIN REGULATIONS AND EXCHANGE ACT REGISTRATION.

    POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF THE OFFER ON THE MARKET FOR THE COMMON SHARES.  The
purchase of Common Shares by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer will reduce the
number of Common Shares that might otherwise trade publicly and will reduce the
number of holders of Common Shares, which could adversely affect the liquidity
and market value of the remaining Common Shares held by the public.

    Parent intends to cause the delisting of the Common Shares by Nasdaq
following consummation of the Offer.

    NASDAQ LISTING.  Depending upon the number of Common Shares purchased
pursuant to the Offer, the Common Shares may no longer meet the standards for
continued listing on Nasdaq. According to Nasdaq's published guidelines, the
Common Shares would not be eligible to be included for listing if, among other
things, the number of Common Shares publicly held falls below 750,000, the
number of round lot holders of Common Shares falls below 400 or the market value
of such publicly held Common Shares is not at least $5 million. If, as a result
of the purchase of Common Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Merger, the Stock
Purchase Agreement or otherwise, the Common Shares no longer meet the
requirements of Nasdaq for continued listing, the listing of the Common Shares
will be discontinued. In such event, the market for the Common Shares would be
adversely affected. In the event the Common Shares were no longer eligible for
listing on Nasdaq, quotations might still be available from other sources. The
extent of the public market for the Common Shares and the availability of such
quotations would, however, depend upon the number of holders of such Common
Shares remaining at such time, the interest in maintaining a market in such
Common Shares on the part of securities firms, the possible termination of
registration of such Common Shares under the Exchange Act as described below and
other factors.

    EXCHANGE ACT REGISTRATION.  The Common Shares are currently registered under
the Exchange Act. Such registration may be terminated upon application by BEI to
the Commission if the Common Shares are not listed on a "national securities
exchange" and there are fewer than 300 record holders. The termination of the
registration of the Common Shares under the Exchange Act would substantially
reduce the information required to be furnished by BEI to holders of Common
Shares and to the Commission and would make certain provisions of the Exchange
Act, such as the short-swing profit recovery provisions of Section 16(b), the
requirement of furnishing a proxy statement in connection with stockholders'
meetings pursuant to Section 14(a) or 14(c) of the Exchange Act and the related
requirements of an annual report, and the requirements of Rule 13e-3 under the
Exchange Act with respect to "going private" transactions, no longer applicable
to the Common Shares. In addition, "affiliates" of BEI and persons holding
"restricted securities" of BEI may be deprived of the ability to dispose of such
securities pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended. If registration of the Common Shares under the Exchange Act were
terminated, the Common Shares would no longer be eligible for Nasdaq reporting.
Purchaser currently intends to seek to cause BEI to terminate the registration
of the Common Shares under the Exchange Act as soon after consummation of the
Offer as the requirements for termination of registration are met.

    MARGIN REGULATIONS.  The Common Shares are currently "margin securities", as
such term is defined under the rules of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board"), which has the effect, among other
things, of allowing brokers to extend credit on the collateral of such
securities. Depending upon factors similar to those described above regarding
listing and market quotations, following the Offer it is possible that the
Common Shares might no longer constitute "margin securities" for purposes of the
margin regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, in which event such Common
Shares could no longer be used as collateral for loans made by brokers. In
addition, if registration of the Common Shares under the Exchange Act were
terminated, the Common Shares would no longer constitute "margin securities."

SECTION 14.  CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer and subject to the terms of
the Merger Agreement, Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment any
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, and may extend, terminate or amend the
Offer, if (i) immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer the Minimum
Condition shall not have been satisfied, (ii) the HSR Condition shall not have
been satisfied, or (iii) at any time on or after the date of the Merger
Agreement and prior to the expiration of the Offer any of the following
conditions shall exist:

        (a) there shall have been instituted or be pending any Action before any
    governmental authority (i) challenging or seeking to make illegal,
    materially delay, or otherwise, directly or indirectly, restrain or prohibit
    or make materially more costly, the making of the Offer, the acceptance for
    payment of any Shares by Parent, Purchaser or any other affiliate of Parent,
    or the consummation of any other Transaction, or seeking to obtain material
    damages in connection with any Transaction; (ii) seeking to prohibit or
    materially limit the ownership or operation by BEI, Parent or any of their
    subsidiaries of all or any of the business or assets of BEI, Parent or any
    of their subsidiaries that is material to either Parent and its
    subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or BEI and the Subsidiaries, taken as a
    whole, or to compel BEI, Parent or any of their subsidiaries, as a result of
    the Transactions, to dispose of or to hold separate all or any portion of
    the business or assets of BEI, Parent or any of their subsidiaries that is
    material to Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or BEI and the
    Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (iii) seeking to impose or confirm any
    limitation on the ability of Parent, Purchaser or any other affiliate of
    Parent to exercise effectively full rights of ownership of any Shares,
    including, without limitation, the right to vote any Shares acquired by
    Purchaser pursuant to the Offer or otherwise on all matters properly
    presented to BEI's stockholders, including, without limitation, the adoption
    of the Merger Agreement; or (iv) seeking to require divestiture by Parent,
    Purchaser or any other affiliate of Parent of any Shares;

        (b) there shall have been any statute, rule, regulation, legislation or
    interpretation enacted, promulgated, amended, issued or deemed applicable to
    (i) Parent, BEI or any subsidiary or affiliate of Parent or BEI, or
    (ii) any Transaction, by any United States or non-United States legislative
    body or Governmental Authority with appropriate jurisdiction, other than the
    routine application of the waiting period provisions of the HSR Act to the
    Offer, the Stockholders Agreement or the Merger, that is reasonably likely
    to result, directly or indirectly, in any of the consequences referred to in
    clauses (i) through (iv) of paragraph (a) above;

        (c) any material adverse effect on BEI or its ability to consummate the
    Merger Agreement or the Transactions shall have occurred and is continuing;

        (d) there shall have occurred (i) a declaration of a banking moratorium
    or any suspension of payments in respect of banks in the United States that
    materially and adversely affects the ability of Parent to consummate the
    Transactions for more than five business days after the expiration of the
    Offer, or (ii) a commencement of a war or armed hostilities or other
    national or international calamity directly or indirectly involving the
    United States that materially and adversely affects the ability of Purchaser
    and Parent to consummate the Transactions or, in the case of such calamity
    existing on the date hereof, a material acceleration or worsening thereof;

        (e) except as set forth in the two provisos set forth in this
    paragraph (e), any representation or warranty of BEI in the Merger Agreement
    shall not be true and correct as if such representation or warranty was made
    as of any expiration date of the Offer without for this purpose giving
    effect to qualifications or limitations as to materiality or the absence of
    a Material Adverse Effect contained in such representations and warranties,
    except for such failures to be true and correct as would not, individually
    or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect; PROVIDED, that the
    representations and warranties of BEI in Sections 4.01, 4.02, 4.03, 4.04,
    4.06,

    4.12, 4.14, 4.17, 4.20 and 4.21 of the Merger Agreement shall not, to the
    extent qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect, be true and
    correct, or to the extent that any such representation or warranty is not so
    qualified, shall not be true and correct in any material respect as if such
    representations or warranties were made as of the date of the expiration of
    the Offer; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that those representations or warranties
    that address matters only as of a specific date shall not be true and
    correct (subject to the applicable materiality standard as set forth above)
    as of such date;

        (f) (i) BEI shall have (A) failed to perform, in any material respect,
    any obligation or to comply, in any material respect, with any agreement or
    covenant of BEI to be performed or complied with by it under the Merger
    Agreement, or (B) shall have failed to perform or comply in any respect with
    its agreement and covenant in Section 6.01(f) of the Merger Agreement, or
    (ii) the Supporting Stockholders shall have failed to perform, in any
    material respect, any obligation or to comply, in any material respect, with
    any agreement or covenant of the Supporting Stockholders to be performed or
    complied with by them under the Stockholders Agreement as a result of such
    failed performance by the Supporting Stockholders, the Purchaser's ability
    to consummate the Transactions is materially impaired; or

        (g) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with
    its terms; or

        (h) Purchaser and BEI shall have agreed that Purchaser shall terminate
    the Offer or postpone the acceptance for payment of Shares thereunder;

which, in the reasonable judgment of Purchaser in any such case, and regardless
of the circumstances (including any action or inaction by Parent or any of its
affiliates) giving rise to any such condition, makes it inadvisable to proceed
with such acceptance for payment. Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement,
the foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Purchaser and Parent and
may be asserted by Purchaser or Parent regardless of the circumstances giving
rise to any such condition or may be waived by Purchaser or Parent in whole or
in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion. The failure
by Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall
not be deemed a waiver of any such right; the waiver of any such right with
respect to particular facts and other circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver
with respect to any other facts and circumstances; and each such right shall be
deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

SECTION 15.  CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS AND REGULATORY APPROVALS.

    GENERAL.  Based upon its examination of publicly available information with
respect to BEI and the review of certain information furnished by BEI to Parent
and discussions between representatives of Parent with representatives of BEI
during Parent's investigation of BEI (see Section 10), neither Purchaser nor
Parent is aware of (a) any license or other regulatory permit that appears to be
material to the business of BEI or any of its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
which might be adversely affected by the acquisition of Shares by Purchaser
pursuant to the Offer or the Stockholders Agreement, or (b) except as set forth
below, of any approval or other action by any domestic (federal or state) or
foreign governmental authority which would be required prior to the acquisition
of Shares by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer or the Stockholders Agreement.
Should any such approval or other action be required, it is Purchaser's current
intention to seek such approval or action. Purchaser does not currently intend,
however, to delay the purchase of Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer pending
the outcome of any such action or the receipt of any such approval (subject to
Purchaser's right to decline to purchase Shares if any of the conditions in
Section 14 shall have occurred).

    STATE TAKEOVER LAWS.  BEI is incorporated under the laws of the State of
Delaware. In general, Section 203 of Delaware Law prevents an "interested
stockholder" (generally a person who owns or has the right to acquire 15% or
more of a corporation's outstanding voting stock, or an affiliate or

associate thereof) from engaging in a "business combination" (defined to include
mergers and certain other transactions) with a Delaware corporation for a period
of three years following the date such person became an interested stockholder
unless, among other things, prior to such date the board of directors of the
corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction in which
the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder. On May 13, 2002,
prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement,
the BEI Board by unanimous vote of all directors present at a meeting held on
such date, approved the Merger Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement,
determined that each of the Offer and the Merger is fair to, and in the best
interest of, the stockholders of BEI. Accordingly, Section 203 is inapplicable
to the Offer and the Merger.

    A number of other states have adopted laws and regulations applicable to
attempts to acquire securities of corporations which are incorporated, or have
substantial assets, stockholders, principal executive offices or principal
places of business, or whose business operations otherwise have substantial
economic effects, in such states. In Edgar v. MITE Corp., the Supreme Court of
the United States invalidated on constitutional grounds the Illinois Business
Takeover Statute, which, as a matter of state securities law, made takeovers of
corporations meeting certain requirements more difficult. However, in 1987 in
CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of America, the Supreme Court held that the State of
Indiana may, as a matter of corporate law and, in particular, with respect to
those aspects of corporate law concerning corporate governance, constitutionally
disqualify a potential acquiror from voting on the affairs of a target
corporation without the prior approval of the remaining stockholders. The state
law before the Supreme Court was by its terms applicable only to corporations
that had a substantial number of stockholders in the state and were incorporated
there.

    BEI, directly or through its subsidiaries, conducts business in a number of
states throughout the United States, some of which have enacted takeover laws.
Purchaser does not know whether any of these laws will, by their terms, apply to
the Offer or the Merger and has not complied with any such laws. Should any
person seek to apply any state takeover law, Purchaser will take such action as
then appears desirable, which may include challenging the validity or
applicability of any such statute in appropriate court proceedings. In the event
it is asserted that one or more state takeover laws is applicable to the Offer
or the Merger, and an appropriate court does not determine that it is
inapplicable or invalid as applied to the Offer, Purchaser might be required to
file certain information with, or receive approvals from, the relevant state
authorities. In addition, if enjoined, Purchaser might be unable to accept for
payment any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, or be delayed in continuing
or consummating the Offer, and the Merger. In such case, Purchaser may not be
obligated to accept for payment any Shares tendered. For more details, please
see Section 14.

    ANTITRUST.  Under the HSR Act and the rules that have been promulgated
thereunder by the FTC, certain acquisition transactions may not be consummated
unless certain information has been furnished to the Antitrust Division and the
FTC and certain waiting period requirements have been satisfied. Based on the
fact that BEI has reported both its total worldwide assets and annual worldwide
net sales to be less than $10,000,000, Parent and Purchaser believe that no
filing is required under the HSR Act.

    The FTC and the Antitrust Division frequently scrutinize the legality under
the antitrust laws of transactions such as the proposed acquisition of the
Shares by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer or the Stockholders Agreement. At any
time before or after the purchase of the Shares pursuant to the Offer or the
Stockholders Agreement by Purchaser, the FTC or the Antitrust Division could
take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in
the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the purchase of the Shares
pursuant to the Offer or the Stockholders Agreement or seeking the divestiture
of the Shares purchased by Purchaser or the divestiture of substantial assets of
Parent, BEI or their respective subsidiaries. Private parties and state
attorneys general may also bring legal action under federal or state antitrust
laws under certain circumstances. Based upon an examination of information
available to Parent relating to the businesses in which Parent, BEI and their
respective

subsidiaries are engaged, Parent and Purchaser believe that neither the Offer
nor the Stockholders Agreements will violate the antitrust laws. Nevertheless,
there can be no assurance that a challenge to the Offer or the Stockholders
Agreement on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made,
what the result would be. For more details, please see Section 14 for certain
conditions to the Offer, including conditions with respect to litigation.

    OTHER LAWS AND LEGAL MATTERS.  BEI markets its products in foreign
countries, and therefore is subject to regulation by non-U.S. governments. Such
governments may also attempt to impose additional conditions on BEI's operations
conducted in such countries. Purchaser presently intends to take such action as
such laws may require.

SECTION 16.  FEES AND EXPENSES.

    Except as set forth below, Purchaser will not pay any fees or commissions to
any broker, dealer or other person for soliciting tenders of Shares pursuant to
the Offer.

    Purchaser and Parent have retained D.F. King & Co., Inc. to serve as the
Information Agent, and The Bank of New York to serve as the Depositary, in
connection with the Offer. The Information Agent may contact holders of Shares
by personal interview, mail, telephone, telex, telegraph and other methods of
electronic communication and may request brokers, dealers, commercial banks,
trust companies and other nominees to forward the Offer materials to beneficial
holders. The Information Agent and Depositary will each receive reasonable and
customary compensation for their services, be reimbursed for certain reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses and be indemnified against certain liabilities in
connection with their services, including certain liabilities and expenses under
the federal securities laws.

    Except as set forth above, neither Parent nor Purchaser will pay any fees or
commissions to any broker or dealer or other person or entity in connection with
the solicitation of tenders of Shares pursuant to the Offer. Brokers, dealers,
banks and trust companies will be reimbursed by Purchaser for customary mailing
and handling expenses incurred by them in forwarding the Offer materials to
their customers.

    Boston Scientific has agreed with Charles Crocker, BEI's Chairman, and
Richard Turner Ph.D., BEI's President and Chief Executive Officer, to direct
proceeds to be received by them pursuant to the Offer, in the aggregate amount
of $950,000, to a former financial advisor to BEI. Mr. Crocker and Mr. Turner
have agreed to pay this amount to such former advisor in connection with the
settlement of a claim by the former advisor for compensation made by such former
advisor in connection with the Merger Agreement and the Offer.

SECTION 17.  MISCELLANEOUS.

    The Offer is being made solely by this Offer to Purchase and the related
Letter of Transmittal, and is being made to holders of Shares. Purchaser is not
aware of any jurisdiction where the making of the Offer is prohibited by any
administrative or judicial action pursuant to any valid state statute. If
Purchaser becomes aware of any valid state statute prohibiting the making of the
Offer or the acceptance of Shares pursuant thereto, Purchaser will make a good
faith effort to comply with any such state statute. If, after such good faith
effort, Purchaser cannot comply with any such state statute, the Offer will not
be made to (nor will tenders be accepted from or on behalf of) the holders of
Shares in such state. In any jurisdiction where the securities, blue sky or
other laws require the Offer to be made by a licensed broker or dealer, the
Offer shall be deemed to be made on behalf of Purchaser by one or more
registered brokers or dealers licensed under the laws of such jurisdiction.

    No person has been authorized to give any information or make any
representation on behalf of Purchaser or BEI not contained in this Offer to
Purchase or in the Letter of Transmittal, and if given or made, such information
or representation must not be relied upon as having been authorized.

    Pursuant to Rule 14d-3 of the General Rules and Regulations under the
Exchange Act, Parent and Purchaser have filed with the Commission the Schedule
TO, together with exhibits, furnishing certain additional information with
respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO and any amendments thereto, including
exhibits, may be inspected at, and copies may be obtained from, the same places
and in the same manner as set forth in Section 7 (except that they will not be
available at the regional offices of the Commission).

Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Series A Shares", and
collectively with the Common Shares, the "Shares"), of BEI Medical Systems
Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("BEI"), upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Purchaser's Offer to Purchase dated May 30, 2002
(the "Offer to Purchase"), and this Letter of Transmittal (which, together with
any amendments or supplements thereto or hereto, collectively constitute the
"Offer"), receipt of which is hereby acknowledged.

    Subject to, and effective upon, acceptance for payment of, and payment for,
the Shares tendered herewith in accordance with the terms of and subject to the
conditions of the Offer (including, if the Offer is extended or amended, the
terms and conditions of such extension or amendment), the undersigned hereby
sells, assigns and transfers to, or upon the order of, the Purchaser, all right,
title and interest in and to all of the Shares that are being tendered hereby
and any and all dividends (other than as expressly provided in the Merger
Agreement (as defined in the Offer to Purchase)), distributions, rights, or
other securities issued or issuable in respect of such Shares on or after
May 13, 2002 (collectively, "Distributions"), and irrevocably appoints the
Depositary the true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact of the undersigned
with respect to such Shares and all Distributions with full power of
substitution (such power of attorney being deemed to be an irrevocable power
coupled with an interest) to (a) deliver stock certificates and all
distributions, or transfer ownership of such Shares and all Distributions, on
the account books maintained by the Book-Entry Transfer Facility, together in
such case with all accompanying evidences of transfers and authenticity to, or
upon the order of the Purchaser, (b) present such Shares and all Distributions
for transfer on the books of BEI, and (c) receive all benefits and otherwise
exercise all rights of beneficial ownership of such Shares and all
Distributions, all in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of
the Offer as set forth in the Offer to Purchase.

    The undersigned hereby irrevocably appoints each designee of the Purchaser
as the attorney-in-fact and proxy of the undersigned, with full power of
substitution, to vote the Shares as described below in such manner as each such
attorney-in-fact and proxy (or any substitute thereof) shall deem proper in its
sole discretion, and to otherwise act (including pursuant to written consent) to
the full extent of the undersigned's rights with respect to the Shares and all
Distributions tendered hereby and accepted for payment by the Purchaser prior to
the time of such vote or action. All such proxies and powers of attorney shall
be considered coupled with an interest in the tendered Shares and shall be
irrevocable and are granted in consideration of, and are effective upon, the
acceptance for payment of such Shares in accordance with the terms of the Offer.
Such acceptance for payment by the Purchaser shall revoke, without further
action, any other proxy or power of attorney granted by the undersigned at any
time with respect to such Shares and all Distributions and no subsequent proxies
or powers of attorney may be given or written consent executed (or, if given or
executed, will not be deemed effective) with respect thereto by the undersigned.
The designees of the Purchaser will, with respect to the Shares for which the
appointment is effective, be empowered to exercise all voting and other rights
of such Holder as they in their sole discretion may deem proper at any annual,
special, adjourned or postponed meeting of BEI's stockholders, by written
consent or otherwise, and the Purchaser reserves the right to require that, in
order for Shares to be deemed validly tendered, immediately upon the Purchaser's
acceptance for payment of such Shares, the Purchaser must be able to exercise
all rights (including, without limitation, all voting rights at any meeting of
stockholders then scheduled and rights of conversion) with respect to such
Shares and receive all Distributions.

    The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the undersigned has full
power and authority to tender, sell, assign and transfer the Shares tendered
hereby and all Distributions and that, when the same are accepted for payment by
the Purchaser, the Purchaser will acquire good, marketable and unencumbered
title thereto, free and clear of all liens, restrictions, charges and
encumbrances, and the same will not be subject to any adverse claim. The
undersigned will, upon request, execute and deliver any additional documents
deemed by the Depositary or the Purchaser to be necessary or desirable to
complete the sale, assignment, and transfer of the Shares tendered hereby and
all Distributions. In addition, the undersigned shall promptly remit and
transfer to the Depositary for the account of the Purchaser any and all
Distributions in respect of the Shares tendered hereby, accompanied by
appropriate documentation of transfer and, pending such remittance or
appropriate assurance thereof, the Purchaser shall be, subject to applicable
law, entitled to all rights and privileges as owner of any such Distributions
and may withhold the entire purchase price or deduct from the purchase price the
amount or value thereof, as determined by the Purchaser in its sole discretion.
No authority herein conferred or agreed to be conferred shall be affected by,
and all such authority shall survive, the death or incapacity of the
undersigned. All obligations of the undersigned hereunder shall be binding upon
the heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors and
assigns of the undersigned. Subject to the withdrawal rights set forth in
Section 4--"Withdrawal Rights" of the Offer to Purchase, the tender of the
Shares and related Distributions hereby made is irrevocable. The undersigned
understands that tenders of the Common Shares pursuant to any of the procedures
described in Section 3--"Procedures for Accepting the Offer and Tendering
Shares" of the Offer to Purchase and in the instructions hereto will constitute
a binding agreement between the undersigned and the Purchaser on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, if the price to be paid in the Offer is amended in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, the price to be paid to the
undersigned will be amended. The undersigned recognizes that under certain
circumstances set forth in the Offer to Purchase, the Purchaser may not be
required to accept for payment any of the Shares tendered hereby.

please issue the check for the purchase price and/or return any Certificates not
tendered or not accepted for payment in the name(s) of the registered Holder(s)
appearing under "Description of Shares Tendered." Similarly, unless otherwise

are not accepted for payment by crediting the account at the Book-Entry Transfer

obligation, pursuant to the "Special Payment Instructions," to transfer any

does not accept for payment any of the Shares so tendered.

                                  INSTRUCTIONS
             FORMING PART OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER

    1.  GUARANTEE OF SIGNATURES.  Except as otherwise provided below, all
signatures on this Letter of Transmittal must be guaranteed by a financial
institution (including most banks, savings and loan associations and brokerage
houses) that is a participant in the Security Transfer Agents Medallion Program,
The New York Stock Exchange Medallion Signature Guarantee Program or the Stock
Exchange Medallion Program (each, an "Eligible Institution"). Signatures on this
Letter of Transmittal need not be guaranteed (a) if this Letter of Transmittal
is signed by the registered Holder(s) (which term, for purposes of this
document, shall include any participant in the Book-Entry Transfer Facility
whose name appears on a security position listing as the owner of Common Shares)
of the Shares tendered herewith and such Holder(s) has not completed the box
entitled either "Special Payment Instructions" or "Special Delivery
Instructions" on this Letter of Transmittal or (b) if such Shares are tendered
for the account of an Eligible Institution. See Instruction 5 of this Letter of
Transmittal.

    2.  DELIVERY OF LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND CERTIFICATES OR BOOK-ENTRY
CONFIRMATIONS.  This Letter of Transmittal is to be used either if Certificates
are to be forwarded herewith or, unless an Agent's Message (as defined in the
Offer to Purchase) is utilized, if tenders are to be made pursuant to the
procedures for tender by book-entry transfer set forth in
Section 3--"Procedures for Accepting the Offer and Tendering Shares" of the
Offer to Purchase. Certificates evidencing all physically tendered Shares, or
timely confirmation (a "Book-Entry Confirmation") of a book-entry transfer of
Common Shares into the Depositary's Account at DTC, as well as this Letter of
Transmittal (or copy thereof), properly completed and duly executed with any
required signature guarantees (or, in the case of a book-entry delivery, an
Agent's Message), and all other documents required by this Letter of Transmittal
must be received by the Depositary at one of its addresses set forth herein
prior to the Expiration Date (as defined in Section 1--"Terms of the Offer;
Expiration Date" of the Offer to Purchase). If Certificates are forwarded to the
Depositary in multiple deliveries, a properly completed and duly executed Letter
of Transmittal (or copy thereof) must accompany each such delivery.

    Holders whose Certificates are not immediately available or who cannot
deliver their Certificates and all other required documents to the Depositary
prior to the Expiration Date or who cannot complete the procedures for
book-entry transfer on a timely basis may nevertheless tender their Shares by
properly completing and duly executing a Notice of Guaranteed Delivery pursuant
to the guaranteed delivery procedure set forth in Section 3--"Procedures for
Accepting the Offer and Tendering Shares" of the Offer to Purchase. Pursuant to
such procedure: (i) such tender must be made by or through an Eligible
Institution; (ii) a properly completed and duly executed Notice of Guaranteed
Delivery, substantially in the form provided by the Purchaser, must be received
by the Depositary prior to the Expiration Date; and (iii) Certificates, as well
as a Letter of Transmittal (or copy thereof), properly completed and duly
executed with any required signature guarantees (or, in the case of a book-entry
delivery, an Agent's Message), and all other documents required by this Letter
of Transmittal must be received by the Depositary within three trading days of
The Nasdaq National Market after the date of execution of such Notice of
Guaranteed Delivery.

    THE METHOD OF DELIVERY OF THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL, CERTIFICATES AND ALL
OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING DELIVERY THROUGH THE BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER
FACILITY, IS AT THE OPTION AND RISK OF THE TENDERING HOLDER, AND THE DELIVERY
WILL BE DEEMED MADE ONLY WHEN ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY (INCLUDING, IN
THE CASE OF BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER, BY BOOK-ENTRY CONFIRMATION (AS DEFINED IN THE
OFFER TO PURCHASE)). IF DELIVERY IS BY MAIL, REGISTERED MAIL WITH RETURN RECEIPT
REQUESTED, PROPERLY INSURED, IS RECOMMENDED. IN ALL CASES, SUFFICIENT TIME
SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO ENSURE TIMELY DELIVERY.

    No alternative, conditional or contingent tenders will be accepted for
payment and no fractional Shares will be purchased. All tendering Holders, by
execution of this Letter of Transmittal (or a copy hereof), waive any right to
receive any notice of the acceptance of their Shares for payment.

    3.  INADEQUATE SPACE.  If the space provided under "Description of Shares
Tendered" is inadequate, the share Certificate numbers and/or the number of
Shares should be listed on a separate signed schedule and attached hereto.

    4.  PARTIAL TENDERS (APPLICABLE TO CERTIFICATE HOLDERS ONLY; NOT APPLICABLE
TO COMMON SHARES WHICH ARE TENDERED BY BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER).  If fewer than all
the Shares evidenced by any Certificate submitted are to be tendered, fill in
the number of Shares which are to be tendered in the box entitled "Number of
Shares Tendered." In such cases, new Certificate(s) evidencing the remainder of
the Shares that were evidenced by Certificate(s) delivered to the Depositary
will be sent to the person signing this Letter of Transmittal, unless otherwise
provided in the box entitled "Special Delivery Instructions" on this Letter of
Transmittal, as soon as practicable after the Expiration Date. All Shares
represented by Certificate(s) delivered to the Depositary will be deemed to have
been tendered unless otherwise indicated.

    5.  SIGNATURES ON LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL; STOCK POWERS AND ENDORSEMENTS.  If
this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered Holder(s) of the Shares
tendered hereby, the signature(s) must correspond with the name(s) as written on
the face of the Certificate(s) without alteration, enlargement or any change
whatsoever. If any of the Common Shares tendered hereby are owned of record by
two or more joint owners, all such owners must sign this Letter of Transmittal.
If any of the tendered Shares are registered in different names on several
Certificates, it will be necessary to complete, sign and submit as many separate
Letters of Transmittal as there are different registrations of the Shares. If
this Letter of Transmittal or any Certificate or stock power is signed by a
trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, attorney-in-fact, officer of a
corporation or other person acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity,
such person should so indicate when signing, and proper evidence satisfactory to
the Depositary and the Purchaser of such person's authority so to act must be
submitted. If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered Holder(s)
of the Shares transmitted hereby, no endorsements of Certificate(s) or separate
stock powers are required unless payment is to be made to, or Certificate(s)
evidencing the Shares not tendered or purchased are to be issued in the name of,
a person other than the registered Holder(s). Signatures on such Certificate(s)
or stock powers must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution. If this Letter of
Transmittal is signed by a person other than the registered Holder(s) of the
Shares tendered hereby, the Certificate(s) must be endorsed or accompanied by
appropriate stock powers, in either case signed exactly as the name or names of
the registered holder or holders appear(s) on such Certificate(s). Signatures on
such Certificate(s) or stock powers must be guaranteed by an Eligible
Institution.

    6.  TRANSFER TAXES.  Except as otherwise provided in this Instruction 6, the
Purchaser will pay or cause to be paid any transfer taxes with respect to the
transfer and sale of purchased Shares to it or its order pursuant to the Offer.
If, however, payment of the purchase price of any Shares purchased is to be made
to or, in the circumstances permitted hereby, if Certificate(s) for the Shares
not tendered or purchased are to be registered in the name of, any person other
than the registered holder, or if tendered Certificate(s) are registered in the
name of any person other than the person(s) signing this Letter of Transmittal,
the amount of any transfer taxes (whether imposed on the registered Holder or
such person) payable on account of the transfer to such person will be deducted
from the purchase price for such Shares if satisfactory evidence of the payment
of such taxes, or exemption therefrom, is not submitted.

    Except as provided in this Instruction 6, it will not be necessary for
transfer tax stamps to be affixed to the Certificate(s) listed in this Letter of
Transmittal.

    7.  SPECIAL PAYMENT AND DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS.  If a check for the purchase
price of any Shares tendered hereby is to be issued in the name of, and/or
Certificates for the Shares not tendered or not accepted for payment are to be
issued in the name of and/or returned to, a person other than the person(s)
signing this Letter of Transmittal or if a check and/or such Certificates for
Shares are to be mailed to someone other than the signer of this Letter of
Transmittal or to an address other than that shown above, the appropriate boxes
on this Letter of Transmittal should be completed. A Book-Entry Holder may
request that Common Shares not accepted for payment be credited to such account
maintained at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility as such Book-Entry Holder may
designate under "Special Payment Instructions." If no such instructions are
given, such Common Shares not accepted for payment will be returned by crediting
the account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility designated above.

    8.  REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE OR ADDITIONAL COPIES.  Questions or requests for
assistance may be directed to, or additional copies of the Offer to Purchase,
this Letter of Transmittal, the Notice of Guaranteed Delivery and other tender
offer materials may be obtained from, the Information Agent at the address set
forth on the back cover of the Offer to Purchase or from your broker, dealer,
commercial bank or trust company. Such materials will be furnished at the
Purchaser's expense.

    9.  LOST, MUTILATED OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES.  If any Certificates have
been lost, mutilated or destroyed, the Holder should promptly notify the
Depositary by checking the box immediately preceding the special payment/special
delivery instructions and indicating the number of Shares lost. The Holder will
then be instructed as to the procedure to be followed in order to replace the
relevant Certificates. This Letter of Transmittal and related documents cannot
be processed until the procedures for replacing lost, mutilated or destroyed
Certificates have been followed.

    IMPORTANT: THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL OR A COPY HEREOF OR AN AGENT'S
MESSAGE, TOGETHER WITH CERTIFICATES OR CONFIRMATION OF BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER AND
ALL OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS OR THE NOTICE OF GUARANTEED DELIVERY MUST BE
RECEIVED BY THE DEPOSITARY PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATE.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                           IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION

    Under United States federal income tax law, a tendering Holder may be
subject to backup withholding tax at a rate of 30% with respect to payments by
the Depositary pursuant to the Offer unless such Holder: (i) is a corporation or
other exempt recipient and, if required, establishes its exemption from backup
withholding; (ii) provides its correct taxpayer identification number ("TIN")
and certifies that the TIN provided is correct (or that such Holder is awaiting
a TIN); or (iii) certifies that it is not currently subject to backup
withholding or certifies as to its non-United States status. If such Holder is
an individual, the TIN is his or her social security number. Completion of a
Substitute Form W-9, in the case of a U.S. Holder, provided in this Letter of
Transmittal, should be used for this purpose. Failure to provide such Holder's
TIN on the Substitute Form W-9, if applicable, may subject the tendering Holder
(or other payee) to a $50 penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue Service
("IRS"). More serious penalties may be imposed for providing false information
which, if willfully done, may result in fines and/or imprisonment. The box in
part 3 of the Substitute Form W-9 may be checked if the tendering Holder (or
other payee) is required to submit a Substitute Form W-9 and has not been issued
a TIN and has applied for a TIN or intends to apply for a TIN in the near
future. If the box in Part 3 is so checked and the Depositary is not provided
with a TIN by the time of payment, the Depositary will withhold 30% on all such
payments of the Offer Price until a TIN is provided to the Depositary. In order
for a foreign Holder to qualify as an exempt recipient, that Holder should
submit an IRS Form W-8 or a Substitute Form W-8, signed under penalties of
perjury, attesting to that Holder's exempt status. Such forms can be obtained
from the Depositary. Failure to provide the information on the form may subject
tendering Holders to 30% United States federal income tax withholding on the
payment of the purchase price of cash pursuant to the Offer. Backup withholding
is not an additional tax. Rather, the tax liability of persons subject to backup
withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld. If withholding
results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained by filing a tax
return with the IRS. The Depositary cannot refund amounts withheld by reason of
backup withholding.

 failure to report all interest or dividends, or (c) the IRS has notified me that I am no longer subject to
 backup withholding.

notification from the IRS stating that you are no longer subject to backup withholding, do not cross out such
item (2).

law, and (b) a majority of the outstanding Series A Shares, or such higher
percentage of such class of securities as may be required to approve the Merger
pursuant to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of BEI, as amended from
time to time, or applicable law, (the "Minimum Condition"), and (ii) the

    transfer cannot be completed by the Expiration Date;

Stock, net to the seller in cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in the Offer to Purchase, and in the related Letter of Transmittal
(which, together with the Offer to Purchase and any amendments or supplements
thereto, collectively constitute the "Offer"). The Offer is being made in
connection with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 13, 2002 (the
"Merger Agreement"), among Parent, Purchaser and BEI. The Merger Agreement
provides, among other things, that as promptly as practicable after the purchase
of Shares pursuant to the Offer, Purchaser will be merged with and into BEI (the
"Merger"). As a result of the Merger, BEI will continue as the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") and will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent.

    We (or our nominee) are the holder of record of Shares held by us for your
account. A tender of such Shares can be made only by us as the holder of record
and pursuant to your instructions. The Letter of Transmittal is furnished to you
for your information only and cannot be used by you to tender Shares held by us
for your account.

    We request instructions as to whether you wish to have us tender on your
behalf any or all of the Shares held by us for your account, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer.

    Your attention is invited to the following:

    of Preferred Stock, net to the seller in cash.

2.  The Offer is being made for any and all outstanding Shares.

3.  The Board of Directors of BEI has unanimously (i) determined that the Merger
    Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including each of the
    Offer, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Stockholders
    Agreement (as defined in the Offer to Purchase), are fair to, and in the
    best interests of, the holders of Shares, (ii) approved, adopted and
    declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
    thereby, including each of the Offer and the Merger, and (iii) resolved to
    recommend that the holders of Shares accept the Offer and tender Shares
    pursuant to the Offer and, if applicable, vote their Shares in favor of the
    adoption of the Merger Agreement.

4.  The Offer will expire at 12:00 Midnight, New York City time, on Wednesday,
    June 26, 2002, unless the Offer is extended.

5.  The Offer is also conditioned upon, among other things, the expiration,
    termination or satisfaction of the applicable waiting period under the
    Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended.

6.  Tendering stockholders will not be obligated by Parent or Purchaser to pay
    brokerage fees or commissions or, except as otherwise provided in
    Instruction 6 of the Letter of Transmittal, stock transfer taxes with
    respect to the sale and transfer of any Shares to Purchaser pursuant to the
    Offer. If you own Shares through a broker or other nominee, and your broker
    or nominee tenders your Shares on your behalf, your broker or nominee may
    charge a fee for doing so. You should consult your broker or nominee to
    determine whether any charges or commissions will apply.

7.  Tendering stockholders who fail to complete and sign the Substitute
    Form W-9 may be subject to a required federal backup withholding tax of 30%
    of the gross proceeds payable to such stockholder or other payee pursuant to
    the Offer.

    If you wish to have us tender any or all of your Shares, please so instruct
us by completing, executing and returning to us the instruction form contained
in this letter. An envelope in which to return your instructions to us is
enclosed. If you authorize the tender of your Shares, all such Shares will be
tendered unless otherwise specified in your instructions. YOUR INSTRUCTIONS
SHOULD BE FORWARDED TO US IN AMPLE TIME TO PERMIT US TO SUBMIT A TENDER ON YOUR
BEHALF PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE OFFER.

    The Offer is made solely by the Offer to Purchase and the related Letter of
Transmittal and is being made to all holders of Shares. Purchaser is not aware
of any state where the making of the Offer is prohibited by any administrative
or judicial action pursuant to any valid state statute. If Purchaser becomes
aware of any valid state statute prohibiting the making of the Offer or the
acceptance of Shares pursuant thereto, Purchaser will make a good faith effort
to comply with such state statute. If, after such good faith effort, Purchaser
cannot comply with such state statute, the Offer will not be made to (nor will
tenders be accepted from or on behalf of) the holders of Shares in such state.
In any jurisdiction where the securities, blue sky or other laws require the
Offer to be made by a licensed broker or dealer, the Offer shall be deemed to be
made on behalf of Purchaser by one or more registered brokers or dealers
licensed under the laws of such jurisdiction.

         This announcement is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of
an offer to sell Shares (as defined below). The Offer (as defined below) is
being made solely by the Offer to Purchase dated May 30, 2002, and the related

                          BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION

         BROADWAY ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation ("Purchaser"),
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Boston Scientific Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), is offering to purchase all the issued and
outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Common
Shares"), including the associated preferred share purchase rights, and all
of the outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value
$0.001 per share (the "Series A Shares" and together with the Common Shares,
the "Shares"), of BEI Medical Systems Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("BEI"), at a purchase price of $6.8426 per share of Common Stock and
$13.6852 per share of Preferred Stock, net to the seller in cash, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, and
in the related Letter of Transmittal (which, together with the Offer to
Purchase and any amendments or supplements thereto, collectively constitute
the "Offer"). Following the Offer, Purchaser intends to effect the Merger
described below.

         THE OFFER WILL EXPIRE AT 12:00 MIDNIGHT, NEW YORK CITY TIME, ON
WEDNESDAY, JUNE 26, 2002, UNLESS THE OFFER IS EXTENDED.

         THE OFFER IS CONDITIONED UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THERE HAVING BEEN
VALIDLY TENDERED AND NOT WITHDRAWN PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE OFFER AT
LEAST THE NUMBER OF SHARES THAT, TOGETHER WITH ANY SHARES OWNED BY BSC, IF
ANY, SHALL CONSTITUTE (a) A MAJORITY OF THE THEN OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL COMMON SHARES ISSUABLE UPON THE
CONVERSION OF THE SERIES A SHARES OR UPON THE

CONVERSION OR EXERCISE OF ANY OPTIONS, WARRANTS, RIGHTS OR OTHER CONVERTIBLE
SECURITIES), OR SUCH HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF SUCH CLASS OF SECURITIES AS MAY BE
REQUIRED TO APPROVE THE MERGER PURSUANT TO THE RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION OF BEI, AS AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME, OR APPLICABLE LAW, AND
(b) A MAJORITY OF THE OUTSTANDING SERIES A SHARES, OR SUCH HIGHER PERCENTAGE
OF SUCH CLASS OF SECURITIES AS MAY BE REQUIRED TO APPROVE THE MERGER PURSUANT
TO THE RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF BEI, AS AMENDED FROM TIME TO
TIME, OR APPLICABLE LAW, (THE "MINIMUM CONDITION"). THE OFFER IS ALSO SUBJECT
TO CERTAIN OTHER CONDITIONS DESCRIBED IN THIS OFFER TO PURCHASE. THE OFFER IS
NOT SUBJECT TO A FINANCING CONDITION. SEE SECTIONS 1 AND 14, WHICH SET FORTH
IN FULL THE CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER.

         The Offer is being made pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of May 13, 2002 (the "Merger Agreement"), among Parent, Purchaser and
BEI. The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that as promptly as
practicable after the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer and the
satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of the other conditions set forth in the
Merger Agreement, and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ("Delaware Law"), Purchaser will be
merged with and into BEI (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, BEI will
continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"), and will
become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. At the effective time of the Merger
(the "Effective Time"), each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Shares held in the treasury of BEI and other than
Shares held by holders of Shares who shall have demanded and perfected appraisal
rights under Delaware Law) shall be canceled and converted automatically into
the right to receive $6.8426 per Common Share and $13.6852 per Series A Share,
in cash, or any higher price that may be paid per Share in the Offer, without
interest. Holders of Shares who demand and fully perfect appraisal rights under
Delaware Law will be entitled to receive, in connection with the Merger, cash
for the fair value of their Shares as determined pursuant to the procedures
prescribed by Delaware Law. For more details, please see Section 11 of the Offer
to Purchase. The Merger Agreement is more fully described in Section 10 of the
Offer to Purchase. Certain federal income tax consequences of the sale of Shares
pursuant to the Offer and the Merger, as the case may be, are described in
Section 5 of the Offer to Purchase.

         THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF BEI HAS UNANIMOUSLY (i) DETERMINED THAT
THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, INCLUDING
EACH OF THE OFFER AND THE MERGER (AS DEFINED HEREIN), AND THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THE STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT (AS DEFINED HEREIN) ARE FAIR TO,
AND IN THE BEST INTEREST OF, THE HOLDERS OF THE SHARES, (ii) APPROVED,
ADOPTED AND DECLARED ADVISABLE THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, INCLUDING EACH OF THE OFFER AND THE MERGER, AND (iii)
RESOLVED TO RECOMMEND THAT THE HOLDERS OF SHARES ACCEPT THE OFFER AND TENDER
SHARES PURSUANT TO THE OFFER AND, IF APPLICABLE, VOTE THEIR SHARES IN FAVOR
OF THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

         For purposes of the Offer, Purchaser will be deemed to have accepted
for payment (and thereby purchased) Shares validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn as, if and when Purchaser gives oral or written notice to The Bank of
New York (the "Depositary"), of Purchaser's acceptance for payment of such
Shares pursuant to the Offer. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
the Offer, payment for Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer will be
made by deposit of the purchase price therefor with the Depositary, which will
act as agent for tendering holders of Shares for the purpose of receiving
payments from Purchaser and transmitting such payments to tendering holders of
Shares whose Shares have been accepted for payment. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL
INTEREST ON THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR SHARES BE PAID, REGARDLESS OF ANY DELAY IN
MAKING SUCH PAYMENT. In all cases, payment for Shares tendered and accepted for
payment pursuant to the Offer will be made only after timely receipt by the
Depositary of (i) the certificates evidencing such Shares (the "Share
Certificates") or timely confirmation of a book-entry transfer of such Shares
into the Depositary's account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility (as defined in
Section 2 of the Offer to Purchase) pursuant to the procedures set forth in
Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase, (ii) the Letter of Transmittal (or a
manually signed facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed, with
any required

signature guarantees or an Agent's Message (as defined in Section 2 of the Offer
to Purchase), in connection with the book-entry transfer, and (iii) any other
documents required under the Letter of Transmittal.

         Purchaser expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion (but
subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement), at any time and
from time to time, to extend for any reason the period of time during which the
Offer is open, including the occurrence of any condition specified in Section 14
of the Offer to Purchase, by giving oral or written notice of such extension to
the Depositary. Any such extension will be followed as promptly as practicable
by public announcement thereof, such announcement to be made no later than 9:00
a.m., New York City time, on the next business day after the previously
scheduled expiration date of the Offer. During any such extension, all Shares
previously tendered and not withdrawn will remain subject to the Offer and
subject to the right of a tendering stockholder to withdraw such stockholder's
Shares. If certain of the conditions to the Offer shall not have been satisfied,
and in Parent's sole judgment are reasonably capable of being satisfied within
30 days, Parent will, at the request of BEI, extend the Offer from time to time
unless any such condition is no longer reasonably capable of being satisfied
within such 30 day period in Parent and Purchaser's sole judgment. In no event
will Purchaser be required to extend the Offer beyond December 31, 2002.
Following satisfaction or waiver of all the conditions to the Offer and the
acceptance of and payment for all the Shares tendered during the offering
period, Purchaser may elect to provide a subsequent offering period. This would
allow Purchaser to accept additional Shares that were not tendered prior to the
expiration of the Offer. During a subsequent offering period, Shares already
tendered may not be withdrawn.

         Tenders of Shares made pursuant to the Offer are irrevocable except
that such Shares may be withdrawn at any time prior to the Expiration Date and,
unless theretofore accepted for payment and paid for by Purchaser pursuant to
the Offer, may also be withdrawn at any time after July 28, 2002. For the
withdrawal to be effective, a written notice of withdrawal must be timely
received by the Depositary at one of its addresses set forth on the back cover
page of the Offer to Purchase. Any such notice of withdrawal must specify the
name of the person who tendered the Shares to be withdrawn, the number of Shares
to be withdrawn and the name of the registered holder of such Shares, if
different from that of the person who tendered such Shares. If Share
Certificates evidencing Shares to be withdrawn have been delivered or otherwise
identified to the Depositary, then, prior to the physical release of such Share
Certificates, the serial numbers shown on such Share Certificates must be
submitted to the Depositary and the signature(s) on the notice of withdrawal
must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution (as defined in Section 3 of the
Offer to Purchase), unless such Shares have been tendered for the account of an
Eligible Institution. If Shares have been tendered pursuant to the procedure for
book-entry transfer as set forth in Section 3 of the Offer to Purchase, any
notice of withdrawal must specify the name and number of the account at the
Book-Entry Transfer Facility to be credited with the withdrawn Shares. All
questions as to the form and validity (including the time of receipt) of any
notice of withdrawal will be determined by Purchaser, in its sole discretion,
which determination will be final and binding.

         The information required to be disclosed by Rule 14d-6(d)(1) of the
General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, is contained in the Offer to Purchase and is incorporated herein by
reference.

         BEI has provided Purchaser with BEI's stockholder list and security
position listings, including the most recent list of names, addresses and
security positions of non-objecting beneficial owners in the possession of
BEI, for the purpose of disseminating the Offer to holders of Shares. The
Offer to Purchase and the related Letter of Transmittal will be mailed by
Purchaser or the Information Agent to record holders of Shares whose names
appear on BEI's stockholder list and will be furnished, for subsequent
transmittal to beneficial owners of Shares, to brokers, dealers, commercial
banks, trust companies and similar persons whose names, or the names of whose
nominees, appear on the stockholder list or, if applicable, who are listed as
participants in a clearing agency's security position listing.
