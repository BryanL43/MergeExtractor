                          QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT
                                   THE MERGER

Q:  HOW WILL THE MERGER WORK?

A:  Newfield Operating Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Newfield, will
    merge with and into EEX, making EEX a wholly owned subsidiary of Newfield.

Q:  WHY DID EEX AGREE TO THE MERGER?

A:  In reaching its decision to agree to the merger, the EEX Board of Directors
    considered the company's financial situation and future prospects. In
    particular, the EEX Board of Directors considered the following material
    factors:

        - the increased liquidity and long-term financial stability the merger
          would provide;

        - Newfield's size and financial strength would permit the realization of
          the value of EEX's exploration opportunities;

        - the attractiveness of Newfield common stock as merger consideration;

        - the opportunity for EEX's common shareholders to receive units in a
          new overriding royalty trust;

        - the fact that approximately 83% of Newfield's production after the
          merger would consist of natural gas from North America, allowing its
          stockholders greater upside potential if natural gas prices increase
          in the future;

        - the additional capital Newfield would be able to invest in additional
          exploration and development activities on EEX's onshore properties;
          and

        - the Newfield offer provided EEX's common shareholders more value than
          the other offers presented to the EEX Board of Directors.

Q:  WHY IS NEWFIELD ACQUIRING EEX IN THE MERGER?

A:  Newfield is acquiring EEX because the assets and operations of EEX are
    complementary to those of Newfield. EEX's onshore properties are located in
    Newfield's core South Texas focus area, and the merger will make Newfield
    one of the largest independent producers in this area. In addition, during
    the past year, Newfield has been seeking to establish offshore operations in
    the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico. EEX's acreage position in the Gulf of
    Mexico will help Newfield accomplish this objective.

Q:  WHAT WILL HOLDERS OF EEX COMMON STOCK RECEIVE FOR THEIR SHARES?

A:  Holders of EEX common stock will receive .05703 of a share of Newfield
    common stock in exchange for each of their shares of EEX common stock. This
    exchange ratio will not change, even if the market price of Newfield common
    stock or EEX common stock increases or decreases between now and the date
    that the merger is completed. Holders of EEX common stock have the option to
    elect to receive units in a newly formed royalty trust in lieu of all or a
    portion of the shares of Newfield common stock they would otherwise receive.
    For each trust unit that a holder of EEX common stock elects to receive, the
    number of shares of Newfield common stock that the shareholder would
    otherwise receive will be reduced by .00054.

Q:  WHAT WILL HOLDERS OF EEX PREFERRED STOCK RECEIVE FOR THEIR SHARES?

A:  Each holder of EEX Series B 8% Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock ("EEX
    preferred stock") will receive a pro rata portion, based on the holder's
    ownership of EEX preferred stock, of an

    aggregate of 4,700,000 shares of Newfield common stock. Holders of EEX
    preferred stock will not have the option to elect to receive trust units.

Q:  WHAT WILL HAPPEN AT THE SPECIAL MEETING OF EEX SHAREHOLDERS?

A:  At the EEX special meeting to be held on           , 2002, EEX shareholders
    will vote on the approval of the merger agreement. The merger will not take
    place unless, among other things, the merger agreement receives the required
    affirmative vote of the EEX shareholders.

Q:  WHAT VOTE IS REQUIRED?

A:  The transaction of business at the special meeting requires the presence in
    person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the issued and
    outstanding shares of EEX capital stock entitled to vote at the special
    meeting. Approval of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of
    the holders of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast at the special
    meeting by the holders of record of the outstanding shares of EEX common
    stock. In addition, approval of the merger agreement requires the
    affirmative vote of the holders of (a) two-thirds of the votes entitled to
    be cast at the special meeting by the holders of record of the outstanding
    shares of EEX common stock and EEX preferred stock (voting together as a
    single class) and (b) a majority of the votes entitled to be cast at the
    special meeting by the holders of record of the outstanding shares of EEX
    preferred stock. The holders of all of the outstanding shares of EEX
    preferred stock have executed a voting agreement and irrevocable proxy
    pursuant to which they have agreed, among other things, to vote their shares
    in favor of the merger agreement. Consequently, if the holders of the
    requisite number of shares of EEX common stock vote in favor of the merger
    agreement, the approval of the merger agreement is assured. Abstentions and
    broker non-votes will count in determining whether a quorum is present at
    the special meeting but will be the equivalent of a vote "AGAINST" the
    proposal to approve the merger agreement.

Q:  WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?

A:  After carefully reading this document and the accompanying annexes, mail
    your signed proxy card in the enclosed return envelope as soon as possible
    so that your shares can be voted at the special meeting of EEX shareholders.
    In addition, if you are a holder of EEX common stock, you should decide
    whether to elect to receive trust units in lieu of all or a portion of the
    shares of Newfield common stock that you will otherwise receive.

Q:  WHAT DO THE TRUST UNITS REPRESENT?

A:  The trust units represent beneficial ownership interests in a newly formed
    royalty trust. The trust will own non-expense bearing overriding royalty
    interests in any future production that may be achieved from intervals at
    depths typically below 18,000 to 21,000 feet from EEX's Treasure Island
    project. The Treasure Island project is an exploration concept covering 116
    Gulf of Mexico lease blocks located on the federal Outer Continental Shelf
    in which EEX currently holds 27 leases and may acquire additional leases in
    the future. There is no production, and there are no proved reserves,
    currently associated with the royalty interests. More detailed descriptions
    of the trust, the overriding royalty interests, the offshore lease blocks,
    the trust units and the risks associated with an election to invest in trust
    units appear later in this proxy statement/prospectus.

Q:  HOW DOES THE TRUST UNIT ELECTION WORK?

A:  If you are holder of EEX common stock, you may elect to receive anywhere
    from no trust units to a maximum number of trust units equal to 105.611
    multiplied by the number of shares of EEX common stock that you own, rounded
    down to the nearest whole trust unit. However, if all of the electing
    shareholders elect to receive more than 42,574,298 trust units (which is the
    total number of trust units available in the merger), then you will be
    allocated trust units in the following manner.

    First, you will be allocated a number of trust units equal to the lesser of
    the number of shares of EEX common stock that you own and the number of
    trust units that you elected to receive. Second, if you elected to receive a
    number of trust units greater than the number of shares of EEX common stock
    that you own, you will be allocated a pro rata portion of the trust units
    remaining after the initial allocation, if any. For each trust unit that you
    elect to receive, the number of shares of Newfield common stock that you
    would otherwise receive will be reduced by .00054.

Q:  HOW DO I ELECT TO RECEIVE TRUST UNITS?

A:  If you are a holder of EEX common stock, fill out and mail the enclosed
    election form and your EEX stock certificates or an appropriate guarantee of
    delivery (as described in the election form) to Newfield's exchange agent.
    We have enclosed a separate envelope for this purpose. To be effective, your
    election form and any other documents required by the form must be received
    by Newfield's exchange agent no later than           , 2002. If you do not
    want to elect to receive trust units, do not complete an election form. If
    your shares are held in "street name" through your broker, your broker will
    mail an election form to you under separate cover, together with a letter of
    instructions for making an election to receive trust units. Holders of EEX
    common stock who fail to fill out and return the enclosed election form will
    be deemed to have elected to receive no trust units and will therefore
    receive only shares of Newfield common stock (and cash in lieu of fractional
    shares) in exchange for their shares of EEX common stock.

Q:  WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON'T MAKE OR DON'T WANT TO MAKE AN ELECTION?

A:  To receive trust units in lieu of all or a portion of the Newfield common
    stock that you would otherwise receive for your EEX common stock, you must
    make an election. If you do not want to receive trust units, do not complete
    an election form. If Newfield's exchange agent has not received a completed
    election form and any other documents required by the form from you by
              , 2002, you will receive only shares of Newfield common stock (and
    cash in lieu of fractional shares) in exchange for your shares of EEX common
    stock.

Q:  IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY MY BROKER, WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY
SHARES FOR ME?

A:  Your broker will not be able to vote your shares without instructions from
    you. You should instruct your broker to vote your shares, following the
    directions provided by your broker.

Q:  CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I HAVE MAILED MY SIGNED PROXY CARD?

A:  Yes. You can change your vote at any time before your proxy card is voted at
    the EEX special meeting. You can do this in one of three ways. First, you
    can send a written notice stating that you would like to revoke your proxy.
    Second, you can complete and submit a new proxy card. Third, you can attend
    the EEX special meeting and vote in person. Your attendance alone will not,
    however, revoke your proxy. If you have instructed a broker to vote your
    shares, you must follow directions provided by your broker to change those
    instructions.

Q:  CAN I CHANGE MY TRUST UNITS ELECTION AFTER I HAVE MAILED MY ELECTION FORM?

A:  Yes. You can change your election by sending a written notice to Newfield's
    exchange agent prior to the election deadline stating that you would like to
    revoke or change your election, as described more fully in the election
    form.

Q:  SHOULD I SEND IN MY STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW?

A:  If you do not elect to receive trust units, please do not send in your stock
    certificates until after the merger is completed. At that time, you will
    receive written instructions for exchanging your EEX stock certificates for
    Newfield stock certificates and cash for any fractional shares. If you elect
    to

    receive trust units, you must send in with your election form your EEX stock
    certificates or an appropriate guarantee of delivery as described in the
    election form.

Q:  WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO OUTSTANDING SHARES OF EEX RESTRICTED STOCK AND OPTIONS
    AND WARRANTS TO PURCHASE EEX COMMON STOCK?

A:  All restrictions on unvested shares of EEX restricted stock will terminate
    immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. In connection with
    the execution of the merger agreement, all outstanding stock options granted
    under any EEX stock option plan became fully vested and exercisable. All
    unexercised options will terminate at the effective time of the merger and
    the holders of the options will receive, with respect to each share of EEX
    common stock underlying such unexercised options, a cash payment equal to
    the amount, if any, by which the closing price of Newfield common stock on
    the last trading day before the effective date of the merger multiplied by
    the exchange ratio of .05703 exceeds the exercise price for such share.
    Because the per share exercise price for each outstanding option is, in most
    cases, significantly in excess of both the current trading price of EEX's
    common stock and the current market value of the per share merger
    consideration (based on the current trading price of Newfield's common
    stock), we do not expect any holders of outstanding options to exercise
    their options or to be entitled to any payment upon termination of their
    options at the effective time of the merger. Pursuant to a voting agreement
    and irrevocable proxy executed by the holders of all of the outstanding
    shares of EEX preferred stock, at the effective time of the merger, Newfield
    will purchase from such holders all outstanding warrants to purchase shares
    of EEX common stock.

Q:  WHAT ARE THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO SHAREHOLDERS?

A:  Your exchange of shares of EEX capital stock for shares of Newfield common
    stock in the merger will be tax-free for federal income tax purposes. You
    will, however, have to pay taxes with respect to any trust units you elect
    to receive and any cash you receive for fractional shares. Your tax basis in
    the shares of Newfield common stock that you will receive in the merger will
    equal your current tax basis in your EEX common stock (reduced by any amount
    attributable to trust units you elect to receive and to a fractional share
    interest for which cash is received).

Q:  ARE ANY REGULATORY APPROVALS NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE MERGER?

A:  Newfield is in the process of determining whether it is required to make a
    pre-merger notification filing with the Federal Trade Commission under the
    Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. If a filing is required, the
    merger cannot be completed until the expiration or early termination of the
    waiting period required by that act.

Q:  WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE COMPLETED?

A:  Subject to EEX shareholder and regulatory approvals, we expect to complete
    the merger promptly following the EEX special meeting of shareholders.

Q:  WILL I BE ABLE TO TRADE THE NEWFIELD COMMON STOCK THAT I RECEIVE IN THE
MERGER?

A:  Yes. Except for Newfield common stock to be received by certain affiliates
    of EEX, the Newfield common stock received in the merger will be freely
    tradable.

Q:  WILL EEX SHAREHOLDERS BE ABLE TO TRADE THE TRUST UNITS THAT THEY RECEIVE IN
THE MERGER?

A:  The trust units will not be listed or quoted on any national securities
    exchange or market, and there will be no public trading market for the trust
    units. There can be no assurance that a market will develop for the trust
    units or that you will be able to sell your trust units.

Q:  AM I ENTITLED TO DISSENTERS' OR APPRAISAL RIGHTS?

A:  No. Holders of EEX stock are not entitled to dissenters' or appraisal rights
    in connection with the merger.

Q:  ARE THERE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MERGER THAT I SHOULD CONSIDER IN
DECIDING HOW TO VOTE?

A:  Yes. You should carefully read the description of the risks associated with
    the merger and with investing in Newfield common stock and trust units
    beginning on page   .

Q:  WHERE CAN I FIND MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANIES?

A:  Both Newfield and EEX file periodic reports and other information with the
    SEC. You may read and copy this information at the SEC's public reference
    facility. Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for information about this
    facility. This information is also available at the Internet site maintained

THE COMPANIES

    NEWFIELD EXPLORATION COMPANY
    363 N. Sam Houston Pkwy. E., Suite 2020
    Houston, Texas 77060
    (281) 847-6000

     Newfield is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration,
development and acquisition of crude oil and natural gas properties. Newfield
was founded in 1989 and acquired its first oil and gas reserves in 1990. Since
that time, Newfield has grown rapidly. Newfield has a solid asset base of
producing properties and exploration and development drilling opportunities in
the Gulf of Mexico, and, over the last several years, Newfield has expanded its
areas of operation to include the U.S. onshore Gulf Coast, the Anadarko Basin of
Oklahoma, Offshore Australia and China's Bohai Bay.

    EEX CORPORATION
    2500 CityWest Boulevard, Suite 1400
    Houston, Texas 77042
    (713) 243-3100

     EEX and its predecessors have been engaged in the exploration for and the
development, production and sale of natural gas and crude oil since 1918.
Currently, EEX's primary activities are concentrated in Texas, Louisiana and the
Gulf of Mexico.

    TREASURE ISLAND ROYALTY TRUST (PAGE 80)
    c/o Newfield Exploration Company
    363 N. Sam Houston Pkwy. E., Suite 2020
    Houston, Texas 77060
    (281) 847-6000

     Treasure Island Royalty Trust is an express trust created under the laws of
the state of Texas pursuant to a trust agreement entered into on June 17, 2002
between Newfield, as grantor, and certain individuals, as trustees. The trust
was created by Newfield to hold certain non-expense bearing overriding royalty
interests in any future production that may be achieved from stratigraphic
intervals at depths typically below 18,000 to 21,000 feet from EEX's Treasure
Island project. The Treasure Island project is an exploration concept covering
116 Gulf of Mexico lease blocks located on the federal Outer Continental Shelf
in which EEX currently holds 27 leases and may acquire additional leases in the
future. There is no production, and there are no proved reserves, currently
associated with the royalty interests.

THE MERGER

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, Newfield Operating Company, a wholly
owned subsidiary of Newfield, will be merged with and into EEX. EEX will be the
surviving entity in the merger and will, as a result of the merger, become a
wholly owned subsidiary of Newfield.

EEX'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER (PAGE 49)

     In reaching its decision to agree to the merger, the EEX Board of Directors
considered the company's financial situation and future prospects. In
particular, the EEX Board of Directors considered the following material
factors:

     - INCREASED LIQUIDITY AND LONG-TERM FINANCIAL STABILITY.  EEX's default
       under its old credit agreement and liquidity issues (in particular, the
       limited available credit under its new credit facility and EEX's
       potential inability to meet payment obligations on its senior notes in
       early 2003) would require EEX to raise additional equity and successfully
       place a high-yield debt offering in order to meet its financing needs. A
       merger with Newfield would remove the risk that necessary financing could
       not be obtained.

     - INCREASED FINANCIAL STRENGTH TO EXPLOIT ASSETS.  EEX could not fully
       realize the value of its exploration opportunities, particularly its
       deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets and the Treasure Island acreage position,
       absent a merger with an entity of sufficient size and a strong balance
       sheet.

     - RECEIPT OF AN ATTRACTIVE CURRENCY.  The merger would provide EEX common
       shareholders, if they so choose, with an attractive currency in Newfield
       common stock.

     - SIGNIFICANT NON-COST BEARING EXPOSURE TO THE TREASURE ISLAND
       PROJECT.  The merger would give EEX's common shareholders the option to
       elect to receive units in a new royalty trust formed to hold overriding
       royalty interests in EEX's Treasure Island acreage position in lieu of
       Newfield common stock.

     - GREATER EXPOSURE TO ATTRACTIVE NORTH AMERICA NATURAL GAS
       FUNDAMENTALS.  Upon completion of the merger, approximately 83% of
       Newfield's production would consist of natural gas from North America,
       allowing its stockholders greater upside potential if natural gas prices
       increase in the future.

     - ADDITIONAL CAPITAL.  Newfield's strong balance sheet would enable it to
       invest capital to fund additional exploration and development activities
       on EEX's onshore properties.

     - FAVORABLE TERMS COMPARED TO OTHER PROPOSALS.  The terms of the Newfield
       merger provided EEX's common shareholders more value than the other
       offers presented to the EEX Board of Directors. Other offers were subject
       to financing contingencies and were generally from companies which were
       smaller than Newfield and thus less capable of addressing EEX's liquidity
       issues. The EEX Board of Directors chose a merger transaction with
       Newfield as opposed to a recapitalization of EEX because of the execution
       risks associated with completing a multi-step recapitalization subject to
       market risks.

NEWFIELD'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER (PAGE 49)

     Newfield is acquiring EEX because the assets and operations of EEX are
complementary to those of Newfield. EEX's onshore properties are located in
Newfield's core South Texas focus area, and the merger will make Newfield one of
the largest independent producers in this area. In addition, during the past
year, Newfield has been seeking to establish its offshore operations in the
deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico. EEX's acreage position in the Gulf of Mexico
will help Newfield accomplish this objective.

THE EEX SPECIAL MEETING (PAGE 31)

     A special meeting of the shareholders of EEX will be held on           ,
2002, at the offices of EEX at 2500 CityWest Boulevard, Houston, Texas at   :00
a.m. local time. At the meeting, EEX shareholders will be asked to approve the
merger agreement.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE EEX BOARD OF DIRECTORS (PAGE 49)

     The Board of Directors of EEX has adopted the merger agreement and approved
the merger by the unanimous vote of its members who were present at its May 29,
2002 meeting, during which the merger agreement and the merger were considered
and voted upon. The EEX Board of Directors believes that the merger, the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are in the best interest of
EEX and its shareholders and recommends that you vote "FOR" approval of the
merger agreement.

RECORD DATE AND OUTSTANDING SHARES (PAGE 31)

     You are entitled to vote at the EEX special meeting if you owned shares of
EEX common stock or shares of EEX Series B 8% Cumulative Perpetual Preferred
Stock ("EEX preferred stock") at the close of business on           , 2002, the
record date for the meeting. There are        shares of EEX common stock
entitled to be voted at the special meeting, each of which will have one vote
for each of the matters to be considered at the special meeting. There are
       shares of EEX preferred stock entitled to be voted at the special
meeting, which will have an aggregate of 8,000,000 votes for each of the matters
to be considered at the special meeting.

VOTE REQUIRED (PAGE 31)

     The transaction of business at the special meeting requires the presence in
person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding
shares of EEX capital stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. Approval of
the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote by the holders of two-thirds
of the votes entitled to be cast at the special meeting by the holders of record
of the outstanding shares of EEX common stock. In addition, approval of the
merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of (a) two-thirds
of the votes entitled to be cast at the special meeting by the holders of record
of the outstanding shares of EEX common stock and EEX preferred stock (voting
together as a single class) and (b) a majority of the votes entitled to be cast
at the special meeting by the holders of record of the outstanding shares of EEX
preferred stock. The holders of all of the outstanding shares of EEX preferred
stock have executed a voting agreement and irrevocable proxy pursuant to which
they have agreed, among other things, to vote their shares in favor of the
merger agreement. Consequently, if the holders of the requisite number of shares
of EEX common stock vote in favor of the merger agreement, the approval of the
merger agreement is assured.

     Abstentions and broker non-votes will count in determining whether a quorum
is present at the special meeting but will be the equivalent of a vote "AGAINST"
the proposal to approve the merger agreement.

VOTING AGREEMENT AND IRREVOCABLE PROXY (PAGE 78)

     All of the holders of EEX preferred stock and certain executive officers of
EEX who own shares of EEX common stock have entered into a voting agreement and
irrevocable proxy pursuant to which they have agreed, among other things, to
vote their shares in favor of the merger agreement and against any other
proposal by a third party seeking to acquire EEX and against any action which
could reasonably be expected to interfere with, delay, impede, postpone or
materially affect the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

SHARE OWNERSHIP OF MANAGEMENT

     As of the record date for the EEX special meeting, the directors and
executive officers of EEX owned approximately 2.0% of the issued and outstanding
shares of EEX common stock and none of the shares of EEX preferred stock
entitled to vote at the EEX special meeting. Each of them has advised EEX that
he plans to vote all such shares in favor of the merger agreement. Thomas M
Hamilton, Chairman and President, Chief Executive Officer and a director of EEX,
David R. Henderson, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of EEX,
and Richard S. Langdon, Executive Vice President, Finance and Administration and
Chief Financial Officer of EEX, have entered into a voting agreement and
irrevocable

proxy pursuant to which they have agreed to vote their shares of EEX common
stock in favor of the merger agreement.

     In addition, Howard H. Newman, a director of both EEX and Newfield, is a
general partner of Warburg, Pincus & Co., the sole general partner of four
private equity funds that together hold all of the EEX preferred stock. Warburg,
Pincus & Co. and its affiliates are collectively referred to in this proxy
statement/prospectus as "Warburg."

OPINIONS OF FINANCIAL ADVISORS TO EEX (PAGE 51)

     In deciding to approve the merger, one of the factors that the EEX Board of
Directors considered was the opinions of its financial advisors, Morgan Stanley
& Co. Incorporated and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., that, as of May 29, 2002,
subject to and based on certain considerations set forth in such opinions, the
aggregate consideration to be received by the holders, as a group, of EEX common
stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view,
to such holders. The full text of the opinions of Morgan Stanley & Co.
Incorporated and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. describes the basis on which they
rendered their opinions. The opinions are attached as Annexes C and D to this
proxy statement/ prospectus. YOU ARE URGED TO READ THE ENTIRE OPINIONS
CAREFULLY.

WHAT HOLDERS OF EEX COMMON STOCK WILL RECEIVE IN THE MERGER (PAGE 66)

     In the merger, holders of EEX common stock will receive .05703 of a share
of Newfield common stock in exchange for each share of EEX common stock they
own. This exchange ratio will not change, even if the market price of Newfield
common stock or EEX common stock increases or decreases between now and the date
that the merger is completed. No fractional shares will be issued. As a result,
the total number of shares of Newfield common stock to be received by EEX
shareholders will be rounded down to the nearest whole number and such holders
will receive a cash payment for the value of the remaining fraction of a share
that they would otherwise receive. Holders of EEX common stock will have the
option to elect to receive units in a newly formed royalty trust in lieu of all
or a portion of the shares of Newfield common stock they would otherwise
receive. For each trust unit in the Treasure Island Royalty Trust that a holder
of EEX common stock elects to receive, the number of shares of Newfield common
stock that the shareholder would otherwise receive will be reduced by .00054.

WHAT HOLDERS OF EEX PREFERRED STOCK WILL RECEIVE IN THE MERGER (PAGE 66)

     In the merger, each holder of EEX preferred stock will receive a pro rata
portion of an aggregate of 4,700,000 shares of Newfield common stock, to be
allocated according to the shareholder's ownership of EEX preferred stock.
Holders of EEX preferred stock will not have the option to elect to receive
trust units.

ELECTION OF TRUST UNITS (PAGE 68)

     Holders of EEX common stock may elect to receive trust units by filling out
and mailing the enclosed election form and their EEX stock certificates or an
appropriate guarantee of delivery (as described in the election form) to
Newfield's exchange agent. To be effective, election forms and any other
documents required by the form must be received by Newfield's exchange agent no
later than           , 2002. Holders who do not want to receive trust units in
the merger should not complete an election form. Holders of EEX common stock
whose shares are held in "street name" through a broker will receive an election
form under separate cover, together with a letter of instructions for making an
election to receive trust units, from the broker. Holders of EEX common stock
who fail to fill out and return the enclosed election form will be deemed to
have elected to receive no trust units and will therefore receive only shares of
Newfield common stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares) in exchange for
their shares of EEX common stock. The holders of EEX common stock may elect to
receive anywhere from no trust units to a maximum number of trust units equal to
105.611 multiplied by the number of shares of EEX common stock that they own,
rounded down to the nearest whole trust unit.

ALLOCATION OF TRUST UNITS (PAGE 68)

     If the holders of EEX common stock elect to receive in the aggregate no
more than 42,574,298 trust units (which is the maximum number of trust units
available in the merger), then each electing shareholder will be allocated the
full number of trust units elected to be received by such electing shareholder.
If the holders of EEX common stock elect to receive in the aggregate more than
42,574,298 trust units, then each electing holder will be allocated trust units
in the following manner. First, each holder of EEX common stock who elects to
receive trust units will be allocated a number of trust units equal to the
lesser of the number of shares of EEX common stock such holder owns and the
number of trust units such holder elected to receive. Second, each holder of EEX
common stock who elected to receive a number of trust units greater than the
number of shares of common stock that such holder owns will be allocated a pro
rata portion of the trust units remaining after this initial allocation, if any.

OWNERSHIP OF NEWFIELD FOLLOWING THE MERGER (PAGE 42)

     Approximately 7.1 million shares of Newfield common stock will be issued to
EEX shareholders in the merger. Such shares will constitute approximately 12.4%
of the outstanding shares of Newfield common stock (on a fully diluted basis)
after the merger.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT FOLLOWING THE MERGER (PAGES 62 AND 66)

     None of the directors of EEX will continue as a director of EEX or be
appointed as a director of Newfield following the merger. Howard H. Newman, who
is a director of both EEX and Newfield, will continue as a director of Newfield
following the merger. Newfield does not expect to retain any of the executive
officers of EEX as executive officers of EEX or Newfield following the merger.
However, Newfield may retain certain officers of EEX or other EEX personnel as
employees of EEX or Newfield following the merger.

OTHER INTERESTS OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE MERGER (PAGE 61)

     Some of EEX's officers and directors have interests in the merger that
differ from, or are in addition to, your interests as a shareholder of EEX.
Certain officers and directors of EEX hold stock options and restricted shares
that will become fully vested and exercisable as a result of the merger, and
some officers have employment contracts, change of control agreements or similar
arrangements with EEX that, among other things, provide for certain payments and
other benefits in the event their employment is terminated in connection with a
change in control of EEX. Certain executive officers of EEX will receive
severance payments in connection with their termination from EEX following the
consummation of the merger in accordance with change in control agreements and
other plans and arrangements for the benefit of such executive officers. In
addition, Howard H. Newman, a director of both EEX and Newfield, is a general
partner of Warburg, Pincus & Co., the sole general partner of four private
equity funds that together hold all of the EEX preferred stock. Warburg, Pincus
& Co. is also the sole general partner of another private equity fund that owns
less than 5% of Newfield's common stock. EEX's Board of Directors was aware of
these interests and considered them in approving the merger agreement and the
merger. Mr. Newman recused himself from the May 29, 2002 meeting of the EEX
Board of Directors, at which the merger agreement and the merger were considered
and approved, and certain other meetings of the EEX Board of Directors at which
the merger was discussed. In addition, Mr. Newman recused himself from all
meetings of the Newfield Board of Directors at which the merger was discussed.
See "The Merger -- Background of the Merger."

CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER (PAGE 68)

     Newfield and EEX will not complete the merger unless a number of conditions
are satisfied or, if permitted, waived by them. These include:

     - the approval and adoption of the merger agreement by the shareholders of
       EEX;

     - the absence of any law, regulation or order making the merger illegal or
       prohibiting the merger;

     - the receipt of necessary approvals from U.S. and foreign governmental
       authorities;

     - the receipt of opinions of counsel to EEX and Newfield regarding the tax
       effects of the merger; and

     - other customary closing conditions.

GOVERNMENTAL AND REGULATORY APPROVALS (PAGE 65)

     Newfield is in the process of determining whether it is required to make a
pre-merger notification filing with the Federal Trade Commission under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. If a filing is required, the
merger cannot be completed until the expiration or early termination of the
waiting period required by that act.

NO SOLICITATION (PAGE 72)

     EEX has agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to, and not to authorize
its directors, officers, employees and representatives to, initiate or engage in
any discussions with another party regarding a business combination with such
other party while the merger is pending.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT (PAGE 74)

     Newfield and EEX mutually can agree to terminate the merger agreement at
any time, whether before or after the receipt of shareholder approval, without
completing the merger. Either company can terminate the merger agreement if:

     - the merger is not completed before November 30, 2002, unless the
       incompletion of the merger is due to that company's failure to perform
       its obligations under the merger agreement;

     - a governmental authority prohibits the merger;

     - the shareholders of EEX do not approve the merger agreement and the
       merger; or

     - the other party materially breaches or fails to comply with any of its
       representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in the
       merger agreement.

     Newfield may terminate the merger agreement if the Board of Directors of
EEX withdraws or modifies its recommendation of the merger to the shareholders
of EEX or approves an acquisition proposal by a third party relating to EEX. EEX
may terminate the merger agreement if the Board of Directors of EEX receives a
superior acquisition proposal from a third party relating to EEX and the EEX
Board of Directors has determined, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that termination of the merger agreement is necessary for it to comply
with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

TERMINATION FEE (PAGE 75)

     If the merger agreement is terminated, EEX will be required to pay a
termination fee of $13.5 million to Newfield in certain circumstances.

CERTAIN MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES (PAGE 90)

     The merger has been structured so that none of Newfield, EEX, Newfield
stockholders or EEX shareholders will recognize any gain or loss for federal
income tax purposes in connection with the merger (except for gain recognized
with respect to any trust units elected to be received by EEX common

shareholders and cash received in lieu of fractional shares of Newfield common
stock by EEX shareholders). Completion of the merger is conditioned upon the
receipt of legal opinions to that effect.

     TAX MATTERS CAN BE COMPLICATED, AND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO
YOU WILL DEPEND ON THE FACTS OF YOUR OWN SITUATION. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR OWN
TAX ADVISORS TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO YOU,
INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN
INCOME AND OTHER TAX LAWS IN YOUR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT (PAGE 64)

     The merger will be treated as a purchase under generally accepted
accounting principles.

NO DISSENTERS' OR APPRAISAL RIGHTS (PAGE 65)

     EEX shareholders are not entitled to any dissenters' or appraisal rights in
connection with the merger under the Texas Business Corporation Act.

COMPARATIVE RIGHTS OF NEWFIELD STOCKHOLDERS AND EEX SHAREHOLDERS (PAGE 94)

     In the merger, EEX shareholders will receive shares of Newfield common
stock and become Newfield stockholders. Upon completion of the merger, your
rights as stockholders of Newfield will be governed by Delaware law and
Newfield's certificate of incorporation and bylaws. There are various
differences between the rights of EEX shareholders and the rights of Newfield
stockholders under EEX's and Newfield's respective charter provisions and bylaws
and under Texas and Delaware law.

proposed merger, the closing per share sales prices of Newfield common stock and
EEX common stock, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, were $36.55 and
$1.90, respectively. On           , 2002, the last trading day before the date

common stock.

     Newfield has not paid any cash dividends in the past on its common stock
and does not intend to pay cash dividends in the future. Any future cash
dividends to holders of Newfield common stock would depend on future earnings,
capital requirements, Newfield's financial condition and other factors
determined by Newfield's Board of Directors. In addition, Newfield's credit
facility contains restrictions on its ability to pay cash dividends.

     EEX did not declare any dividends on its common stock in 2001 or 2000. The
merger agreement prohibits EEX from declaring or paying any dividends on shares
of EEX common stock or EEX preferred stock, except for cumulative dividends on
EEX preferred stock and intercompany dividends from direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiaries. If the merger is not consummated, the declaration and
payment of any future dividends on EEX common stock will be at the discretion of
the Board of Directors of EEX and will depend upon, among other things, future
earnings of EEX, its general financial condition, the success of its business
activities, its capital requirements and general business conditions. In
addition, EEX's new credit facility prohibits the payment of dividends on its
common stock.

(1) General and administrative expense includes non-cash stock compensation
    charges of $2,751, $3,047, $1,999, $2,222 and $1,177 for 2001, 2000, 1999,
    1998 and 1997, respectively, and $578 and $595 for the three month periods
    ended March 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

(2) Newfield adopted SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, "Revenue
    Recognition in Financial Statements," effective January 1, 2000. The
    adoption of SAB No. 101 requires Newfield to report crude oil inventory
    associated with its Australian offshore operations at the lower of cost or
    market, which was a change from its historical policy of recording such
    inventory at market value on the balance sheet date, net of estimated costs
    to sell. The cumulative effect of the change from the acquisition date of
    Newfield's Australian operations in July 1999 through December 31, 1999 is a
    reduction in net income of $2.36 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, and is
    shown as the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on the
    consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2000. The
    pro forma effect had SAB No. 101 been applied retroactively to 1999 would
    have reduced net income by $2.36 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. SAB
    No. 101 would not have effected periods prior to the acquisition of
    Newfield's Australian operations in July 1999.

(3) Newfield adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133,
    "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" on January 1,
    2001. SFAS No. 133 requires Newfield to record all derivative instruments as
    either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those
    instruments at fair value. For all periods prior to January 1, 2001,
    Newfield accounted for commodity price hedging instruments in accordance
    with SFAS No. 80. The cumulative effective of the adoption is a reduction in
    net income of $4.8 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, and is shown as the
    cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on the consolidated
    statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2001 and the three
    months ended March 31, 2001.

(1) The per share amounts for periods prior to 1998 have been restated to
    reflect the reduction in weighted average shares outstanding due to the
    one-for-three reverse stock split effective on December 8, 1998.

(2) Represents borrowings under EEX's old credit facility which would have
    matured in June 2002. EEX entered into a new credit facility on May 29,
    2002.

(3) Newfield's estimates of EEX's proved reserves at December 31, 2001 are set
    forth in the unaudited pro forma combined supplementary oil and gas
    disclosures appearing later in this proxy statement/prospectus. Newfield's
    estimates differ from those of EEX as set forth above. Such pro forma
    disclosures also reflect the disposition of EEX's international operations
    in the second quarter of 2002. EEX disagrees with Newfield's estimates of
    EEX's proved reserves and believes that no adjustment is required with
    respect to its reported estimates of such reserves at December 31, 2001. EEX
    has received confirmation from their independent petroleum engineers, as of
    a recent date, that a reexamination of the basis and documentation used to
    prepare such estimates revealed no information that would cause EEX or its
    independent petroleum engineers to materially revise such estimates.

(4) Oil and gas properties and other, net as of March 31, 2002 are shown net of
    assets held for sale.

SUMMARY UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     The following summary unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial
information combines the historical consolidated balance sheets and income
statements of Newfield and EEX and gives effect to the merger using the purchase
method of accounting. The following information is provided to assist you in
your analysis of the financial aspects of the merger.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information is based
on the following assumptions and adjustments:

     - EEX's income statement for the year ended December 31, 2001 has been
       adjusted to reflect the disposition and discontinuance of its
       international operations, as if these transactions had occurred on
       January 1, 2001;

     - the income statement data assume the merger was effective on January 1,
       2001;

     - the balance sheet data assume that the merger was effective on March 31,
       2002;

     - the balance sheet data does not reflect Newfield's anticipated
       refinancing of the EEX debt assumed; and

     - the historical financial statements of EEX have been adjusted to conform
       to the accounting policies of Newfield.

     The historical income statement information for the year ended December 31,
2001 is derived from the audited financial statements of EEX and Newfield. The
historical income statement information for the three-month period ended March
31, 2002 and the historical balance sheet information as of March 31, 2002 are
derived from the unaudited financial statements of EEX and Newfield. EEX has
provided all the historical information set forth herein regarding EEX and its
subsidiaries, and Newfield has provided all the historical information set forth
herein regarding Newfield and its subsidiaries and the assumptions and
adjustments for the pro forma information. Neither EEX nor Newfield assumes any
responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the information provided by
the other party.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information is
presented for illustrative purposes only. The financial results may have been
different had the companies always been combined. You should not rely on the
unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information as being indicative
of the historical results that would have been achieved had the companies always
been combined or the future results that Newfield will experience. Further, the
unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information does not reflect
the effect of restructuring charges that will be incurred to fully integrate and
operate the combined organization more efficiently or anticipated synergies
resulting from the merger. The restructuring activities to integrate the
companies may result in head count reduction, asset rationalization and other
activities. Because the plans for these activities have not yet been finalized,
Newfield is not able to reasonably quantify the cost for such activities.

     The following information should be read together with "Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Condensed Financial Information" and the historical financial
statements and related notes of EEX and Newfield incorporated by reference into
this proxy statement/prospectus. See "Where You Can Find More Information."

                                  RISK FACTORS

     In addition to the other information included and incorporated by reference
in this proxy statement/ prospectus, you should consider carefully the matters
described below in determining whether to approve the merger agreement.

RISKS RELATING TO THE MERGER

     NEWFIELD MAY FACE DIFFICULTIES IN INTEGRATING EEX'S BUSINESS INTO ITS
BUSINESS.  Newfield and EEX entered into the merger agreement with the
expectation that their combined operations will make Newfield one of the largest
independent natural gas producers in the South Texas area and help Newfield to
establish a significant position in the deepwater areas of the Gulf of Mexico.
In integrating EEX's business into Newfield's, however, Newfield may encounter
difficulties that could adversely affect its financial position, such as
difficulties in combining operations, retention and integration of key
management personnel and other important employees of EEX, the potential
disruption of operations and the incurrence of substantial transaction costs and
other expenses to accomplish the merger. Neither Newfield nor EEX can assure you
that the integration of EEX's business will be accomplished in an efficient and
effective manner, if at all.

     THE CONSIDERATION TO BE PAID FOR EEX COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER IS A FIXED
NUMBER OF SHARES OF NEWFIELD COMMON STOCK (OR, IF YOU SO ELECT, TRUST UNITS) AND
WILL NOT BE ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN THE STOCK PRICE OF EITHER NEWFIELD OR
EEX.  Under the merger agreement, each share of EEX common stock will be
converted into .05703 of one share of Newfield common stock (or, if you so
elect, into trust units or into trust units and Newfield common stock). This
exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted if there is any increase or
decrease in the price of Newfield common stock or EEX common stock. The prices
of Newfield common stock and EEX common stock at the closing of the merger may
vary from their respective prices on the date of this proxy statement/prospectus
and on the date of the EEX special meeting. These prices may vary because of
changes in Newfield's business, operations, or prospects or those of EEX, market
assessments of the likelihood that the merger will be completed, the timing of
the completion of the merger, the prospects of post-merger operations,
regulatory considerations, general market and economic conditions and other
factors. Although Newfield expects the merger to be completed in the third
quarter of 2002, it may be completed on a later date. Neither Newfield nor EEX
has a right to terminate the merger agreement solely because of adverse changes
in the oil and gas industry prior to the effective date of the merger.

     NEWFIELD WILL INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES IN CONNECTION WITH THE
MERGER.  Newfield expects to incur approximately $25 million of expenses related
to the merger. These expenses will include severance and related payments to be
made to certain executive officers of EEX upon completion of the merger,
investment banking expenses, legal and accounting fees, printing expenses, third
party engineering expenses, transition and integration costs and other related
charges. Newfield may also incur additional unanticipated expenses in connection
with the merger.

     SOME OF EEX'S DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS HAVE INTERESTS IN THE MERGER
THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM YOUR INTERESTS.  Some of the directors and executive
officers of EEX are parties to agreements, or participate in other arrangements,
that entitle them to severance and related payments upon their termination
following the completion of the merger. For a discussion of these arrangements,
see "The Merger -- Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger." You should
consider these interests in connection with your vote on the merger agreement,
including whether these interests may have influenced those directors and
executive officers to recommend or support the merger agreement.

RISKS RELATING TO NEWFIELD'S BUSINESS, STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS

     OIL AND GAS PRICES FLUCTUATE WIDELY, AND LOW PRICES FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD
OF TIME ARE LIKELY TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON NEWFIELD'S
BUSINESS.  Newfield's revenues, profitability and future growth depend
substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas. Historically, prices for oil
and gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the
future. These prices also affect the amount of cash

flow available for capital expenditures and Newfield's ability to borrow and
raise additional capital. The amount Newfield can borrow under its credit
facility is subject to periodic redeterminations based in part on changing
expectations of future prices. Lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil
and gas that Newfield can economically produce.

     Prices for oil and gas fluctuate widely. Among the factors that can cause
fluctuations are:

     - the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas;

     - the price and availability of alternative fuels;

     - weather conditions;

     - the level of consumer demand;

     - the price of foreign imports;

     - worldwide economic conditions;

     - political conditions in oil and gas producing regions; and

     - domestic and foreign governmental regulations.

     NEWFIELD'S USE OF OIL AND GAS PRICE HEDGING CONTRACTS INVOLVES CREDIT RISK
AND MAY LIMIT FUTURE REVENUES FROM PRICE INCREASES AND RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT
FLUCTUATIONS IN NEWFIELD'S NET INCOME AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY. Newfield uses
hedging transactions with respect to a portion of its oil and gas production to
achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce its exposure to price
fluctuations. While the use of hedging transactions limits the down-side risk of
price declines, their use may also limit future revenues from price increases.
Hedging transactions also involve the risk that the counterparty may be unable
to satisfy its obligations.

     Newfield adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133
on January 1, 2001. SFAS No. 133 generally requires it to record each hedging
transaction as an asset or liability measured at its fair value. Each quarter
Newfield must record changes in the value of its hedges, which could result in
significant fluctuations in net income and stockholders' equity from period to
period. Please read Newfield's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2001 and quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed for the quarter ended
March 31, 2002 for a more detailed discussion of Newfield's hedging program.

     NEWFIELD'S FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS ON ITS ABILITY TO REPLACE THE RESERVES
THAT IT PRODUCES.  Newfield's future success depends on its ability to find,
develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable. As
is generally the case, Newfield's producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico and
the onshore Gulf Coast often have high initial production rates, followed by
steep declines. As a result, Newfield must locate and develop or acquire new oil
and gas reserves to replace those depleted by production. Newfield must do this
even during periods of low oil and gas prices when it may be difficult to raise
the capital necessary to finance these activities. Without successful
exploration, development or acquisition activities, Newfield's reserves,
production and revenues will decline rapidly. Newfield cannot assure you that it
will be able to find and develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable
cost.

     SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL IS REQUIRED TO REPLACE AND GROW RESERVES.  Newfield
makes, and will continue to make, substantial expenditures to find, develop,
acquire and produce oil and gas reserves. Newfield believes that it will have
sufficient cash provided by operating activities and available borrowings under
its credit arrangements to fund planned capital expenditures in 2002. If,
however, lower oil and gas prices or operating difficulties result in Newfield's
cash flow from operations being less than expected or limit Newfield's ability
to borrow under its credit facility, Newfield may be unable to expend the
capital necessary to undertake or complete its drilling program unless it raises
additional funds through debt or equity financings. Newfield cannot assure you
that debt or equity financing, cash generated by operations or borrowing
capacity under its credit arrangements will be available or sufficient to meet
these requirements.

     RESERVE ESTIMATES ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND DEPEND ON MANY ASSUMPTIONS
THAT MAY TURN OUT TO BE INACCURATE.  Estimating accumulations of oil and gas is
complex and is not exact because of the numerous uncertainties inherent in the
process. The process relies on interpretations of available geologic,
geophysical, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and
reliability of this technical data can vary. The process also requires certain
economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the SEC, such as oil and gas
prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and
availability of funds. The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of:

     - the quality and quantity of available data;

     - the interpretation of that data;

     - the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and

     - the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate.

     The proved reserve information with respect to Newfield included and
incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus is based on
estimates Newfield prepared. This proxy statement/prospectus also contains
Newfield's estimates of certain proved reserve information with respect to EEX.
Estimates prepared by others might differ materially from Newfield's
estimates.  Actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes,
development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil
and gas reserves most likely will vary from Newfield's estimates. Any
significant variance could materially affect the quantities and present value of
Newfield's and EEX's reserves. In addition, Newfield may adjust estimates of
proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and
development and prevailing oil and gas prices. Newfield's reserves may also be
susceptible to drainage by operators on adjacent properties.

     You should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows with
respect to Newfield's proved reserves incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement/prospectus is the current market value of Newfield's estimated proved
oil and gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, Newfield generally
bases the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on
prices and costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may
be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the
estimate.

     IF OIL AND GAS PRICES DECREASE, NEWFIELD MAY BE REQUIRED TO TAKE
WRITEDOWNS.  Newfield may be required to writedown the carrying value of its oil
and gas properties when oil and gas prices are low or if Newfield has
substantial downward adjustments to its estimated proved reserves, increases in
its estimates of development costs or deterioration in its exploration results.

     Newfield capitalizes the costs to acquire, find and develop its oil and gas
properties under the full cost accounting method. The net capitalized costs of
its oil and gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future
net cash flows from proved reserves, using constant oil and gas prices and a 10%
discount factor, plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved
properties. With the concurrence of the SEC, Newfield's impairment calculation
uses a hedge adjusted price (net realized price after considering cash flow
hedges) applied to the quantity of proved reserves covered by its hedges. If net
capitalized costs of Newfield's oil and gas properties exceed this limit,
Newfield must charge the amount of the excess to earnings. Newfield reviews the
carrying value of its properties quarterly, based on prices in effect as of the
end of each quarter or as of the time of reporting its results. The carrying
value of oil and gas properties is computed on a country-by-country basis.
Therefore, while its properties in one country may be subject to a writedown,
its properties in other countries could be unaffected. Once incurred, a
writedown of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if
oil or gas prices increase.

     NEWFIELD MAY BE SUBJECT TO RISKS IN CONNECTION WITH FUTURE
ACQUISITIONS.  The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an
assessment of several factors, including:

     - recoverable reserves;

     - future oil and gas prices;

     - operating costs; and

     - potential environmental and other liabilities.

     The accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection
with these assessments, Newfield performs a review of the subject properties
that it believes to be generally consistent with industry practices. Newfield's
review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit
Newfield to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess
their deficiencies and capabilities. Inspections may not always be performed on
every platform or well, and structural and environmental problems are not
necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems
are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective
contractual protection against all or part of the problems. Newfield is often
not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and
acquires properties on an "as is" basis.

     COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY CONDITIONS MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT NEWFIELD'S ABILITY TO
CONDUCT OPERATIONS. Competition in the oil and gas industry is intense,
particularly with respect to the acquisition of producing properties and
undeveloped acreage. Major and independent oil and gas companies actively bid
for desirable oil and gas properties, as well as for the equipment and labor
required to operate and develop their properties. Many of Newfield's competitors
have financial resources that are substantially greater than those of Newfield,
which may adversely affect Newfield's ability to compete with these companies.

     DRILLING IS A HIGH-RISK ACTIVITY.  Newfield's future success will depend,
in part, on the success of its drilling programs. In addition to the numerous
operating risks described in more detail below, these activities involve the
risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be discovered.
In addition, Newfield often is uncertain as to the future cost or timing of
drilling, completing and producing wells. Further, Newfield's drilling
operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of
factors, including:

     - unexpected drilling conditions;

     - pressure or irregularities in formations;

     - equipment failures or accidents;

     - adverse weather conditions;

     - compliance with governmental requirements; and

     - shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery
       of equipment.

     THE OIL AND GAS BUSINESS INVOLVES MANY OPERATING RISKS THAT CAN CAUSE
SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES, AND NEWFIELD'S INSURANCE MAY NOT PROTECT IT AGAINST ALL
THESE RISKS.  These risks include:

     - fires;

     - explosions;

     - blow-outs;

     - uncontrollable flows of oil, gas, formation water or drilling fluids;

     - natural disasters;

     - pipe or cement failures;

     - casing collapses;

     - embedded oilfield drilling and service tools;

     - abnormally pressured formations; and

     - environmental hazards such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, pipeline
       ruptures and discharges of toxic gases.

     If any of these events occur, Newfield could incur substantial losses as a
result of:

     - injury or loss of life;

     - severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and
       equipment;

     - pollution and other environmental damage;

     - clean-up responsibilities;

     - regulatory investigation and penalties;

     - suspension of its operations; and

     - repairs to resume operations.

     If Newfield experiences any of these problems, its ability to conduct
operations could be adversely affected.

     Offshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks peculiar to
the marine environment, such as capsizing, collisions and damage or loss from
hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions. These conditions can cause
substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production. As a result, Newfield
could incur substantial liabilities that could reduce or eliminate the funds
available for exploration, development and acquisitions, or result in loss of
properties.

     Newfield maintains insurance against some, but not all, of these potential
risks and losses. Newfield may elect not to obtain insurance if it believes that
the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In
addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable.
If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by
insurance, it could adversely affect Newfield.

     NEWFIELD HAS RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS FOREIGN OPERATIONS.  Newfield
continues to evaluate and pursue new opportunities for international expansion
in areas where it can use its core competencies. To date, Newfield has expanded
its operations to Australia and China.

     Ownership of property interests and production operations in areas outside
the United States is subject to the various risks inherent in foreign
operations. These risks may include:

     - currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations;

     - loss of revenue, property and equipment as a result of expropriation,
       nationalization, war or insurrection;

     - increases in taxes and governmental royalties;

     - renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities and
       quasi-governmental agencies;

     - changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based
       companies;

     - labor problems; and

     - other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over
       Newfield's international operations.

     Newfield's international operations may also be adversely affected by laws
and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, taxation and
investment. In addition, if a dispute arises with respect to Newfield's foreign
operations, Newfield may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign
courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the
jurisdiction of the courts of the United States.

     EXPLORATION IN DEEPWATER INVOLVES GREATER OPERATING AND FINANCIAL RISKS
THAN EXPLORATION AT SHALLOWER DEPTHS. THESE RISKS COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL
LOSSES.  Deepwater drilling and operations require the application of recently
developed technologies and involve a higher risk of mechanical failure. Newfield
will likely experience significantly higher drilling costs for any deepwater
wells it may drill. In addition,

much of the deepwater play lacks the physical and oilfield service
infrastructure present in shallower waters. As a result, development of a
deepwater discovery may be a lengthy process and require substantial capital
investment, resulting in significant financial and operating risks.

     In addition, as Newfield carries out its drilling program in deepwater, it
is likely that it will not initially serve as operator of the wells. As a
result, Newfield may have limited ability to exercise influence over operations
for these properties or their associated costs. Newfield's dependence on the
operator and other working interest owners for these deepwater projects and its
limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could prevent the
realization of its targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition
activities in the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico. The success and timing of
drilling and exploitation activities on properties operated by others therefore
depend upon a number of factors that will be largely outside of Newfield's
control, including:

     - the timing and amount of capital expenditures;

     - the availability of suitable offshore drilling rigs, drilling equipment,
       support vessels, production and transportation infrastructure and
       qualified operating personnel;

     - the operator's expertise and financial resources;

     - approval of other participants in drilling wells; and

     - selection of technology.

     OTHER INDEPENDENT OIL AND GAS COMPANIES' LIMITED ACCESS TO CAPITAL MAY
CHANGE NEWFIELD'S EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS.  Many independent oil and
gas companies have limited access to the capital necessary to finance their
activities. As a result, some of the other working interest owners of Newfield's
wells may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as
they become due. These problems could cause Newfield to change, suspend or
terminate its drilling and development plans with respect to the affected
project.

     NEWFIELD IS SUBJECT TO COMPLEX LAWS THAT CAN AFFECT THE COST, MANNER OR
FEASIBILITY OF DOING BUSINESS. Exploration, development, production and sale of
oil and gas are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international
regulation. Newfield may be required to make large expenditures to comply with
environmental and other governmental regulations. Matters subject to regulation
include:

     - discharge permits for drilling operations;

     - drilling bonds;

     - reports concerning operations;

     - the spacing of wells;

     - unitization and pooling of properties; and

     - taxation.

     Under these laws, Newfield could be liable for personal injuries, property
damage, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up
costs and other environmental damages. Failure to comply with these laws also
may result in the suspension or termination of Newfield's operations and subject
it to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, these laws could
change in ways that substantially increase Newfield's costs. Any such
liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could
materially adversely affect Newfield's financial condition and results of
operations.

     NEWFIELD'S CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, STOCKHOLDERS RIGHTS PLAN AND
BYLAWS CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT COULD DISCOURAGE AN ACQUISITION OR CHANGE OF
CONTROL OF NEWFIELD.  Newfield's stockholders rights plan, together with certain
provisions of its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, may make it more
difficult to effect a change in control of Newfield, to acquire Newfield or to
replace incumbent management. These

provisions could potentially deprive Newfield's stockholders of opportunities to
sell shares of Newfield common stock at above-market prices.

     NEWFIELD DOES NOT INTEND TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON NEWFIELD COMMON
STOCK.  Newfield has not paid cash dividends in the past and does not intend to
pay dividends in the foreseeable future on Newfield common stock. Newfield
currently intends to retain any earnings for the future operation and
development of its business. Newfield's ability to make dividend payments in the
future will be dependent on its future performance and liquidity. In addition,
Newfield's credit facility contains restrictions on its ability to pay cash
dividends.

RISKS RELATING TO THE TRUST AND THE TRUST UNITS

     THERE WILL BE NO PUBLIC MARKET FOR THE TRUST UNITS, WHICH WILL LIMIT THEIR
MARKET PRICE AND YOUR ABILITY TO SELL THEM FOR THEIR INHERENT VALUE.  The trust
units are a new issue of securities for which there is currently no trading
market. As a result, there can be no assurance that a market will develop for
the trust units or that you will be able to sell your trust units. The trust
units will not be listed or quoted on any national securities exchange or
market.

     THE TRUST MAY NOT RECEIVE ANY ROYALTIES RELATED TO THE PRODUCTION OF OIL
AND NATURAL GAS FROM THE UNDERLYING PROPERTIES.  The only assets and sources of
income to the trust are the royalty interests, which generally entitle the trust
to receive a share of the oil and gas production from the underlying properties
if production is achieved. There is no production and there are no proved
reserves currently associated with the royalty interests, and there can be no
assurance that there will be production associated with the royalty interests in
the future. The underlying properties are at present exploration prospects. As a
result, ultimate commercialization of any one or more of these prospects may
never be realized, either because oil or gas may not be discovered or, if
discovered, because the costs of development may be prohibitive. The prospects
target geological formations that are deeper than conventional Gulf of Mexico
prospects and therefore have greater risks and costs associated with their
exploration and development.

     PRODUCTION RISKS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT TRUST DISTRIBUTIONS.  The occurrence
of drilling, production or transportation accidents at any of the underlying
properties may reduce trust distributions. While the trust, as the owner of
overriding royalty interests, should not be responsible for the costs associated
with these accidents, any such accidents may result in the loss of a productive
well and associated reserves or interruption of production. Generally, Newfield
would be obligated to the trust to undertake (or if Newfield is not the
operator, to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the operator to
undertake) remedial operations only to the extent that such actions would be
undertaken by a prudent operator under similar circumstances in accordance with
good oilfield practices but without giving effect to the existence of the
royalty interests.

     ANY FUTURE DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE TRUST WILL BE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATING
PRICES FOR THE SALE OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS.  Oil and gas prices fluctuate widely
in response to relatively minor changes in supply, market uncertainty and a
variety of additional factors that are beyond the control of the trust. These
factors include, among other things, those set forth in the risk factors above.

     To the extent there is production of oil and gas associated with the
royalty interests, the royalties that the trust may receive from its share of
production will be affected by changes in the prices of oil and natural gas. As
a result, future distributions from the trust to the holders of the trust units
could be reduced or discontinued. In addition, lower oil and gas prices may
reduce the likelihood that the underlying properties will be developed or that
any oil and gas discovered will be economic to produce. The volatility of energy
prices reduces the accuracy of estimates of future cash distributions to trust
unitholders and the value of the trust units.

     Any future distributions from the trust will be reduced by the trust's
current administrative expenses and obligation to repay amounts previously
borrowed from Newfield to fund these expenses. The trustee is entitled to
reimburse itself from the quarterly revenues of the trust to pay all expenses
relating to the administration of the royalty interests and the trust incurred
during such quarter, and to repay amounts

previously borrowed from Newfield to fund these expenses prior to the date that
royalty interests produce any revenues for the trust, in the latter case up to
an aggregate maximum of 8% of the trust's revenues during such quarter. In
addition, if the trust borrows funds to cover any other expenses or liabilities,
no distributions will be made to trust unitholders until that indebtedness is
paid in full.

     THE TRUST WILL BE DEPENDENT ON NEWFIELD FOR FUNDING UNTIL IT HAS
REVENUE.  Because none of the underlying properties are at present producing any
oil or gas, the trust has, and upon completion of the merger will have, no
source of income. Therefore, it must rely on Newfield for funding of its
administrative expenses. Any material adverse change affecting Newfield and its
financial condition or results of operations could materially and adversely
affect the trust and the trust unitholders. Newfield has agreed to make loans as
may be requested by the trustee in amounts estimated by the trustee to be
required to cover administrative expenses expected to be incurred within the
90-day period following the date each such loan is made. Loans from Newfield
will bear interest at an annual rate of 8% and will be senior unsecured
obligations of the trust. Such loans will be repaid in quarterly installments
only from the excess, if any, of an amount equal to 8% of the cash received by
the trustee in a given quarter from proceeds of the royalty interests over all
compensation, reimbursements and other charges otherwise owing and paid to the
trustee for its performance of its obligations under the trust agreement for
that quarter.

     NO DISTRIBUTIONS WILL BE MADE TO TRUST UNITHOLDERS IF THE TRUST BORROWS
FUNDS TO COVER EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES OR LIABILITIES UNTIL THAT INDEBTEDNESS IS
PAID IN FULL.  No distributions will be made to trust unitholders if the trust
borrows funds to pay any extraordinary expenses or liabilities of the trust
until that indebtedness is paid in full. In addition to the trustee's authority
to borrow funds from Newfield to cover administrative expenses, if at any time
the cash on hand and to be received by the trust and available to pay trust
liabilities is not or will not be in the judgment of the trustee sufficient to
pay other expenses or liabilities of the trust as they become due, the trustee
is authorized to borrow the funds required to pay such liabilities from a third
party, from Newfield or from the trustee. In such event, no further
distributions will be made to trust unitholders until the indebtedness created
by any such borrowing has been paid in full. To secure payment of such
indebtedness, the trustee is authorized to mortgage, pledge, grant security
interests in or otherwise encumber the royalty interests.

     THE TRUST UNITHOLDERS WILL HAVE LIMITED VOTING RIGHTS AND NO INFLUENCE OR
CONTROL OVER THE OPERATION OR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNDERLYING
PROPERTIES.  The voting rights of trust unitholders are more limited than those
of stockholders of most public corporations. For example, there is no
requirement for annual meetings of trust unitholders or for an annual or other
periodic re-election of the trustee. Neither the trustee nor the trust
unitholders will be able to influence or control the operation or future
development of the underlying properties. Among other things, Newfield will have
the right to elect not to participate in drilling or other operations conducted
by other working interest owners under an operating agreement or similar
arrangement, which could result in forfeiture of the affected property or
subject Newfield (and, therefore, the trust) to non-consent recoupment
penalties, if a reasonable, prudent operator acting in conformity with sound
oilfield practices without giving effect to the existence of the royalty
interests would make that election.

     NEWFIELD'S INTERESTS AND THE INTERESTS OF THE TRUST UNITHOLDERS MAY NOT
ALWAYS BE ALIGNED.  Because Newfield has interests in oil and gas properties not
included in the trust, following completion of the merger Newfield's interests
and the interests of the trust unitholders may not always be aligned. For
example, in setting budgets for development and production expenditures for
Newfield's properties, including the underlying properties, Newfield may make
decisions that could adversely affect future production from the underlying
properties. Moreover, Newfield could decide to sell or abandon some or all of
the underlying properties, and that decision may not be in the best interests of
the trust unitholders. Except for specified matters that require approval of the
trust unitholders (as described in "Treasure Island Royalty Trust -- Trust
Agreement"), the documents governing the trust do not provide a mechanism for
resolving these conflicting interests.

     NEWFIELD MAY TRANSFER OR ABANDON UNDERLYING PROPERTIES.  Newfield may at
any time transfer all or part of the underlying properties. Trust unitholders
will not be entitled to vote on any transfer, and the

trust will not receive any proceeds of the transfer. Following any such
transfer, the underlying properties will continue to be subject to the
overriding royalty interests of the trust, but the net proceeds from the
transferred property would be calculated separately and paid by the transferee.
The transferee would be responsible for all of Newfield's obligations relating
to the overriding royalty interests on the portion of the underlying properties
transferred, and Newfield would have no continuing obligation to the trust for
those properties. In addition, at the request of Newfield the trustee must sell
royalty interests that burden subject interests then in commercial production
and which Newfield proposes to sell to an unaffiliated third party. However, the
trustee will not be required to sell during any calendar year any royalty
interest the value of which exceeds 10% of the value of all royalty interests
held by the trust and then attributed with proved reserves or which would cause
the cumulative value of all royalty interests sold pursuant to such requests to
exceed 25% of the value of all royalty interests held by the trust and then
attributed with proved reserves.

     ROYALTY INTERESTS MUST BE SOLD IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, WHICH COULD CAUSE
THE TRUST TO BE TERMINATED. The trustee must sell all or substantially all of
the royalty interests comprising the trust estate if the holders of 80% or more
of the trust units approve the sale or vote to terminate the trust. The trustee
also must sell royalty interests not comprising all or substantially all of the
trust estate if the holders of 60% or more of the trust units approve the sale.
The trustee must also sell all of the royalty interests if the aggregate cash
proceeds received by the trustee with respect to the royalty interests for each
of the two successive years after the first full year during which any of the
underlying properties produce oil and/or gas in commercial quantities is less
than $1,000,000 per year. Sale of all the royalty interests will terminate the
trust. The net proceeds of any sale will be distributed to the trust
unitholders.

     TRUST UNITHOLDERS WILL HAVE LIMITED ABILITY TO ENFORCE RIGHTS.  The trust
agreement and Texas trust law permit the trustee and the trust to sue Newfield
or any other future owner of the underlying properties to honor the royalty
interests. If the trustee does not take appropriate action to enforce the
royalty interests, the trust unitholders' recourse would likely be limited to
bringing a lawsuit against the trustee to compel the trustee to take specified
actions. Trust unitholders probably would not be able to sue Newfield or any
future owner of the underlying properties directly to enforce the trust's
rights.

     LIMITED LIABILITY OF TRUST UNITHOLDERS IS UNCERTAIN.  It is unclear under
Texas law whether a trust unitholder could be held personally liable for the
trust's liabilities if those liabilities exceeded the value of the trust's
assets. While Newfield believes it is highly unlikely the trust could incur such
excess liabilities, there can be no assurance that the trust unitholders will
not be held liable for the respective pro rata portions of any of such excess
liabilities. The trust's royalty interests are generally not subject to
operational and environmental liabilities and obligations. The trust conducts no
active business that would give rise to other business liabilities. The trustee
has limited ability to incur obligations on behalf of the trust. The trustee has
no authority to incur any contractual liabilities on behalf of the trust that
are not limited solely to claims against the assets of the trust.

                            THE EEX SPECIAL MEETING

DATE, TIME AND PLACE OF THE SPECIAL MEETING; PURPOSES OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

     The special meeting of shareholders of EEX will be held on                ,
          , 2002, at the offices of EEX at 2500 CityWest Boulevard, Houston,
Texas commencing at                :00 a.m. local time. At the meeting, the
holders of EEX common stock and EEX preferred stock will be asked to approve the
merger agreement and to consider such other matters as may properly be brought
before the meeting.

RECORD DATE AND OUTSTANDING SHARES

     Only holders of record of EEX common stock and EEX preferred stock at the
close of business on           , 2002 are entitled to notice of, and to vote at,
the EEX special meeting. On the record date, there were approximately
               holders of record of the           shares of EEX common stock
then issued and outstanding. Each share of EEX common stock entitles the holder
thereof to one vote on each matter submitted for shareholder approval. The
holders of EEX preferred stock are entitled to an aggregate of 8,000,000 votes
on each matter submitted for shareholder approval.

VOTING AND REVOCATION OF PROXIES

     All properly executed proxies that are not revoked will be voted at the EEX
special meeting in accordance with the instructions contained therein.

     If a holder of EEX common stock executes and returns a proxy and does not
specify otherwise, the shares represented by such proxy will be voted "for"
approval of the merger agreement in accordance with the recommendation of the
Board of Directors of EEX.

     All of the holders of EEX preferred stock and certain of the executive
officers of EEX who own shares of EEX common stock have executed a voting
agreement and irrevocable proxy pursuant to which they have agreed to vote their
shares in favor of approval of the merger agreement. See "Voting Agreement and
Irrevocable Proxy."

     THE EEX BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE HOLDERS OF EEX COMMON STOCK
VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

     A shareholder of EEX who has executed and returned a proxy may revoke it at
any time before it is voted at the EEX special meeting by:

     - executing and returning a proxy bearing a later date;

     - filing written notice of such revocation with the Secretary of EEX,
       stating that the proxy is revoked; or

     - attending the EEX special meeting and voting in person.

VOTE REQUIRED

     The transaction of business at the special meeting requires the presence in
person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding
shares of EEX capital stock entitled to vote at the EEX special meeting.
Approval of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
the votes entitled to be cast at the EEX special meeting by the holders of
record of the outstanding shares of EEX common stock. In addition, approval of
the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of (a)
two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast at the special meeting by the
holders of record of the outstanding shares of EEX common stock and EEX
preferred stock (voting together as a single class) and (b) a majority of votes
entitled to be cast at the EEX special meeting by the holders of record of the
outstanding shares of EEX preferred stock. The holders of all of the outstanding
shares of EEX preferred stock have executed a voting agreement and irrevocable
proxy pursuant to which they have agreed, among

other things, to vote their shares in favor of the merger agreement.
Consequently, if the holders of the requisite number of shares of EEX common
stock vote in favor of the merger agreement, the approval of the merger
agreement is assured.

     On the record date, there were           shares of EEX common stock and
          shares of EEX preferred stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the
EEX special meeting.

     In determining whether the merger agreement has received the requisite
number of affirmative votes, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same
effect as a vote AGAINST the merger agreement.

     Votes cast by proxy or in person at the EEX special meeting will be counted
by the persons appointed by EEX to act as election inspectors for the meeting.
The election inspectors will treat broker non-votes as shares that are present
and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.
However, for purposes of determining the outcome of any matter as to which the
broker has indicated in writing on the proxy that it does not have discretionary
authority to vote, such shares will be treated as not present and not entitled
to vote with respect to that matter (even though those shares may be entitled to
vote on other matters).

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

     In addition to solicitation by mail, the directors, officers, employees and
agents of EEX may solicit proxies from holders of EEX common stock by personal
interview, telephone, telegram or otherwise. Newfield and EEX will each pay
one-half of the costs of the solicitation of proxies from holders of EEX common
stock and the costs of printing this proxy statement/prospectus. Arrangements
will also be made with brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and
fiduciaries who hold of record voting securities of EEX for the forwarding of
solicitation materials to the beneficial owners thereof. EEX will reimburse such
brokers, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for the reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by them in connection therewith. EEX has engaged the services
of Innisfree M&A Incorporated to distribute proxy solicitation materials to
brokers, banks and other nominees and to assist in the solicitation of proxies
from holders of EEX common stock for a fee of $15,000 plus $5 for each telephone
call that Innisfree is requested to make or receive. Innisfree will also be
reimbursed for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

OTHER MATTERS

     At the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the Board of Directors of
EEX does not know of any business to be presented at the EEX special meeting
other than as set forth in the notice accompanying this proxy
statement/prospectus. If any other matters should properly come before the EEX
special meeting, it is intended that the shares represented by proxies will be
voted with respect to such matters in accordance with the judgment of the
persons voting such proxies, provided that no proxy which is voted against the
approval of the merger agreement will be voted in favor of any adjournment or
postponement of the EEX special meeting.

          UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     The following summary unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial
information combines the historical consolidated balance sheets and income
statements of Newfield and EEX and gives effect to the merger using the purchase
method of accounting. The following information is provided to assist you in
your analysis of the financial aspects of the merger.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information is based
on the following assumptions and adjustments:

     - EEX's income statement for the year ended December 31, 2001 has been
       adjusted to reflect the disposition and discontinuance of its
       international operations, as if these transactions had occurred on
       January 1, 2001;

     - the income statement data assume the merger was effective on January 1,
       2001;

     - the balance sheet data assume that the merger was effective on March 31,
       2002;

     - the balance sheet data does not reflect Newfield's anticipated
       refinancing of the EEX debt assumed; and

     - the historical financial statements of EEX have been adjusted to conform
       to the accounting policies of Newfield.

     The historical income statement information for the year ended December 31,
2001 is derived from the audited financial statements of EEX and Newfield. The
historical income statement information for the three-month period ended March
31, 2002 and the historical balance sheet information as of March 31, 2002 are
derived from the unaudited financial statements of EEX and Newfield. EEX has
provided all the historical information set forth herein regarding EEX and its
subsidiaries, and Newfield has provided all the historical information set forth
herein regarding Newfield and its subsidiaries and the assumptions and
adjustments for the pro forma information. Neither EEX nor Newfield assumes any
responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the information provided by
the other party.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information is
presented for illustrative purposes only. The financial results may have been
different had the companies always been combined. You should not rely on the
unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information as being indicative
of the historical results that would have been achieved had the companies always
been combined or the future results that Newfield will experience. Further, the
unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information does not reflect
the effect of restructuring charges that will be incurred to fully integrate and
operate the combined organization more efficiently or anticipated synergies
resulting from the merger. The restructuring activities to integrate the
companies may result in head count reduction, asset rationalization and other
activities. Because the plans for these activities have not yet been finalized,
Newfield is not able to reasonably quantify the cost for such activities.

     The following information should be read together with the historical
financial statements and related notes of EEX and Newfield incorporated by
reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. See "Where You Can Find More
Information."

                                   THE MERGER

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MERGER

     The merger agreement provides for the merger of Newfield Operating Company,
a wholly owned subsidiary of Newfield, with and into EEX, with EEX surviving the
merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Newfield. At the effective time, each
outstanding share of EEX common stock will be converted into .05703 of a share
of Newfield common stock (subject to the right of holders of EEX common stock to
elect to receive units in a newly formed royalty trust in lieu of shares of
Newfield common stock, with each such unit elected reducing the number of shares
of Newfield common stock that would otherwise be received by .00054) and the
outstanding shares of EEX preferred stock will be converted into an aggregate of
4,700,000 shares of Newfield common stock. A total of approximately 7.1 million
shares of Newfield common stock will be issued pursuant to the merger agreement,
representing approximately 12.4% of the total number of shares of Newfield
common stock (on a fully diluted basis) to be outstanding after such issuance.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     As EEX's Board of Directors prepared to meet for their annual strategy
review in July 2000, EEX was faced with four primary issues.

     - The Cooper Field infrastructure assets, including the Enserch Garden
       Banks floating production system, were generating no income for the
       company but had a capital lease obligation against the infrastructure
       assets of over $200 million. In addition, the infrastructure assets
       securing the capital lease obligation could not be sold separately
       without paying off the entire capital lease obligation.

     - The obligation to provide gas to the Encogen power plant was going to
       require EEX to incur substantial capital expenditures in 2000 and 2001
       which ultimately totaled $62.5 million. This capital outlay was required
       to meet a delivery obligation entered into some years earlier by its
       predecessor company and would provide no future income to EEX.

     - The Arctic I drilling rig contract had two more years before it expired
       and EEX did not have firm drilling plans for the two year remaining term.

     - EEX was faced with liquidity issues. The company's balance sheet was not
       strong enough to realize fully the value of the assets, and its revolving
       bank agreement was scheduled to expire in two years, necessitating a
       refinancing of the company.

     At the EEX board meeting on July 25, 2000, management reviewed various
strategic options with the EEX board based on the liquidity concerns and
financial situation confronting EEX going forward. One of the options reviewed
was the merger of EEX with an entity of sufficient size to realize the value of
EEX's Gulf of Mexico and onshore opportunities. At its meeting on July 25, 2000,
the board considered whether, due to the increase in commodity prices,
particularly natural gas prices, it was an opportune time for EEX to review its
strategic options. The board instructed EEX management to retain an investment
bank to advise EEX concerning its strategic options, including a sale of the
entire company. After interviewing several investment banks to serve as
potential strategic advisors, on September 15, 2000, EEX retained Morgan Stanley
& Co. Incorporated to provide financial advice to EEX in connection with its
strategic options.

     During September 2000 Morgan Stanley and EEX created a data room for
potential merger or sale candidates to review information concerning EEX.
Potential candidates were required to sign a confidentiality agreement prior to
gaining access to the data room. From September 2000 until the execution date of
the merger agreement with Newfield, EEX management and Morgan Stanley contacted
51 companies, 25 of which signed confidentiality agreements, and 21 of which
visited the EEX data room.

     In early September 2000, Newfield contacted EEX and Warburg regarding the
possibility that EEX might be a candidate for an acquisition by Newfield, and
EEX put Morgan Stanley in contact with

representatives of Newfield. The parties executed a confidentiality agreement on
October 4, 2000. The confidentiality agreement is for a two year term and
includes, among other things, a standstill provision and customary provisions
regarding the treatment of confidential information. On October 24 and 25, 2000,
Newfield representatives reviewed information in the data room and were given
presentations by EEX personnel concerning various operational and financial
matters, both onshore and offshore. After reviewing the information, Newfield
told Morgan Stanley that they were interested in EEX's onshore assets but were
not interested in acquiring all of EEX.

     During the first, second and early third quarter of 2001, a number of
potential acquirors commenced or continued their due diligence, and several
parties to whom EEX had previously provided information continued with their due
diligence analysis of EEX. EEX was engaged with such parties in discussions
regarding potential acquisitions of all or a portion of the company.

     In early April 2001, Newfield again contacted EEX concerning a possible
transaction in which Newfield would join with a third party to make a proposal
to acquire all of EEX. Newfield indicated that it would acquire all of EEX's
onshore assets and all of the offshore assets other than those leases in the
area of EEX's Llano discovery, offshore Louisiana, various infrastructure which
had been utilized in the Cooper Field (including the Enserch Garden Banks
floating production system and pipelines), and the contract for the Arctic I
semi-submersible drilling rig. The excluded assets were to be acquired by the
third party. Discussions commenced with the third party but were terminated when
the third party indicated it did not wish to make a bid.

     On May 21, 2001, Morgan Stanley provided the EEX Board of Directors with an
update on the strategic alternatives for EEX and various financing alternatives.
On May 23, 2001, Howard H. Newman, a director of EEX, reported to the EEX board
that he had been contacted by Newfield and another potential acquiror regarding
a transaction with EEX. Mr. Newman is also a director of Newfield. The purchase
agreement pursuant to which Warburg purchased its preferred stock and warrants
in EEX provides Warburg the right to designate one person for election to EEX's
Board of Directors. Mr. Newman, a general partner of Warburg, Pincus & Co. and a
Vice Chairman, Managing Director and member of Warburg, Pincus L.L.C., serves as
such designee. An affiliate of Warburg owns less than 5% of the common stock of
Newfield. Mr. Newman asked the other members of the EEX board for permission to
discuss a possible transaction between Newfield and EEX. Mr. Newman wanted to
make sure that the other board members were aware of any discussions he would
have concerning this subject because of his membership on the boards of both
companies, and the ownership by an affiliate of Warburg of less than 5% of the
common stock of Newfield. The EEX board agreed that Mr. Newman could be involved
in discussions with Newfield. The other inquiry was referred to Morgan Stanley.

     During early June, 2001, Mr. Newman and Frederick M. Lowther, another
member of the EEX board, held a conference call with Newfield representatives
concerning Newfield's interest in EEX. During the call, Newfield indicated that
its valuation of EEX as a whole was below the then current market valuation. As
a result, EEX ceased discussions with Newfield regarding an acquisition of the
entire company.

     At the July 25, 2001 EEX board meeting, the EEX board approved the purchase
of the lessor's interest in the Enserch Garden Banks floating production system,
pipelines and related facilities for $69 million in order to provide additional
alternatives to market the floating production facility. The transaction closed
on August 2, 2001, but was recorded in the second quarter of 2001. The EEX board
also decided to pursue a plan for the recapitalization of EEX while allowing
Morgan Stanley to continue to pursue potential strategic transaction candidates.
EEX commenced preparations for a private offering of $350 million principal
amount of senior high-yield notes, the proceeds of which would be used to pay
off borrowings under EEX's existing credit facility (which was to expire in June
2002) and the gas sales obligation with an affiliate of Enron North America. The
financing would also include entry into a new $150 million bank credit facility.
EEX also began contacting potential purchasers of its interest in the Llano
Field discovery. The Llano Field interests were subsequently sold to Amerada
Hess Corporation on September 6, 2001 for $50 million cash plus an overriding
royalty interest of one-half of 1% for the first

100 million barrels of oil equivalent total production from the Llano Field and
1% on all production thereafter. Representatives of EEX were on the second day
of a "road show" in connection with the senior note offering at the time of the
September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C. In
the aftermath of those attacks, debt financing ceased to be available for the
type of high-yield transaction which EEX was pursuing, and the proposed offering
was terminated.

     On November 5, 2001, EEX learned that Newfield desired to explore a
possible combination of the companies. On November 13, 2001, David Trice,
President and Chief Executive Officer of Newfield, and Mr. Hamilton held a
meeting to discuss Newfield's renewed interest in EEX. On November 14, 2001,
Newfield contacted Mr. Hamilton about a possible merger of the two companies.
Mr. Hamilton replied that EEX was willing to reopen discussions with Newfield.
On November 19, 2001, Newfield reviewed data relating to the Devil's Island
prospect. Mr. Hamilton sent an electronic message to Mr. Trice on November 29,
2001, inviting Newfield to return to the EEX data room to update its
information. Newfield again came to the EEX data room on December 7 and 10,
2001. On December 21, 2001, Newfield met internally to review the progress of
its analysis of EEX. During the final two weeks of December and in early January
2002, Newfield continued to refine its valuation of the EEX assets.

     During late 2001 and early 2002, Warburg was from time to time contacted by
a number of potential acquirors for EEX, all of whom were referred to Morgan
Stanley.

     On January 10, 2002, Mr. Trice sent Mr. Hamilton an electronic message
indicating that any transaction with EEX would require a purchase of Warburg's
shares of EEX preferred stock at a discount, in order to allow Newfield to pay
at least a market price for the outstanding EEX common shares. Mr. Trice
indicated that he had forwarded several ideas to Warburg for its review
regarding acquiring Warburg's interest in EEX.

     On January 18, 2002, Morgan Stanley representatives met with Newfield in
Houston, Texas to review valuation issues concerning EEX.

     An EEX Board of Directors meeting was held on January 26, 2002 at which,
among other things, the EEX board was updated on the status of the indications
of interest for the company. Mr. Newman recused himself from and was not present
for the portion of the meeting in which the board reviewed the discussions among
EEX, potential acquirors and Warburg. Warburg agreed to conduct its own
diligence on the then leading candidate as a basis for determining what portion
of the consideration for their preferred stock they would consider taking as
equity. Warburg also informed EEX that notwithstanding its rights to insist on
cash consideration under the terms of its EEX preferred stock, it would be
willing to accept liquid securities in exchange for its preferred shares.

     Newfield representatives met with EEX's onshore staff in EEX's San Antonio
office in early February 2002 to examine information on EEX's onshore fields.

     On February 7, 2002, Warburg and Newfield discussed possible methods by
which to structure an acquisition of Warburg's EEX preferred shares as part of a
merger transaction between EEX and Newfield.

     During mid-February 2002, Morgan Stanley representatives held discussions
with Newfield and two other unrelated parties concerning possible proposals to
be made for EEX. On behalf of EEX, Morgan Stanley urged each party to finalize
their respective evaluations of EEX and to submit written proposals to Morgan
Stanley for review by EEX management and Morgan Stanley prior to an EEX board
meeting to be held on March 14, 2002.

     At a meeting of the EEX Board of Directors held on February 20, 2002,
Morgan Stanley reviewed with the board the status of negotiations with five
potential acquirors, including Newfield. In particular, the presentation focused
on the potential offer from a third party other than Newfield.

     On February 22, 2002, EEX reported preliminary results of a $168 million
loss, or ($4.02) per share, for the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2001. For
the year ended December 31, 2001, EEX reported preliminary results of a net loss
of $160 million, or ($3.85) per share. These results arose primarily from

extraordinary items totaling a loss of $160 million, including impairments
required by FAS 121 and other extraordinary items. At year-end 2001, EEX's debt
to capital ratio under its revolving credit agreement was greater than the
agreement's limit of 60% because of the decrease in equity resulting from these
losses and increases in borrowings. During February 2002, EEX's 17 bank lending
group agreed to amend EEX's loan agreement to increase the ratio to 72% and
waive the covenant breach. The amendment and waiver was to expire on April 30,
2002.

     The asset write downs which triggered the covenant breach consisted
principally of non-cash impairments resulting from two transactions entered into
by EEX's predecessor, infrastructure covered by a capital lease including a
floating production system and pipelines and a natural gas delivery obligation.
The natural gas delivery obligation arose from a transaction entered into by
Enserch Exploration, Inc. in the late 1980s and involved a commitment to a west
Texas cogeneration facility. In effect, EEX had to purchase natural gas on the
open market to meet this delivery obligation. That obligation was fulfilled in
May, 2001 and the contract expired the following month.

     The floating production system and pipelines were a part of Enserch
Exploration's Cooper Field development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
Production began from Cooper in late 1996. Unfortunately, the field quickly
depleted and was abandoned in 1999, idling the floating production system and
pipelines. The obligations continued, however, in the form of principle and
interest payments on the capital lease, equity repurchase, and maintenance and
refurbishment of the equipment.

     At its March 14, 2002 meeting, the EEX board instructed management to
complete the terms of a new credit facility with the 17 bank syndicate
participating in EEX's existing revolving credit facility. This credit facility
was due to expire in June 2002. The board had been advised that terms of the new
credit facility, which had been in discussion since November of 2001, would
require an amendment eliminating the requirement for the settlement of the gas
sales obligations EEX had entered into with an affiliate of Enron North America.
This amendment was necessary because a rise in natural gas prices during late
February and early March 2002 had resulted in an increase in the mark-to-market
cost to settle the obligation. This additional cost would eliminate any
liquidity for EEX under the negotiated terms of the new credit facility. The
board was informed that the failure to consummate the new credit facility by the
date EEX was required to file its Form 10-K with the SEC would require EEX's
independent auditors, Ernst & Young L.L.P., to issue its audit report with a
report modification for a "going concern" uncertainty arising from the fact that
the new credit facility would not have closed at the time the accountants issued
their audit report. This "going concern" audit report would constitute an event
of default under the existing revolving credit facility.

     During its March 14, 2002 meeting, the EEX board heard presentations from
EEX management and Morgan Stanley concerning the four proposals which had been
received and ongoing discussions with two other potential purchasers. The
Newfield proposal was for a merger with EEX that provided for the issuance of
Newfield common stock to the holders of the EEX equity (common and preferred) of
either $225 million or $210 million and contingent net profits and royalty
interests in certain of EEX's offshore assets. The offer was also contingent
upon the holders of EEX's lease debt and bank debt accepting a discounted
pay-off of their indebtedness. Morgan Stanley also updated the board on
discussions with Warburg as to the consideration it was willing to receive in a
transaction, and its willingness to accept a discount with respect to the
liquidation value of the preferred stock. In addition, the EEX board heard from
another investment bank regarding prospects for a renewed effort to recapitalize
EEX through the sale of additional preferred shares to third parties and a new
senior high yield debt offering. The EEX board instructed management to continue
working with Morgan Stanley to obtain final proposals from Newfield and the
other interested third parties by April 19, 2002 for review at a special board
meeting to be held during the week of April 22. The EEX board also instructed
management to continue its efforts with the second investment bank to develop a
recapitalization plan and to test the market for new offerings of preferred
stock and high-yield senior debt. EEX contacted several significant shareholders
to determine whether they would be interested in participating in the proposed
recapitalization of EEX. Under the terms of applicable confidentiality
agreements, EEX disclosed to several of such shareholders its ongoing
discussions concerning various strategic alternatives, including the Newfield
proposal.

     During the first several months of 2002, EEX was in discussions with BP
Exploration & Production Inc. concerning a possible transaction involving the
leases EEX had acquired on its Treasure Island project in the Gulf of Mexico.
Those discussions were nearing conclusion in late March. On March 22, 2002, Mr.
Hamilton informed Mr. Trice about the discussions with BP and the terms of the
proposed transaction in an effort to help Newfield understand and properly take
into consideration the effect of a possible BP transaction in any bid Newfield
might make. The proposed terms of the BP transaction included an area of mutual
interest covering in excess of 110 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico around EEX's
existing leases (the "AMI").

     During the first half of April 2002, Morgan Stanley held discussions with
Newfield and three other companies concerning preparation of final proposals for
a transaction with EEX.

     On April 17, 2002, Mr. Trice informed Mr. Hamilton that Newfield's board
would meet on April 22 to approve the final Newfield proposal to EEX. He
informed Mr. Hamilton that, as had happened whenever the Newfield board had
discussed EEX in the past, Mr. Newman would be recused from and would not be
present at the meeting and that Mr. Newman had not been provided with any
Newfield materials concerning EEX. On April 18, 2002, Newfield representatives
reviewed the preliminary results from the Devil's Island well EEX was drilling
together with Amerada Hess in the greater Llano area.

     On April 24, 2002, the EEX board met in New York City to review the five
proposals received by Morgan Stanley for an acquisition of EEX and to review the
progress on a recapitalization plan. Morgan Stanley made a presentation
regarding each of the proposals, which included a comparison of the material
financial terms of each proposal. The Newfield proposal provided that the EEX
common shareholders would receive .0552 of a share of Newfield common for each
EEX common share held, comprising an aggregate amount of 2,345,304 shares of
Newfield common stock to be issued as merger consideration. As owner of the EEX
preferred shares, Warburg would receive an aggregate of 4,654,696 shares of
Newfield common stock and a 20% net profits interest in EEX's Treasure Island
acreage position. The proposal assumed certain debt limits and other obligations
for EEX which were incorrect at the time. The proposal was also conditioned on
the requirements that the AMI would not include horizons shallower than 20,000
feet, and that the BP transaction would be on terms otherwise acceptable to
Newfield. Newfield had been informed verbally prior to the board meeting that
its assumptions regarding elements of EEX's debt were incorrect, and was
supplied with the correct numbers. Mr. Trice informed Morgan Stanley that
revised debt information would result in the number of shares being offered to
the EEX common shareholders being reduced by 400,000. During the board meeting,
representatives of Warburg indicated that it would be acceptable to Warburg for
the 20% net profits interest in the Treasure Island acreage position to be paid
to the EEX common shareholders rather than to Warburg.

     During the April 24, 2002 meeting, EEX management and another investment
bank reviewed the progress made on a recapitalization plan for EEX. The EEX
board was informed that several parties had expressed an interest in acquiring
portions of a proposed preferred share offering and that the other investment
bank felt that market conditions were favorable for a private high-yield senior
debt offering by EEX. The board was also advised that EEX had reached agreement
with its two agent banks on a term sheet for the new secured credit facility.

     The EEX board (with Mr. Newman abstaining) directed EEX management to
concentrate its efforts in concluding a merger transaction with Newfield. The
EEX board's decision to concentrate its merger efforts with Newfield was based
on, among other things, the fact that Newfield's proposal provided the highest
value per share of EEX common stock from among all of the proposals, Warburg's
agreement to permit the net profits interests to be paid to the EEX common
shareholders instead of the preferred shareholders, the fact that Newfield had
significantly completed its asset diligence and the liquidity provided by
Newfield common stock. As a second priority, the EEX board directed EEX
management to continue its efforts to reach agreement with potential investors
for the sale of a new preferred stock offering and to begin efforts toward a new
high-yield senior debt offering. Finally, the EEX board voted to enter into the
new secured credit facility with the 17 bank lending group when agreements had
been finalized.

     Beginning on April 29, 2002 and continuing through May 29, 2002, there were
almost daily meetings and conversations between EEX, EEX's legal counsel, Akin,
Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, L.L.P., and Morgan Stanley with Newfield,
Newfield's investment bank, UBS Warburg, and Newfield's legal counsel, Vinson &
Elkins L.L.P. In addition, legal counsel for Warburg, Willkie Farr & Gallagher,
participated in negotiations concerning those transaction issues relating to
Warburg.

     Mr. Trice and Mr. Hamilton met on May 1, 2002 to discuss various issues
concerning the possible merger. Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Trice discussed Newfield's
concerns related to the area of mutual interest in the Treasure Island
negotiations with BP and the possible views of various EEX shareholders with
large positions in EEX common stock. During the meeting Mr. Trice indicated that
Newfield was considering changing the 20% net profits interest to an overriding
royalty interest, promising to follow up with a detailed term sheet. The term
sheet was delivered to EEX on May 2, 2002. Between May 2 and May 6, 2002, there
were numerous conversations, primarily between David Henderson, Executive Vice
President and Chief Operating Officer for EEX, and Elliot Pew, Vice
President-Exploration for Newfield, concerning the overriding royalty interest.
On May 6, 2002, the parties agreed upon a term sheet applicable to the Treasure
Island overriding royalty, incorporating the terms subsequently included in the
final merger documents.

     Between May 13 and May 20, 2002, there were several discussions and
communications between Mr. Henderson and Messrs. Trice and Pew concerning the
terms of the AMI. After a review of the proposed terms with Newfield on May 13,
2002, Mr. Hamilton proposed on May 15 several options to BP related to the AMI.
On May 17, 2002, Mr. Henderson forwarded to Mr. Pew the terms upon which EEX was
willing to finalize its AMI arrangement with BP. On May 20, BP responded with
some changes to the EEX proposal. These changes were acceptable to Newfield and
EEX. The Treasure Island agreement with BP was executed by BP and EEX on May 21,
2002.

     On May 17, 2002, Mr. Trice forwarded a final proposal to Mr. Hamilton,
Warburg, and Morgan Stanley. Mr. Trice indicated that the proposal must be
accepted by May 21 or Newfield would withdraw its proposal and terminate
discussions. The proposal provided that as a result of the merger, all of the
outstanding common stock of EEX would be converted into an aggregate of
2,400,000 shares of Newfield common stock and that an overriding royalty
interest in EEX's Treasure Island project would be distributed to a trust or
other appropriate entity for the benefit of EEX's common shareholders
immediately prior to closing of the proposed transaction. Assuming a total of
42,487,395 shares of EEX common stock outstanding, this would result in an
exchange ratio of .0565 of a share of Newfield common stock for each outstanding
share of EEX common stock. In addition, all of the outstanding shares of EEX
preferred stock would be converted into an aggregate of 4,700,000 shares of
Newfield common stock.

     The EEX board met by telephone on May 21, 2002. EEX management and legal
counsel made presentations to the board concerning the status of the
negotiations with Newfield and the status of the various related agreements as
of that date. Information regarding the terms of other offers received by Morgan
Stanley was presented to the EEX board. The other offers provided the holders of
common stock with less than the Newfield offer, were subject to financing
contingencies, and were generally from companies which were smaller than
Newfield and thus less capable of addressing EEX's liquidity issues. At least
one of the proposals came from a company that had significant diligence to
complete and thus presented a timing issue. Morgan Stanley presented its
financial and valuation analysis of Newfield's May 17 proposal and indicated
that they would be prepared to provide a fairness opinion regarding the
aggregate consideration offered in connection with Newfield's proposal to be
received by holders of EEX common stock, subject to the final terms of the
agreements being completed and review by its internal fairness committee. EEX
management informed the board that JPMorgan had been retained to provide an
opinion on the transaction when the final terms were complete. Akin, Gump
reviewed with the EEX board the two-thirds vote required under Texas law to
approve the proposed merger. EEX management also updated the EEX board on the
status of efforts to reach agreement with potential investors for the sale of a
new preferred stock offering and efforts toward a new high yield senior debt
offering. After the presentations, Mr. Newman recused himself and left the phone
call. The remaining members of the EEX board then discussed the proposals.
Thereafter, Mr. Newman rejoined the call and the EEX board voted

(with Mr. Newman abstaining) to instruct management to finalize the merger
agreement and related documents with Newfield and present them to the board for
final approval as soon as possible. The EEX board determined to proceed with a
merger with Newfield for the reasons set forth above. The EEX board considered
the relative merits of a recapitalization and a merger, including, among other
factors, the potential long term value for EEX shareholders presented by each.
The board chose a merger transaction as opposed to a recapitalization of EEX
because of the execution risks associated with completing a multi-step
recapitalization subject to market risks at a time when EEX was in default under
its then existing credit facility and had not yet completed negotiations with
lenders concerning a new credit facility.

     Between May 21 and May 29, 2002, EEX and Newfield and their respective
legal counsel worked to finalize the merger agreement, overriding royalty
conveyance documents, trust agreement, amendment to the EEX rights agreement and
waiver agreement relating to the Warburg Purchase Agreement, each of which was
also reviewed and commented upon by Warburg and its legal counsel. Warburg and
its legal counsel worked with Newfield and its legal counsel to finalize the
voting agreement and the registration rights agreement, each of which was also
reviewed and commented upon by EEX and its legal counsel. The negotiations
between EEX and Newfield included discussions concerning the mechanism by which
EEX common shareholders would be allowed to elect to take Newfield common stock,
units in the Treasure Island overriding royalty trust, or a combination of both.
This mechanism is further described under the headings "The Merger
Agreement -- Trust Units" and "The Companies -- Treasure Island Royalty Trust."

     On May 28, 2002, the Board of Directors of Newfield approved the merger
agreement and related documents and the transaction contemplated thereby. Mr.
Newman recused himself from and was not present at this meeting. In connection
with their consideration of the transaction, representatives of Vinson & Elkins
L.L.P. reviewed the terms of the transaction documents and UBS Warburg L.L.C.
presented its oral opinion to the board that the consideration to be paid by
Newfield in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to Newfield.
UBS Warburg L.L.C. is not affiliated with Warburg.

     The EEX board met on May 29, 2002 by telephone to review the final terms of
the merger agreement, the voting agreement, overriding royalty conveyance
documents, trust agreement, amendment to the EEX rights agreement, and waiver
agreement relating to the Warburg Purchase Agreement. Mr. Newman did not
participate in the meeting. In addition, prior to the meeting Warburg had
advised the EEX board by electronic message that, subject to the approval of the
acquisition by the EEX board, Warburg was prepared, subject to review of final
documents and approval by the EEX board, to execute a voting agreement with
representatives of Newfield. Management of EEX and representatives of Akin,
Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, L.L.P. discussed the structure of the transaction,
the change of control provisions as they relate to EEX management and employees,
the status of the negotiations with the bank lending group in connection with
the new secured credit facility, and the terms of the various agreements. Morgan
Stanley presented its financial and valuation analyses and its oral opinion to
the board that, subject to certain matters reviewed with the EEX board and
stated in Morgan Stanley's written opinion, the aggregate consideration to be
received by the holders, as a group, of EEX common stock in the proposed merger
was, as of the date of the meeting, fair, from a financial point of view, to
such shareholders. Management also advised the board that JPMorgan had provided
its oral opinion to the effect that, subject to certain matters stated in its
written opinion, the aggregate consideration to be received by the holders, as a
group, of EEX common stock in the proposed merger was, as of the date of the
meeting, fair, from a financial point of view, to such shareholders. Following
additional discussion and deliberation the board members present unanimously
approved the merger agreement, the voting agreement, the overriding royalty
conveyance documents, the trust agreement, amendment to the EEX rights
agreement, the waiver agreement relating to the Warburg Purchase Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by such agreements, and agreed to recommend that
EEX's shareholders approve the merger agreement.

     Subsequent to the meeting of the EEX Board of Directors, legal counsel for
EEX, Newfield and Warburg finalized the merger agreement, the Warburg voting
agreement and related documents. The new secured credit facility with the bank
lending group was executed by all parties by 2:00 p.m., May 29, 2002.

During the afternoon of May 29, 2002, subsequent to the execution of the new
secured credit facility, EEX and Newfield entered into the merger agreement.
Simultaneously, EEX, Newfield, Warburg and the parties to the voting agreement,
the waiver agreement relating to the Warburg Purchase Agreement and the
registration rights agreement executed their respective documents. Newfield and
EEX announced the transaction on May 29, 2002.

NEWFIELD'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     Newfield is acquiring EEX because the assets and operations of EEX are
complementary to those of Newfield. EEX's onshore properties are located in
Newfield's core South Texas focus area, and the merger will make Newfield one of
the largest independent producers in this area. In addition, during the past
year, Newfield has been seeking to establish its offshore operations in the
deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico. EEX's acreage position in the Gulf of Mexico
will help Newfield accomplish this objective.

EEX'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER; RECOMMENDATION OF THE EEX BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     By the unanimous vote of directors present at a meeting held on May 29,
2002, the EEX Board of Directors determined the merger to be advisable and in
the best interests of EEX and its shareholders and approved the merger and the
merger agreement and determined to recommend that the EEX shareholders approve
the merger agreement.

     In reaching its decision to declare the merger advisable and approve the
merger and the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, the
EEX Board of Directors consulted with EEX's legal and financial advisors, as
well as with EEX's management. The EEX Board of Directors considered the
company's financial situation and future prospects. In particular, the EEX Board
of Directors considered the following material factors:

     - Increased Liquidity and Long-Term Financial Stability.  The EEX Board of
       Directors considered the company's liquidity issues, in particular the
       limited available credit under its new revolving credit facility and
       EEX's potential inability to meet payment obligations on its senior notes
       in early 2003. EEX's new secured credit facility provides only limited
       liquidity relative to its prior credit arrangements and matures March 31,
       2003. This decreased liquidity and the new credit facility's short term
       would require EEX to raise additional equity and successfully place a
       high yield debt offering in order to meet EEX's financing needs. If the
       merger with Newfield is completed, no such financing will be required and
       the risk that these financial steps could not be accomplished will be
       eliminated.

     - Increased Financial Strength to Exploit Assets.  The EEX Board of
       Directors considered the likelihood that the company could not fully
       realize the value of its Gulf of Mexico and onshore opportunities absent
       a merger of EEX with an entity of sufficient size. Only a company with a
       strong balance sheet can fully realize the value of the EEX assets,
       particularly its deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets and the Treasure Island
       acreage position. If the merger with Newfield is completed, Newfield will
       have a strong enough balance sheet to participate in the development of
       any exploratory success on these assets. EEX as a stand-alone company
       would be required to continue to reduce its interest through sales or to
       take smaller carried interests in any developments on these assets.

     - Receipt of an Attractive Currency.  If the merger with Newfield is
       completed, EEX shareholders will receive, if they so choose, an
       attractive currency in Newfield common stock. Newfield common stock has
       historically maintained an attractive valuation compared to its peers.

     - Significant Non-Cost Bearing Exposure to the Treasure Island Project.  As
       more fully explained under the heading "The Merger Agreement -- Trust
       Units," upon completion of the merger with Newfield, EEX's common
       shareholders would have the option to elect to receive units in a new
       trust in lieu of Newfield common stock. The trust will own overriding
       royalty interests in future production from defined intervals generally
       at depths of more than 20,000 feet from certain Gulf of Mexico lease
       blocks located on the federal Outer Continental Shelf in which EEX owns
       or may

       acquire an interest. EEX has identified nine prospects at depths of more
       than 20,000 feet, which, if productive, could bring substantial value
       through the overriding royalty interests to the trust. EEX and Newfield
       can give no assurances that these prospects will produce oil or gas or
       that, if oil or gas is found, that the oil or gas will be developed, as
       the costs for drilling to and producing at these depths will be
       significant.

     - Greater Exposure to Attractive North America Natural Gas
       Fundamentals.  Upon completion of the merger, approximately 83% of
       Newfield's production would consist of natural gas from North America.
       Newfield's strong balance sheet should enable it to manage price risk
       more effectively, allowing the stockholders greater upside potential if
       natural gas prices increase in the future.

     - Additional Capital.  The combined company resulting from the merger will
       bring together two strong onshore U.S. production companies and would be
       able to provide capital to fund additional exploration and development
       activities on EEX's onshore properties.

     - Favorable Terms Compared to Other Proposals.  The terms of the Newfield
       merger provide the holders of EEX common stock more value than the other
       offers presented to the EEX Board of Directors. Other offers were subject
       to financing contingencies and were generally from companies which are
       smaller than Newfield and thus less capable of addressing EEX's liquidity
       issues. In addition, one of the other proposals came from a company that
       had significant due diligence to complete and thus presented a timing
       issue. The EEX Board of Directors chose a merger transaction with
       Newfield over a recapitalization of EEX because of the execution risks
       associated with completing a multi-stock recapitalization subject to
       market risks.

     The EEX Board of Directors also considered the following material factors
in its analysis:

     - information concerning the financial condition, results of operations,
       prospects and businesses of both EEX and Newfield, including the reserves
       of the companies, their production volumes, their cash flows from
       operations, the recent stock market performance of EEX common stock and
       Newfield common stock, and the ratio of EEX's common stock price to
       Newfield's common stock price over various periods;

     - current industry, economic and market conditions and the EEX Board of
       Directors' understanding of present and anticipated environment in the
       independent exploration and production sector of the energy industry, and
       the continued consolidation within this sector;

     - other strategic options available to EEX (including the sale of
       additional preferred stock, an offering of high yield debt and other
       potential transactions) and their relative advantages and disadvantages
       vis-a-vis the merger;

     - the opinion of outside legal counsel that the merger could be
       accomplished on a tax-free basis;

     - presentations from, and discussions with, senior executives of EEX,
       representatives of its outside legal counsel and representatives of
       Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan regarding the business, financial and legal
       due diligence, as applicable, with respect to Newfield and the terms and
       conditions of the merger agreement; and

     - the financial analyses of Morgan Stanley and the EEX Board of Directors'
       receipt of opinions from each of Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan that, as of
       May 29, 2002 and subject to certain matters stated in such opinions, the
       aggregate consideration to be received by holders, as a group, of EEX
       common stock in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of
       view, to such holders.

     The EEX Board of Directors also considered certain risks and potential
disadvantages associated with the merger, including:

     - the risk that the merger might not be completed as a result of a failure
       to satisfy the conditions to the merger;

     - the risk that the operations of the two companies may not be successfully
       integrated; and

     - other matters described under "Risk Factors."

     The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the
EEX Board of Directors is not exhaustive but does include all material factors
considered by the EEX Board of Directors. The EEX Board of Directors did not
quantify or attach any particular weight to the various factors that it
considered in reaching its determination that the merger agreement and the
merger are fair to and in the best interests of EEX and its shareholders. In
addition, individual directors may have given different significance to
different factors. As a result of its consideration of the foregoing and other
relevant considerations, the EEX Board of Directors determined that the merger
agreement and the merger are advisable and in the best interests of EEX and its
shareholders and adopted the merger agreement and approved the merger. In
considering the recommendation of the EEX Board of Directors with respect to the
merger, shareholders should be aware that the interests of certain directors and
executive officers with respect to the merger are or may be different from the
interests of the shareholders generally. The EEX Board of Directors was aware of
these interests and took these interests into consideration in approving the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. See "-- Interests of
Certain Persons in the Merger."

     BY UNANIMOUS VOTE OF THE DIRECTORS PRESENT AT THE MAY 29, 2002 MEETING OF
THE EEX BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AT WHICH THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER WERE
CONSIDERED AND VOTED UPON, THE EEX BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED AND ADOPTED
THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND APPROVED THE MERGER, AND RECOMMENDS THAT THE HOLDERS OF
EEX COMMON STOCK AND EEX PREFERRED STOCK VOTE "FOR" THE PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE
MERGER AGREEMENT.

OPINIONS OF FINANCIAL ADVISORS TO EEX

     EEX retained Morgan Stanley to provide it with financial advisory services
in connection with the evaluation of strategic alternatives and retained
JPMorgan to provide it with financial advisory services in connection with the
merger. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan were selected to act as EEX's financial
advisors based on their qualifications, expertise and reputation and their
knowledge of the business and affairs of EEX. Each of Morgan Stanley and
JPMorgan provided written opinions, as more fully described below, to the EEX
Board of Directors in connection with its consideration of the mergers.

  MORGAN STANLEY

     At the meeting of the EEX Board of Directors on May 29, 2002, Morgan
Stanley rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that as of
May 29, 2002, and subject to and based on the various considerations set forth
in its opinion, the aggregate consideration to be received by the holders, as a
group, of shares of EEX common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair
from a financial point of view to such holders. For the purposes of its opinion,
Morgan Stanley assumed, with the consent of the EEX Board of Directors, that the
aggregate consideration to be received by the holders of the EEX common stock
will consist solely of Newfield common stock, and that no such holder will elect
to receive any trust units in the merger.

     THE FULL TEXT OF MORGAN STANLEY'S WRITTEN OPINION, DATED AS OF MAY 29,
2002, WHICH SETS FORTH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE, PROCEDURES
FOLLOWED, MATTERS CONSIDERED AND LIMITATIONS ON THE SCOPE OF THE REVIEW
UNDERTAKEN BY MORGAN STANLEY IN RENDERING ITS OPINION, IS ATTACHED AS ANNEX C TO
THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS. HOLDERS OF EEX COMMON STOCK ARE URGED TO, AND
SHOULD, READ THIS OPINION CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. MORGAN STANLEY'S
OPINION IS DIRECTED TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF EEX, ADDRESSES ONLY THE
FAIRNESS FROM A FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW OF THE AGGREGATE CONSIDERATION RECEIVED
BY THE HOLDERS, AS A GROUP, OF SHARES OF EEX COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO THE MERGER
AGREEMENT, AND DOES NOT ADDRESS ANY OTHER ASPECT OF THE MERGER OR CONSTITUTE A
RECOMMENDATION TO ANY EEX SHAREHOLDER AS TO HOW TO VOTE AT THE SPECIAL MEETING
OR AS TO WHETHER HOLDERS OF EEX COMMON STOCK SHOULD ELECT TO RECEIVE ANY TRUST
UNITS IN LIEU OF NEWFIELD COMMON STOCK. THIS SUMMARY IS QUALIFIED IN ITS
ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL TEXT OF THE OPINION.

     In connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other
things:

          (a) reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other
     information of EEX and Newfield, respectively;

          (b) reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial
     and operating data, including internal oil and gas reserve estimates
     concerning EEX, prepared by the management of EEX;

          (c) reviewed certain financial forecasts prepared by the management of
     EEX;

          (d) reviewed certain financial forecasts and estimates for Newfield of
     certain securities analysts contained in publicly available research
     reports and discussed with management of EEX and Newfield such forecasts
     and estimates;

          (e) reviewed and discussed the past and current operations and
     financial condition and the prospects of EEX, including information
     relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits
     anticipated from the merger, with management of EEX, including, EEX's
     management's view of the strategic rationale for, and the timing of, the
     merger, and management's view of the risks and uncertainties associated
     with not pursuing the merger;

          (f) reviewed and discussed the past and current operations and
     financial condition and the prospects of Newfield, including information
     relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits
     anticipated from the merger, with management of Newfield;

          (g) reviewed the pro forma impact of the transaction on Newfield's
     cash flow per share, oil and gas reserves and production and financial
     ratios;

          (h) reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for EEX common
     stock and Newfield common stock;

          (i) compared the financial performance of EEX and Newfield and the
     prices and trading activity of EEX common stock and Newfield common stock
     with that of certain comparable publicly-traded companies and their
     securities;

          (j) reviewed certain reserve reports prepared by EEX and EEX's
     independent reserve engineers;

          (k) reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of
     certain comparable acquisition transactions;

          (l) participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives
     of EEX and Newfield and their financial and legal advisors;

          (m) reviewed a draft of the merger agreement and certain related
     documents; and

          (n) performed such other analyses and considered such other factors as
     Morgan Stanley deemed appropriate.

     In rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without
independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information
supplied or otherwise made available to it for the purposes of its opinion. With
respect to the financial forecasts, including information relating to certain
strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the merger,
Morgan Stanley assumed that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting
the best currently available estimates and judgments of the future financial
performance of EEX and Newfield. Morgan Stanley did not receive financial
forecasts or internal financial or operating information for Newfield from
either Newfield or EEX. Instead, for the purposes of its analysis, Morgan
Stanley relied, with EEX's consent, on publicly available information of
Newfield, including certain financial forecasts and estimates for Newfield of
certain securities analysts contained in publicly available research reports.
Morgan Stanley relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment by
the management of EEX of (1) the strategic, financial and other benefits

expected to result from the merger and (2) the strategic rationale for, and the
timing of, the merger, and management's view of the risks and uncertainties
associated with not pursuing the merger.

     Morgan Stanley assumed that in connection with the receipt of all necessary
regulatory approvals for the proposed merger, no restrictions will be imposed
that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected
to be derived in the proposed merger. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that
the merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the
merger agreement, including, among other things, that the merger will be treated
as a tax-free reorganization pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. Morgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisals of
the assets or liabilities of EEX, nor has it been furnished with any such
appraisals, other than the reserve reports referred to in (j) above. With
respect to reserve estimates and reports referred to in (b) and (j) above,
Morgan Stanley is not an expert in the engineering evaluation of oil and gas
properties and, with EEX's consent, relied, without independent verification,
upon the internal reserve estimates prepared by EEX. Morgan Stanley's opinion is
necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions in effect
on, and the information made available to it as of May 29, 2002.

     Morgan Stanley noted that, in accordance with the terms of the merger
agreement, a holder of EEX common stock may elect to receive trust units in lieu
of shares of Newfield common stock, and, as a result, holders of EEX common
stock may receive a combination of Newfield common stock and trust units in the
merger that is different from the combination that the other holders of EEX
common stock receive. Morgan Stanley's opinion addresses only the fairness, from
a financial point of view, of the aggregate consideration to be received by the
holders of shares of EEX common stock pursuant to the merger agreement to such
holders as a group, and does not address the fairness of the consideration to be
received by any individual holder of EEX common stock. In addition, Morgan
Stanley expresses no opinion as to the consideration to be received by the
holders of EEX preferred stock or the relative allocation of the consideration
to be received in the merger by the holders of EEX common stock and by the
holders of EEX preferred stock. Morgan Stanley's opinion does not address the
underlying business decision or the legal basis to effect the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement or the relative merits of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement as compared to any alternate business
transaction, or other alternative, whether or not such alternative could be
achieved. In addition, Morgan Stanley's opinion does not in any manner address
the prices at which the Newfield common stock will trade at any time, and Morgan
Stanley expresses no opinion or recommendation as to how the shareholders of EEX
should vote at the shareholders' meeting held in connection with the merger or
as to whether holders of EEX common stock should elect to receive any trust
units in lieu of Newfield common stock.

     The following is a brief summary of the material financial analyses
performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral opinion and the
preparation of its written opinion letter dated May 29, 2002. These summaries of
financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to
fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must
be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not
constitute a complete description of the financial analyses.

     Net Asset Valuation.  Morgan Stanley estimated EEX's net asset value using
two methodologies, one based on a discounted cash flow analysis and the other
based on precedent asset transactions analysis. Morgan Stanley estimated, at
various hydrocarbon pricing scenarios and a 10% discount rate, the present value
of the future pre-tax cash flows that EEX could be expected to generate from its
proved reserves as of December 31, 2001. In the analysis, Morgan Stanley assumed
three alternative cases for future oil and natural gas prices. The first
scenario was generated using the average futures prices listed on NYMEX on May
22, 2002. The second scenario was calculated using First Call median estimates
for future oil and gas prices as of May 22, 2002. The third scenario was used to
analyze the potential downside case with future commodity prices held constant
as estimated by Morgan Stanley. For each of the three scenarios, Morgan Stanley
calculated the unlevered free cash flows that EEX would be expected to generate
from its proved reserves during the fiscal years 2002 through 2016 and the value
of the remaining proved reserves projected at 2016 based upon engineering
projections prepared by the management of EEX. The unlevered

free cash flows and remaining value of proved reserves were then discounted to
obtain a present value using a discount rate of 10%. To those estimated values
for EEX's proved reserves, Morgan Stanley added assessments of the value of
certain other assets and liabilities of EEX, including, but not limited to,
other land, acreage, other assets, working capital, the book value of debt, the
present value of EEX's gas sales obligation and the value of its preferred stock
(based on 4.7 million shares of Newfield common stock to be received by the
holders of EEX preferred stock pursuant to the merger) based on information and
assumptions provided by EEX's management. The analysis resulted in an implied
value of EEX's common equity of $0 to $100 million.

     Morgan Stanley also estimated EEX's net asset value based on a precedent
asset transactions analysis. For this analysis, Morgan Stanley reviewed selected
financial and operating information for precedent asset transactions which
involved proved reserves that for the purposes of this analysis may be
considered to have similar operating and financial characteristics to those of
EEX's proved reserves. Morgan Stanley defined Firm Value as the sum of equity
market capitalization, total debt and preferred stock, minus cash and cash
equivalents. Mcfe was defined as one thousand cubic feet equivalent of natural
gas assuming a conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one
barrel of oil.

     The results of these analyses are as follows:

                                                       PRECEDENT ASSET     SELECTED VALUATION
                                                      TRANSACTIONS RANGE         RANGE
                                                      ------------------   ------------------

Firm Value/Proved Mcfe..............................   $0.72 - $2.08        $1.00 - $1.50

     Morgan Stanley applied the selected valuation range in the table above to
estimate the value of EEX's proved reserves as of December 31, 2001. To those
estimated values for EEX's proved reserves, Morgan Stanley added assessments of
the value of certain other assets and liabilities of EEX, including, but not
limited to, other land, acreage, other assets, working capital, the book value
of debt, the present value of EEX's gas sales obligation and the value of its
preferred stock (based on 4.7 million shares of Newfield common stock to be
received by the holders of EEX preferred stock pursuant to the merger) based on
information and assumptions provided by EEX's management. The analysis resulted
in an implied value of EEX's common equity of $0 to $114 million.

     No asset transaction utilized in the comparable asset transactions analysis
is identical to EEX or its assets. Mathematical analysis, such as determining
the average or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable
asset transaction data.

     Comparable Company Analysis.  Morgan Stanley reviewed selected financial
information, ratios and public market multiples for the following publicly
traded companies:

     - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.;

     - Magnum Hunter Resources Inc.;

     - St. Mary Land & Exploration Co.;

     - Swift Energy Co.;

     - Range Resources Corp.;

     - Comstock Resources, Inc.;

     - 3TEC Energy Corp.;

     - Meridian Resource Corp.; and

     - Brigham Exploration Co.

     The selected companies were chosen because they are publicly traded
companies that for purposes of this analysis may be considered similar to EEX.

     The multiples and ratios for each of the selected companies were based on
the most recent publicly available information and on closing prices as of May
24, 2002. Morgan Stanley defined EBITDAX as earnings before interest, taxes,
depletion, depreciation, amortization and exploration expense.

     The results of these analyses are as follows:

                                                     COMPARABLE COMPANY   SELECTED VALUATION
                                                           RANGE                RANGE
                                                     ------------------   ------------------

Firm Value/2002 Estimated EBITDAX..................     4.3 - 8.3            6.0 - 7.0
Firm Value/2003 Estimated EBITDAX..................     3.5 - 7.3            5.0 - 6.0
Firm Value/Proved Mcfe.............................   $1.00 - $1.88        $1.20 - $1.50

     Morgan Stanley applied the selected valuation range in the table above to
estimates prepared by the management of EEX. The analysis resulted in an implied
value of EEX's common equity of $0 to $120 million.

     No company utilized in the comparable company analysis is identical to EEX.
In evaluating the comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made judgments and
assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic,
market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the
control of EEX, such as the impact of competition on the business of EEX and the
industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse material
change in the financial condition and prospects of EEX or the industry or in the
financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the
average or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable
company data.

     Precedent Corporate Transactions Analysis.  Using publicly available
information, Morgan Stanley performed an analysis of the following precedent
corporate transactions that were comparable to the merger in certain respects:

     - Helmerich & Payne, Inc./Key Production Company, Inc.;

     - Magnum Hunter Resources Inc./Prize Energy Corp.;

     - Dominion Resources, Inc./Louis Dreyfus Corp.;

     - Devon Energy Corp./Mitchell Energy Corp.;

     - Westport Resources Corp./Belco Oil & Gas Corp.; and

     - Kerr-McGee Corp./HS Resources, Inc.

     The results of these analyses are as follows:

                                                      PRECEDENT CORPORATE   SELECTED VALUATION
                                                      TRANSACTIONS RANGE          RANGE
                                                      -------------------   ------------------

Firm Value/LTM EBITDAX..............................     3.2 - 8.6             4.5 - 6.5
Firm Value/Proved Mcfe..............................   $0.77 - $1.43         $1.15 - $1.40

     Morgan Stanley applied the selected valuation range in the table above to
estimates prepared by the management of EEX. The analysis resulted in an implied
value of EEX's common equity of $0 to $72 million.

     No transaction utilized as a comparison in the precedent corporate
transactions analysis is identical to the merger. In evaluating the transactions
listed above, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to
industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Newfield
or EEX, such as the impact of competition on Newfield, EEX and the industry
generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse material change in the
financial condition and prospects of Newfield, EEX or the industry or in the
financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the
average or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using precedent
corporate transaction data.

     90 Day Historical Range Analysis. Morgan Stanley reviewed the daily closing
price of EEX common stock for the 90 day period from February 24, 2002 to May
24, 2002. The value of EEX common equity during this period varied from $71
million to $102 million.

     Pro Forma Financial Results.  Morgan Stanley reviewed the pro forma impact
of the merger on Newfield's projected cash flow per share for the fiscal years
ended 2002 and 2003 based upon two cases for EEX's capital spending. One case
assumed EEX's capital spending would be limited to its available cash and
borrowing capacity and the other case assumed Newfield could increase EEX's
capital spending budget. The analysis was performed utilizing publicly available
securities research analyst estimates for Newfield and estimates for EEX
prepared by EEX management based on comparable commodity price forecasts. Based
on these estimates, the merger would be expected to be accretive to Newfield's
cash flow per share in 2002 and slightly dilutive to Newfield's cash flow per
share in 2003 based upon EEX's available capital spending budget and accretive
to Newfield's cash flow per share in 2002 and 2003 assuming Newfield could
increase EEX's capital spending, without giving effect to any potential
synergies that may result from the merger in either case.

     In connection with the review of the merger by the EEX Board of Directors,
Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for
purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a
complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or
summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the
results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular
weight to any particular analysis or factor considered by it. Furthermore,
Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of its analyses or factors
considered by it, without considering all analyses and factors as a whole, would
create an incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion. In addition,
Morgan Stanley may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight
than other analyses and factors and may have deemed various assumptions more or
less probable than other assumptions, so that the ranges of valuations resulting
from any particular analysis described above should therefore not be taken to be
Morgan Stanley's view of the actual value of EEX.

     In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with
respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Newfield or EEX. Any
estimates contained in Morgan Stanley's analysis are not necessarily indicative
of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those suggested by such estimates. The analyses performed were
prepared solely as part of Morgan Stanley's analysis of the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the aggregate consideration to be received by the
holders, as a group, of shares of EEX common stock pursuant to the merger
agreement and were conducted in connection with the delivery by Morgan Stanley
of its opinion dated May 29, 2002 to the EEX Board of Directors. The analyses do
not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which EEX common stock
actually may be valued or the prices at which the EEX common stock may actually
trade in the marketplace.

     In addition, as described above, Morgan Stanley's opinion and presentation
to the EEX Board of Directors was one of many factors taken into consideration
by the EEX Board of Directors in making its decision to approve the merger.
Consequently, the Morgan Stanley analyses as described above should not be
viewed as determinative of the opinion of the EEX Board of Directors with
respect to the value of EEX or its common stock or of whether the EEX Board of
Directors would have been willing to agree to a different consideration to be
received by the holders of shares of EEX common stock. The consideration
pursuant to the merger agreement and other terms of the merger agreement were
determined through arm's length negotiations between Newfield and EEX and were
approved by the EEX Board of Directors. Morgan Stanley provided advice to EEX
during the course of such negotiations; however, the decision to enter into the
merger agreement and to accept the consideration pursuant to the merger
agreement was solely that of the EEX Board of Directors. Morgan Stanley did not
recommend any specific consideration to EEX or that any given consideration
constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.

     Morgan Stanley is an internationally recognized investment banking and
advisory firm. Morgan Stanley, as part of its investment banking and financial
advisory business, is continuously engaged in the valuation of businesses and
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated
underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and
unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other
purposes. In the past, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have provided financial
advisory and financing services for EEX and have received fees for the rendering
of these services. In the ordinary course of Morgan Stanley's business, Morgan
Stanley or its affiliates may from time to time trade in the securities of or
indebtedness of EEX and Newfield for its own account, the accounts of investment
funds and other clients under the management of Morgan Stanley and for the
accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short
position in these securities or indebtedness.

     Pursuant to the engagement letter dated September 15, 2000 between EEX and
Morgan Stanley, EEX agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a customary fee for Morgan
Stanley's financial advisory services. EEX has also agreed to reimburse Morgan
Stanley for its expenses incurred in performing its services. In addition, EEX
has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, their respective
directors, officers, agents and employees and each person, if any, controlling
Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities and
expenses, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws,
related to or arising out of Morgan Stanley's engagement and any related
transactions.

  JPMORGAN

     On May 29, 2002, JPMorgan delivered its written opinion to the EEX Board of
Directors, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to
certain matters stated therein, the aggregate consideration to be received by
the holders, as a group, of EEX common stock in the merger was fair, from a
financial point of view, to those holders. JPMorgan's opinion noted that, for
purposes of its opinion, JPMorgan assumed, with the consent of the EEX Board of
Directors, that the aggregate consideration to be received by the holders of EEX
common stock will consist solely of Newfield common stock, and that no such
holder will elect to receive any trust units in the merger.

     THE FULL TEXT OF THE JPMORGAN'S OPINION, WHICH SETS FORTH THE ASSUMPTIONS
MADE, FACTORS CONSIDERED AND LIMITATIONS UPON THE REVIEW UNDERTAKEN BY JPMORGAN
IN RENDERING ITS OPINION, IS INCLUDED AS ANNEX D. JPMORGAN'S WRITTEN OPINION WAS
ADDRESSED TO THE EEX BOARD OF DIRECTORS, WAS DIRECTED ONLY TO THE CONSIDERATION
TO BE RECEIVED BY THE HOLDERS, AS A GROUP, OF EEX COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER,
AND DID NOT CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION TO ANY EEX SHAREHOLDER AS TO HOW SUCH
SHAREHOLDER SHOULD VOTE ON THE MERGER OR ANY OTHER MATTER RELATED THERETO OR AS
TO WHETHER SUCH HOLDER SHOULD ELECT TO RECEIVE NEWFIELD COMMON STOCK OR TRUST
UNITS. THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL PROVISIONS OF JPMORGAN'S OPINION IS
QUALIFIED BY REFERENCE TO SUCH OPINION. EEX SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THIS
OPINION IN ITS ENTIRETY.

     In arriving at its opinion, JPMorgan, among other things:

     - reviewed a draft of the merger agreement dated May 29, 2002;

     - reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information
       concerning EEX and Newfield and the industries in which they operate;

     - compared the proposed financial terms of the merger with the publicly
       available financial terms of certain transactions involving companies
       JPMorgan deemed relevant and the consideration received for such
       companies;

     - compared the financial and operating performance of the business of
       Newfield and EEX with publicly available information concerning certain
       other companies JPMorgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and
       historical market prices of EEX common stock and Newfield common stock
       and certain publicly traded securities of those other companies;

     - reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by
       the management of EEX relating to its business and equity research
       reports with respect to Newfield and its business;

     - reviewed copies of reports relating to oil and gas reserves of EEX
       provided by EEX and copies of summary information relating to oil and gas
       reserves of Newfield;

     - discussed with management of EEX alternatives available to EEX in the
       absence of the merger; and

     - performed other financial studies and analyses and considered other
       information deemed appropriate for the purposes of its opinion by
       JPMorgan.

     JPMorgan held discussions with certain members of the management of
Newfield and EEX with respect to certain aspects of the merger, and the past and
current business operations of Newfield and EEX, the financial condition and
future prospects and operations of Newfield and EEX, the effects of the merger
on the financial condition and future prospects of EEX and Newfield, and certain
other matters JPMorgan believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.
JPMorgan's opinion noted that it did not receive any financial analyses or
forecasts from Newfield as to Newfield's projected financial performance.

     In giving its opinion, JPMorgan relied upon and assumed, without
independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all information that
was publicly available or was furnished to it by Newfield or EEX or otherwise
reviewed by it, and JPMorgan did not assume any responsibility or liability
therefor. JPMorgan did not conduct any valuation or appraisal of any assets or
liabilities, nor have any valuations or appraisals been provided to it (other
than the reserve reports), and JPMorgan did not assume any responsibility or
liability for undertaking any valuation or appraisal of EEX or Newfield, or as
to the solvency of or issues relating to solvency concerning EEX. In relying on
financial analyses and forecasts provided to it, JPMorgan assumed that they were
reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of
operations and financial condition of EEX to which such analyses or forecasts
relate. JPMorgan also assumed that the merger would qualify as a tax-free
reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes, and that the
merger and the other transactions contemplated by the agreement would be
consummated as described in the agreement. JPMorgan relied as to all legal
matters relevant to rendering its opinion upon the advice of counsel. JPMorgan
also assumed that the definitive agreement would not differ in any material
respects from the draft thereof furnished to JPMorgan. JPMorgan further assumed
that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals
necessary for the consummation of the merger will be obtained without any
adverse effect on Newfield or on EEX or on the contemplated benefits of the
merger.

     JPMorgan's opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other
conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to JPMorgan as
of, the date of its opinion. Subsequent developments may affect the written
opinion, and JPMorgan does not have any obligation to update, revise, or
reaffirm that opinion. JPMorgan's opinion was limited to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the aggregate consideration to be received by the
holders, as a group, of EEX common stock in the proposed merger. JPMorgan
expressed no opinion as to the underlying decision by EEX to engage in the
merger. JPMorgan expressed no opinion as to the price at which Newfield common
stock will trade at any future time. In addition, JPMorgan expressed no opinion
as to the consideration to be received by the holders of EEX preferred stock or
the relative allocation of the consideration to be received in the merger by the
holders of EEX common stock and by the holders of EEX preferred stock.

     JPMorgan was not engaged to and did not provide advice concerning the
structure, the specific amount of the consideration paid to holders of EEX
common stock, or manner, timing or form of payment of, the consideration, or any
other aspects of the merger, or to provide services other than the delivery of
its opinion. JPMorgan was not authorized to and did not solicit any expressions
of interest from any other parties with respect to the sale of all or any part
of EEX or any other alternative transaction. JPMorgan did not participate in
negotiations with respect to the terms of the merger or any related
transactions. Consequently, JPMorgan assumed that such terms were the most
beneficial terms from EEX's perspective

that could under the circumstances be negotiated among the parties to those
transactions, and JPMorgan expressed no opinion whether any alternative
transaction might produce consideration for the holders of EEX common stock in
an amount in excess of that contemplated in the merger.

     In accordance with customary investment banking practice, JPMorgan employed
generally accepted valuation methods in reaching its opinion. The following is a
summary of the material financial analyses utilized by JPMorgan in connection
with delivering its opinion.

  Analysis of EEX

     Selected Public Companies Analysis.  Using publicly available information,
including analyst consensus estimates provided by First Call and balance sheet
items from company filings for March 31, 2002, JPMorgan compared certain
financial and operating information and ratios for EEX with the corresponding
financial and operating information for the following five exploration and
production oil and gas companies:

     - Range Resources Corporation;

     - The Meridian Resource Corporation;

     - 3TEC Energy Corporation;

     - KCS Energy, Inc.; and

     - Abraxas Petroleum Corporation.

     Using closing prices per share as of May 24, 2002, this analysis indicated
that:

     - the ratio of the equity market value to projected cash flow in 2003
       ranged from 1.0x to 3.6x, with a mean of 2.1x and a median of 1.6x; and

     - the ratio of the firm value, which is defined as equity market value plus
       total long-term debt minus cash plus liquidation preference of preferred
       stock plus minority interest, to the most recently disclosed quantity of
       estimated proved reserves, on a dollars per millions of cubic feet
       equivalent, which is referred to as Mcfe, ranged from $1.30 to $1.70,
       with a mean of $1.46 and a median of $1.43.

     Using EEX management projections and applying a reference range of 1.5x to
1.9x as the multiple of projected cash flow per share in 2003, this analysis
indicated a range of implied values of EEX common stock of approximately $71
million to $90 million. Using EEX's estimated proved reserves as of December 31,
2001 and applying a reference range of $1.35 to $1.50 per Mcfe, this analysis
indicated a range of implied values of EEX common stock of approximately $22
million to $84 million. These ranges of implied values of EEX common stock
compare to the implied value of the consideration to be received by the holders
of EEX common stock in the merger of approximately $89 million based upon the
closing price per share of Newfield common stock on May 24, 2002 of $37.19.

     Selected Transaction Analysis.  Using publicly available information,
including analyst consensus estimates provided by First Call, as well as
estimates prepared by John S. Herold, Inc., JPMorgan examined four selected
transactions in the exploration and production industry to value EEX. The
transactions considered and the month and year in which each transaction was
announced were:

     - Noble Affiliates Inc.'s acquisition of the onshore assets of Aspect
       Energy (December 2001);

     - Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation's acquisition of Cody Company (the parent of
       Cody Energy LLC) (June 2001);

     - Pure Resources, Inc.'s acquisition of Hallwood Energy Corporation (March
       2001); and

     - Pogo Producing Company's acquisition of NORIC Corp. (the parent of North
       Central Oil Corp.) (November 2000).

     The analysis indicated that the consideration paid divided by the most
recently disclosed quantity of estimated proved reserves, on a dollars per Mcfe
equivalent, ranged from $0.91 to $1.47, with a mean of $1.30 and a median of
$1.41.

     Using EEX's estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2001 and applying
a reference range of $1.20 to $1.45 per Mcfe, this analysis indicated a range of
implied values of EEX common stock of $0 to approximately $63 million, compared
to the implied value of the consideration to be received by the holders of EEX
common stock in the merger of approximately $89 million based upon the closing
price per share of Newfield common stock on May 24, 2002 of $37.19.

     Net Asset Value Analysis.  JPMorgan conducted a net asset value analysis to
estimate the net asset value of EEX common stock. Using financial forecasts
provided by EEX management, JPMorgan estimated EEX's net asset value by
discounting the projected after-tax cash flows from EEX at rates of 10% to 12%,
and by applying a risk weighting for proved reserves of 100% and for probable
and possible reserves of 0%. This analysis indicated a range of implied values
of EEX common stock of approximately $18 million to $105 million, compared to
the implied value of the consideration to be received by the holders of EEX
common stock in the merger of approximately $89 million based upon the closing
price per share of Newfield common stock on May 24, 2002 of $37.19.

     Historical Stock Performance.  JPMorgan reviewed historical trading prices
for EEX common stock. This stock price performance review indicated that for the
period ended May 24, 2002, the one month, the three month, the six month, and
the twelve month average closing prices for EEX common stock were $1.87, $1.97,
$1.98 and $2.27 per share, respectively.

  Analysis of Newfield

     Selected Public Companies Analysis.  Using publicly available information,
including analyst consensus estimates provided by First Call, JPMorgan compared
certain financial and operating information and ratios for Newfield with the
corresponding financial and operating information for the following five
exploration and production oil and gas companies:

     - Pogo Producing Company;

     - Forest Oil Corporation;

     - Stone Energy Corporation;

     - The Houston Exploration Company; and

     - Remington Oil and Gas Corporation.

     Using the closing prices per share as of May 24, 2002, this analysis
indicated that:

     - the ratio of the equity market value to projected cash flow in 2003
       ranged from 3.5x to 5.4x, with a mean of 4.4x and a median of 4.2x;

     - the ratio of the firm value to projected earnings before interest, taxes,
       depreciation, amortization and exploration expense, which is referred to
       as EBITDAX, in 2003 ranged from 4.1x to 6.3x, with a mean of 5.2x and a
       median of 5.0x; and

     - the ratio of the firm value to the most recently disclosed quantity of
       estimated proved reserves, on a dollars per Mcfe equivalent, ranged from
       $1.41 to $2.90, with a mean of $2.02 and a median of $1.97.

     Using analyst consensus estimates provided by First Call and applying a
reference range of 4.00x to 4.75x as the multiple of projected cash flow per
share in 2003, this analysis indicated a range of implied values of Newfield of
approximately $35.10 to $41.70 per share. Using analyst consensus estimates by
First Call and applying a range of 4.50x to 5.25x as the multiple of projected
2003 EBITDAX, this analysis indicated a range of implied values of Newfield of
approximately $36.50 to $43.90 per share. Using Newfield's estimated proved
reserves as of December 31, 2001 and applying a range of $2.00 to $2.50 per

Mcfe, this analysis indicated a range of implied values of Newfield of
approximately $30.10 to $39.60 per share.

     Historical Stock Performance.  JPMorgan reviewed historical trading prices
for Newfield common stock. This stock price performance review indicated that
for the one year period ended May 24, 2002, the current, the high and the low
closing prices for Newfield common stock were $37.19, $39.15 and $26.25 per
share, respectively.

     The summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete description
of the analyses or data presented by JPMorgan. The preparation of a fairness
opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. JPMorgan believes that the summary set forth
above and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions
thereof, without considering all of its analyses, could create an incomplete
view of the processes underlying its analyses and opinion. JPMorgan based its
analyses on assumptions that it deemed reasonable, including assumptions
concerning general business and economic conditions and industry-specific
factors. The other principal assumptions upon which JPMorgan based its analyses
are set forth above under the description of each such analysis. JPMorgan's
analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future
results that might be achieved, which values may be higher or lower than those
indicated. Moreover, JPMorgan's analyses are not and do not purport to be
appraisals or otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually
could be bought or sold.

     None of the companies used in the selected public companies analysis
described above is identical to EEX or Newfield, and none of the transactions
used in the selected transaction analysis described above is identical to the
merger. Accordingly, an analysis of publicly traded comparable companies and
transactions is not exclusively mathematical; rather it involves complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating
characteristics of the comparable companies and other factors that could affect
the public trading value of the comparable companies or company to which they
are being compared.

     As a part of its investment banking business, JPMorgan and its affiliates
are continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control
purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and
unlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for estate, corporate
and other purposes. JPMorgan was selected to deliver an opinion to EEX's Board
of Directors with respect to the merger on the basis of such experience and
JPMorgan's familiarity with EEX.

     For services rendered in connection with the delivery of its opinion, EEX
has agreed to pay JPMorgan a customary fee upon consummation of the merger. In
addition, EEX has agreed to reimburse JPMorgan for its expenses incurred in
connection with its services, including the fees and disbursements of counsel,
and will indemnify JPMorgan against certain liabilities, including liabilities
arising under the federal securities laws.

     Certain of JPMorgan's affiliates are agent bank on credit facilities for
each of EEX and Newfield and JPMorgan and its affiliates have in the past
provided other commercial and investment banking services for EEX and Newfield,
respectively, for which it would receive customary compensation. JPMorgan's
opinion noted that, as of the date of its opinion, EEX was in default under its
old credit facility.

     In addition, in the ordinary course of their businesses, JPMorgan and its
affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities and loans of EEX or
Newfield for their own account or for the accounts of customers and,
accordingly, they may at any time hold long or short positions in such
securities or loans.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER

     In considering the recommendation of EEX's Board of Directors with respect
to the merger, EEX's shareholders should be aware that certain of EEX's
directors and executive officers have interests respecting the merger separate
from and in addition to their interests as holders of EEX common stock,

including those referred to below. EEX's Board of Directors was aware of these
interests and considered them in approving the merger.

 EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS, CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENTS AND SEVERANCE ARRANGEMENTS;
 OPTION PLANS

     The merger will constitute a change in control for purposes of EEX's stock
option plans and other benefit plans. As a result of this change in control and
pursuant to action taken by EEX's Board of Directors and its Compensation
Committee, stock options, restricted shares and other benefits under EEX's plans
automatically became fully vested following the execution of the merger
agreement.

     Messrs. Thomas M Hamilton, David R. Henderson, Richard S. Langdon, Richard
L. Edmonson and Tracey E. Coats have each entered into employment contracts with
EEX that contain, among other things, provisions relating to the granting of
stock options, the award of restricted stock, and the provision of certain
benefits in the event of a termination of employment in connection with a change
in control of EEX. Each of Messrs. Hamilton, Henderson, Langdon, Edmonson and
Coats have also executed change in control agreements with EEX that provide
certain benefits in the event their employment is terminated subsequent to a
change in control of EEX (as defined in the change in control agreements). The
change in control agreements generally provide that if the officer is terminated
or, under certain circumstances, elects to terminate his employment within three
years following a change in control of EEX, the officer shall be entitled to a
lump-sum severance payment of three times the sum of the officer's base salary
and target bonus, a prorated bonus in the year of termination, the value over
the exercise price of certain unexercised stock options, a three-year
continuation of employee benefits, the equivalent of two years of service credit
under the retirement program, and reimbursement of certain legal fees, expenses,
and any excise taxes.

     In addition to the employment contracts and change in control agreements
described above, EEX maintains severance arrangements for certain key EEX
employees, including Messrs. Hamilton, Henderson, Langdon, Edmonson and Coats
and Mr. Robert W. Oliver. Certain enhanced severance benefits would be provided
to employees covered by the EEX Corporation Employee Stability Plan and the EEX
Corporation Employee Bonus Stability Plan upon certain terminations of
employment in connection with a change in control of EEX. Guaranteed bonuses
also would be provided to employees covered by EEX's Employee Bonus Program upon
certain terminations of employment in connection with a change in control of
EEX.

     In the event the same type of benefits or payments are payable under the
employment contracts, the change in control agreements and the other severance
arrangements, the officers will receive the highest benefit or payment, but not
duplicate benefits or payments.

     Newfield does not expect to retain any of the executive officers of EEX as
executive officers of EEX or Newfield after the merger. However, Newfield may
retain certain officers of EEX or other EEX personnel as employees of EEX or
Newfield following the merger. EEX anticipates that the aggregate amount to be
received by the above six officers under the change in control agreements, the
employment agreements or other severance arrangements as a result of the merger
will be approximately $12.9 million, in addition to any potential cash-out of
unexercised options to purchase EEX common stock. Because the per share exercise
price for each outstanding option is, in most cases, significantly in excess of
both the current trading price of EEX's common stock and the current market
value of the per share merger consideration (based on the current trading price
of Newfield's common stock), it is unlikely that any of these six officers will
be entitled to any such cash-out.

 INDEMNIFICATION

     The merger agreement provides that Newfield will, to the extent that EEX
would be permitted by applicable law or its bylaws, indemnify each person who
was, at the date of the merger agreement, or has been at any time prior to the
date of the merger agreement, or who becomes prior to the effective time of the
merger, an officer or director of EEX or any of its subsidiaries against all
losses, expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses), claims,
damages or liabilities or, subject to Newfield's written

consent, settlements that arise out of actions or omissions occurring at or
prior to the effective time of the merger (whether asserted or claimed prior to,
at or after the effective time of the merger) and that are, in whole or in part,
based on the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of such
party.

     The merger agreement also provides that, for a period of not less than six
years after the effective time of the merger, Newfield will, subject to certain
limitations, maintain EEX's existing directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies, but only to the extent related to actions or omissions prior
to the effective time of the merger.

     To the fullest extent permitted by law, all rights to indemnification as of
the date of the merger agreement in favor of directors, officers, employees and
agents of EEX and its subsidiaries with respect to their activities prior to the
effective time, as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation
and bylaws in effect on the date of the merger agreement, or otherwise in effect
on the date of the merger agreement, will survive the merger and will continue
in full force and effect.

 WARBURG PINCUS/HOWARD H. NEWMAN

     Warburg, Pincus & Co. is the sole general partner of Warburg, Pincus Equity
Partners, L.P., Warburg, Pincus Netherlands Equity Partners I, C.V., Warburg,
Pincus Netherlands Equity Partners II, C.V. and Warburg, Pincus Netherlands
Equity Partners III, C.V. (together, the WP Funds), private equity funds that
together own all of the outstanding shares of EEX preferred stock. Warburg
Pincus, L.L.C. (WP LLC) manages each of the WP Funds. Howard H. Newman is a
director of Newfield and EEX. In addition, Mr. Newman is a general partner of
Warburg, Pincus & Co. and a Vice Chairman, Managing Director and member of WP
LLC. Another private equity fund of which Warburg, Pincus & Co. is the sole
general partner owns 1,864,735 shares of Newfield common stock. WP LLC also
manages this private equity fund. Mr. Newman owns 65,226 shares of Newfield
common stock. Mr. Newman recused himself from the May 29, 2002 meeting of the
EEX Board of Directors, at which the merger agreement and the merger were
considered and approved, and certain other meetings of the EEX Board of
Directors at which the merger was discussed. In addition, Mr. Newman recused
himself from all meetings of the Newfield Board of Directors at which the merger
was discussed. See "The Merger -- Background of the Merger."

     Receipt of Newfield common stock in the Merger.  The WP Funds will receive
an aggregate of 4,700,000 shares of Newfield common stock in exchange for their
shares of EEX preferred stock. In addition, Mr. Newman owns 56,992 shares of EEX
common stock and options to purchase an additional 65,351 shares of EEX common
stock. Assuming he elects to receive in the merger a number of trust units equal
to the number of shares of EEX common stock that he owns, Mr. Newman
individually will receive 3,219 shares of Newfield common stock and 56,992 trust
units in exchange for the 56,992 shares of EEX common stock that he currently
holds. Mr. Newman's unexercised options to purchase EEX common stock shall be
cancelled upon consummation of the merger.

     Voting Agreement.  The WP Funds have entered into a voting agreement and
irrevocable proxy with Newfield, Thomas M Hamilton, David R. Henderson and
Richard S. Langdon (the chief executive officer, chief operating officer and
chief financial officer, respectively, of EEX) and David A. Trice and Terry W.
Rathert (Newfield's chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
respectively). Pursuant to the voting agreement, the WP Funds have agreed to,
and have granted to David A. Trice and Terry W. Rathert an irrevocable proxy to,
among other things, vote all of their shares of EEX preferred stock in favor of
the merger agreement and the merger and against any proposal or other matter
that could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or
materially affect the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The WP
Funds have also agreed to certain restrictions on their activities related to
the merger. See "Voting Agreement and Irrevocable Proxy."

     The voting agreement also provides that, effective at the consummation of
the merger:

     - the WP Funds will sell to Newfield all of the warrants to purchase EEX
       common stock held by the WP Funds for an aggregate purchase price of
       $10.00; and

     - the registration rights of the WP Funds under the Registration Rights
       Agreement dated as of January 8, 1999 by and among EEX and the WP Funds
       will terminate.

The voting agreement also provides that Newfield will reimburse the WP Funds for
50% of any filing fees paid by the WP Funds in connection with filings made
under the HSR Act if the merger is consummated. The WP Funds may terminate the
voting agreement if:

     - the merger agreement is amended without the consent of the WP Funds to
       increase the consideration payable to the holders of EEX common stock or
       to decrease the consideration payable to the WP Funds as the holders of
       EEX preferred stock; or

     - Newfield purchases or agrees to purchase any shares of EEX common stock
       at a per share purchase price greater than the product of (x) 0.05703 and
       (y) the market price of the Newfield common stock (as determined in the
       voting agreement).

     Registration Rights Agreement.  Concurrently with the execution of the
merger agreement, Newfield entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the
WP Funds that will take effect upon the consummation of the merger. Pursuant to
this agreement, Newfield is obligated to file with the SEC within 30 days of the
consummation of the merger, and to have declared effective by the SEC within 120
days of the consummation of the merger, a shelf registration statement under the
Securities Act to register the reoffering and resale of the shares of Newfield
common stock received by the WP Funds in the merger. Newfield will be required
to maintain the effectiveness of the shelf registration statement until all of
the shares of Newfield common stock received by the WP Funds in the merger have
been sold or until such time as such shares are eligible for sale under Rule
144(k) under the Securities Act. Pursuant to the registration rights agreement,
until the first anniversary of the consummation of the merger, the maximum
number of shares of Newfield common stock that any of the WP Funds may sell on
the New York Stock Exchange in any one month, with certain exceptions, is the
greater of (x) 25% of the average monthly trading volume of Newfield common
stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange for the previous two months and
(y) 20% of the number of shares of Newfield common stock issued to such WP Fund
in the merger. Newfield may suspend the WP Funds' use of any prospectus which is
part of a shelf registration statement if Newfield possesses material nonpublic
information. No such suspension may last longer than 45 consecutive days, and
all such suspensions may cover no more than an aggregate of 90 days within any
period of twelve consecutive months.

     In addition, if Newfield proposes to file a registration statement or a
prospectus supplement to an already effective shelf registration statement with
respect to an underwritten offering of Newfield common stock, the WP Funds will
have the right to include their shares of Newfield common stock in the
registration, subject to certain limitations.

     The registration rights agreement contains customary indemnification and
contribution provisions by Newfield for the benefit of the WP Funds. In
addition, each of the WP Funds has agreed to indemnify Newfield solely with
respect to information provided by such WP Fund, with such indemnification being
limited to the amount by which the proceeds received by such WP Fund exceeds the
amount of any loss that such WP Fund has otherwise been required to pay by
reason of such information.

     North Sea Joint Venture.  Newfield recently formed a subsidiary in the
United Kingdom and opened an office in London. Newfield is currently evaluating
opportunities in the North Sea. In connection with this evaluation, Newfield and
Warburg are currently discussing the terms of a potential North Sea joint
venture between the two parties. These discussions are not related to the
merger.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     The merger will be accounted for as a purchase, as such term is used under
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Accordingly, from
and after the effective time of the merger, EEX's consolidated results of
operations will be included in Newfield's consolidated results of operations.
For purposes of preparing its consolidated financial statements, Newfield will
establish a new accounting basis for EEX's assets and liabilities based upon
their estimated fair values and Newfield's purchase price,

including the costs of the acquisition. Accordingly, the purchase accounting
adjustments made in connection with the development of the unaudited pro forma
combined condensed financial information appearing elsewhere in this proxy
statement/prospectus are preliminary. These adjustments have been made solely
for purposes of developing such unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial
information to comply with disclosure requirements of the SEC. Although the
final purchase price allocation may differ materially, the unaudited pro forma
combined condensed financial information reflects Newfield's best estimate based
upon currently available information. For more information regarding the pro
forma allocation of the purchase price, see "Unaudited Pro Forma Combined
Condensed Financial Information."

GOVERNMENTAL AND REGULATORY APPROVALS

     Newfield is in the process of determining whether it is required to make a
pre-merger notification filing with the Federal Trade Commission under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. If a filing is required, the
merger cannot be completed until the expiration or early termination of the
waiting period required by that act.

     At any time before or after the effective time of the merger, the
Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general or
private persons or entities could seek under the antitrust or competition laws,
among other things, to enjoin the merger or to cause Newfield to divest itself,
in whole or in part, of EEX or of other businesses conducted by Newfield or EEX.
Newfield cannot assure you that a challenge to the merger will not be made or
that, if such a challenge is made, Newfield and EEX will prevail.

RIGHTS OF DISSENTING SHAREHOLDERS

     Under the Texas Business Corporation Act, EEX shareholders will not be
entitled to any appraisal or dissenters' rights in connection with the merger.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The following description does not purport to be complete and is qualified
in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is
attached as Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated
herein by reference. You are urged to read the merger agreement in its entirety.

THE MERGER

     A wholly owned subsidiary of Newfield will merge into EEX following the
required approval by the EEX shareholders of the merger agreement and the
satisfaction or, where permitted, waiver of the other conditions to the merger.

     EEX will survive the merger as Newfield's wholly owned subsidiary. If all
conditions to the merger are satisfied or waived, the merger will become
effective (1) at the time of the filing by EEX of the articles of merger with
the Texas Secretary of State or (2) at such later time as Newfield and EEX may
agree and as set forth in the articles of merger. The filing of the articles of
merger will occur as soon as practicable after the satisfaction or waiver of all
conditions to the merger.

     In addition, at the effective time of the merger, the articles of
incorporation of EEX shall be amended so that they are identical to the articles
of incorporation of the Newfield merger subsidiary in effect immediately prior
to the effective time of the merger. The bylaws of the Newfield merger
subsidiary as in effect immediately prior to the effective time will be the
bylaws of EEX at and after the effective time of the merger. The officers and
directors of the merger subsidiary immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger will be the officers and directors of EEX once the merger is
consummated.

TREATMENT OF EEX COMMON STOCK AND FRACTIONAL SHARES

     Each share of EEX common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger will be converted into .05703 of a share of
Newfield common stock (including the associated preferred stock purchase rights
set forth in Newfield's rights agreement). However, if the holder of such share
makes an election to receive units of Newfield's newly-created royalty trust,
then such share will be converted into (A) the quotient of (x) the number of
whole trust units elected to be received by, and that are allocated to, such
holder pursuant to the procedures set forth in the merger agreement divided by
(y) the number of shares of EEX common stock covered by the election form for
such holder and (B) the fraction of one share of Newfield common stock, if any,
remaining after reducing the exchange ratio set forth above by the quotient of
(x) .00054 multiplied by the number of trust units allocated to such holder and
(y) the number of shares of EEX common stock covered by the election form for
such holder. Newfield will not issue any fractional shares of Newfield common
stock. Holders of EEX common stock will receive cash, without interest, in lieu
of fractional shares.

     All shares of EEX common stock will no longer be outstanding upon
conversion and will automatically be canceled and retired, and the holder of a
certificate that, immediately prior to the effective time of the merger,
represented outstanding shares of EEX common stock will no longer have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration to be
issued or paid pursuant to the merger agreement upon the surrender of such
certificate.

     All shares of common stock of EEX (including the associated preferred stock
purchase rights set forth in EEX's shareholder rights plan) that are held in
EEX's treasury will be canceled and retired and no cash, capital stock or other
consideration will be delivered in exchange for any shares held in EEX's
treasury.

TREATMENT OF EEX PREFERRED STOCK AND FRACTIONAL SHARES

     The shares of EEX preferred stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, plus all accrued and
unpaid dividends, will be converted into an aggregate of 4,700,000 shares of
Newfield common stock (including the associated preferred stock purchase rights
set forth in Newfield's rights agreement), and each holder of EEX preferred
stock will receive a pro rata portion of

such shares of Newfield common stock based on such holder's ownership of EEX
preferred stock immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. Holders
of EEX preferred stock will not have the option to elect to receive trust units.
All shares of EEX preferred stock will no longer be outstanding upon conversion
and will automatically be canceled and retired, and the holder of a certificate
that, immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, represented shares
of EEX preferred stock will no longer have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the consideration to be issued or paid pursuant to
the merger agreement in consideration upon the surrender of such certificate.

TREATMENT OF EEX OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK AND WARRANTS

     The EEX Board of Directors and its Compensation Committee have caused all
stock options granted under any EEX stock option plan outstanding on May 29,
2002, the date of the merger agreement, to become fully vested and exercisable
as of the date of the merger agreement. Any stock options that are granted after
May 29, 2002 will be fully vested and exercisable on the date of such grant. All
unexercised vested options shall terminate at the effective time of the merger.
As soon as practicable following the effective time of the merger, the holders
of such options will receive, with respect to each share of EEX common stock
underlying such unexercised options, a cash payment equal to the amount, if any,
by which the closing price of Newfield common stock on the last trading day
before the effective date of the merger multiplied by the exchange ratio of
...05703 exceeds the exercise price for such share. Because the per share exercise
price for each outstanding option is, in most cases, significantly in excess of
the current trading price of EEX's common stock and in excess of the current
market value of the per share merger consideration (based on the current trading
price of Newfield's common stock), Newfield does not expect any holders of
outstanding options to exercise their options or to be entitled to any payment
upon termination of their options at the effective time of the merger.

     All restrictions on unvested shares of restricted stock will terminate
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.

     Pursuant to the voting agreement, at the effective time of the merger,
Newfield will purchase from the WP Funds all outstanding warrants to purchase
shares of EEX common stock. See "Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger --
Warburg Pincus/Howard H. Newman -- Voting Agreement."

TREASURE ISLAND ROYALTY TRUST

     On June 17, 2002, Newfield caused the Treasure Island Royalty Trust to be
created as an express trust under the laws of the State of Texas pursuant to a
trust agreement between Newfield, as grantor, and certain individuals, as
trustees. At closing of the merger, Newfield and Wachovia Bank, National
Association, as successor trustee, will enter into an amended and restated trust
agreement. Thereafter, the trust and the respective rights of and obligations of
Newfield, the trustee and the trust unitholders with respect to the trust will
be governed by that document. The royalty trust will own overriding royalty
interests in any future production that may be achieved from stratigraphic
intervals at depths typically below 18,000 to 21,000 feet from EEX's Treasure
Island project, an exploration concept covering 116 Gulf of Mexico lease blocks
located on the federal Outer Continental Shelf in which EEX currently holds 27
leases and may acquire additional leases in the future. There is no production,
and there are no proved reserves, currently associated with the royalty
interests. After the effective time of the merger, Newfield will distribute
units in the trust to holders of shares of EEX common stock who elect to receive
such units as a part of the merger consideration, subject to the election and
allocation procedures described below. After the effective time of the merger,
but on or before the date Newfield causes the royalty trust to issue the trust
units to the electing shareholders, Newfield will cause EEX or its subsidiaries
to convey the overriding royalty interests, pursuant to a master conveyance of
overriding royalty interest and related recordable conveyances, to the royalty
trust in consideration for the issuance by the royalty trust to Newfield of
42,574,298 trust units, representing ownership of the entire beneficial interest
in the assets of the royalty trust. This conveyance will be effective as of the
effective time of the merger.

ELECTION AND ALLOCATION OF TRUST UNITS

     An election form will entitle the holder of shares of EEX common stock to
elect to receive whole trust units in lieu of all or any portion of Newfield
common stock that the holder would otherwise receive in the merger. However, no
holder of EEX common stock may elect to receive more trust units than the
product of (A) 105.611 and (B) the number of shares of EEX common stock owned by
that holder, rounded down to the nearest whole trust unit. Newfield will not
issue any partial trust units. EEX will use all reasonable efforts to make an
election form available to all persons who become holders of record of shares of
EEX common stock between the date of mailing of this proxy statement/prospectus
and the deadline for submitting election forms.

     A total of 42,574,298 trust units will be available. If the holders of EEX
common stock elect to receive in the aggregate no more than 42,574,298 trust
units, then each electing shareholder will be allocated the full number of trust
units elected to be received by such electing shareholder. If the holders of EEX
common stock elect to receive in the aggregate more than 42,574,298 trust units,
then each electing holder will be allocated a number of whole trust units equal
to the sum of (A) the lesser of (1) the number of trust units the electing
holder elected to receive and (2) the number of shares of EEX common stock
covered by the election form for such holder plus (B) the product of (1) the
result of 42,574,298 less the aggregate number of trust units allocated to all
electing holders pursuant to clause (A) above multiplied by (2) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the amount, if any, by which the number of trust units
such electing holder elected to receive exceeds the number of trust units
allocated to that holder pursuant to clause (A) above and the denominator of
which is the amount by which the aggregate number of trust units elected to be
received by all electing holders exceeds the aggregate number of trust units
allocated to all electing holders pursuant to clause (A) above, rounded down to
the nearest whole trust unit.

       expenditures in excess of $1,000,000 outside the capital budget, as
       amended and approved by EEX prior to the date of the merger agreement;
       and

     - agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

  CONDUCT OF NEWFIELD'S BUSINESS PENDING THE MERGER

     Newfield has agreed that prior to the effective time of the merger it will

       market value, except in an underwritten offering or in a "bought deal"
       with one or more investment banks; and

     - agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

  NO SOLICITATION

     EEX has agreed that it will not, and that it will not authorize or permit
any of its subsidiaries or any of its or its subsidiaries' directors, officers,
employees, agents, representatives, investment bankers, attorneys and
accountants or any other person to:

     - initiate, solicit, or knowingly encourage or otherwise facilitate
       (including by providing any nonpublic information relating to EEX and its

       or the consummation of any transaction contemplated by, an acquisition
       proposal (as defined below);

     - engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or provide any nonpublic

     Notwithstanding anything in the merger agreement to the contrary, EEX or
its Board of Directors may:

     - to the extent applicable, comply with Rules 14e-2(a) and 14d-9
       promulgated under the Exchange Act; and

     - prior to obtaining the approval of the EEX shareholders required to
       approve the merger agreement, furnish information to, and negotiate or
       otherwise engage in discussions with, any person who has indicated the
       willingness to make or has made an acquisition proposal, provided that
       (i) no information may be furnished unless EEX then has or obtains a
       confidentiality agreement from such person with terms no less favorable
       to EEX than those contained in the EEX confidentiality agreement with
       Newfield and that permits EEX to comply with its obligations under the
       merger agreement and EEX has provided a copy of such confidentiality
       agreement to Newfield and (ii) EEX may not commence negotiations or
       discussions with or provide information to any such

       person until 48 hours after EEX has advised Newfield of its intention to
       take any such actions and unless the EEX Board of Directors has
       determined in good faith by the affirmative vote of a majority of its
       members, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that such
       action is necessary for the EEX Board of Directors to comply with its
       fiduciary duties under applicable law.

     EEX must notify Newfield in writing within 24 hours of any inquiries,
proposals or offers, or any discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated
or continued by any person with EEX, any of its subsidiaries, any of its or its
subsidiaries' directors, officers and employees or any of the EEX
representatives relating to, constituting or which would reasonably be expected
to lead to an acquisition proposal or any request by any person for information
relating to EEX or any of its subsidiaries contemplating, relating to or which
would reasonably be expected to lead to any acquisition proposal. Such notice
shall include the name of such person and the material terms and conditions of
any proposal, inquiry, offer or request, and EEX must provide within 24 hours
such other details of the acquisition proposal, inquiry, offer or request as
Newfield may reasonably request. EEX must keep Newfield fully informed on a
prompt basis of the status and terms, including any material changes or
adjustments made to or proposed to be made to the terms, of any such inquiry,
proposal, offer or request. If EEX is permitted to provide information to any
person it must provide to Newfield a list of, and copies of, the information
provided to such person concurrently with delivery to such person and
immediately provide Newfield with access to all information to which such person
was provided access.

     EEX must immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations by it, any of its subsidiaries, any of
its or its subsidiaries' directors, officers and employees or any of the EEX
representatives with any person with respect to any acquisition proposal.

     An "acquisition proposal" means a bona fide proposal or public announcement
of an intention to do any of the following (other than the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement or the merger): (a) any merger,
amalgamation, arrangement, tender offer, share exchange, take-over bid,
recapitalization, consolidation or other business combination directly or
indirectly involving EEX or one or more of its subsidiaries with aggregate net
revenues or assets of 35% or more of EEX's consolidated net revenues (based on
the most recent income statement filed with the SEC) or consolidated assets
(based on fair market value), as applicable, (b) any acquisition by any person
or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of any business
that constitutes 35% or more of EEX's consolidated net revenues (based on the
most recent income statement filed with the SEC), or assets representing 35% or
more of EEX's assets on a consolidated basis (based on fair market value) (or
any lease, long-term supply agreement, exchange, mortgage, pledge or other
arrangement having a similar economic effect) in each case in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions or (c) any acquisition of
beneficial ownership (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of 35%
or more of the voting capital stock of EEX or any of its subsidiaries by any
person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act).

  LISTING OF NEWFIELD COMMON STOCK

     Newfield has agreed to use all reasonable efforts to cause the common stock
to be issued in the merger to be approved for listing on the New York Stock
Exchange prior to the effective time of the merger, subject to official notice
of issuance.

  INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

     Newfield has agreed, to the extent that EEX would be permitted by
applicable law or its bylaws, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person
who is now, or has been at any time or who becomes prior to the effective time
of the merger, an officer or director of EEX or any of its subsidiaries against
all losses, expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses),
claims, damages or liabilities or, upon Newfield's written consent, settlements
arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time
of the merger, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the effective
time of the merger, based on or arising out of the fact, in whole or in part,
that such person is or was a director or

officer of such party and, to the fullest extent that EEX would be permitted
under applicable law, to advance expenses to the indemnified person.

     In addition, Newfield has agreed to maintain EEX's existing officers' and
directors' liability insurance policy for a period of not less than six years
after the effective time of the merger, but only to the extent related to
actions or omissions prior to the effective time of the merger; provided, that
Newfield may substitute policies of substantially similar coverage and amounts
containing terms no less advantageous to such former directors or officers if
the carrier of the substitute policies maintains a Best rating equal to or
greater than EEX's existing carrier and the substitution will not result in gaps
or lapses of coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the effective
time of the merger; provided, further, that in no event will Newfield be
required to expend annually more than 200% of the last annual premium paid by
EEX before the date of the merger agreement.

  TAX TREATMENT

     Each of Newfield, the merger subsidiary and EEX have agreed to use all
reasonable efforts to cause the merger to qualify, and will not take, nor permit
any subsidiary to take, any actions which could prevent the merger from
qualifying, as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code.

  UNWIND OF GAS SALES OBLIGATION

     Prior to August 31, 2002, EEX has agreed to use all reasonable efforts to
cause Enron North America Corp. or its applicable affiliate to take all
necessary actions to obtain bankruptcy court approval of a plan submitted by
Enron North America Corp. or its applicable affiliate to terminate the gas sales
obligation between a subsidiary of EEX and an affiliate of Enron North America
Corp. and to effect certain other actions and guarantees in connection with the
termination of the gas sales obligation, including the termination of related
liens on the assets and properties of EEX's subsidiary and the termination of
related guarantees by such subsidiary, all on terms and conditions reasonably
satisfactory to Newfield.

TERMINATION

     The merger agreement may be terminated and the merger may be abandoned at
any time prior to the effective time of the merger, whether before or after the
approval by the EEX shareholders of the merger agreement has been obtained:

     - by the mutual written consent of Newfield and EEX;

     - by Newfield or by EEX upon a breach by the other of any representation,
       warranty, covenant, obligation or agreement contained in the merger
       agreement or if any representation or warranty of the other is untrue, so
       that the conditions to the closing of the merger in the merger agreement
       would not be satisfied and where the breach or untruth is not curable or
       if curable, is not cured within 30 days after notice thereof has been
       received by the other party;

     - by Newfield or by EEX if any governmental authority or court of competent
       jurisdiction adopts any law or amendment to any law or issues any order,
       decree or ruling or taken any other action which would permanently
       restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the merger and such governmental
       order has become final and nonappealable, provided that the party seeking
       to terminate the merger agreement on this basis has used all reasonable
       efforts to remove or lift such governmental order;

     - by Newfield or by EEX if the merger is not completed on or before
       November 30, 2002; provided, however, that the failure to complete the
       merger is not the result of a failure by the party seeking to terminate
       the merger agreement or its affiliates to perform any covenant,
       obligation or agreement contained in the merger agreement;

     - by Newfield or by EEX if the required approval of EEX shareholders has
       not been obtained at the EEX Special Meeting (including any adjournment
       or postponement thereof);

     - by Newfield if the EEX Board of Directors fails to recommend, or
       withdraws, modifies or changes in any manner adverse to Newfield its
       recommendation of, the merger agreement and the merger to the EEX
       shareholders or resolves to do so, approves or recommends any acquisition
       proposal (other than an acquisition proposal by Newfield) or resolves to
       do so, or has not sent to its shareholders pursuant to Rule 14e-2 under
       the Exchange Act a statement disclosing that it recommends rejection of
       any tender or exchange offer relating to its securities that has been
       commenced by a person unaffiliated with Newfield within ten business days
       after such tender or exchange offer is first published, sent or given; or

     - by EEX at any time prior to receipt of its shareholders' approval, upon
       48 hours prior written notice to Newfield, if a superior proposal (as
       defined below) has been made and not been withdrawn, the superior
       proposal did not result from a breach of the no solicitation provisions
       under the merger agreement, the EEX Board of Directors has determined in
       good faith by the affirmative vote of a majority of its members that
       action is necessary to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable
       law as the result of the superior proposal and Newfield does not make,
       within 48 hours of receipt of EEX's written notification of its intention
       to terminate the merger agreement, a written offer that the EEX Board of
       Directors determines in good faith, is at least as favorable, from a
       financial point of view, to the EEX shareholders as the superior
       proposal.

     A "superior proposal " means any bona fide written proposal by a third
person directly or indirectly, to acquire businesses representing more than 50%
of EEX's consolidated net revenues (based on the most recent income statement
filed with the SEC), or assets representing more than 50% of EEX's total assets
on a consolidated basis (based on fair market value), or more than 50% of EEX's
voting capital stock, whether by way of merger, amalgamation, arrangement,
tender offer, share exchange, take-over bid, recapitalization, consolidation,
sale of assets or otherwise, that in the good faith determination by affirmative
vote of a majority of the members of the EEX Board of Directors, after taking
into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal
and the person making such proposal, (a) is reasonably capable of being
completed without undue delay and (b) is more favorable to EEX's shareholders
from a financial point of view than the merger.

EFFECT OF TERMINATION

     If the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its termination
provisions, none of Newfield, the merger subsidiary, or EEX, or any of their
respective officers or directors, will have any liability to any of the other
parties to the merger agreement, except as described below. EEX will be required
to pay a termination fee of $13.5 million to Newfield if:

     - it terminates the merger at its option because the merger is not
       completed by November 30, 2002 and, within 12 months after the date of
       such termination, it enters into any agreement for or completes a change
       of control transaction;

     - it terminates the merger agreement at its option because it failed to
       obtain shareholder approval and, within 12 months after the termination
       date, it or any of its subsidiaries enters into any agreement for or
       completes a change of control transaction;

     - Newfield terminates the merger agreement due to the EEX Board of
       Directors' change of recommendation of the merger or its recommendation
       of or failure to reject an acquisition proposal; or

     - it terminates the merger agreement upon receipt of a superior proposal.

     All rights and obligations of any party to the merger agreement shall
terminate, except for the confidentiality provisions of the merger agreement,
which will survive the termination for a period of two years from the date of
such termination and except for the publicity, fees, expenses and other payments
and attorneys' fees provisions, which will survive the termination indefinitely.

     The termination of the merger agreement will not relieve any party from
liability for any willful misrepresentation or inaccuracy in any of its
representations or warranties or any material breach or non-performance of any
of its covenants or agreements under the merger agreement.

                         TREASURE ISLAND ROYALTY TRUST

OVERVIEW

     Treasure Island Royalty Trust is an express trust created under the laws of
the state of Texas pursuant to a trust agreement entered into on June 17, 2002
between Newfield, as grantor, and certain individuals, as trustees. The trust
was created by Newfield to hold certain non-expense bearing overriding royalty
interests in any future production that may be achieved from stratigraphic
intervals at depths typically below 18,000 to 21,000 feet from EEX's Treasure
Island project, an exploration concept covering 116 Gulf of Mexico lease blocks
located on the federal Outer Continental Shelf in which EEX currently holds 27
leases and may acquire additional leases in the future. There is no production,
and there are no proved reserves, currently associated with the royalty
interests.

ROYALTY INTERESTS AND SUBJECT INTERESTS

  Royalty Interests

     The royalty interests to be conveyed to the trust will consist of
overriding royalty interests in certain oil and gas leases covering blocks
located within the Treasure Island project. The Treasure Island project is a
concept designed by EEX to explore for oil and gas in 116 blocks (which are
specific areas designated by the MMS) the Gulf of Mexico, offshore Louisiana and
Texas on the federal Outer Continental Shelf in stratigraphic intervals which
are below the salt weld at depths typically below 18,000 to 21,000 feet. EEX has
to date identified prospects in the Treasure Island project at various locations
in the South Timbalier, Ship Shoal, South Marsh Island and Eugene Island leasing
areas. The Treasure Island project targets Tertiary age intervals and structures
similar to the recent discovery at Thunder Horse in the Gulf of Mexico, as well
as Cretaceous intervals and structures analogous to the Poza Rica Field in the
Golden Lane trend of Mexico. These prospects target geological formations that
are deeper than conventional Gulf of Mexico prospects and therefore have greater
risks and costs associated with their exploration and development. Neither
Newfield nor EEX has sufficient information to offer any projection or estimate
as to the reserves, if any, that may be associated with the Treasure Island
project. No such projection or estimate can be made until such time as a
sufficient number of exploratory wells are drilled to the target depths and
tested and analyzed so as to provide a basis for determining possible
recoverable reserves.

     Overriding royalty interests in general are interests carved out of an oil
and gas lessee's working or cost-bearing interest under the lease entitling the
overriding royalty interest owner to a share of oil or gas production free of
the costs of exploration and production. The overriding royalty interest in the
Treasure Island project will be a 5% overriding royalty interest in and to the
hydrocarbons saved and produced from the subject interests (See "-- Subject
Interests" below), with such 5% interest being proportionately reduced to a 25%
working interest or such lesser working interest as may be owned by EEX. The 5%
overriding royalty interest will be reduced in the event that EEX owns or
subsequently acquires an interest in a lease in the Treasure Island project with
total existing leasehold burdens in excess of 20% but less than 30%. In that
event, the overriding royalty interest will be determined by taking the total
net revenue interest (of 8/8ths) in the lease divided by 80% times 5%, and then
proportionately reducing that product by the working interest acquired by EEX or
Newfield (up to a maximum 25% working interest) in such lease. In the event that
EEX owns or subsequently acquires an interest in a lease in the Treasure Island
project with total existing leasehold burdens of 30% or more, no overriding
royalty interest will be granted to the trust with respect to such lease.

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, Newfield agreed to cause EEX and its
affiliates to enter into a master conveyance of overriding royalty interest,
which will require EEX to convey to the trust, after the effective time of the
merger but prior to the distribution of the trust units to the trust
unitholders, through one or more recordable conveyances with respect to each
underlying subject interest, the overriding royalty interest described above
burdening each of the current leases covering blocks located within the Treasure
Island project. The overriding royalty interest shall apply only to those
hydrocarbons produced and sold from certain specified depths, as discussed above
and as specifically set forth in the applicable recordable conveyance.

     If within five years of the effective time of the merger, EEX, Newfield or
their respective successors or assigns acquires an interest in a lease covering
all or a portion of any block in the Treasure Island project and with respect to
which the overriding royalty interest has not been previously conveyed to the
trust, then EEX, Newfield or their successors or assigns, as applicable, will
convey to the trust the overriding royalty interest burdening such interest as
provided above.

     The overriding royalty interests will be free and clear of any and all
drilling, development and operating costs and expenses of every kind and
character; provided, however, that the overriding royalty interest hydrocarbons
will be valued at the wellhead and Newfield, its successors or assigns will have
no duty to transport or market the produced hydrocarbons away from the wellhead
without cost, and provided further that the overriding royalty interest
hydrocarbons will be subject to and bear production and other like taxes.

     From the date of receipt of first proceeds from the overriding royalty
interest, the trust will bear the actual expenses directly relating to the
administration of the overriding royalty interests and the trust, not to exceed
8% of the overriding royalty interest proceeds received by the trust. If 8% of
the proceeds are insufficient to cover these expenses, Newfield will loan the
difference to the trust on a senior unsecured basis, with interest at the rate
of 8% per year. In subsequent periods when 8% of the proceeds exceeds these
expenses, the trust will repay Newfield from the excess proceeds amounts
previously borrowed from Newfield for the purpose of covering such expenses,
together with interest at the rate of 8% per year.

  Subject Interests

     On May 21, 2002, EEX and BP Exploration & Production Inc. entered into an
Asset Purchase, Farmout and Joint Exploration Agreement pursuant to which BP
acquired 75% of EEX's current interest in 23 federal Outer Continental Shelf
leases covering blocks within the Treasure Island project, two of which have
since expired. Previously, the MMS awarded EEX and BP six leases as a result of
their joint bids at the OCS Sale 182 held on March 20, 2002, and these leases
were made subject to the EEX-BP agreement. As required by the EEX-BP agreement,
BP will conduct further leasing and geophysical activities in the area included
in the Treasure Island project. At the end of the initial evaluation period, BP
may elect, but will have no obligation, to drill up to three wells. BP will bear
the costs related to EEX's 25% working interest in the applicable leases during
the initial evaluation period as well as the drilling of the first three
exploration wells; provided, however, that BP will be required to pay EEX's
costs associated with drilling such wells only to the extent that the costs of
drilling are less than 115% of the costs initially estimated to be required to
drill and complete such wells, as set forth in the authorization for expenditure
approved for such wells, and BP will be required to pay only 50% of EEX's costs
associated with the third exploratory well if either of the first two
exploratory wells are drilled to and test the Cretacious intervals or
structures.

TRUST AGREEMENT

     At the closing of the merger, Newfield and Wachovia Bank, National
Association, as successor trustee, will enter into an amended and restated trust
agreement. Thereafter, the trust and the respective rights and obligations of
Newfield, the trustee and the trust unitholders with respect to the trust will
be governed by that document. The following description of the trust agreement
does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the trust agreement, a substantially final form of which is included as an
exhibit to the Registration Statement on Form S-4, of which this proxy
statement/prospectus is a part. You are urged to read the trust agreement in its
entirety.

  Creation and Organization of the Trust

     The trust was created under the laws of the State of Texas pursuant to the
trust agreement entered into on June 17, 2002 between Newfield, as grantor, and
certain individuals, as trustees. Upon the execution of the amended and restated
trust agreement, the trust will issue 42,574,298 trust units to Newfield in
consideration of Newfield causing EEX and its affiliates to transfer the royalty
interests to the trust.

     Newfield created the trust to acquire and hold the royalty interests for
the benefit of the trust unitholders. The royalty interests are passive in
nature, and neither the trustee nor the trust unitholders will have any control
over or responsibility for any costs relating to the drilling, development or
operation of the subject interests. None of Newfield, EEX or any other operators
of the properties included in the subject interests have any contractual
commitments to the trust to conduct drilling on the properties or to maintain
their ownership interest in any of these properties; provided, however, in the
case of Newfield and EEX, their actions must be consistent with actions that a
reasonable prudent operator of oil and gas properties would take under similar
circumstances in accordance with good oilfield practices and without giving
effect to the existence of the royalty interests. For a description of the
subject interests and other information relating to them, see "-- Royalty
Interests and Subject Interests."

     The beneficial interest in the trust is divided into 42,574,298 trust
units, each of which represents an equal undivided portion of the trust.
Pursuant to the merger agreement, holders of EEX common stock have the option to
elect to receive trust units from Newfield in lieu of all or a portion of the
shares of Newfield common stock they would otherwise receive in the merger as
consideration for their shares of EEX common stock, subject to the election and
allocation procedures described elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.
For additional information concerning the trust units, see "-- Description of
the Trust Units."

  Assets of the Trust

     The assets of the trust will consist of the royalty interests and cash and
temporary investments being held for the payment of expenses and liabilities and
for distribution to the trust unitholders.

  Duties and Limited Powers of the Trustee

     The duties of the trustee are specified in the trust agreement and by the
laws of the State of Texas. The trustee's principal duties consist of:

     - collecting income attributable to the royalty interests;

     - paying expenses, charges and obligations of the trust from the trust's
       income and assets;

     - distributing distributable income to the trust unitholders;

     - prosecuting, defending or settling any claim of or against the trustee,
       the trust or the royalty interests, including the authority to dispose of
       or relinquish title to any of the royalty interests that are the subject
       of a dispute upon the receipt of sufficient evidence regarding the facts
       of such dispute; and

     - taking any action it deems necessary and advisable to best achieve the
       purposes of the trust.

     The trustee has no authority to incur any contractual liabilities on behalf
of the trust that are not limited solely to claims against the assets of the
trust.

     If a liability is contingent or uncertain in amount or not yet currently
due and payable, the trustee may create a cash reserve to pay for the liability.
If the trustee determines that the cash on hand and the cash to be received is
insufficient to cover any extraordinary expenses or liabilities of the trust,
the trustee may borrow funds required to pay those expenses or liabilities. The
trustee may borrow the funds from any person, including Newfield or itself. The
trustee may also encumber the assets of the trust to secure payment of the
indebtedness. If the trustee borrows funds to cover extraordinary expenses or
liabilities, the trust unitholders will not receive distributions until the
borrowed funds are repaid. The trust agreement provides for special borrowing
and repayment procedures with respect to Newfield's funding of ordinary
administrative expenses, which are described below under "-- Funding of
Administrative Expenses."

     The only asset the trust may acquire is the royalty interests and the only
investment activity the trustee may engage in is the investment of cash on hand.

     At the request of Newfield, the trustee must sell royalty interests that
burden subject interests then in commercial production and which Newfield
proposes to sell to an unaffiliated third party. The net proceeds of any such
sale would be allocated to Newfield and the trust based upon the relative
ownership percentage of each in the aggregate net revenue interest of Newfield
and the trust included in the sale. However, the trustee will not be required to
sell during any calendar year any royalty interests (i) the value of which
exceeds 10% of the value of all royalty interests held by the trust and then
attributed with proved reserves or (ii) which would cause the cumulative value
of all royalty interests sold pursuant to such requests to exceed 25% of the
value of all royalty interests held by the trust and then attributed with proved
reserves. In each case, the value of royalty interests shall be the discounted
present value of the future net revenues attributable to the proved reserves
attributable to such royalty interests using a discount rate of 10% or such
other rate required by the SEC, as set forth in the most recent reserve report
of the trust.

     The trustee may also sell any of the royalty interests if it determines
such sale is in the best interests of the trust unitholders and holders of at
least 60% of all trust units outstanding approve the sale. However, any sale of
all or substantially all of the royalty interests, whether in a single
transaction or series of transactions, requires the approval of holders of at
least 80% of all outstanding trust units. The trustee will distribute the net
proceeds from any sale of royalty interests to the trust unitholders.

     The trustee has the right to require any trust unitholder to dispose of his
trust units if an administrative or judicial proceeding seeks to cancel or
forfeit any of the property in which the trust holds an interest because of the
nationality or any other status of a trust unitholder. If a trust unitholder
fails to dispose of his trust units, the trust will be obligated to purchase
them at a price determined in accordance with a formula set forth in the trust
agreement.

     The trustee is authorized to agree to modifications of the terms of the
conveyances of the royalty interests to the trust or to settle disputes
involving such conveyances, so long as such modifications or settlements do not
alter the nature of the royalty interests as rights to receive a share of the
oil and gas, or proceeds thereof, from the underlying properties free of any
obligation for drilling, development or operating expenses or rights that do not
possess any operating rights or are obligations.

  Fiduciary Responsibility and Liability of the Trustee

     The trustee is a fiduciary for the trust unitholders and is required to act
in the best interests of the trust unitholders at all times. The trustee must
exercise the same judgment and care in supervising and managing the trust's
assets as persons of ordinary prudence, discretion and intelligence would
exercise. Under Texas law, the trustee's duties to the trust unitholders are
similar to the duty of care owed by a corporate director to the corporation and
its shareholders. The primary difference between the trustee's duties and a
corporate director's duties is the absence of the legal presumption protecting
the trustee's decisions from challenge.

     Due to the passive nature of the trust, the trustee generally will not make
business decisions affecting the assets of the trust. Therefore, substantially
all of the trustee's functions under the Trust Agreement are expected to be
ministerial in nature. See "-- Duties and Limited Powers of the Trustee" above.

     Under Texas law, the trustee may not profit from any transaction with the
trust. The trust agreement, however, provides that the trustee may:

     - charge for its services as trustee;

     - retain funds to pay for future expenses and deposit them in its own
       account;

     - lend funds at commercial rates to the trust to pay the trust's expenses;
       and

     - seek reimbursement from the trust for its out-of-pocket expenses.

     In discharging its fiduciary duty to trust unitholders, the trustee may act
in its discretion and will be liable to the trust unitholders only for fraud,
gross negligence or acts or omissions constituting bad faith as

adjudicated by the final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction. The trustee will not be liable for any act or omission of its
agents or employees unless the trustee acted in bad faith or with gross
negligence in their selection and retention. The trustee will be indemnified for
any liability or cost that it incurs in the administration of the trust, except
in cases of fraud, gross negligence or bad faith. The trustee will have a lien
on the assets of the trust as security for this indemnification and its
compensation earned as trustee. The trustee is entitled to indemnification from
trust assets or, to the extent that trust assets are insufficient, from
Newfield. Trust unitholders will not be liable to the trustee for any
indemnification. See "-- Description of the Trust Units -- Liability of Trust
Unitholders."

     Under Texas law, if the trustee acts in bad faith, the trustee will be
liable to the trust unitholders for damages. Texas law also permits the trust
unitholders to file actions seeking other remedies, including:

     - removal of the trustee;

     - specific performance;

     - appointment of a receiver;

     - an accounting by the trustee to trust unitholders; and

     - punitive damages.

  Liabilities of the Trust

     Because the trust assets are passive in nature and the trustee has little
power to incur obligations, Newfield anticipates that the trust will only incur
liabilities for routine administrative expenses, such as the trustee's fees and
accounting, engineering, legal and other professional fees.

  Duration of the Trust

     The trust will terminate upon the first to occur of:

     - the sale of all of the royalty interests;

     - such time as the aggregate cash proceeds received by the trustee with
       respect to the royalty interests for each of two successive years after
       the first full year during which any of the subject interests produce oil
       and/or gas in commercial quantities is less than $1,000,000 per year;

     - the trustee shall have failed to receive any aggregate cash proceeds
       attributable to the royalty interests during the period commencing on the
       effective time of the merger through the date of the third anniversary of
       the date that none of the subject interests remain in their respective
       primary terms (including by way of maintenance of any Subject Interest in
       the absence of production beyond its stated primary term through
       Suspension of Production orders or other regulatory relief granted by the
       MMS or successor agency);

     - the holders of 80% or more of the outstanding trust units vote in favor
       of termination; or

     - the trust violates the "rule against perpetuities;"

provided, however, that in no event shall the trust be terminable or terminated
if any Subject Interest remains in its primary term (including by way of
maintenance of such Subject Interest in the absence of production beyond its
stated primary term through a Suspension of Production order or other regulatory
relief granted by the MMS or successor agency). Upon termination of the trust,
the trustee would then sell all of the trust's assets, either by private sale or
public auction, and then distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the trust
unitholders.

  Funding of Administrative Expenses

     From time to time as the trustee deems reasonably necessary to assure
adequate funding for the administration of the trust until such time as cash
proceeds generated by the royalty interests that are

received by the trustee on behalf of the trust are sufficient for such purpose,
the trustee may request Newfield to make loans (and Newfield has agreed to make
such loans), in amounts estimated by the trustee to be required to cover
administrative expenses expected to be incurred within the 90-day period
following the date each such loan is made. In addition, if after such time as
the royalty interests commence generating cash proceeds, 8% of the amount of
proceeds received by the trustee is insufficient to cover these expenses,
Newfield will lend the difference to the trust. All such loans shall be senior
unsecured obligations of the trust, shall bear interest at the rate of eight
percent (8%) per annum and shall be repaid in quarterly installments only from
the excess, if any, of (i) the product of (A) the cash received by the trustee
during the applicable quarter and (B) .08 over (ii) all compensation,
reimbursements and other charges owing and paid to the trustee for such quarter.

  Amendment of Trust Agreement

     Any amendment of the Trust Agreement requires a vote of holders of 60% or
more of the outstanding trust units, except that any amendment that would permit
the holders of fewer than 80% of the outstanding trust units to approve a sale
of all or substantially all of the royalty interests, whether in a single
transaction or series of transactions, or to terminate the trust requires a vote
of holders of 80% or more of the outstanding trust units. However, Newfield and
the trustee may supplement or amend the agreement, without the approval of the
unitholders, in order to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any
provision which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision
thereof, or to change the name of the trust, provided that such supplement or
amendment does not adversely affect the interests of the unitholders. In
addition, no amendment may:

     - alter the purposes of the trust or permit the trustee to engage in any
       business or investment activities other than as specified in the Trust
       Agreement;

     - alter the rights of the trust unitholders as among themselves;

     - permit the trustee to distribute the royalty interests in kind; or

     - adversely affect the rights and duties of the trustee unless such
       amendment is approved by the trustee.

  Dispute Resolution

     Any dispute, controversy or claim that may arise between Newfield and the
trustee relating to the trust will be submitted to binding arbitration before a
tribunal of three arbitrators.

  Compensation of the Trustee

     The trustee is entitled to annual compensation of $15,000, plus
reimbursement of its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with the administration of the trust. The trustee is also entitled to a fee of
$5,000 upon the termination of the trust. The trustee's compensation will be
paid out of the trust's assets.

DESCRIPTION OF THE TRUST UNITS

  General

     Each trust unit represents an undivided share of beneficial interest in the
trust. Each holder of a trust unit has the same rights as the holder of any
other trust unit. The trust has 42,574,298 trust units outstanding.

  Distributions and Income Computations

     Each quarter, the trustee will determine the amount of funds available for
distribution to the trust unitholders. Available funds will equal the excess
cash received by the trust from the royalty interests and other sources during
that quarter (which may, after such time as any of the royalty interests
commence

generating cash proceeds, include loans from Newfield in the circumstances
described in "-- Funding of Administrative Expenses" above), over the trust's
liabilities for that quarter. In any event, no distributions will be made until
such time as the trustee receives cash proceeds from the royalty interests.
Available funds will be reduced by any cash the trustee decides to hold as a
reserve against future liabilities. The trustee shall establish a cash reserve
equal to such amount. Trust unitholders that own their trust units on the close
of business on the last business day of each calendar quarter (the "Quarterly
Record Date") will receive a pro-rata distribution of the amount of the cash
available for distribution no later than 10 business days after the Quarterly
Record Date.

     Unless otherwise advised by counsel or the IRS, the trustee will record the
income and expenses of the trust for each quarterly period as belonging to the
trust unitholders of record on the Quarterly Record Date. Trust unitholders will
recognize income and expenses for tax purposes in the quarter of receipt or
payment by the trust, rather than in the quarter of distribution by the trust.
Minor variances may occur. For example, a reserve could be established in one
quarterly period that would not give rise to a tax deduction until a later
quarterly period, or an expenditure paid in one quarterly period would be
amortized for tax purposes over several quarterly periods. See "Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences -- Ownership of Trust Units."

  Transfer of Trust Units

     Trust unitholders may transfer their trust units by surrendering their
trust unit certificate and complying with such reasonable transfer regulations
as the trustee may prescribe. No service charge will be made to the transferor
or transferee for any transfer of a trust unit. The trustee may require payment
of any tax or other governmental charge imposed for a transfer. The trustee may
treat the owner of any trust unit as shown by its records as the owner of the
trust unit. The trustee will not be considered to know about any claim or demand
on a trust unit by any party except the record owner. Any transfer of a trust
unit will, as to the trustee, transfer to the transferee as of the close of
business on the date of transfer, all right, title and interest of the
transferor in the trust. However, a transfer of a trust unit after any Quarterly
Record Date will not transfer to the transferee the right to any distribution
relating to the Quarterly Record Date. Except as otherwise provided in the Trust
Agreement, the laws of the State of Texas will govern all matters affecting the
title, ownership, warranty or transfer of trust units.

  Periodic Reports

     The trustee will mail to each trust unitholder of record on a Quarterly
Record Date during each quarter (except the fourth) a report showing the assets,
liabilities and distributable income of the trust for the quarter. No later than
120 days following the end of each year the trustee will mail to the trust
unitholders of record, as of a date to be selected by the trustee, an annual
report containing audited financial statements of the trust.

     The trustee will file all required trust federal and state income tax and
information returns. Within 75 days following the end of each fiscal year, the
trustee will prepare and mail to each trust unitholder of record on a Quarterly
Record Date during such year a report in reasonable detail with the information
that trust unitholders need to correctly report their share of the income and
deductions of the trust.

     Each trust unitholder and his representatives may examine, for any proper
purpose, during reasonable business hours the records of the trust and the
trustee.

  Liability of Trust Unitholders

     Texas law is unclear whether a trust unitholder would be responsible for a
liability that exceeds the net assets of the trust and the trustee. Because of
the passive nature of the trust assets and the restrictions in the Trust
Agreement on the power of the trustee to incur liabilities, Newfield believes it
is unlikely that a trust unitholder would incur any liability from the trust.

  Voting Rights of Trust Unitholders

     Trust unitholders voting rights are more limited than those of stockholders
of most public corporations. For example, there is no requirement for annual
meetings of trust unitholders or for annual or other periodic re-election of the
trustee.

     The trustee or trust unitholders owning at least 15% of the outstanding
trust units may call meetings of trust unitholders. Meetings must be held in
Harris County, Texas. Written notice setting forth the time and place of the
meeting and the matters proposed to be acted upon must be given to all of the
trust unitholders of record as of a record date set by the trustee at least 20
days and not more than 60 days before the meeting. The presence in person or by
proxy of trust unitholders representing a majority of trust units outstanding
constitutes a quorum. Each trust unitholder is entitled to one vote for each
trust unit owned.

     Unless otherwise required by the Trust Agreement, any matter may be
approved by holders of a majority of trust units constituting a quorum, although
less than a majority of the trust units then outstanding. The affirmative vote
of the holders of 80% of the outstanding trust units is required to terminate
the trust or approve a sale of all or substantially all of the royalty
interests, whether in a single transaction or series of transactions. The
affirmative vote of the holders of 60% of the outstanding trust units is
required to (1) amend the Trust Agreement (excluding the requirements for 80%
trust unitholder approval of termination of the trust or a sale of all or
substantially all of the royalty interests, which requires approval of holders
of 80% of the outstanding trust units), (2) approve other sales of the assets of
the trust or (3) approve any transaction with Newfield or any affiliate of
Newfield, any unitholder or any third person that holds a leasehold working
interest in any lease burdened by a royalty interest. The trustee may be
removed, with or without cause, by a vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding trust units.

     Any action required or permitted to be authorized or taken at any meeting
of trust unitholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and
without a vote if a consent in writing setting forth the authorization or action
as taken is signed by trust unitholders holding units representing not less than
the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such
action at a meeting at which all units entitled to vote thereon were present and
voted.

     In determining whether trust unitholders holding the requisite number of
units have concurred in any vote, direction, consent or waiver under the trust
agreement, units which are beneficially owned (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) by (1) Newfield or any
affiliate of Newfield, or (2) for purposes of votes regarding termination of the
trust or transactions with parties owning a leasehold working interest in any
lease burdened by a royalty interest, any third person not an affiliate of
Newfield that owns a leasehold working interest in any such lease, or (3) for
purposes of any vote with respect to any transaction proposed to be entered into
by any unitholder with the trust, such unitholder, shall be disregarded and
deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such vote or determination.

                             NOTE TO BALANCE SHEET

FORMATION OF THE TRUST:

     Treasure Island Royalty Trust is an express trust created under the laws of
the state of Texas pursuant to a trust agreement entered into on June 17, 2002
between Newfield, as grantor, and certain officers of Newfield, as trustees. At
the closing of the proposed merger between EEX and Newfield, Newfield and
Wachovia Bank, National Association, as successor trustee, will enter into an
amended and restated trust agreement, pursuant to which the existing trustees
will resign and the trust will issue to Newfield 42,574,298 trust units. The
trust will hold certain non-expense bearing overriding royalty interests in any
future production that may be achieved from intervals at depths typically below
18,000 to 21,000 feet from EEX's Treasure Island project, an exploration concept
covering 116 Gulf of Mexico lease blocks located on the federal Outer
Continental Shelf in which EEX currently owns or may acquire a working interest.
At June 19, 2002, there was no production, and there were no proved reserves,
associated with the royalty interests. Other than its formation, the trust has
not conducted any activities.

                 MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

THE MERGER

     The following is a general summary of the material federal income tax
consequences of the merger to the holders of EEX common stock and is based upon
current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"), existing regulations thereunder and current administrative rulings and
court decisions, all of which are subject to change. No attempt has been made to
comment on all federal income tax consequences of the merger that may be
relevant to particular holders, including holders that are subject to special
tax rules such as dealers in securities, foreign persons, mutual funds,
insurance companies, tax-exempt entities and holders who do not hold their
shares as capital assets. HOLDERS OF EEX COMMON STOCK ARE ADVISED AND EXPECTED
TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISERS REGARDING THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES
OF THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF THEIR PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE CONSEQUENCES
UNDER APPLICABLE STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX LAWS.

     Newfield has received from its counsel, Vinson & Elkins L.L.P., an opinion
to the effect that the merger will be treated for federal income tax purposes as
a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, that
Newfield, Merger Sub and EEX will each be a party to the reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code, and that Newfield, Merger Sub and EEX
will not recognize any gain or loss as a result of the Merger except with
respect to the distribution of the trust units. EEX has received from its
counsel, Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld L.L.P., an opinion to the effect that
the merger will be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, that Newfield, Merger Sub and
EEX will each be a party to the reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(b) of the Code, and that:

     - no gain or loss will be recognized by a holder of EEX common stock or EEX
       preferred stock upon the exchange of all of such holder's shares of EEX
       common stock or EEX preferred stock solely for shares of Newfield common
       stock in the merger;

     - the aggregate basis of the shares of Newfield common stock received by an
       EEX shareholder in the merger (including any fractional share deemed
       received) will be the same as the aggregate basis of the shares of EEX
       common stock or EEX preferred stock surrendered in exchange therefor;

     - the holding period of the shares of Newfield common stock received by a
       shareholder in the merger (including any fractional share deemed
       received) will include the holding period of the shares of EEX common
       stock or EEX preferred stock surrendered in exchange therefor, provided
       that such shares of EEX common stock or EEX preferred stock are held as
       capital assets at the effective time;

     - a shareholder of EEX who receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of
       Newfield common stock will recognize gain or loss equal to the
       difference, if any, between such shareholder's basis in the fractional
       share (as described in the second bullet point above) and the amount of
       cash received; and

     - a holder of EEX common stock who elects to receive trust units will
       recognize gain on that shareholder's exchange of shares of EEX common
       stock in the merger (but in an amount not in excess of the fair market
       value of the trust units received), all or a portion of which could be
       treated as a dividend to that shareholder.

     The foregoing opinions address all of the material federal income tax
consequences of the merger to the participants in the merger and to the
shareholders of EEX. Such opinions are based upon the merger agreement
(including the representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.25 and
5.11 thereof), the facts set forth in the Registration Statement on Form S-4
(including this proxy statement/prospectus), written representations of officers
of EEX and Newfield contained in Exhibits A and B to the merger agreement,
current provisions of the Code, existing regulations thereunder, current
administrative rulings of the Internal Revenue Service, court decisions and the
assumption that the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement will be
carried out strictly in accordance with the terms thereof. Shareholders of EEX

should be aware that such opinions are not binding on the IRS and no assurance
can be given that the IRS will not adopt a contrary position or that a contrary
IRS position would not be sustained by a court. Each of such opinions has been
filed with the SEC as an exhibit to the Registration Statement on Form S-4, of
which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part.

OWNERSHIP OF TRUST UNITS

     This section summarizes the material federal income tax consequences of the
ownership and sale of the trust units. Many aspects of federal income taxation
that may be relevant to a particular taxpayer or to certain types of taxpayers
subject to specific tax treatment are not addressed. In addition, the tax laws
can and do change regularly, and any future changes could have an adverse effect
on the ownership or sale of trust units. The trust will not request advance
rulings from the IRS dealing with the tax consequences of ownership of trust
units.

  CLASSIFICATION AND TAXATION OF THE TRUST

     Under current law, the trust should be taxable as a grantor trust and not
as a business entity. A grantor trust is not subject to tax at the trust level.
For tax purposes, trust unitholders will be considered to own the trust's income
and principal as though no trust were in existence. A grantor trust simply files
an information return, reporting all items of income or deduction which must be
included in the tax returns of the trust unitholders based on their respective
accounting methods and taxable years without regard to the accounting method and
tax year of the trust. Each trust unitholder will recognize taxable income when
the trust receives or accrues it, even if it is not distributed until later. If
the trust were determined to be an unincorporated business entity, it would be
taxable as a partnership unless it elected to be taxed as a corporation. If
treated as a partnership the trust could be considered to be a "publicly traded
partnership" taxable as a corporation unless certain qualifying income tests are
met. The income of the trust should meet such qualifying income tests, so that
even if the trust were considered to be a publicly traded partnership it should
not be taxed as a corporation. The trust does not intend to elect to be taxed as
a corporation. The principal tax consequence of the trust's being treated as a
partnership as opposed to a grantor trust would be that all trust unitholders
would be required to report their share of income from the trust on the accrual
method of accounting regardless of their own method of accounting.

  REPORTING OF TRUST INCOME AND EXPENSES

     The trustee intends to treat each royalty payment it receives as the
taxable income of the trust unitholders who own trust units on the day of
receipt by the trust. Similarly, the trustee intends to pay expenses only on the
day it receives a royalty payment. All expenses paid on a royalty receipt day
will be allocated as expenses of each trust unitholder who receives the
distribution of that royalty income. In most cases, therefore, the income and
expenses of the trust for a period will be reported as belonging to the trust
unitholder who received a distribution for that period. The amount of the
distribution for a trust unit will generally equal the net income allocated to
that trust unit, determined without regard to depletion. This correlation may
not exist if, for example, the trustee were to establish a cash reserve to pay
estimated future expenses or pay an expense with borrowed funds. Moreover, the
IRS could attempt to impute income to trust unitholders when a royalty payment
on the overriding royalty interests accrues. The IRS could also attempt to
disallow the deduction of administrative expenses to persons who were not trust
unitholders when the expenses were incurred. If the IRS were successful, trust
income might be taxed to trust unitholders other than those who received the
distribution relating to that income. Also, an accrual basis trust unitholder
might realize royalty income in a tax year earlier than that reported by the
trustee.

  ROYALTY INCOME AND DEPLETION

     The royalty interests should qualify for an allowance for depletion. The
depletion allowance must be computed separately by each trust unitholder for
each oil or gas property, within the meaning of Section 614 of the Internal
Revenue Code.

     The deduction for depletion is determined annually and is the greater of
cost depletion or, if allowable, percentage depletion. Royalty income from
production attributable to trust units owned by independent producers will
qualify for percentage depletion. An individual or entity with production of the
equivalent of 1,000 barrels of oil per day or less is an independent producer.
Percentage depletion is a statutory allowance equal to 15% of the gross income
from production from a property. Percentage depletion is subject to a net income
limitation of 100% of the taxable income from the property, computed without
regard to depletion deductions and certain loss carrybacks. The depletion
deduction attributable to percentage depletion for a taxable year is limited to
65% of the taxpayer's taxable income for the year before allowance of
independent producers' percentage depletion. Unlike cost depletion, percentage
depletion is not limited to the adjusted tax basis of the property, although it
reduces the adjusted tax basis, but not below zero.

     In computing cost depletion for each property for any year, the allowance
for the property is calculated by dividing the adjusted tax basis of the
property at the beginning of the year by the estimated total number of Bbls of
oil or Mcf of natural gas recoverable from the property. This amount is then
multiplied by the number of Bbls of oil or Mcf of natural gas produced and sold
from the property during the year. Cost depletion for a property cannot exceed
the adjusted tax basis of the property. Each trust unitholder will compute cost
depletion using his basis in his trust units. Information will be provided to
each trust unitholder reflecting how his basis should be allocated among each
property represented by his trust units.

  OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES

     It is anticipated that the only other income of the trust will be interest
income earned on funds held as a reserve or pending distribution. Other expenses
of the trust will include any state and local taxes imposed on the trust and
administrative expenses of the trustee. Although the issue has not been finally
resolved, all or substantially all of those expenses should be deductible in
computing adjusted gross income and, therefore, are not the type of
miscellaneous itemized deductions that are allowable only to the extent that
they total more than 2% of adjusted gross income.

  SALE OF TRUST UNITS; DEPLETABLE BASIS

     Generally, a trust unitholder will realize gain or loss on the sale or
exchange of his trust units measured by the difference between the amount
realized on the sale or exchange and his adjusted basis for such trust units.
Gain or loss on the sale of trust units by a trust unitholder who is not a
dealer of the trust units will generally be capital gain or loss. In the case of
non-corporate taxpayers, such capital gains will be taxable at a maximum rate of
20% if the trust units have been held for more than 12 months. A portion of the
gain will be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the depletion recapture
amount explained below. A trust unitholder's basis in his trust units will be
equal to the amount he paid for the trust units (or in the case of trust units
received in the merger, the fair market value of such units on the date of the
merger), reduced by deductions for depletion claimed by the trust unitholder,
but not below zero. Upon the sale of the trust units, a trust unitholder must
treat as ordinary income his depletion recapture amount, which is an amount
equal to the lesser of the gain on such sale or the sum of the prior depletion
deductions taken with respect to the trust units, but not in excess of the
initial basis of the trust units. The IRS could take the position, however, that
a portion of the sales proceeds is ordinary income to the extent of any accrued
income at the time of the sale that was allocable to the trust units sold even
though the income had not been distributed to the selling trust unitholder.

  BACKUP WITHHOLDING

     In general, distributions of trust income will not be subject to backup
withholding unless the trust unitholder is an individual or other noncorporate
taxpayer and he fails to comply with certain reporting procedures.

  REPORTS

     The trustee will furnish to trust unitholders of record quarterly and
annual reports to facilitate their computation of their tax liability. See
"Treasure Island Royalty Trust -- Description of the Trust Units -- Periodic
Reports."

                        COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS

     The rights of EEX shareholders are currently governed by the Texas Business
Corporation Act (the "TBCA"), EEX's restated articles of incorporation, as
amended, and EEX's bylaws. At the time of the merger, EEX shareholders will
become Newfield stockholders and their rights will be governed by the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), Newfield's second restated certificate of
incorporation, as amended, and Newfield's restated bylaws, as amended. The
following is a summary of material differences between the rights of EEX
shareholders and the rights of Newfield stockholders. It is not a complete
statement of the provisions affecting, and the differences between, the rights
of EEX shareholders and those of Newfield stockholders. The summary is qualified
in its entirety by reference to the TBCA, the DGCL, EEX's restated articles of
incorporation, as amended, and bylaws, and Newfield's second restated
certificate of incorporation, as amended, and restated bylaws, as amended.

                           CERTAIN OIL AND GAS TERMS

     Set forth below are explanations of some commonly used terms in the oil and
gas industry.

     BBL.  One stock tank barrel, or 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume, used herein
in reference to crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbons.

     BCFE.  One billion cubic feet equivalent, determined using the ratio of six
Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids.

     DEEPWATER.  Generally considered to be water depths in excess of 1,000
feet.

     DEVELOPMENT WELL.  A well drilled within the proved area of an oil or
natural gas field to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be
productive, including a well drilled to find and produce probable reserves (an
EXPLOITATION WELL).

     EXPLORATION.  The search for natural accumulation of oil and natural gas by
any geological, geophysical or other suitable means.

     EXPLORATORY WELL.  A well drilled to find and produce oil or natural gas
reserves that is not a development well.

     FARM-IN OR FARM-OUT.  An agreement whereunder the owner of a working
interest in an oil and gas lease assigns the working interest or a portion
thereof to another party who desires to drill on the leased acreage. Generally,
the assignee is required to drill one or more wells in order to earn its
interest in the acreage. The assignor usually retains a royalty or reversionary
interest in the lease. The interest received by an assignee is a "farm-in,"
while the interest transferred by the assignor is a "farm-out."

     FIELD.  An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all
grouped on or related to the same individual geological structural feature or
stratigraphic condition.

     LIQUIDS.  Crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids.

     MBBLS.  One thousand barrels.

     MCF.  One thousand cubic feet of natural gas.

     MCFE.  One thousand cubic feet equivalent, determined using the ratio of
six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of crude oil, condensate or natural gas
liquids.

     MMCF.  One million cubic feet of natural gas.

     MMCFE.  One million cubic feet equivalent, determined using the ratio of
six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of crude oil, condensate or natural gas
liquids.

     MMS.  The United States Minerals Management Service, a division of the U.S.
Department of the Interior.

     NYMEX.  The New York Mercantile Exchange.

     OIL AND GAS LEASE.  An instrument which grants to another (the lessee) the
exclusive right to enter to explore for, drill for, produce, store and remove
oil and natural gas on the mineral interest, in consideration for which the
lessor is entitled to certain rents and royalties payable under the terms of the
lease. Typically, the duration of the lessee's authorization is for a stated
term of years and "for so long thereafter" as minerals are producing.

     OPERATOR.  The individual or company responsible for the exploration,
exploitation and production of an oil or natural gas well or lease.

     POSSIBLE RESERVES.  Reserves similar to probable reserves but that are less
likely to be recovered than not.

     PRESENT VALUE.  When used with respect to oil and natural gas reserves, the
estimated value of future gross revenues (estimated in accordance with the
requirements of the SEC) to be generated from the production of proved reserves,
net of estimated production and future development costs, using prices and costs
in effect as of the date indicated, without giving effect to nonproperty related
expenses such as general and administrative expenses, debt service and future
income tax expenses or to depreciation, depletion and amortization, discounted
using an annual discount rate of 10%.

     PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES.  Reserves that can be expected to be recovered
through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods.

     PROVED RESERVES.  The estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and
natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with
reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs
under existing economic and operating conditions.

     PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES.  Reserves that are expected to be recovered
from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively
major expenditure is required for recompletion.

     ROYALTY INTEREST.  An interest in an oil and natural gas lease that gives
the owner of the interest the right to receive a portion of the production from
the leased acreage (or the proceeds of the sale thereof), but generally does not
require the owner to pay any portion of the costs of drilling or operating the
wells on the leased acreage. Royalties may be either landowner's royalties,
which are reserved by the owner of the leased acreage at the time the lease is
granted, or overriding royalties, which are usually reserved by an owner of the
leasehold in connection with a transfer to a subsequent owner.

     SHELF.  The Continental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico. Water depths generally
range from 50 feet to 1,000 feet.

     3-D SEISMIC.  The method by which a three dimensional image of the earth's
subsurface is created through the interpretation of reflection seismic data
collected over a surface grid. 3-D seismic surveys allow for a more detailed
understanding of the subsurface than do conventional surveys and contribute
significantly to field appraisal, exploitation and production.

     UNDEVELOPED ACREAGE.  Lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or
completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities
of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved
reserves.

     WORKING INTEREST.  The operating interest in an oil and gas lease that
gives the owner the right to drill, produce and conduct operating activities on
the property and a share of production.

     WORKOVER.  Operations on a producing well to restore or increase
production.

                                                                         ANNEX A
