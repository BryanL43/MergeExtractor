(1)
Each
share of CEC common stock is accompanied by a Series A preferred stock purchase right that trades with the CEC common stock. The value attributed to those rights, if any,
is reflected in the market price of the CEC common stock. Prior to the occurrence of certain events, none of which has occurred as of this date, the rights will not be exercisable or evidenced
separately from the CEC common stock. 
(2)
Based
on the maximum number of shares of CEC common stock that CEC may be required to issue in the merger, calculated as the product of (i) 18,168,494, which is the sum of
(a) the aggregate number of outstanding shares of Whitman common stock on April 21, 2003 and (b) the aggregate number of shares of Whitman common stock issuable upon the exercise
of outstanding stock options that could be exercised before the closing of the merger multiplied by (ii) an exchange ratio of 0.162 of a share of CEC common stock for each share of Whitman
common stock.

Pursuant
to Rules 457(f)(1), 457(f)(3) and 457(c) under the Securities Act of 1933 and estimated solely for the purpose of calculating the registration fee, the proposed
maximum aggregate offering price is equal to (i) the average of the high and low prices of Whitman common stock as reported on the American Stock Exchange on April 28, 2003 ($14.205)
multiplied by 18,168,494, which is the estimated maximum number of shares of Whitman common stock that may be cancelled in the merger, minus (ii) $109,010,964 (the cash portion of the merger
consideration payable by CEC).

PROXY STATEMENT

PROSPECTUS

The Proposed Career Education/Whitman Education MergerYour Vote is Important  

Dear
Fellow Whitman Shareholder: 

        Career
Education Corporation and Whitman Education Group, Inc. have agreed on a merger transaction whereby CEC will acquire Whitman. If we complete the merger, Whitman will become
a wholly-owned subsidiary of CEC and you will receive $6.00 in cash and shares of CEC common stock valued at approximately $8.25 for each share of Whitman common stock you own. The value of the CEC
common stock component of the per share merger consideration is subject to adjustment if the
average closing price of CEC common stock during a period prior to the closing of the merger is outside of a specified range of prices as described in this proxy statement/prospectus. The exact number
of shares of CEC common stock that you will receive will be determined by the merger's exchange ratio, which is also based on the average closing price of CEC common stock during the pricing period. 

        CEC's
shares are traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "CECO." As of April 30, 2003, the closing sales price of CEC's common stock was $60.02. 

        We
cannot complete the merger without the approval of Whitman's shareholders. We have scheduled a special meeting of Whitman shareholders to obtain this approval. The special meeting
will be held at Whitman's executive offices located at 4400 Biscayne Boulevard, 14th Floor, Miami, Florida 33137
on                        , 2003 at 10:00 a.m., local time. 

Whether or not you plan to attend, please
take the time to vote by completing and mailing the enclosed proxy card to us.  

        This proxy statement/prospectus provides you with detailed information about the merger and the special meeting. 
Please read this entire
document carefully, including the section entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on page 17 that discusses the potential risks involved in the merger, the operation of the combined company and
owning CEC common stock.  

The board of directors of Whitman has unanimously approved the merger agreement and believes that the merger is in the best interests of
Whitman's shareholders and Whitman. The Whitman board therefore unanimously recommends that you vote in favor of the proposal to approve the merger agreement.  

Sincerely yours,

/s/ 
RICHARD C. PFENNIGER, JR.

NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS

TO BE
HELD                               , 2003  

To the Shareholders of WHITMAN EDUCATION GROUP, INC.: 

        Whitman
will hold a special meeting of the shareholders of Whitman Education Group, Inc. at Whitman's executive offices located at 4400 Biscayne Boulevard, 14th Floor, Miami,
Florida 33137, on                             , 2003 at 10:00 a.m., local time, for the following
purposes: 

1.
To
consider and vote on a proposal to approve the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 26, 2003, among Whitman Education Group, Inc., Career Education
Corporation and Marlin Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of CEC, under which Whitman will merge with and into Marlin Acquisition Corp., with Marlin Acquisition Corp. continuing as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of CEC. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to the proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.

2.
To
act on any other matters that may properly come before the special meeting and any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting. 

The board of directors of Whitman unanimously recommends that Whitman shareholders vote for the approval of the merger agreement.

        Shareholders
of record at the close of business on                             , 2003 are entitled to notice of, and
to vote at, the special meeting and any adjournment or
postponement of the special meeting. A list of those shareholders will be available at the special meeting and will also be available for inspection by shareholders of record during normal business
hours at our corporate headquarters for 10 days prior to the special meeting. Approval of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the Whitman common stock
outstanding as of the record date. 

        All
shareholders are cordially invited to attend the special meeting. It is important that your shares be represented at the special meeting, whether or not you plan to attend in person.
Accordingly, please complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the enclosed envelope, which requires no postage if mailed in the United States. If your shares are held in the name of a
broker, bank or other fiduciary, you should direct that person how to vote your shares and bring proof of your share ownership if you wish to attend the special meeting. You may revoke your proxy in
the manner described in the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus at any time before the proxy has been voted at the special meeting. Please note that if you abstain, do not vote or do not instruct
your fiduciary how to vote any shares that it holds for you in its name, this will have the same effect as a vote against the approval of the merger agreement. 

You should not send Whitman stock certificates with your proxy card. After we complete the merger, the exchange/paying agent will send you written instructions
for exchanging Whitman stock certificates for CEC stock certificates and cash.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER    

Q1:
Why am I receiving this proxy statement/prospectus?

A1:
You
are receiving these materials in connection with Whitman's solicitation of proxies for its special meeting of shareholders to be held
on                        , 2003. At the special
meeting, you will be asked to vote upon a proposed merger transaction between Whitman, CEC and a wholly-owned subsidiary of CEC. This document is also CEC's prospectus for the shares of CEC common
stock that it will issue in the merger.

Q2:
When do you expect to complete the merger?

A2:
We
are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible after the special meeting and, therefore, hope to complete the merger
in                        2003. However, in addition
to obtaining Whitman shareholder approval, we must also obtain regulatory approvals and satisfy other conditions before we can complete the merger. Therefore, we cannot predict exactly when we will
complete the merger.

Q3:
What should I do now in order to vote on the merger?

A3:
After
carefully reading and considering the information contained and incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus, you should vote your Whitman shares by mailing your
completed, dated and signed proxy card to Whitman in the enclosed postage paid envelope as soon as possible so that your shares will be represented at the special meeting. If you abstain from voting
or do not vote, it will have the same effect as voting against the merger proposal.

Q4:
If my Whitman shares are held in "street name" by my broker, will my broker vote my shares for
me?

A4:
If
you do not provide your broker with instructions on how to vote your shares, your shares will not be voted by your broker, which will have the same effect as voting against the
proposed merger. You should follow the directions provided by your broker regarding how to instruct your broker to vote your shares. You should also bring proof of your share ownership if you wish to
attend the special meeting.

Q5:
Can I change my vote?

A5:
If
you are a shareholder of record, you can change your vote in one of the following ways at any time before your proxy is voted at the special meeting:


by
written notice to the corporate secretary of Whitman, stating that you would like to revoke your proxy;


by
completing, signing and submitting a new, later-dated proxy card; or


by
attending the special meeting and voting in person. 

If
your shares are held in the name of a broker and you have directed that person to vote your shares, you must instruct that person if you want to change your vote. 

Q6:
Should I send in my Whitman stock certificates now?

A6:
You
should not send in your Whitman stock certificates now. After we complete the merger, the exchange/paying agent, Computershare Trust Co. of New York, will send you written
instructions for exchanging your Whitman stock certificates for CEC stock certificates and cash.

Q7:
What if I receive more than one proxy card?

A7:
This
may mean that your Whitman shares are registered in different ways or are in more than one account. Please provide voting instructions for all proxy cards you receive to ensure
that all of your Whitman shares are voted at the special meeting. 

Q8:
What if I have additional questions?

A8:
If
you have questions about the merger, the special meeting or where to send your proxy, or if you would like additional copies of this proxy statement/prospectus, you should contact
one of the following: 

Computershare Trust Co. of New York

        CEC
is a provider of private, for-profit post-secondary education with 51 campuses throughout the United States, Canada, France, the United Kingdom and the United
Arab Emirates. CEC also offers online programs through American InterContinental University-Online, its e-learning division. As of April 30, 2003, CEC's student population was
approximately 54,400.

        (305) 575-6510 

        Whitman
is a proprietary provider of career-oriented post-secondary education. Through three wholly-owned subsidiaries, Whitman currently operates 22 schools in 13 states
offering a range of graduate, undergraduate and non-degree certificate or diploma programs primarily in the fields of information
technology, healthcare and business. As of March 31, 2003, Whitman's student population was approximately 9,900. 

Our Reasons for the Merger (page 34)  

        The merger presents an opportunity for Whitman shareholders to realize a significant premium over recent market prices for their shares prior to announcement of
the merger. The merger also allows the shareholders of Whitman to benefit from owning part of a larger and financially stronger enterprise with greater geographical coverage in the United States and
internationally, and a significantly more liquid stock, while also receiving some cash for their shares. Whitman believes the merger will enable Whitman to benefit from CEC's resources and attract a
broader student market and expand Whitman's educational program offerings. 

        From
CEC's perspective, the merger furthers its strategy to invest in growth opportunities while creating operating efficiencies through economies of scale by acquiring schools that CEC
believes will benefit from the implementation of its business, operating and marketing strategy. For example, CEC believes that the merger will strengthen CEC's health and online educational programs.
The merger will also expand CEC's geographic presence to include new major markets in the United States. CEC expects the merger to open new opportunities for it to offer a wider range of credential
options to meet the needs of a broader student population and to enhance the competitive position of its business and CEC's overall strength in the private, post-secondary education
market. 

        Achieving
these anticipated benefits of the merger, however, is subject to risks discussed in "Risk Factors" beginning on page 17. 

Recommendation of the Whitman Board (page 34)  

        The Whitman board of directors has unanimously determined that the merger is in the best interests of Whitman's shareholders and Whitman and approved the merger
agreement. The Whitman board of directors therefore unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the approval of the merger agreement. 

Opinion of Whitman's Financial Advisor (page 36)  

        Legg Mason Walker Wood, Incorporated, as financial advisor to the Whitman board of directors, has delivered its written opinion to the Whitman board of directors
that, as of March 26, 2003 and based upon and subject to the various qualifications and assumptions described therein, the consideration of $14.25 per share ($6.00 per share in cash and $8.25
per share in CEC common stock), subject to adjustment under the terms of the merger agreement, to be received by Whitman shareholders in the merger was fair from a financial point of view to the
Whitman shareholders. The full text of the opinion of Legg Mason is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement/prospectus. We encourage you to read the Legg Mason opinion carefully in its entirety.
Legg Mason's opinion is directed to the Whitman board of directors and does not constitute a recommendation to any Whitman shareholder as to how to vote in connection with the merger. 

The Special Meeting  

 Place, Date, Time and Purpose (page 28)  

        The special meeting will be held at Whitman's executive offices located at 4400 Biscayne Boulevard, 14th Floor, Miami, Florida 33137, on
                             , 2003 at 10:00 a.m., local time. At the special meeting, Whitman
shareholders will be asked to approve the merger agreement. 

 Record Date, Voting Rights and Votes Required (page 28)  

        You are entitled to vote at the special meeting if you owned Whitman shares as of the close of business on the record date of
                             , 2003. On the record date, there were
approximately                        shares of Whitman common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.
Shareholders will have one vote at the special meeting for each share of Whitman common stock they owned on the record date. 

        The
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Whitman common stock outstanding as of the record date is required to approve the merger. As of the record date, Whitman directors and
executive officers had voting power with respect to approximately    % of the outstanding shares of Whitman common stock. Phillip Frost, Whitman's chairman of the board, and a trust of
which he is sole trustee, Richard Pfenniger, Jr., Whitman's chief executive officer and vice-chairman of the board, and Fernando Fernandez, Whitman's chief financial officer, have entered into a
voting agreement with CEC in which they have agreed to vote the Whitman shares for which they have voting power in favor of the merger.
These shares represent approximately    % of the shares of Whitman common stock outstanding as of the record date. The remaining directors and executive officers of Whitman have expressed
an intention to vote the Whitman shares for which they have voting power in favor of the merger agreement. 

The Merger (page 30)  

        The merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus. We encourage you to read the merger agreement because it is the legal document
that governs the merger. If the holders of a majority of the shares of Whitman common stock outstanding as of the record date approve the merger agreement and all other conditions to the merger are
satisfied or waived, Whitman 

will merge into Marlin Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of CEC, and Whitman's separate corporate existence will cease. As a result, Marlin Acquisition Corp. will continue as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of CEC. 

 What You Will Receive (page 43)  

        If we complete the merger, we will exchange each outstanding share of Whitman common stock for $6.00 in cash and a to-be-determined number
of shares of CEC common stock. The value of the CEC common stock component will be approximately $8.25, but is subject to adjustment. The value of CEC common stock to be issued in exchange for each
share of Whitman common stock will be determined based upon the average closing price of CEC common stock on the Nasdaq National Market for the 20-day trading period ending on, and
including, the second trading day prior to the day of the closing of the merger. In addition to $6.00 in cash, if the average closing price of CEC common stock for the pricing period is: 


equal
to or greater than $44.00 but no more than $58.00, you will receive CEC common stock valued at $8.25 for each share of Whitman common stock;


greater
than $58.00, you will receive CEC common stock valued at more than $8.25 for each share of Whitman common stock; and


less
than $44.00, you will receive CEC common stock valued at less than $8.25 for each share of Whitman common stock. 

The
exact number of shares of CEC common stock that you will receive will be determined by the merger exchange ratio. The exchange ratio is (1) the value of the CEC common stock to be issued in
the merger per share of Whitman common stock (as determined by reference to the average closing price of CEC common stock during the pricing period) divided by (2) the average closing price of
CEC common stock during the pricing period, unless the exchange ratio is fixed as shown in the table below. The following table shows how we will adjust the value or number of shares of CEC common
stock that you receive for each of your shares of Whitman common stock, based upon the average closing price of CEC common stock reported on the Nasdaq National Market during the pricing period. 

Average Closing Price of CEC Common Stock

During the Pricing Period

Value/Number of Shares of CEC Common Stock

per Share of Whitman Common Stock

Less than $37.00(1)

Number of shares based on a fixed exchange ratio of 0.204

At least $37.00, but less than $44.00

Valued at $8.25 
less
 $0.10 per dollar that the average closing price during the pricing period is below $44.00, subject to proportionate adjustment for
fractions of a dollar

At least $44.00, but less than $58.00

Valued at $8.25

At least $58.00, but no more than $65.00

Valued at $8.25 
plus
 $0.10 per dollar that the average closing price during the pricing period is above $58.00, subject to adjustment for fractions of a
dollar

Greater than $65.00(2)

Number of shares based on a fixed exchange ratio of 0.138

(1)
If
the average closing price of CEC common stock during the pricing period is less than $37.00, Whitman has the option to terminate the merger agreement unless CEC agrees to issue CEC
common stock valued at $7.55 for each share of Whitman common stock. 

(2)
If
the average closing price of CEC common stock during the pricing period is greater than $65.00, CEC has the option to terminate the merger agreement unless Whitman agrees to have
CEC issue common stock valued at $8.95 for each share of Whitman common stock. 

Example 1: If you hold 100 shares of Whitman common stock and the average closing price of CEC common stock during the pricing period is $48.00, you will receive
$600 plus 17 shares of CEC common stock (based on an exchange ratio equal to 8.25/48). In addition, you will receive a cash payment of $9.60 in lieu of the 0.2 shares of CEC common stock that you
would have otherwise received.

Example 2: If you hold 100 shares of Whitman common stock and the average closing price of CEC common stock during the pricing period is $40.00, you will receive
$600 plus 19 shares of CEC common stock (based on an exchange ratio equal to 7.85/40). In addition, you will receive a cash payment of $24.00 in lieu of the 0.6 shares of CEC common stock that you
would have otherwise received.

        We
expect the market price of CEC common stock to fluctuate prior to the merger. Therefore, the average closing price of CEC common stock during the pricing period may be higher or lower
than the closing price of CEC common stock on the date of the merger agreement and the date of the Whitman special meeting. In addition, because the exchange ratio is fixed two trading days before the
closing of the merger, the value of the CEC common stock that you will receive in the merger may increase or decrease before the date we complete the merger. You should obtain current stock price
quotations for CEC common stock prior to voting on the merger. Instead of issuing fractional shares, CEC will pay cash for fractional shares based on the average closing price of CEC common stock
during the pricing period. 

        Based
upon 14,938,505 shares of Whitman common stock outstanding as of April 21, 2003 and an assumed exchange ratio of 0.162, which is based on an average closing market price of
CEC common stock during the 20 consecutive trading days ended April 21, 2003 of $50.96, CEC will issue an aggregate of approximately 2,420,037 shares of CEC common stock in the merger to the
holders of these shares of Whitman common stock. Based upon the 46,269,587 shares of CEC common stock outstanding as of April 21, 2003, the holders of these shares of Whitman common stock
collectively will hold approximately 5.0% of the shares of CEC common stock outstanding immediately after the merger. 

        CEC
expects to borrow under its $200 million credit facility the funds necessary to pay the cash consideration payable to Whitman's shareholders and option holders in the merger. 

 Treatment of Outstanding Whitman Options (page 45)  

        Each outstanding option to purchase Whitman common stock, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled upon consummation of the merger and exchanged for cash
equal to the positive difference, if any, between (1) the value, in cash, of the per share merger consideration (with the portion payable in CEC common stock being valued as of the second
trading day prior to the closing of the merger) and (2) the per share exercise price of the option. This cash value of the per share merger consideration will adjust in the same manner as the
value of the CEC common stock component of the per share merger consideration payable to Whitman shareholders. 

 Conditions to the Completion of the Merger (page 54)  

        The completion of the merger depends on the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including the following: 


Whitman
shareholders must approve the merger agreement;


CEC
must receive all consents and approvals necessary for the continuation of a number of Whitman's material contracts and existing permits and for Whitman
to consummate the merger, 

with
the exception of approval from the U.S. Department of Education and certain other approvals that cannot be obtained prior to completion of the merger; 


the
parties must obtain all necessary and material governmental and regulatory approvals that can be issued prior to completion of the merger and, if
applicable, the relevant waiting periods imposed under the antitrust laws must expire; and


CEC
must obtain a written statement from the U.S. Department of Education stating, without unduly burdensome limitations, that it does not see any impediment
to issuing a temporary program participation agreement with respect to each of Whitman's educational institutions after completion of the merger. 

 Termination of the Merger Agreement (page 55)  

        CEC and Whitman may agree to terminate the merger agreement at any time before completing the merger. In addition, either party may terminate the merger agreement
(1) if the merger is not completed by September 26, 2003 through no fault of the terminating party, (2) if Whitman shareholders do not approve the merger agreement or
(3) in certain other circumstances. 

        CEC
may also terminate the merger agreement if: 


Whitman's
board of directors withdraws or modifies, in a manner adverse to CEC, its recommendation of the merger;


Whitman
materially breaches the non-solicitation or shareholder recommendation provisions of the merger agreement;


a
third party commences, or files a registration statement with respect to, a tender offer or exchange offer for 10% or more of Whitman's outstanding common
stock and the Whitman board of directors either recommends that Whitman shareholders tender their shares or publicly announces its intention to take no position with respect to the offer;


a
proposal by a third party to acquire Whitman has been announced or becomes publicly known and Whitman's board of directors fails to recommend against
acceptance of the proposal by Whitman shareholders (including by taking no position or indicating its inability to take a position on the proposal) or fails to publicly reconfirm its approval and
recommendation of the merger agreement, in each case, within 10 days; or


the
average closing market price of CEC common stock during the pricing period is greater than $65.00 unless Whitman agrees to have CEC issue common stock
valued at $8.95 for each share of Whitman common stock. 

        Whitman
may also terminate the merger agreement if the average closing market price of CEC common stock during the pricing period is less than $37.00 unless CEC agrees to issue CEC
common stock valued at $7.55 for each share of Whitman common stock. 

 Termination Fees (page 55)  

        Whitman must pay CEC a fee of $10 million, plus up to $1.5 million of CEC's costs and expenses in connection with the merger, if the merger
agreement is terminated because: 


an
acquisition proposal becomes known and Whitman enters into an agreement with respect to the acquisition proposal within 12 months after the merger
agreement is terminated by: 


Whitman
or CEC for failure to obtain Whitman shareholder approval;


Whitman
for failure to consummate the merger by September 26, 2003; or 


CEC
due to the failure of any of Whitman's representations and warranties to be true and correct in all material respects as of March 26, 2003 or due
to Whitman's willful breach of any of its representations and warranties, agreements or covenants after March 26, 2003;


Whitman's
board of directors withdraws or modifies, in a manner adverse to CEC, its recommendation that you vote in favor of the merger agreement;


a
third party commences, or files a registration statement with respect to, a tender offer or exchange offer for 10% or more of Whitman's common stock and
the Whitman board of directors recommends that Whitman shareholders tender their shares or publicly announces its intention to take no position with respect to the offer;


Whitman
materially breaches the no solicitation or shareholder recommendation provisions of the merger agreement; or


a
proposal by a third party to acquire Whitman has been announced or becomes publicly known and Whitman's board of directors fails to recommend against
acceptance of the proposal by shareholders (including by taking no position or indicating its inability to take a position on the proposal) or fails to publicly reconfirm its approval and
recommendation of the merger agreement, in each case, within 10 days. 

 Whitman Prohibited From Soliciting Other Offers (page 52)  

        The merger agreement provides that Whitman will not, and will not permit its directors, officers, employees or other representatives and agents to: 


solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage any acquisition proposal or any proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal;


engage
in discussions concerning, or provide any non-public information to anyone in connection with, any acquisition proposal; or


agree
to, approve or otherwise endorse any acquisition proposal. 

        Any
violation of these solicitation restrictions may result in CEC having the ability to terminate the merger agreement and receive termination fees as described above. However, if
Whitman receives an unsolicited third-party acquisition proposal that the Whitman board of directors determines in good faith is or could be superior to the terms of the merger with CEC, Whitman is
permitted, subject to additional limitations, to furnish information about its business to the third party and engage in discussions and negotiations with the third party. 

 Interests of Whitman's Directors and Officers in the Merger (page 45)  

        When you consider the recommendation of the Whitman board of directors that you vote in favor of the merger, you should be aware that a number of Whitman
directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, yours. These interests include: 


Many
key executives and board members of Whitman who are supporting, or recommending that you vote in favor of, the merger are holders of Whitman stock
options. Upon the closing of the merger, each option held by these persons, whether vested or unvested, will be exchanged for cash to the extent the cash value of the per share merger consideration
exceeds the per share exercise price of the option;


CEC
has entered into agreements with Messrs. Pfenniger and Fernandez that provide severance payments and payment for up to 12 months of a
portion of their COBRA health coverage premiums following the consummation of the merger; and 


CEC
will indemnify Whitman's directors and officers to the same extent they were indemnified as of the date of the merger agreement and will maintain
liability insurance for Whitman's directors and officers for at least six years following the consummation of the merger. 

 No Appraisal Rights (page 49)  

        Whitman shareholders are not entitled to dissenters' or appraisal rights under the Florida Business Corporation Act in connection with the merger. 

 United States Federal Income Tax Considerations (page 46)  

        The merger is intended to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Accordingly, no gain or loss
will be recognized by Whitman shareholders with respect to the CEC common stock received in exchange for Whitman common stock; however, gain, if any, will be recognized with respect to the cash
portion of the merger consideration. In addition, gain or loss will be recognized with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares. 

        Tax
matters are very complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on the facts of your particular situation. You are urged to consult your own tax advisor as to
the specific tax consequences to you of the merger, including the applicable federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences. 

 Accounting Treatment (page 46)  

        CEC will record the merger using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This means that for financial
reporting purposes, CEC will treat both companies as one company beginning as of the date we complete the merger. In addition, under this method of financial reporting, CEC will record the fair value
of Whitman's net assets on its consolidated financial statements, with the remaining purchase price in excess of the fair value of Whitman's net assets recorded as goodwill. 

 Regulatory Approvals (page 48)  

        CEC and Whitman have made filings and taken other actions, and will continue to make filings and take actions, necessary to obtain approvals from all appropriate
governmental and educational authorities in connection with the merger. Regulatory approvals required to complete the merger include approval of a substantial number of the state authorizing agencies
and accrediting agencies that currently approve and accredit the Whitman schools and their educational programs. In addition, after
closing the merger, we will need to obtain approval from the U.S. Department of Education for each of the Whitman schools to continue to participate in the U.S. federal student financial aid programs
administered by the Department of Education. 

 Comparison of Shareholder Rights (page 66)  

        When the merger is completed, you will become a stockholder of CEC. Unlike Whitman, which is a Florida corporation, CEC is a Delaware corporation, and the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of CEC differ from the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Whitman. In addition, CEC has a stockholders' rights plan that entitles holders of its common
stock, in certain instances, to purchase shares of CEC series A preferred stock. As a result, you will have different rights as a CEC stockholder than you currently have as a Whitman
shareholder.

SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA OF WHITMAN    

        We are providing the following Whitman selected consolidated financial information to aid you in your analysis of the financial aspects of the merger. The
following information is only a summary and should be read together with Whitman's audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements, the related notes and the discussion contained in
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in Whitman's Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended March 31,
2002 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the nine months ended December 31, 2002, which are incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus. See "Where You Can

UNAUDITED SELECTED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED
  FINANCIAL DATA OF CEC AND WHITMAN    

        The following unaudited selected pro forma condensed combined statement of income data for the year ended December 31, 2002 gives effect to the merger as
if it had occurred on January 1, 2002. The following unaudited selected pro forma condensed combined balance sheet data as of December 31, 2002 gives effect to the proposed merger of CEC
and Whitman as if the merger had occurred on December 31, 2002. The unaudited selected pro forma condensed combined financial data was prepared from CEC's audited historical consolidated
financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2002 and from Whitman's audited historical consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2002
and unaudited historical condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarters ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. 

        The
unaudited selected pro forma condensed combined financial data includes all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the data and, in the opinion of management, has been
prepared on the same basis as that of the underlying audited financial statements. The unaudited selected pro forma condensed combined financial data is a presentation of historical results with
accounting adjustments necessary to reflect the estimated pro forma effect of the merger on the combined financial position and results of operations of CEC and Whitman. The unaudited selected pro
forma condensed combined financial data does not reflect the effects of any anticipated changes to be made by CEC to the historical operations, is presented for information purposes only, and should
not be construed to be indicative of combined results of operations or financial position that actually would have occurred had the merger of CEC and Whitman been consummated as of the date indicated
or the combined entity's future results of operations or financial position. 

        The
unaudited selected pro forma condensed combined balance sheet data has been prepared using the purchase method of accounting for the proposed merger. The acquired assets and assumed
liabilities of Whitman are stated in the unaudited selected pro forma condensed combined balance sheet data at amounts representing an allocation of the purchase price based upon a preliminary
estimate of the fair values of the acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities at the assumed December 31, 2002 acquisition date. 

        The
unaudited selected pro forma condensed combined financial data is based upon the financial condition and operating results of Whitman during periods when it was not under the
control, influence or management of CEC. The information presented may not be indicative of the results that would have actually occurred had the acquisition been completed as of January 1,
2002, nor is it necessarily indicative of the future financial condition or operating results of the combined entity. CEC expects to incur reorganization and integration expenses and experience
operating efficiencies as a result of its acquisition of Whitman. The unaudited selected pro forma condensed combined financial data does not give effect to these expenses or any synergies that may
occur due to the integration of Whitman with CEC and should be read along with the historical financial statements of CEC and Whitman and the related notes incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement/prospectus.

COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA    

        We have summarized below certain: 


comparative
per share data for CEC common stock and Whitman common stock on a historical basis; and


combined
per share data on an unaudited pro forma basis after giving effect to the merger as if it occurred on January 1, 2002 using the purchase
method of accounting. 

The
unaudited pro forma combined per share data assumes an exchange ratio of 0.162 shares of CEC common stock for each share of Whitman common stock. We have based this exchange ratio on the average
closing price of CEC common stock on the Nasdaq National Market during the 20 consecutive trading days ended April 21, 2003. You should note that this exchange ratio, and thus the amount of CEC
common stock to be issued in the merger, may decrease or increase depending on the trading prices of CEC common stock during the pricing period prior to the merger. 

        You
should read this data along with the selected historical financial data for CEC and Whitman included in this proxy statement/prospectus and the historical consolidated financial
statements of CEC and Whitman and the related notes incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus. The unaudited pro forma data does not necessarily indicate the results that actually
would have been achieved had we been a single entity during 2002 nor does it necessarily indicate the results we will obtain in the future as a combined entity.

COMPARATIVE MARKET PRICE DATA    

        Shares of CEC common stock trade on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "CECO." Shares of Whitman common stock trade on the American Stock Exchange under
the symbol "WIX". The following table presents the closing market prices for CEC common stock and Whitman common stock on March 26, 2003, the last full trading day prior to the announcement of
the signing of the
merger agreement, and                            , 2003, the last practicable trading day for which
information was available prior to the date of the printing of this proxy statement/prospectus.
The table also presents the equivalent price per share of Whitman common stock as of those dates, which is equal to the value of CEC common stock that a Whitman shareholder would have received for one
share of Whitman common stock if the merger had taken place on those dates. We calculated these equivalent numbers by multiplying the closing market price per share of CEC common stock on these dates
by an assumed exchange ratio of 0.162, and adding the per share cash payment of $6.00. We have based this exchange ratio on the average closing price of CEC common stock on the Nasdaq National Market
during the 20 consecutive trading days ended April 21, 2003. You should note that this exchange ratio may decrease or increase depending on the trading prices of CEC common stock during the
pricing period prior to the merger and the actual value of CEC common stock that a Whitman shareholder will receive upon completion of the merger may be higher or lower than the prices below. As a
result, you should obtain current market quotations for CEC common stock and Whitman common stock before making any decision about the merger.

        Neither CEC nor Whitman has ever paid any cash dividends on its stock. We anticipate that our combined enterprise, for the foreseeable future, will retain any
earnings for use in the operation of our business. Therefore, we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 

RISK FACTORS    

        In determining whether you should vote in favor of the merger and acquire CEC common stock, you should consider carefully, in addition to the other information
contained or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus, the following risks associated with the merger, the combined entity following the merger and ownership of CEC common stock
following the merger. References to "we," "us" and "our" refer to the combined CEC/Whitman entity following completion of the merger. 

Risk Factors Related to the Merger  

Because the market price of CEC common stock may fluctuate, you cannot be sure of the value or number of shares of CEC common stock that you will receive in the merger.  

        Upon completion of the merger, Whitman shareholders will receive cash and shares of CEC common stock for each share of Whitman common stock that they own. The
value and number of shares of CEC common stock to be received by Whitman shareholders will be based on the average closing price of CEC common stock during the 20-day pricing period ending
on the second day prior to the completion of the merger. We expect the market price of CEC common stock to fluctuate prior to the completion of the merger. Therefore, the average closing price of CEC
common stock during the pricing period may be higher or lower than the closing price of CEC common stock on the date of the merger agreement, the date of the Whitman special meeting or the date we
complete the merger. Changes in the market price of CEC common stock prior to the merger may affect the value, and will affect the number, of shares of CEC common stock that you receive in the merger.
You may not receive $8.25 in CEC common stock for each of your shares of Whitman common stock. The price of CEC common stock may fluctuate because of various factors, including: 


general
market, industry and economic conditions and market assessments of those conditions;


changes
in the business, operations or prospects of CEC and market assessments of those changes;


regulatory
considerations;


market
assessments of the likelihood the merger will be completed; and


market
assessments of the timing and amount of integration benefits to be achieved after the merger. 

In
addition, although Whitman has the right to terminate the merger agreement if the average closing price of CEC common stock during the pricing period is less than $37.00, Whitman may elect not to
terminate the merger agreement under these circumstances. In this case, you could receive shares of CEC common stock valued at less than $7.55 per share of Whitman common stock. 

We may be unable to successfully integrate the operations and personnel of Whitman and CEC, which could prevent us from realizing the expected benefits of the merger and
materially harm our business.  

        Among the factors we considered in connection with our decision to pursue the merger was the opportunity to realize synergies and efficiencies through the merger.
In order to obtain the benefits of those synergies and efficiencies, we must successfully integrate Whitman and CEC. If we cannot integrate CEC and Whitman efficiently, promptly, successfully or at
all, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the merger. Key elements of Whitman's businesses that need to be integrated into CEC's network of schools include: 


operational,
management and other professional personnel;


marketing
efforts; and 


financial,
accounting, regulatory and other operational controls, procedures, information systems and policies. 

The
successful combination of the two independent companies will require significant effort, managerial resources, time and expense on the part of CEC and Whitman. The integration process will be
further
complicated by the need to integrate geographically dispersed operations, multiple schools and different corporate cultures. The dedication of management and other personnel to the integration process
may distract these individuals' attention from the conduct of day-to-day business activities. This distraction, along with employees' uncertainty about their role in the
combined company and lack of employee focus due to the distractions of the merger, may disrupt our operations. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs and realization of other
efficiencies related to the integration will at least offset the transaction-related costs over time, we may not be able to realize a net benefit from the merger in the near term or at all. 

If we are unable to retain key Whitman educational personnel and administrators, we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of the merger.  

        The success of combining Whitman with CEC will depend upon the retention of educational personnel and administrators who are critical to the continued
advancement, development and support of Whitman's schools. CEC may not be able to retain key educational personnel and administrators of Whitman before or after the merger. The loss of the services of
any significant group of educational personnel and administrators of Whitman could negatively affect CEC's ability to successfully integrate Whitman's operations. As often occurs with mergers, during
the pre-merger and integration phases, competitors may intensify their efforts to recruit educational personnel and administrators. Employee uncertainty regarding the effects of the merger
could also cause increased turnover. 

Limitations on Whitman's ability to pursue other transactions and termination fees if it does pursue an unsolicited superior proposal could make a competing takeover proposal
more difficult and expensive.  

        The merger agreement prohibits Whitman from initiating or encouraging, and limits Whitman's ability to respond to, inquiries with respect to alternative
acquisition proposals. These provisions limit Whitman's ability to pursue offers from other possible acquirors. Whitman must pay CEC a termination fee of $10 million, plus up to
$1.5 million of CEC's costs and expenses, if the merger agreement terminates under certain circumstances, including in connection with an acquisition proposal from a third party. The
termination fee could discourage another company from making a competing takeover proposal that could be more advantageous to Whitman's shareholders because this fee may make the competing proposal
more difficult or expensive and could deter Whitman from entering into an alternative transaction. Whitman is not presently aware of any competing proposal. 

The price of CEC common stock may be affected by factors different from those affecting the price of Whitman common stock.  

        Upon the completion of the merger, holders of Whitman common stock will become holders of CEC common stock. CEC's business differs from that of Whitman, and CEC's
results of operations, as well as the price of CEC's common stock, may be affected by factors different from those affecting Whitman's results of operations and the price of Whitman stock before the
merger. For a discussion of CEC's and Whitman's respective businesses, see CEC's Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2002 and Whitman's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002, which are incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement/prospectus. See "Where You Can Find More Information" on page 73. 

Some of the executive officers and directors of Whitman have interests that could have affected their decision to support or approve the merger.  

        Some of Whitman's executive officers and directors have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, interests of Whitman shareholders.
These interests, which include indemnification, extension of directors and officers' liability insurance, severance payments and cashing out of vested and unvested options, could have affected the
decision of these persons to support or approve the merger. 

The price of Whitman common stock may be adversely affected if we do not complete the merger.  

        If the merger is not completed for any reason, the price of Whitman's common stock may fall significantly to the extent the current market price reflects an
assumption that the merger will be completed. In addition, significant merger-related costs incurred by Whitman, including legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, must be paid by Whitman if we
do not complete the merger. 

Whitman shareholders will have no control over CEC's future operations.  

        Whitman's shareholders presently have the power to approve or reject any matter requiring the approval of shareholders under Florida law and Whitman's articles of
incorporation. Immediately after the merger, Whitman's shareholders, in the aggregate, will hold approximately 5.0% of the outstanding shares of CEC common stock. Even if all of the former Whitman
shareholders voted in concert on all matters presented to CEC's stockholders, this number of CEC shares, without a substantial number of other holders of CEC common stock voting the same way, will not
affect the outcome of proposals voted upon by the stockholders of CEC. 

Risk Factors Related to the Combined Business and Owning CEC Common Stock  

Failure of our U.S. schools to comply with extensive regulations could result in financial penalties, restrictions on our operations or loss of external financial aid funding.  

        We derive a significant portion of our revenue from U.S. federal student financial aid programs administered by the U.S. Department of Education. To participate
in these programs, a U.S. institution must obtain and maintain authorization by the appropriate state agencies, accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department of Education and
certification by the Department of Education. As a result, our U.S. schools are subject to extensive regulation by these agencies. These regulations cover virtually all phases of our operations,
including our educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing and recruiting, financial operations, including the payment of refunds to
students who withdraw, and financial strength. These regulations also affect our ability to acquire or open additional schools, add new educational programs or change our corporate structure. The
agencies that regulate our operations periodically revise their requirements and modify their interpretations of existing requirements. 

        If
one of our schools were to violate any of these regulatory requirements, we could suffer a financial penalty. A regulatory agency could also place limitations on our schools'
operations or terminate the schools' ability to grant degrees and certificates or their eligibility to receive federal student financial aid funds. We cannot predict with certainty how all of these
requirements will be applied, or whether each of our schools will be able to comply with all of the requirements in the future. We have described some of the most significant regulatory requirements
and risks that apply to our U.S. schools in the following paragraphs. 

The U.S. Congress may change the law or reduce funding for federal student financial aid programs, which could harm our student population and revenue.  

        The U.S. Congress periodically revises the Higher Education Act and other laws governing the federal student financial aid programs and annually determines the
funding level for each of these 

programs. During 2003-2004, Congress is expected to devote significant attention to reauthorizing the Higher Education Act, which will likely result in numerous legislative changes. Any
action by Congress that significantly reduces funding for the federal student financial aid programs or the ability of our schools or students to participate in these programs could have a material
adverse effect on our student population and revenue. Legislative action may also increase our administrative costs and require us to modify our practices in order for our schools to comply fully with
applicable requirements. 

If we or our schools do not meet financial responsibility standards, our schools may be required to post a letter of credit and our participation in federal student financial
aid programs could be limited, which could harm our net income and student population.  

        To participate in the federal student financial aid programs, an institution must meet general standards of financial responsibility and either meet specific
numeric measures of financial responsibility or post a letter of credit in favor of the Department of Education and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in the federal student
financial aid programs. Currently, none of our schools is required to post a letter of credit in favor of the Department of Education or accept other conditions on its participation in the federal
student financial aid programs due to failure to satisfy the numeric measures of financial responsibility. If, however, we or our institutions fail to satisfy the numeric standards in the future, any
required letter of credit, if obtainable, and any limitations on our participation in the federal student financial aid programs could adversely affect our net income and student population. Our
inability to obtain a required letter of credit also could adversely affect our net income and student population. Under a separate requirement, an institution must post a letter of credit if it makes
more than a certain proportion of student refunds beyond the regulatory time period. Twenty-one of CEC's institutions have outstanding letters of credit in favor of the Department of
Education in the aggregate amount of $2.8 million due to late student refunds. Three of Whitman's institutions have outstanding letters of credit in favor of the Department of Education in the
aggregate amount of $575,000 due to late student refunds. 

Our schools may lose eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs if their student loan default rates are too high, which could harm our student
population and revenue.  

        An institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all of the federal student financial aid programs if defaults by its students on their federal
student loans exceed specified rates. If any of our institutions, depending on its size, loses eligibility to participate in the federal student financial aid programs because of high student loan
default rates, that loss could have a material adverse effect on our student population and revenue. 

Our schools may lose eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs if the percentage of their revenue derived from those programs is too high, which
could harm our student population and revenue.  

        A proprietary institution loses its eligibility to participate in the federal student financial aid programs if it derives more than 90% of its revenue from these
programs in any fiscal year. If any of our institutions, depending on its size, loses eligibility to participate in the federal student financial aid programs, that loss could have a material adverse
effect on our student population and revenue. 

If regulators do not approve our acquisition of schools from third parties, our ability to participate in federal student financial aid programs at the acquired institution
would be limited.  

        When we acquire an institution, including Whitman, the Department of Education and most applicable state authorizing agencies and accrediting agencies consider
that a change of ownership or control of the institution has occurred. For Department of Education purposes, an institution's eligibility to participate in the federal student financial aid programs
is subject to review, and the institution could
lose its eligibility to participate unless it can reestablish its state authorization and accreditation and satisfy the other requirements to be recertified by the Department of Education as an 

eligible institution following any change of ownership or control. If an institution is recertified following a change of ownership or control, it will be on a provisional basis. The Department of
Education has the authority to provisionally and temporarily certify an institution following a change of control under certain circumstances while the Department of Education reviews the
institution's application. A change of ownership or control of an institution under the standards of the Department of Education may result in the temporary suspension of the institution's
participation in the federal student financial aid programs until the Department of Education issues a temporary certification document. With respect to the state and accrediting agencies, most of the
states and accrediting agencies include the sale of a controlling interest of common stock in the definition of a change of control. A change of control under the definition of any of these agencies
would require the affected institution to reaffirm its state authorization or accreditation. The requirements to obtain such reaffirmation from the states and accrediting agencies with jurisdiction
over our schools vary widely. If we were unable to promptly reestablish the state authorization, accreditation or Department of Education certification of an institution we acquired, depending on the
size of that acquisition, that failure could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

If regulators do not approve transactions involving a change of control or change in our corporate structure, we may lose our ability to participate in federal student
financial aid programs.  

        If we experience a change of control under the standards of applicable state agencies, accrediting agencies or the Department of Education, we or the schools
governed by such agencies must seek the approval of the relevant agencies. The failure of any of our schools to reestablish its state authorization, accreditation or Department of Education
certification would result in a loss of federal student financial aid funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our student population and revenue. 

        The
Department of Education, applicable state agencies or applicable accrediting agencies may consider transactions or events other than a sale of a controlling interest of common stock
to constitute a change of control. If the Department of Education or any of the other regulatory agencies interprets a particular sequence of events to constitute a change of control, we would be
required to seek all necessary approvals to continue our participation in the federal student financial aid programs, and could at least temporarily lose access to financial aid funding on that basis.
Some of these transactions or events, such as a significant acquisition of our common stock, may be beyond our control. 

If our schools do not maintain their state authorizations and accreditations, they may not operate or participate in federal student financial aid programs.  

        A school that grants degrees, diplomas or certificates must be authorized by the relevant agencies of the state in which it is located and, in some cases, other
states where the school is deemed to be
operating. State authorization and accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department of Education also are required for an institution to participate in the federal student financial
aid programs. Requirements for authorization or accreditation vary substantially among the applicable agencies, and some of our schools must satisfy highly detailed standards regarding their
educational programs, facilities, faculty and other matters to maintain the necessary approvals. Loss of state authorization or accreditation by any of our campuses, depending on the size of the
campus, could have a material adverse effect on our student population and revenue. 

Regulatory agencies or third parties may commence compliance reviews, bring claims or initiate litigation against us.  

        Because we operate in a highly regulated industry, we are subject to compliance reviews, claims of non-compliance or lawsuits by government agencies
or third parties. If the results of these reviews or proceedings are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to defend successfully against third-party lawsuits or claims, we may be required to pay
money damages or be subject to fines, limitations, loss of federal 

funding, injunctions or other penalties. Even if we adequately address issues raised by an agency review or successfully defend a third-party lawsuit or claim, we may have to devote significant money
and management resources to address these issues. 

Failure to comply with extensive Canadian regulations could affect the ability of our Canadian schools to participate in Canadian financial aid programs.  

        We derive a majority of our Canadian schools' revenue from Canadian governmental financial aid programs. Depending on their province of residence, Canadian
students may receive loans under the Canada Student Loans Program, the Ontario Student Loans Plan and the Quebec Loans and Bursaries Program. In addition, there are students attending the Canadian
schools who receive government-sponsored financial assistance from provinces other than Ontario and Quebec. 

        Our
Canadian schools must meet eligibility standards to administer these programs and must comply with extensive statutes, rules, regulations and requirements. Each of our Ontario
schools will be required to share the cost of student loan defaults if defaults by its students on their Ontario Student Assistance Plan loans exceed specified rates. Our International Academy of
Design and Technology and SoftTrain schools in Toronto currently do not have a default rate that exceeds the applicable threshold of 25%. However, our International Academy of Design and Technology
school in Ottawa had an overall default rate of 28.6% in 2002 and has received a letter from the Ontario Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities indicating that it may have to share in the
costs of defaults and post an additional bond with the Ministry. If our Canadian schools cannot meet these and other eligibility standards or fail to comply with applicable requirements, it could have
a material adverse effect on our net income. 

        The
Canadian, Ontario and Quebec governments continuously review the legislative, regulatory and other requirements relating to student financial assistance programs due to political and
budgetary pressures. Although we do not anticipate a significant reduction in the funding for these programs, any change that significantly reduces funding or the ability of our schools to participate
in these programs could have a material adverse effect on our student population and revenue. 

Violations of local government regulations by our operations in France, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates could subject us to civil penalties and if these local
regulations increase or change, our ability to conduct business in these countries could be limited.  

        Our schools in France, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates are subject to extensive local regulations and requirements. If we are found to be in
violation of these local regulations, including licensing and accreditation requirements, we could be subject to civil sanctions, including monetary penalties. Additionally, we could be required to
incur significant ongoing expenses to comply with these regulatory requirements or, conceivably, could be restricted or barred from providing educational services in that jurisdiction. 

Failure to effectively manage our growth could harm our business.  

        We have grown rapidly since our incorporation in January 1994. Our continued rapid growth may place a strain on our management, operations, employees or
resources. We may not be able to maintain or accelerate our current growth rate, effectively manage our expanding operations or achieve planned growth on a timely or profitable basis. If we are unable
to manage our growth effectively, we may experience operating inefficiencies and our net income may be materially adversely affected. 

If students fail to pay their outstanding balances, our business will be harmed.  

        We offer a variety of payment plans to help students pay that portion of their education expense not covered by financial aid programs. These balances are
unsecured and not guaranteed. Losses related to unpaid student balances in excess of the amounts we have reserved for bad debts could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Failure to effectively identify, pursue and integrate acquired schools could harm our business.  

        We expect to continue to rely on acquisitions as a key component of our growth. From time to time, we engage in, and we are currently engaged in, evaluations of,
and discussions with, possible acquisition candidates. We may not continue to be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or to acquire any such schools on favorable terms. Furthermore, we
may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired schools into our operations profitably. Acquisitions involve a number of special risks and challenges, including: 


the
diversion of management's attention;


difficulties
in assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired schools;


incurring
significant additional capital expenditures, transaction and operating expenses and non-recurring acquisition-related charges;


dilution
of stockholders' interest in us if we issue equity or equity-related securities as consideration;


adverse
short-term effects on reported operating results from the amortization or write-off of acquired goodwill and other intangible
assets;


assumption
of known and unknown liabilities of acquired companies;


possible
loss of key employees;


difficulty
of presenting a unified corporate image; and


becoming
subject to unanticipated business or regulatory uncertainties or liabilities. 

        Acquired
schools may not enhance our business and, if we do not successfully address associated risks and uncertainties, may ultimately have a material adverse effect on our growth and
ability to compete. 

Opening additional new schools and adding new services could be difficult for us.  

        We have also grown by opening new schools, primarily as additional branches of existing schools. Establishing new schools poses unique challenges and requires us
to make investments in management, capital expenditures, marketing expenses and other resources different, and in some cases greater, than those required with respect to the operation of acquired
schools. When opening a new school, we may be required to obtain appropriate state or provincial and accrediting agency approvals. In addition, to be eligible for federal student financial aid
programs, such a school has to be certified by the Department of Education. Our failure to effectively manage the operations of newly established schools or service areas, or any diversion of
management's attention from our core career-oriented school operating activities, could harm our business. 

Failure to keep pace with changing market needs and technology could harm our student population.  

        Prospective employers of our graduates increasingly demand that their entry-level employees possess appropriate technological skills. Educational programs at our
schools, particularly programs in visual communications and information technology, must keep pace with these evolving requirements. If we cannot respond to changes in industry requirements, it could
have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract students. 

We compete with a variety of schools and if we are unable to compete effectively, our student population and revenue could be harmed.  

        The post-secondary education market is highly competitive. Our schools compete with traditional public and private two-year and
four-year colleges and universities and other proprietary schools, 

including those that offer distance learning programs. Some public and private colleges and universities, as well as other private career-oriented schools, offer programs similar to those of our
schools. Although tuition at private nonprofit institutions is, on average, higher than tuition at our schools, some public institutions are able to charge lower tuition than our schools, due in part
to government subsidies and other financial sources not available to proprietary schools. Some of our competitors in both the public and private sectors have substantially greater financial and other
resources than us. We may incur increasing costs competing for students. If we are not able to compete effectively for students, our revenue may decline. 

Expansion outside of the United States, Canada, France, the United Kingdom and Dubai could adversely affect our business.  

        Although we currently operate in the United States, Canada, France, the United Kingdom and Dubai, we intend to explore opportunities outside those markets. There
may be difficulties and complexities associated with our expansion into these other international markets, and our strategies may not succeed beyond our current markets. International operations
present inherent risks, including: 


currency
fluctuations;


varying
political and economic conditions;


compliance
with and unanticipated changes in legal and regulatory requirements;


trade
barriers;


staffing
and management problems; and


adverse
tax consequences. 

If
we do not effectively address these risks, our growth and ability to compete may be impaired. 

Failure to obtain additional capital in the future could reduce our ability to grow.  

        We believe that funds from operations, cash, investments and borrowings under our $200 million credit facility pursuant to our credit agreement,
approximately $121.5 million of which we expect to access to fund the cash consideration payable to Whitman's shareholders and option holders in the merger, will be adequate to fund our current
operating plans for the foreseeable future. However, we may need additional debt or equity financing in order to carry out our strategy of growth through acquisitions. We may also need additional debt
or equity financing in the future to carry out our growth strategy. The amount and timing of such additional financing will vary principally depending on the timing and size of acquisitions and the
sellers' willingness to provide financing themselves. To the extent that we require additional financing in the future and are unable to obtain such additional financing when needed or on terms
acceptable to us, we may not be able to fully implement our growth strategy. 

Our credit agreement limits our ability to take various actions.  

        Our credit agreement limits our ability to take various actions, including paying dividends and disposing of assets. Accordingly, we may be restricted from taking
actions which management believes would be desirable and in the best interests of us and our stockholders. The credit agreement also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy
specified financial tests. A breach of any covenants contained in the credit agreement could result in an event of default under that agreement and allow the lenders to pursue various remedies,
including accelerating the indebtedness outstanding thereunder, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. 

The loss of our key personnel could harm our business.  

        Our success to date has depended, and will continue to depend, largely on the skills and efforts of John M. Larson, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Officer, Patrick K. Pesch, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary, Nick Fluge, President of our Online Education Group, and Jacob P. Gruver, President of our
Colleges, Schools & Universities Group, and our other key personnel. Our success also depends, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified faculty, school presidents
and administrators and corporate management. Due to the nature of our business, we may have difficulty locating and hiring qualified personnel, and retaining such personnel once hired. None of our
employees is subject to an employment or noncompetition agreement other than Mr. Larson. We do not maintain life insurance on any of our employees. The loss of the services of any of our key
personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial
condition. In addition, a limited number of our faculty members are represented by unions, although they are not currently subject to collective bargaining agreements. If we become subject to
collective bargaining agreements, our flexibility in making human resources decisions could be impaired. 

Terrorist attacks and other acts of wider armed conflict may have an adverse effect on the U.S. and world economies and may disrupt our provision of educational services.  

        Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war, such as those that took place on September 11, 2001, could disrupt our operations. Attacks or armed
conflicts that directly impact our physical facilities or ability to recruit foreign students could significantly affect our ability to provide educational services to our students and thereby impair
our ability to achieve our expected results. Further, violent acts and threats of future attacks could adversely effect the U.S. and world economies. Finally, further terrorist acts could cause the
United States to enter into a wider armed conflict which could further impact our operations and result in prospective students, as well as our current students and employees, entering the armed
forces. These factors could cause significant declines in our population and could have a material adverse effect on our revenue. 

Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law and our stockholders' rights plan could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial
to our stockholders, more difficult.  

        Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may delay, defer or inhibit a future acquisition of us not approved by our board of directors. These
provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our board of directors in connection with the transaction. For example, our
certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such voting, conversion and other rights, preferences, privileges and
restrictions as it determines, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to, and may be harmed by, the rights of the holders
of our preferred stock that may be issued in the future. In addition, our certificate of incorporation divides our board of directors into three classes having staggered terms. We are also subject to
the provisions of Delaware law that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of our company. One of these provisions prevents us from engaging in a business
combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person becomes an interested stockholder, unless specified conditions are satisfied. We have also implemented
a stockholders' rights plan, also commonly called a "poison pill," that would substantially reduce or eliminate the expected economic benefit to an acquiror from acquiring us in a manner or on terms
not approved by our board of directors. These and other impediments to a third-party acquisition or change of control could limit the price investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our
common stock. 

Risks specific to CEC's American InterContinental University Online's ("AIU Online") business and Whitman's Colorado Technical University's ("CTU") distance learning program
could have a material adverse effect on our business.  

        AIU Online and CTU's distance learning program both intend to continue increasing their number of students and additional resources will be required to support
this anticipated growth, including additional faculty, and enrollment, academic and financial counselors. AIU Online's exceptional growth to this point has placed, and future growth is expected to
place, a significant strain on AIU Online's financial and operational resources. The continued development of awareness of the programs offered by AIU Online is critical to the continued acceptance
and growth of AIU Online's programs. If AIU Online is unable to continue to develop awareness of the programs offered by it, this could limit its enrollments and negatively impact its ability to
increase revenues and profitability. 

        Both
AIU Online's and CTU's distance learning program's success depends in part on their ability to expand the content of programs, develop new programs in a cost-effective
manner, and meet students' needs in a timely manner. The expansion of their existing programs and the development of new programs may not be accepted by their students or the online education market.
CTU also must seek approval for expansion of its distance learning offerings from its accreditor, the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. 

        The
performance and reliability of AIU Online's program infrastructure and CTU's distance learning infrastructure are critical to the respective reputations of AIU Online and CTU, and
their ability to attract and retain students. Any system error or failure, or a sudden and significant increase in traffic,
may result in the unavailability of AIU Online's computer networks. CTU contracts with an outside vendor specialist in providing technical support to distance learning providers. The performance of
this contractor cannot be guaranteed and certain system errors or failures or demand changes could occur, which could cause CTU's computer network to be unavailable. Individual, sustained, or repeated
occurrences could significantly damage the reputation of AIU Online or CTU's distance learning program and result in a loss of potential or existing students. Additionally, these computer systems and
operations are vulnerable to interruption or malfunction due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters and telecommunications failures. Any interruption to AIU Online's computer
systems or operations could have a material adverse effect on the ability of AIU Online to attract and retain students. Any interruption to the computer systems of CTU's vendor would disrupt CTU's

THE WHITMAN SPECIAL MEETING    

Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting  

        We are sending this proxy statement/prospectus to you as part of the solicitation of proxies by the Whitman board of directors for use at the special meeting, and
any adjournment or postponement of that special meeting, to be held at Whitman's executive offices located at 4400 Biscayne Boulevard, 14th Floor, Miami, Florida 33137,
on                        
    , 2003 at 10:00 a.m., local time. We are first mailing this proxy statement/prospectus to you on or
about                            , 2003. 

Purpose of the Special Meeting  

        At the special meeting, Whitman shareholders will consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 26,
2003, among Whitman, CEC and Marlin Acquisition Corp. a wholly-owned subsidiary of CEC. The merger agreement provides for the merger of Whitman with and into Marlin Acquisition Corp., with Marlin
Acquisition Corp. continuing as a wholly-owned subsidiary of CEC. 

        Whitman
does not expect any matter to be brought before the special meeting other than the merger. If other matters are properly presented at the special meeting, the persons named in
the proxy card will vote in their discretion with respect to those matters. However, if a proposal to adjourn or postpone the meeting is properly presented to permit the Whitman board of directors to
further solicit proxies because there are not sufficient votes to approve the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting, the persons named in the proxy card will not have discretion to vote
shares voted against the merger agreement in favor of adjournment or postponement to solicit further proxies in favor of the merger agreement. 

The Whitman board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the merger agreement.  

 Record Date and Outstanding Shares; Voting Rights  

        Only holders of record of Whitman common stock at the close of business on the record date,
                        , 2003, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the
special meeting. At the close of business on the record date, there were                        shares of Whitman common stock
outstanding held by approximately            holders of record. Each holder
of record of Whitman common stock on the record date will be entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted upon at the special meeting. 

Quorum; Required Votes; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes  

        At the special meeting, a quorum requires the presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of Whitman common stock outstanding as
of the record date. Abstentions and broker non-votes, which are executed proxies returned by a broker holding shares in "street name" that indicate that the broker has not received voting
instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares and does not have discretionary authority to vote the shares with respect to the approval of the merger agreement, will be counted as shares
present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. 

        Approval
of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Whitman common stock outstanding as of the record date. The failure to submit a vote,
abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as votes "AGAINST" the approval of the merger agreement. As of the record date, Whitman directors and executive officers had
voting power with respect to approximately    % of the outstanding shares of Whitman common stock. Phillip Frost, Whitman's chairman of the board, and a trust of which he is sole trustee,
Richard Pfenniger, Jr., Whitman's chief executive officer and vice-chairman of the board, and Fernando Fernandez, Whitman's 

chief financial officer, have entered into a voting agreement with CEC in which they agree to vote the Whitman shares for which they have voting power in favor of the merger. These shares represent
approximately    % of the shares of Whitman common stock outstanding as of the record date. The remaining directors and executive officers of Whitman have indicated their intention to vote
the Whitman shares for which they have voting power in favor of the approval of the merger agreement. 

Proxies; Revocability of Proxies  

        All shares of Whitman common stock represented by properly executed proxies received before or at the special meeting will, unless the proxies are revoked, be
voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on those proxies. If you are a shareholder of record and you return a properly executed proxy card but fail to vote on the proposal, the designated
proxies will exercise their discretionary authority and vote your shares "FOR" the approval of the merger agreement. 

        If
your shares are held in "street name" in an account at a brokerage firm, bank or other fiduciary, you should direct them on how to vote your shares. If you do not provide your broker,
bank or other fiduciary with instructions on how to vote your shares with respect to the merger proposal, your broker, bank or other fiduciary will not vote your shares, which will result in a "broker
non-vote" for your shares. Broker non-voters will have the same effect as a vote against the merger agreement. 

        If
you receive more than one proxy card, it is because you hold your Whitman shares in different names. For example, you may hold some of your Whitman shares individually, some jointly
with your spouse and some in trust for your children, in which case you should receive three separate proxy cards to vote. Please complete, date, sign and return all of the proxy cards. 

        A
Whitman shareholder of record giving a proxy has the power to revoke its proxy and change its votes by: 


sending
a written notice to Whitman's corporate secretary prior to the special meeting, stating that the shareholder would like to revoke its proxy;


completing,
dating, signing and mailing another proxy card and having it received by Whitman prior to the special meeting; or


attending
the special meeting and voting in person. 

Attendance
at the special meeting will not in and of itself constitute revocation of a proxy; you must cast an actual vote. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other fiduciary and
you have directed that person to vote your shares, you must instruct that person if you want to change your vote. 

Solicitation of Proxies  

        Whitman and CEC will share equally the cost of printing and mailing this proxy statement/prospectus. Whitman may supplement the initial solicitation of proxies by
mail by telephone, fax, e-mail or personal solicitation by directors, officers or other regular employees of Whitman. No additional compensation will be paid to directors, officers or other regular
employees for these services. Whitman will request brokers, banks and other fiduciaries holding Whitman common stock beneficially owned by others to send this proxy statement/prospectus to, and obtain
proxies from, the beneficial owners of the shares and will reimburse the holders for their reasonable expenses in doing so. Whitman has engaged Georgeson Shareholder Communications, Inc. to help it
solicit proxies at a cost of approximately $6,500 plus expenses. 

        You
should not send in any Whitman stock certificates with your proxy card. The exchange/paying agent will mail a transmittal letter to you containing instructions for the surrender of
Whitman stock certificates as soon as practicable after completion of the merger. 

THE MERGER    

Structure of the Merger  

        If the Whitman shareholders approve the merger agreement and we satisfy or waive all other conditions to the merger contained in the merger agreement, Whitman
will merge with and into Marlin Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of CEC. As a result Whitman will cease its separate corporate existence and Marlin Acquisition Corp. will continue as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of CEC. We intend to complete the merger on the second business day after obtaining shareholder approval at the Whitman special meeting and satisfaction or waiver of all other
conditions contained in the merger agreement, which we hope will be in                  2003. We cannot, however, predict exactly when we will complete the
merger. 

Background of the Merger  

        Whitman's board of directors and management have periodically reviewed alternatives available to Whitman as part of their ongoing focus on enhancing shareholder
value. These alternatives have generally included continued internal growth and possible growth through a business combination with a strategic partner who might provide access to greater financial
resources and operational capabilities. From time to time, members of Whitman's management have received and considered unsolicited informal expressions of interest from parties interested in pursuing
a business combination with Whitman. 

        In
early 2002, Whitman was approached by a publicly-traded education company that expressed interest in acquiring or entering into a business combination with Whitman. The Whitman board
authorized Whitman's senior management to engage in discussions with that party and, in connection with those discussions, on February 21, 2002, Whitman retained Legg Mason Wood Walker,
Incorporated as its exclusive financial advisor to advise the Whitman board in reviewing that party's proposal and any other proposals that Whitman might receive regarding the sale of Whitman. 

        Over
the first half of 2002, Whitman engaged in preliminary discussions with a total of four publicly-traded education companies, including CEC. Each of these companies independently
approached Whitman and expressed interest in acquiring or entering into a business combination with Whitman, and Whitman provided limited due diligence information to these parties after receiving
confidentiality agreements covering the provided information. Throughout this period, Richard Pfenniger, Jr., the vice-chairman and chief executive officer of Whitman, had a number of
informal discussions with members of the Whitman board and Whitman's financial and legal advisors. He also advised the Whitman board on the status of any ongoing discussions at the regular board
meetings during this period. 

        On
May 14, 2002, Mr. Pfenniger and Jack Larson, the chairman and chief executive officer of CEC, along with Patrick Pesch, chief financial officer of CEC and Todd Steele,
director of strategic planning and development for CEC, had an informal introductory meeting at a New York Society of Security Analysts conference. Both companies were presenting at the conference. 

        In
mid-June of 2002, Mr. Steele contacted Mr. Pfenniger to request a meeting in Miami to learn more about Whitman's business and to explore whether a
transaction between CEC and Whitman might benefit both parties. 

        On
June 26 and 27, 2002, Mr. Steele met with Mr. Pfenniger and Fernando Fernandez, Whitman's chief financial officer, in Miami. Prior to the meeting, CEC signed a
confidentiality and standstill agreement with Whitman, agreeing (1) to keep information it obtained from Whitman confidential and (2) to not engage in certain transactions for a
specified period of time with respect to Whitman's common stock without the consent of the Whitman board. During the meetings, the parties discussed 

their operating philosophies and business strategies, as well as the status of Whitman's business operations, and Mr. Steele requested detailed financial information about Whitman's
operations. 

        Over
the next few weeks, CEC received and analyzed Whitman's financial information and on July 15, 2002, CEC's interest in Whitman was discussed at a regularly scheduled meeting
of CEC's board of directors. 

        On
July 31 and August 1, 2002, Mr. Steele met with Mr. Pfenniger and Mr. Fernandez in Miami. In addition to further discussion of Whitman's business
and additional requests for due diligence information, Mr. Steele and Mr. Pfenniger had a preliminary discussion regarding a potential merger of CEC and Whitman, including potential
structuring parameters and the transaction process. 

        At
a regularly scheduled meeting on August 1, 2002, Whitman's board of directors discussed the status of the discussions with CEC and the other companies that had approached
Whitman. 

        In
early August 2002, Mr. Steele telephoned Mr. Pfenniger to discuss CEC's initial thoughts regarding a proposal for the acquisition of Whitman for $9.00 per share.
Mr. Pfenniger responded that Whitman was not interested in the specific proposal discussed. The parties did not reach any agreement during the conversation, but decided to continue with further
discussions. 

        During
the summer of 2002, each of the other three parties that had previously expressed an interest in pursuing a business combination with Whitman either suspended those discussions
and their due diligence investigations or significantly curtailed their contacts with Whitman's management. Two of those three companies never submitted a proposal to Whitman. The remaining company,
which was also the first to have approached Whitman, had submitted a proposal to Whitman during May 2002 for a business combination transaction but had shortly thereafter suspended its
discussions with Whitman in order to pursue another acquisition. Although this party resumed periodic discussions with Whitman in the summer of 2002, it indicated to Mr. Pfenniger at that time
that it was not prepared to pursue a business combination on the terms it had previously proposed but made a revised proposal on terms that Whitman believed were less attractive than the party's
original proposal. Whitman agreed to allow the other party to continue its due diligence investigation. 

        On
September 27, 2002, Mr. Steele telephoned Mr. Pfenniger to propose an acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of Whitman for $11.00 per share consisting of
$4.00 in cash and shares of CEC's common stock valued at $7.00. CEC also sent a letter describing the proposal to Whitman. At the time of this proposal, Whitman's common stock was trading in a range
between $5.00 and $6.00 per share. After reviewing the proposal, Mr. Pfenniger responded that CEC's proposal was inadequate. Mr. Pfenniger suggested that CEC continue its financial
analysis of Whitman. 

        On
October 14, 2002, CEC's board of directors discussed the status of the negotiations with Whitman during a regularly scheduled meeting. 

        During
October 2002, CEC continued its analysis of the information provided by Whitman and monitored Whitman's operational performance. Mr. Steele held periodic
conversations with Mr. Pfenniger and Mr. Fernandez about Whitman's business. In late October or early November the parties agreed to have CEC and its advisors conduct several days of due
diligence on-site at Whitman's corporate offices in Miami, to provide CEC greater detail regarding Whitman's operations to potentially support a higher valuation. CEC sent Whitman a
detailed information request list on November 7, 2002. 

        On
November 1, 2002, Whitman's board of directors discussed the status of the negotiations with CEC and the other party during a regularly scheduled meeting. 

        From
December 11 until December 13, 2002, a team of CEC employees, its corporate counsel, Katten Muchin Zavis Rosenman, and Ernst & Young LLP, traveled to Whitman's
corporate offices in Miami to conduct preliminary business, legal and financial due diligence. 

        On
December 16, 2002, CEC's board of directors discussed the status of the negotiations with Whitman during a regularly scheduled meeting, and on December 17, 2002,
Mr. Larson, Mr. Pesch and Mr. Steele met in Miami with Mr. Pfenniger, Mr. Fernandez and David Ruggieri, president of Whitman's Ultrasound Diagnostics Schools
subsidiary, to discuss Whitman's current business operations and prospects. 

        Following
this meeting, on December 20, 2002, Mr. Steele submitted a revised proposal to Mr. Pfenniger for an acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of Whitman
for $12.50 per share consisting of $6.50 in cash and shares of CEC's common stock valued at $6.00. CEC also sent a letter describing this proposal to Whitman. At the time, Whitman's common stock was
trading in a range between $6.00 and $7.00 per share. 

        During
mid-December 2002, representatives of the other party that had previously proposed a business combination involving Whitman contacted representatives of Legg
Mason and indicated that the other party desired to meet with Whitman to resume discussions. On December 19, 2002, Mr. Pfenniger, Mr. Fernandez, Mr. Ruggieri and
representatives of Legg Mason met with representatives of this other party and held discussions regarding each other's businesses and a possible business combination transaction. 

        Following
these discussions, in late December 2002, the other party proposed a business combination involving Whitman at a price per share that was lower than CEC's
December 20
th
 proposal. In early January 2003, Whitman advised the other party that it did not believe that the party's most recent proposal was adequate. Although the
other party thereafter indicated that it might be willing to increase the price per share it was willing to offer, the revised offer the other party suggested that it might consider offering was still
lower than CEC's December 20
th
 proposal. In response, Mr. Pfenniger suggested that the other party continue its due diligence investigation and resume discussions if it was
interested in pursuing a transaction at a higher value for Whitman shareholders after completing its due diligence. 

        In
early January 2003, Mr. Pfenniger informed Mr. Steele that although CEC's December 20th proposal was improved, it still did not represent an adequate value
for Whitman. Mr. Pfenniger and Mr. Steele then agreed that CEC would work toward completing its due diligence review of Whitman, and that during the same period the parties would prepare
and fundamentally agree on the terms of a merger agreement subject to continued negotiation of a mutually acceptable price. 

        On
January 7, 2003, Mr. Pfenniger sent a preliminary term sheet to CEC outlining certain non-financial terms for the merger transaction. 

        On
February 1, 2003, Mr. Pfenniger discussed the status of his discussions with CEC and the other potential acquirer at a regular meeting of the Whitman board. At the
February 1 meeting, the Whitman board encouraged Mr. Pfenniger to pursue discussions with both CEC and the other party to determine whether a mutually agreeable proposal could be reached
with either of those parties. 

        From
February 10, 2003 until February 12, 2003, a team of CEC employees, along with advisors from Katten Muchin Zavis Rosenman and Ernst & Young LLP, traveled to
Whitman's corporate offices in Miami to conduct further business, legal and financial due diligence. 

        On
February 13, 2003, Katten Muchin Zavis Rosenman delivered to Whitman and its outside counsel a first draft of a proposed merger agreement and voting agreement. Subsequently,
representatives of Whitman's outside counsel and Katten Muchin Zavis Rosenman negotiated various provisions of the agreements and, on March 7, 2003, Katten Muchin Zavis Rosenman delivered a
revised draft of the merger agreement and the voting agreement. The parties agreed to meet in Miami the following week for detailed discussions concerning the terms of a potential transaction. 

        On
March 3, 2003, the board of directors of CEC briefly discussed the status of negotiations with Whitman during a regularly scheduled telephonic board meeting. 

        From
March 10, 2003 until March 12, 2003, representatives of CEC and Katten Muchin Zavis Rosenman met in Miami with representatives of Whitman and its outside counsel, for
detailed discussions concerning provisions of the merger agreement and other transaction documents. At these meetings, CEC proposed to pay $14.00, consisting of $6.00 in cash and shares of CEC's
common stock valued at $8.00, for each outstanding share of Whitman common stock. Whitman provided a counter-proposal of $14.25 for each outstanding share of Whitman common stock. CEC tentatively
agreed to this price, and proposed delivering $6.00 in cash and shares of CEC's common stock valued at $8.25, subject to Whitman agreeing to enter into an exclusivity agreement and satisfactory
conclusion of the negotiations of the material open items in the merger agreement. After reviewing the terms of CEC's increased proposal in comparison to Whitman's prior discussions both with CEC and
the other parties (including the second party which had made a proposal during 2002), Whitman agreed to grant CEC the exclusivity period, subject to Whitman's right to continue to provide the second
party with due diligence information requested by that other party. On March 12, 2003, CEC and Whitman entered into an exclusivity agreement prohibiting Whitman from soliciting acquisition
proposals from, or discussing acquisition proposals with, third parties through March 28, 2003 subject to Whitman's right to continue to provide due diligence information to the other party as
described above. 

        On
March 14, 2003, representatives of the second party conducted a previously arranged visit to Whitman's Miami offices to continue their due diligence but did not submit a
revised proposal. 

        On
March 17, 2003, Mr. Pfenniger, Mr. Fernandez and a representative of Legg Mason met with CEC's senior management at CEC's offices in Hoffman Estates to discuss
CEC's operations, financial condition and future prospects. Prior to the meeting Whitman signed a confidentiality and standstill agreement with CEC, agreeing (1) to keep information it obtained
from CEC confidential and (2) to not engage in certain transactions for a specified period of time with respect to CEC common stock without the consent of CEC's board of directors. During that
same week, two representatives of CEC accompanied Mr. Pfenniger to Whitman's Colorado Technical University campus in Colorado Springs, and two other representatives of CEC accompanied
Mr. Ruggieri on visits to four of Whitman's Ultrasound Diagnostics Schools campuses. During this time period, Mr. Pfenniger had informal discussions with the members of the Whitman board
of directors concerning the status of the negotiations with CEC. 

        Representatives
of CEC and Katten Muchin Zavis Rosenman met in Miami with representatives of Whitman and its outside counsel on March 24, 2003 and March 25, 2003, to
finalize the transaction documents. 

        On
March 25, 2003, CEC's board of directors met to discuss the proposed merger, including the pricing and other key terms of the merger agreement. At the meeting, the board of
directors received presentations from CEC's management and Katten Muchin Zavis Rosenman regarding the proposed merger and merger agreement. After careful consideration of the structure, terms and
conditions of the proposed merger, CEC's board of directors unanimously approved the proposed transaction as in the best interests of CEC. 

        Whitman's
board of directors met on March 26, 2003 to discuss the proposed merger, including the pricing and other terms of the merger agreement. The Whitman board of directors
was advised by management and by Whitman's outside counsel on the terms and conditions contained in the merger agreement and the voting agreement, and the negotiations which had led to such terms. At
that meeting, a representative of Legg Mason made a presentation to the Whitman board and, after reviewing the material factors in its assessment of the proposed merger, Legg Mason indicated that as
of that date, in its opinion, the proposed merger consideration to be received by Whitman shareholders was fair from a financial point of view to Whitman shareholders. All directors participated in 

discussions concerning the proposed transaction and the course of action that Whitman should take. After careful consideration of the structure, terms and conditions of the proposed merger, the
Whitman board unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby as in the best interests of Whitman and its shareholders. 

        On
March 26, 2003, representatives of both Whitman and CEC finalized and executed the merger agreement and all related agreements and documents. The parties issued a joint press
release announcing the proposed merger later that day. 

Whitman's Reasons for the Merger  

        The Whitman board of directors has unanimously determined that the merger is in the best interests of Whitman and its shareholders and approved the merger
agreement. The Whitman board of directors therefore unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the approval of the merger agreement. 

        In
making its recommendation, the Whitman board of directors considered a number of factors, including, without limitation, the factors mentioned in the section entitled "Background of
the Merger" above, and the following: 


The
$14.25 per share merger consideration payable to Whitman shareholders in the merger, prior to any adjustment under the terms of the merger agreement,
will provide Whitman shareholders with cash and shares of CEC common stock representing a premium of 42.5% over the $10.00 closing price of Whitman common stock on March 25, 2003, the day
immediately before the date that the Whitman board of directors met to finally approve the merger, and which also represented a 50.1% premium and a 55.7% premium over the average closing price of
Whitman common stock during the one-week period and one-month period, respectively, ended March 25, 2003.


The
opinion of Legg Mason, dated March 26, 2003, that as of that date, the merger consideration to be received by Whitman shareholders in the merger
was fair to Whitman shareholders from a financial point of view. The opinion was considered together with the financial analyses presented to the Whitman board of directors by Legg Mason. A copy of
Legg Mason's written opinion is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement/prospectus. A description of Legg Mason's opinion and analysis is included below under "Opinion of Financial Advisor to
Whitman."


The
historical and recent market prices for Whitman's common stock and CEC's common stock compared to each other and to other competitors in the industry.


The
past financial and operational performance and prospects of Whitman and CEC.


The
current prospects for further appreciation in the value of Whitman's common stock in light of the limited analyst research coverage that Whitman has
received in the past and the limited liquidity of the Whitman common stock. The Whitman board of directors also considered the fact that Whitman shareholders will receive equity in CEC, the prospects
for further appreciation in the value of CEC
common stock, including as a result of the merger, and the significantly greater liquidity of CEC common stock.


The
financial and other terms of the merger, the merger agreement and the related transaction agreements, including the operation of the collar provisions,
the representations, warranties and covenants, the conditions to each party's obligations to complete the merger and the termination provisions. 


Various
alternatives to the merger, including the risks of Whitman remaining independent and successfully executing its business plan, and the likelihood of
ultimately completing a sale to any other interested party at a mutually acceptable price.


The
opportunity for Whitman shareholders to receive shares of CEC common stock in a tax-free reorganization, other than taxes payable on the
gain, if any, on the cash portion of the merger consideration and cash paid in lieu of fractional shares.


The
judgment, advice and analysis of Whitman's senior management, including their favorable recommendation of the merger.


The
Whitman board of directors' belief that the allied health programs of Whitman's schools and additional geographic scope that Whitman's institutions would
provide to CEC would enhance the value of CEC, and that the financial and managerial capabilities of CEC could enhance and extend the value of the businesses contributed by Whitman.


The
ability of Whitman to terminate the merger agreement if the average closing price of CEC common stock during the pricing period would result in Whitman
shareholders receiving merger consideration valued at less than $13.55 per share of Whitman common stock unless CEC agrees to provide Whitman shareholders with merger consideration valued at $13.55
per share of Whitman common stock.


The
ability of CEC to consummate the merger and pay the cash portion of the merger consideration in light of CEC's available credit facility, and the ability
of CEC and Whitman to obtain the regulatory approvals required for the consummation of the merger, including the approval of the Department of Education and state regulatory authorities. The Whitman
board of directors also noted the lack of any financing condition in the merger agreement and the ability of CEC to terminate the merger agreement only in limited circumstances.


The
impact of the merger on students, employees, and communities served by Whitman's academic programs through Whitman having access to CEC's marketing and
enrollment management processes, as well as increased cash resources to fund those efforts. The Whitman board of directors also noted the past performance and reputation of CEC's management team and
the belief that CEC's approach to integrating acquisitions could minimize disruptions to Whitman's existing employees, students and academic programs. 

        The
Whitman board of directors also considered potential detriments involved in the merger, including the following: 


The
conditions imposed by the merger agreement limiting Whitman's ability to consider other proposals by third parties, requiring Whitman to submit the
merger to its shareholders for approval regardless of any proposals that may be presented by third parties and requiring Whitman to pay a termination fee and CEC's expenses under specified
circumstances, the effect of which may prevent others from proposing an alternative transaction that may be more advantageous to Whitman shareholders.


The
risks inherent in the fluctuating price of CEC's common stock on the Nasdaq National Market and the significant increase in CEC's stock price during the
preceding twelve months.


The
ability of CEC to terminate the merger agreement if the average closing price of the CEC common stock during the pricing period would result in Whitman
shareholders receiving merger consideration valued at greater than $14.95 per share of Whitman common stock unless Whitman agrees to accept merger consideration valued at $14.95 per share of Whitman
common stock. 


The
potential disruption of Whitman's business that could result from the announcement of the merger.


Possible
difficulties of integrating the operations, management and corporate cultures of Whitman and CEC. 

        The
foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered and given weight by the Whitman board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive. In view of the wide variety of
factors considered in connection with its evaluation and approval of the merger agreement and the complexity of those matters, the Whitman board did not find it useful or practical to, and did not,
quantify or otherwise assign relative or specific weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination. In addition, individual members of the Whitman board of directors may have
assigned different weights to different factors. The Whitman board of directors determined, however, that, overall, the positive factors of the merger to Whitman and its shareholders outweighed the
negative factors and risks of the merger and, therefore, unanimously approved the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and recommended that the merger agreement be approved by the Whitman
shareholders. 

CEC's Reasons for the Merger  

        From CEC's perspective, the merger furthers its strategy to invest in growth opportunities while creating operating efficiencies through economies of scale by
acquiring schools that CEC believes will benefit from the implementation of its business operating and marketing strategy. For example, CEC believes that the merger will strengthen CEC's health and
online educational programs. The merger will also expand CEC's geographic presence to include new major markets in the United States. CEC expects the merger to open new opportunities for it to offer a
wider range of credential options to meet the needs of a broader student population and to enhance the competitive position of its business and CEC's overall strength in the private,
post-secondary education market. 

Opinion of Financial Advisor to Whitman  

        In February 2002, Whitman engaged Legg Mason Wood Walker, Incorporated to act as Whitman's exclusive financial advisor in advising Whitman
concerning proposals Whitman received for the sale of
Whitman and, if requested by Whitman, assisting in negotiating the terms of a possible merger opportunity. The engagement also provided that if an agreement was reached, Legg Mason would provide an
opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be received by Whitman's shareholders. Legg Mason was not authorized to and did not solicit indications from
interested parties; however, it did advise Whitman regarding unsolicited expressions of interest to acquire Whitman or control of Whitman. 

        Legg
Mason has provided CEC with financing services in the past for which Legg Mason has received customary fees. 

        At
the March 26, 2003 meeting of the Whitman board of directors, Legg Mason delivered its opinion to the Whitman board of directors that, based on and subject to the assumptions
and conditions set forth in its opinion, as of March 26, 2003, the merger consideration of $14.25 per share ($6.00 per share in cash and $8.25 per share in CEC common stock), subject to
adjustment under the terms of the merger agreement, to be received by Whitman's shareholders, is fair to such shareholders, from a financial point of view. 

        The
full text of the opinion, which sets forth the assumptions made, matters considered and the scope and limitations of the review undertaken by Legg Mason in rendering its opinion, is
attached as Annex B to this proxy statement/prospectus, and Legg Mason has consented to its attachment to this proxy statement. You are urged to read the entire Legg Mason opinion carefully. The
opinion is 

directed only to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Whitman shareholders, of the merger consideration to be received by such shareholders. The opinion does not constitute a
recommendation of the merger over any other alternative transaction (including the alternative to not effect the merger) that may be available to Whitman and does not address the underlying business
decision of the Whitman board of directors to proceed with or to effect the merger. Also, Legg Mason is not making any recommendation to Whitman's shareholders as to whether or not they should vote
for or against the merger. In requesting Legg Mason's opinion, the Whitman board of directors did not give any special instructions to Legg Mason or impose any limitation upon the scope of
investigation that Legg Mason deemed necessary to enable it to deliver its opinion. 

        In
arriving at its opinion, Legg Mason had, among other things: 

(i)
reviewed
the material terms of the merger, including a draft dated March 24, 2003 of the merger agreement;

(ii)
reviewed
certain publicly available audited and unaudited financial statements of Whitman and certain other publicly available information concerning
Whitman;

(iii)
reviewed
certain publicly available audited financial statements of CEC and certain other publicly available information concerning CEC;

(iv)
reviewed
certain internal information, primarily financial in nature, concerning Whitman and prepared by its management;

(v)
reviewed
forecast financial statements of Whitman prepared and furnished to Legg Mason by Whitman's senior management;

(vi)
reviewed
the historical stock prices and trading volume of the common stock of Whitman and CEC;

(vii)
held
discussions with certain officers and employees of Whitman concerning Whitman's operations, financial condition and future prospects;

(viii)
held
discussions with certain officers and employees of CEC concerning CEC's operations, financial condition and future prospects;

(ix)
reviewed
certain publicly available financial and stock market data relating to selected public companies that Legg Mason considered relevant to its
inquiry;

(x)
reviewed
certain publicly available data regarding transactions that Legg Mason considered relevant to its inquiry; and

(xi)
conducted
such other financial studies, analyses and investigations and considered such other information as Legg Mason deemed necessary or appropriate. 

        In
connection with its evaluation and preparation of the opinion, Legg Mason assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all financial and other information supplied to Legg
Mason by Whitman's management and all publicly available information, and did not independently verify the information. Legg Mason also relied upon Whitman's management as to the reasonableness and
achievability of the financial projections (and the assumptions and bases in the projections) that Whitman's senior management provided to Legg Mason, and Legg Mason assumed that the projections were
reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of Whitman's management as to Whitman's future operating performance. In arriving at its opinion, Legg
Mason relied upon the financial data for fiscal years 2000 through 2007 presented to the Whitman board of directors at its meeting on March 26, 2003. The projected financial data for 2003
through 2007 were Whitman's latest available projections provided to Legg Mason by Whitman's management as of the date the opinion was rendered. Whitman does not customarily disclose internal
management 

projections of the type provided to Legg Mason in connection with the evaluation and preparation of the opinion. These projections were not prepared with the expectation of public disclosure. The
projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, including factors related to general economic and competitive conditions. Accordingly, actual results could
vary significantly from those set forth in the projections. Legg Mason was not requested to make, and did not make, an independent appraisal or evaluation of Whitman's or CEC's assets, properties,
facilities or liabilities, and Legg Mason has not been furnished with any appraisals or evaluations in respect thereof. 

        The
Legg Mason opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions and circumstances as they existed or were in effect on, and the information made available to Legg
Mason as of, March 24, 2003. Legg Mason expressed no opinion as to what the value of common stock of Whitman or CEC actually would be when the merger is consummated or as to the price or
trading range at which either Whitman or CEC common stock was expected to trade following the announcement of the merger. 

        In
connection with rendering its opinion, Legg Mason assumed in all respects material to its analyses that the merger will be consummated according to the terms and conditions described
in the merger agreement without any waiver of material terms or conditions by any party thereto, and that satisfying any other conditions for completing the merger would not have an adverse effect on
Whitman. 

        The
following is a summary of the principal financial and valuation analyses performed by Legg Mason in connection with its preparation of the opinion. These analyses were presented to,
and discussed with, the Whitman board of directors at its meeting on March 26, 2003. 

 Summary of Legg Mason's Valuation Analysis  

        Legg Mason utilized a series of valuation methodologies customary among investment professionals to determine an estimated value for Whitman before giving effect
to the merger. These valuation methodologies included (a) comparable public companies analysis; (b) premium paid analysis; (c) comparable transactions analysis; and
(d) discounted cash flow, or DCF, analysis. Legg Mason regarded each of these analyses to be appropriate and reflective of generally accepted valuation methodologies given Whitman's trading
volume relative to total shares outstanding, the accessibility of comparable publicly traded companies and available information regarding similar transactions in the education industry. In each
analysis, Legg Mason calculated the implied equity value per share of Whitman common stock. Legg Mason then compared the implied equity values that it calculated to a $14.25 per share merger
consideration. 

 Comparable Public Companies Analysis  

        Legg Mason compared Whitman's relevant historical and current financial and operating results with the operating results of selected publicly traded companies
that are engaged in postsecondary education, collectively referred to as the comparable companies. Legg Mason chose six comparable public companies based on general business, operating and financial
characteristics representative of companies in the industry in which Whitman operates. No company or business used in the analysis of comparable companies is identical or substantially identical to
Whitman. Legg Mason excluded two otherwise comparable companies, Apollo Group, Inc. ("Apollo Group") and Strayer Education Group, Inc. ("Strayer Education"), from its analysis because
Apollo Group's market capitalization is on average six times that of any other comparable member and Strayer Education's margins are on average three times those of Whitman. Legg Mason relied upon the
mean and median multiples of the other comparable companies. 

        In
performing its analysis, Legg Mason calculated multiples of, among other things, each comparable company's TTM (trailing twelve months) EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, 

depreciation and amortization), TTM EPS (earnings per share), projected 2003 EBITDA and projected 2003 EPS, collectively referred to as the Enterprise and Equity Value Multiples. 

        In
using the comparable companies analysis to value Whitman before giving effect to the merger, Legg Mason analyzed financial information, which included: 


operating
performance;


market
capitalization;


growth
rates;


capitalization
ratios;


ratios
of equity value to TTM EPS and 2003 EPS; and


ratios
of enterprise value to TTM EBITDA and 2003 EBITDA. 

        For
the purposes of this analysis, the comparable companies selected by Legg Mason were six companies that operate in the postsecondary education industry as listed below: 

        CEC;

        Concorde
Career Colleges, Inc.; 

        Corinthian
Colleges, Inc.; 

        DeVry, Inc.; 

        Education
Management Corporation; and 

        ITT
Educational Services, Inc. 

        This
analysis produced the following valuation data:

        Legg Mason derived a range of estimated values by applying the above-referenced mean Enterprise and Equity Value Multiples of the comparable companies to
Whitman's appropriate financial statistics. Legg Mason ultimately derived an equity value per share for each multiple after taking into account Whitman's cash of $18.48 million as of
December 31, 2002, debt of $8.04 million as of December 31, 2002, assuming a per share merger consideration of $14.25, and the diluted number of shares outstanding of 17,083,289
as of March 10, 2003. Legg Mason applied the comparable companies' mean and median multiples to Whitman's TTM EBITDA, 2003 EBITDA, TTM EPS and 2003 EPS and calculated an equity value per share.
The resulting implied equity values per share ranged from $10.83 to $17.38. 

 Premium Paid Analysis  

        Legg Mason conducted an analysis of premiums paid in transactions from January 1, 2002 through March 24, 2003 involving acquisitions of publicly
traded companies that had enterprise values between $100 and $300 million as a method of valuing Whitman. A premium paid analysis reviews and analyzes transactions and the resulting implied
share prices involving comparable public companies that have been acquired. By comparing a target's share price prior to the announcement date of the acquisition to the price at which it is acquired,
a premium paid analysis determines what percentage of a premium or discount the acquiror paid. 

        In
performing this analysis, Legg Mason utilized the data from the transactions described above to derive mean and median percentage premiums paid on a one day, one week and one month
prior to announcement date and compared these results to Whitman's share price one day, one week and one month prior to March 24, 2003. 

        This
analysis produced the following valuation data:

        Legg Mason derived a range of estimated equity share prices based upon applying the above-mentioned mean and median premiums paid to Whitman's share price one
day, one week and one month prior to March 24, 2003. The resulting implied equity values per share ranged from $12.26 to $12.82. 

 Comparable Transactions Analysis  

        Legg Mason conducted an analysis of merger and acquisition transactions involving postsecondary education companies, collectively referred to as the comparable
transactions, as a method of valuing Whitman. A comparable transactions analysis reviews and analyzes transactions and the resulting implied multiples, involving companies in the same industries as
Whitman. In performing this analysis, Legg Mason considered that the merger and acquisition transaction environment varies over time because of, among other things, interest rate and equity market
fluctuations and industry results and growth expectations. Likewise, valuations and their implied multiples will vary over time with market conditions. No acquired company or business used in the
comparable transactions analysis is identical or substantially identical to Whitman. 

        Legg
Mason analyzed the acquisition of publicly traded and privately held postsecondary companies and calculated the acquisition multiples paid for these companies. The range of
multiples of these transactions was then applied to Whitman's financial results. These multiples included enterprise value to TTM Revenues, enterprise value to TTM EBITDA and enterprise value to TTM
EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes). Legg Mason calculated the mean and median multiples for each of these categories based on these comparable transactions. 

        For
the purposes of this analysis, the comparable transactions selected by Legg Mason were the following acquisitions of postsecondary education companies: 

        DeVry, Inc.'s
acquisition of Ross University (pending); 

        Corinthian
Colleges, Inc.'s acquisition of Wyo-Tech Acquisition Corp.; 

        Education
Management Corporation's acquisition of Argosy Education Group; 

        CEC's
acquisition of Pennsylvania Culinary Institute; 

        CEC's
acquisition of EduTrek International, Inc.; and 

        Kaplan
Educational Centers acquisition of Quest Education, Inc. 

        This
analysis produced the following valuation data:

        Legg Mason derived a range of estimated values based upon implied enterprise values and equity values derived by applying the above-mentioned mean and median
Enterprise Value Multiples of the comparable transactions analysis to Whitman's appropriate financial statistics. If Legg Mason believed that the multiple for a particular comparable transaction was
extremely high, Legg Mason excluded that multiple and relied upon the multiples of the other comparable transactions. 

        Legg
Mason then applied the comparable transactions multiples obtained to Whitman's TTM Revenues, TTM EBITDA and TTM EBIT to determine an approximate valuation after taking into account
Whitman's cash of $18.48 million and debt of $8.04 million as of December 31, 2002. In deriving the equity value per share, Legg Mason used the diluted number of Whitman shares of
common stock outstanding of 17,083,289 as of March 10, 2003. The resulting implied equity values per share ranged from $8.84 to $14.52. Legg Mason placed little emphasis on the per share values
implied by the revenue mean and median multiples ($14.52 and $10.15) primarily because merger transactions involving companies with positive cash flow are generally valued on multiples of EBITDA and
EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) rather than revenue. 

 Discounted Cash Flow Analysis  

        Legg Mason performed a discounted cash flow analysis premised upon the assumptions summarized below. The discounted cash flow analysis was based upon the
financial and operating information relating to Whitman's business, operations and prospects prepared and provided by Whitman's management and covering fiscal years 2004 through 2007. 

        Using
a discount rate of 13% to 18%, Legg Mason calculated the present value of the projected stream of net unlevered cash flow (as defined below) for fiscal years 2004 through 2007 and
the present cash value of Whitman's terminal value at March 31, 2007. Legg Mason applied the discount rate derived from Whitman's implied weighted average cost of capital (using a pricing model
known as the capital asset pricing model and based on general and systemic risk factors reflected by Whitman). "Net unlevered cash flow," as used in the analysis, means, for each period, projected
EBIT, less taxes at an estimated rate of 40.5%, plus projected depreciation and amortization, less projected capital expenditures, plus or minus projected changes in non-cash working
capital. The terminal value was computed by multiplying Whitman's projected EBITDA by terminal multiples of 5.0x to 7.0x. Legg Mason adjusted the calculated present value of the net unlevered cash
flow and terminal value by adding Whitman's cash and cash equivalents and subtracting Whitman's debt, to calculate a range of equity values for Whitman. 

        This
analysis produced the following valuation data:

        Based on the discount rate and range of terminal multiples referred to above, Legg Mason calculated a range of equity values of $214.5 million to
$314.4 million, after adding Whitman's cash of $18.48 million as of December 31, 2002 and subtracting its debt of $8.04 million as of December 31, 2002. Legg Mason
then derived the implied equity value per share using the diluted number of Whitman shares of common stock outstanding as of March 10, 2003. The implied equity value per share is a range of
$12.55 to $18.40. Legg Mason placed little emphasis on this analysis primarily because the resulting implied per share values were based on management prepared financial projections, which reflected
substantial increases in EBITDA and margin improvement from 2004 through 2007 in contrast to Whitman's historical results for the last three years. 

        The
above summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Legg Mason or of its presentation to the Whitman board of directors. The preparation of a
fairness opinion is a complex process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of these methods to the particular
circumstances and, therefore, is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analysis or the summary set forth above, without considering the
analysis as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying the opinion of Legg Mason. In arriving at its fairness determination, Legg Mason considered the results of all these
constituent analyses and, except as described in this summary, did not attribute any particular weight to any particular factor or analysis
considered by it. Rather, Legg Mason made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering, among other things, that a merger consideration
of $14.25 per share received by Whitman's shareholders would be within the range implied by the results of such analyses. No company or transaction used in any of the above analyses as a comparison is
directly comparable to Whitman or the merger. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable
than suggested by such analyses. 

        Legg
Mason is a nationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in, among other things, the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with
mergers, acquisitions, underwritings, sales and distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary course of
its business, Legg Mason may actively trade in CEC's securities for its own account and the accounts of its customers, and accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in CEC's
securities. Legg Mason also provides equity research coverage of CEC. 

        In
consideration of Legg Mason's services as Whitman's financial advisor, Whitman paid Legg Mason a nonrefundable fee of $25,000 upon execution of the engagement letter and $275,000 upon
Legg Mason's delivery of its opinion. No portion of the initial fee would have been refundable if Legg 

Mason was unable to provide an opinion that the consideration to be received by Whitman's shareholders in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, and no portion of either fee would have
been refundable if Whitman determined not to proceed with the merger. If the merger closes, Whitman has agreed to pay Legg Mason an additional fee in an amount equal to .70% of the aggregate
consideration paid, directly or indirectly, by CEC in the merger, including the aggregate merger consideration received by Whitman's shareholders and option holders. The fee payable to Legg Mason upon
consummation of the merger is estimated to be approximately $1.8 million (assuming the $8.25 value of CEC common stock included in the merger consideration is not adjusted pursuant to the
merger agreement). 

        Whitman
has also agreed to reimburse Legg Mason for up to $50,000 of its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the performance of its services
rendered under the engagement letter, and to indemnify Legg Mason and certain affiliated parties against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising out of or
in connection with the services rendered by Legg Mason under its engagement letter. 

Merger Consideration  

        If we complete the merger, we will exchange each outstanding share of Whitman common stock for $6.00 in cash and a to-be-determined number
of shares of CEC common stock. The value of the CEC common stock component will be approximately $8.25, but is subject to adjustment. The value of CEC common stock to be issued in exchange for each
share of Whitman common stock will be determined
based upon the average closing price of CEC common stock reported on the Nasdaq National Market for the pricing period, which is the 20-day trading period ending on, and including, the
second trading day prior to the day of the closing of the merger. In addition to $6.00 in cash, if the average closing price of CEC common stock for the pricing period is: 


equal
to or greater than $44.00 but no more than $58.00, you will receive CEC common stock valued at $8.25 for each share of Whitman common stock;


greater
than $58.00, you will receive CEC common stock valued at more than $8.25 for each share of Whitman common stock; and


less
than $44.00, you will receive CEC common stock valued at less than $8.25 for each share of Whitman common stock. 

The
exact number of shares of CEC common stock that you will receive will be determined by the merger exchange ratio. The exchange ratio is (1) the value of the CEC common stock to be issued in
the merger per share of Whitman common stock (as determined by reference to the average closing price of CEC common stock during the pricing period) divided by (2) the average closing price of
CEC common stock during the pricing period, unless the exchange ratio is fixed as shown in the table below. The following table shows how we will adjust the value or number of shares of CEC common
stock 

that you receive for each of your shares of Whitman common stock, based upon the average closing price of CEC common stock reported on the Nasdaq National Market during the pricing period.

If
the average closing price of CEC common stock during the pricing period is less than $37.00, Whitman has the option to terminate the merger agreement unless CEC agrees to issue CEC
common stock valued at $7.55 for each share of Whitman common stock.

(2)
If
the average closing price of CEC common stock during the pricing period is greater than $65.00, CEC has the option to terminate the merger agreement unless Whitman agrees to have
CEC issue common stock valued at $8.95 for each share of Whitman common stock. 

        The
following table provides some examples of how the formula above works to determine the exchange ratio and the corresponding values of the CEC common stock and the total merger
consideration that you would receive for a share of Whitman common stock at various average closing prices of CEC common stock during the pricing period.

        We expect the market price of CEC common stock to fluctuate prior to the merger. Therefore, because the value and number of shares of CEC common stock you receive
in the merger is determined based upon the average closing price of CEC common stock during the pricing period, you should obtain current stock price quotations for CEC common stock prior to voting on
the merger. You should also note that because the exchange ratio is fixed two trading days before the closing of the merger and we expect the market price of CEC common stock to fluctuate, the value
of the CEC common stock that you will receive in the merger may increase or decrease during the two-day trading period between the end of the pricing period and the closing of the merger. 

        CEC
will not issue fractional shares of CEC common stock in the merger. Instead, each holder of Whitman common stock that would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of CEC common
stock in the merger will be paid an amount in cash equal to such fractional share of CEC common stock multiplied by the average closing price of CEC common stock during the pricing period. 

        Based
upon 14,938,505 shares of Whitman common stock outstanding as of April 21, 2003 and an assumed exchange ratio of 0.162, which is based on the average closing market price of
CEC common stock during the 20 consecutive trading days ended April 21, 2003 of $50.96, CEC will issue an aggregate of approximately 2,420,037 shares of CEC common stock in the merger to the
holders of these shares of Whitman common stock. Based upon the 46,269,587 shares of CEC common stock outstanding as of April 21, 2003 the holders of these shares of Whitman common stock
collectively will hold approximately 5.0% of the shares of CEC common stock outstanding immediately after the merger. 

        CEC
expects to borrow under its $200 million credit facility the funds necessary to pay the cash consideration payable to Whitman's shareholders and option holders in the merger. 

Treatment of Outstanding Whitman Stock Options  

        Each outstanding option to purchase Whitman common stock, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled upon consummation of the closing and exchanged for cash
equal to the positive difference, if any, between (1) the value, in cash, of the per share merger consideration (with the portion payable in CEC common stock being valued as of the second
trading day prior to the closing of the merger) and (2) the per share exercise price of the option. Based upon CEC's average closing stock price of $50.96 for the 20-day period
ended April 21, 2003 and the options to purchase 3,229,989 shares of Whitman common stock outstanding as of April 21, 2003 that have an exercise price below $14.25, CEC will pay an
aggregate of approximately $31,912,291 to Whitman option holders after completion of the merger. 

Termination of Whitman Employee Stock Purchase Plan  

        The most recent offering period under Whitman's employee stock purchase plan ended March 31, 2003 and Whitman will not commence any additional offering
periods unless the merger agreement is terminated. Any options to purchase Whitman common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2003 under Whitman's employee stock purchase plan were exercised in
accordance with the plan. Whitman's employee stock purchase plan will terminate as of the consummation of the merger unless terminated earlier by Whitman's board of directors. 

Payoff of Whitman Term Loan and Credit Facility  

        Whitman has a capital expenditure term loan that is payable in monthly installments of principal and interest with a balloon payment due in April 2006 and
a $3.5 million line of credit that expires on October 31, 2003. The interest rate of the capital expenditure term note and the line of credit is variable and is equal to the sum of 2.40%
and the 1-month LIBOR rate. At April 28, 2003, the interest rate on these loans was 3.717%. At April 28, 2003, Whitman had $4.6 million outstanding under the terms of its capital
expenditure term loan, no outstanding balance under its credit facility and letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility of $618,411, which reduced the amount available for borrowing under
the credit facility. These loans are secured by substantially all of Whitman's assets. Whitman will repay these loans in full prior to closing the merger. 

Interests of Whitman Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger  

        In considering the recommendation of the Whitman board of directors, and support of Whitman executive officers, with respect to the merger agreement, shareholders
of Whitman should be aware that certain directors and executive officers of Whitman have interests in the merger that are different 

from, or in addition to, their interests as shareholders of Whitman generally. The Whitman board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the
merger. 

        Stock Options.
    When we complete the merger, all outstanding Whitman stock options, including those held by executive officers
and directors, whether or not vested, will be cancelled and exchanged for cash in an amount per share equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the equivalent cash value of the per share
merger consideration (with the portion payable in CEC common stock being valued as of the second trading day prior to the closing of the merger) and (2) the exercise price of the option. Based
upon CEC's average closing stock price of $50.96 for the 20-day period ended April 21, 2003 and the outstanding options to purchase 1,745,000 shares of Whitman common stock
held by Whitman executive officers and directors as of April 21, 2003 that have an exercise price below $14.25, CEC will pay an
aggregate of approximately $17,223,150 to Whitman executive officers and directors after completion of the merger. 

        Severance Benefits.
    Richard C. Pfenniger, Jr., Whitman's chief executive officer and vice chairman of the
board, entered into a severance, non-competition, non-solicitation and confidentiality agreement with Whitman and CEC that entitles him to (1) payments of $50,000 per
month for a period of nine months following the merger, or $450,000 in the aggregate, and (2) partial payment of his COBRA health coverage premiums for up to 12 months.
Mr. Pfenniger will not be employed by CEC or its affiliates after the merger. Fernando Fernandez, Whitman's chief financial officer, entered into a letter agreement with CEC entitling him to
(1) severance compensation payable in a lump sum of $150,000, and (2) partial payment of his COBRA health coverage premiums for up to 12 months in the event that he is not
employed by CEC, or its affiliates, following the merger. 

        Indemnification and Insurance.
    If we complete the merger, CEC will indemnify, as and to the extent presently provided in
Whitman's charter, bylaws and indemnification agreements, each person who was on or prior to March 26, 2003, or who becomes prior to the completion of the merger, a director or officer of
Whitman for liabilities incurred due to acting in such capacity. For at least six years following consummation of the merger, CEC will also maintain Whitman's directors' and officers' liability
insurance. 

Accounting Treatment  

        CEC will account for the merger as a "purchase" in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Consequently, CEC will allocate the aggregate
consideration paid by it in connection with the merger to the surviving corporation's tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities based upon their fair values, with any excess being
treated as goodwill. CEC will include the revenues and expenses of Whitman in CEC's consolidated financial statements from the date of consummation of the merger. 

Material Federal Income Tax Consequences  

        The following summary discusses the material United States federal income tax consequences of the merger to Whitman shareholders. This discussion is based upon
the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and judicial decisions currently in effect, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive
effect. The discussion assumes that the Whitman shareholders currently hold their Whitman stock and will continue to hold that stock as a capital asset within the meaning of section 1221 of the
Internal Revenue Code. Further, the discussion does not address all aspects of United States federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular shareholder in light of his, her or its
personal circumstances or to shareholders subject to special treatment under the United States federal income tax laws, including: 


insurance
companies; 


financial
institutions or trusts;


dealers
in securities or foreign currency;


traders
that mark to market;


tax-exempt
organizations;


shareholders
who hold their shares as part of a hedge, appreciated financial position, straddle or conversion transaction;


shareholders
who acquired the Whitman common stock through the exercise of options or otherwise as compensation or through a tax-qualified
retirement plan; and


foreign
corporations, foreign partnerships or other foreign entities and individuals who are not citizens or residents of the United States. 

        Furthermore,
this discussion does not consider the potential effects of any state, local or foreign tax laws. 

        Neither
CEC nor Whitman has requested a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to any of the United States federal income tax consequences of the merger and, as a result,
there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service will not disagree with or challenge any of the conclusions described below. 

        Holders
of Whitman common stock are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific tax consequences to them of the merger, including the applicability and effect of
federal, state, local and foreign income or other tax laws in their particular circumstances. 

        Stearns
Weaver Miller Weissler Alhadeff & Sitterson, P.A. will provide an opinion for the benefit of the shareholders of Whitman regarding the income tax consequences of the
merger to Whitman shareholders. The opinion will rely on assumptions, including assumptions regarding the absence of changes in existing facts and the completion of the merger in accordance with the
proxy statement/prospectus and the merger agreement. The opinion will also rely on representations and covenants, including those contained in officers' certificates of Whitman. Any change in
currently applicable law, which may or may not be retroactive, or failure of any of the factual representations or assumptions to be true, correct and complete in all material respects, could affect
the conclusions to be reached in the Stearns Weaver Miller Weissler Alhadeff & Sitterson, P.A. tax opinion. 

        The
conclusions to be reached in the Stearns Weaver Miller Weissler Alhadeff & Sitterson, P.A. tax opinion regarding the tax treatment to Whitman shareholders are: 


the
merger will constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and Whitman and CEC will each be a
party to such reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Internal Revenue Code;


a
Whitman shareholder will not recognize gain or loss on the exchange except for gain, if any, with respect to the cash portion of the merger consideration
and any cash received in the merger or in lieu of a fractional share of CEC common stock.


a
Whitman shareholder who receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of CEC common stock will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the
cash received and the tax basis allocated to the fractional share interest;


any
gain recognized by a Whitman shareholder as a result of the merger will generally be capital gain if the shareholder's Whitman common stock is held as a
capital asset at the effective time of the merger and will be long-term capital gain if the shareholder's Whitman common stock has been held for more than one year at the effective time of
the merger; 


the
tax basis of the shares of CEC common stock (including any fractional share interests deemed received and exchanged for cash) received in exchange for
shares of Whitman common stock in the
merger will be the same as the tax basis of the shares of Whitman common stock exchanged therefor, increased by any gain recognized on the exchange (including any gain treated as a dividend but other
than gain attributable to fractional shares), and reduced by the amount of any cash received in the exchange (other than with respect to fractional shares); and


the
holding period for shares of CEC common stock received in exchange for shares of Whitman common stock pursuant to the merger will include the holding
period of the shares of Whitman common stock exchanged therefor. 

        Unless
you comply with certain reporting and/or certification procedures or are an exempt recipient under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations,
cash payments in exchange for your Whitman common stock in the merger may be subject to "backup withholding" at a rate of 30% for federal income tax purposes. Any amounts withheld under the backup
withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder's federal income tax liability, provided the required information is furnished to the Internal Revenue Service. 

The preceding summary of the federal tax consequences of the merger does not purport to be a complete analysis or discussion of all potential tax effects relevant
to the merger. This discussion is included for general information purposes only and may not apply to a particular shareholder in light of the shareholder's particular circumstances. You are urged to
consult your own tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences to you of the merger, including tax return reporting requirements, the applicability and effect of federal, state, local, foreign and
other applicable tax laws and the effect of any proposed changes in the tax laws.

Regulatory Matters  

        Antitrust.
    Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, CEC and Whitman are
prohibited from completing the merger until: 


notifications
are given to the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice;


information
is furnished to the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division; and


specified
waiting period requirements are satisfied or terminated by the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division. 

        On                            ,
2003, in connection with the merger, CEC and Whitman each filed a Pre-Merger Notification and Report Form under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Justice Department. The waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act relating
to the merger is expected to expire on                            , 2003. 

        Even
after the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act expires, at any time before or after the merger, the Antitrust Division or the Federal Trade Commission could,
among other things, seek to enjoin the completion of the merger or seek the divestiture of substantial assets of CEC or Whitman. Although CEC and Whitman believe that the merger is legal under U.S.
antitrust laws, there can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if a challenge is made, that it would not be successful. 

        Education Regulation.
    Completion of the merger is subject to approval and notice requirements imposed by education regulatory
and accrediting agencies. Whitman is in the process of providing notice to, or obtaining approval of the merger from, the Georgia Nonpublic Postsecondary Education Commission, the Colorado Commission
on Higher Education, the Florida Commission for Independent Education, the Illinois State Board of Education, the Maryland Higher Education Commission, the 

Massachusetts Department of Education, the New Jersey Department of Education, the New York State Education Department, the Ohio State Board of Career Colleges and Schools, the Texas Workforce
Commission, the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, the Accrediting Bureau of Health Education Schools, the Missouri Coordinating Board for Higher Education, the Pennsylvania State
Board of Private Licensed Schools, the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools and the Missouri State Board of Nursing. The parties also plan to obtain confirmation from the U.S.
Department of Education that it sees no substantial impediment to issuing a temporary program participation agreement with respect to each of Whitman's educational institutions after completion of the
merger. In addition, Whitman is in the process of providing notice to and obtaining approval of the merger, if necessary, from certain additional accrediting and state agencies that accredit or
approve individual educational programs of certain schools or that regulate participation in certain non-federal financial aid programs, as well as relevant guaranty agencies. Under the
merger agreement, Whitman and CEC must obtain prior to closing all approvals and consents from governmental entities that are necessary to complete the merger. Under Department of Education
regulations, Department of Education approval, which effectively permits Whitman to continue to access federal student financial aid funding, can only be obtained after the merger has been
consummated. In addition, certain other approvals and consents of applicable state and accrediting agencies with respect to the merger can only be obtained after the consummation of the merger. There
can be no assurance that any necessary approvals and consents will be obtained. 

        Federal Securities Laws.
    The shares of CEC common stock issued in connection with the merger will be registered under the
Securities Act and will be freely transferable under the Securities Act, except for shares of CEC common stock issued to any person who is deemed to be an "affiliate" of Whitman on
the date of the special meeting. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under the common control of Whitman and may include
executive officers, directors and significant shareholders of Whitman. Affiliates of Whitman may not sell their shares of CEC common stock acquired in connection with the merger except pursuant to: 


an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of those shares;


Rule 145
(or, for Whitman shareholders who become affiliates of CEC, Rule 144) under the Securities Act; or


any
other applicable exemption under the Securities Act. 

        As
provided by the merger agreement, Whitman has obtained from each of its affiliates (for purposes of Rule 145 of the Securities Act) a written agreement providing that the
affiliate will not sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of any CEC common stock issued to the affiliate pursuant to the merger, except in compliance with Rule 145 or an exemption from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act. 

        CEC's
registration statement on Form S-4, of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, does not cover the resale of shares of CEC common stock to be received
by Whitman affiliates in the merger. 

        Nasdaq National Market.
    CEC has prepared and filed with the Nasdaq National Market a Notification for the Listing of
Additional Shares for the shares of CEC common stock to be issued in connection with the merger. When we complete the merger, Whitman common stock will be delisted from the American Stock Exchange and
deregistered under the Exchange Act. 

Appraisal Rights  

        Whitman shareholders are not entitled to dissenter's or appraisal rights under the Florida Business Corporation Act in connection with the merger. 

THE MERGER AGREEMENT    

        The following summary of the merger agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete copy of the merger agreement attached as Annex A to this
proxy statement/prospectus and incorporated in this proxy statement/prospectus by reference. We urge you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety. 

Whitman Stock Certificate Exchange Procedures  

        Promptly after we complete the merger, the exchange/paying agent will mail to each registered holder of Whitman common stock (1) a letter of transmittal
and (2) instructions for surrendering the holder's Whitman stock certificate(s) in exchange for certificates representing shares of CEC common stock and cash. Upon surrendering a Whitman stock
certificate, together with a signed letter of transmittal and any other required documents, to the exchange/paying agent, each Whitman shareholder will be entitled to receive certificates representing
the whole number of shares of CEC common stock that the shareholder has the right to receive and a check for the cash payable to the shareholder. No interest will be paid on any cash to be paid
pursuant to the merger. You should not surrender your stock certificates for exchange until you receive a letter of transmittal from the exchange/paying agent. 

        If
any Whitman stock certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, CEC will require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Whitman stock certificate to provide an appropriate
affidavit and may require the owner to deliver a bond as indemnity against any claim that may be made against us with respect to the Whitman stock certificate. 

Directors and Officers of Whitman after the Merger  

        Under the merger agreement, the directors of Marlin Acquisition Corp. immediately prior to the merger, all of whom are officers of CEC, will be the initial
directors of the surviving corporation at and after the merger, and the officers of Marlin Acquisition Corp. immediately prior to the merger, all of whom are officers of CEC, will be the initial
officers of the surviving corporation at and after the merger.

take,

cause any of the conditions to the merger, not to be satisfied. 

        In
addition, CEC has agreed that it will carry on its business in the ordinary course and not take any action that would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to the
merger not being satisfied. 

        No Solicitation.
    The merger agreement provides that Whitman will not, and will not permit its directors, officers, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other representatives, agents or affiliates to: 


solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage any proposal that constitutes an acquisition proposal (as defined below) or any proposal that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an acquisition proposal; 


engage
in negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide any non-public information to any person in connection with, any acquisition
proposal; or


agree
to, approve, recommend or otherwise endorse or support any acquisition proposal. 

However,
if a third party submits an unsolicited, written acquisition proposal, and Whitman's board of directors reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and
any nationally recognized investment bank, that the acquisition proposal will, or upon further discussion or due diligence could reasonably be expected to, result in a superior proposal (as defined
below), then Whitman may (1) furnish information about its business to the third party and (2) negotiate and participate in discussions and negotiations with the third party. If
Whitman's board of directors determines that the acquisition proposal is a superior proposal (as defined below), Whitman's board of directors may withdraw or adversely modify its recommendation of the
merger, but must still allow Whitman shareholders to vote on the merger at the special meeting. Whitman will advise CEC if it receives a superior proposal, identifying the third party and specifying
the material terms and conditions of the superior proposal. 

        The
merger agreement requires Whitman to promptly advise CEC if (1) an acquisition proposal is made or modified, (2) a request for information is made that could lead to an
acquisition proposal or (3) Whitman furnishes non-public information to, or enters into discussions regarding an acquisition proposal with, any third party. Whitman must also keep
CEC informed about any such proposal or request. 

        An
"acquisition proposal" is any proposal relating to a possible: 


merger,
consolidation or similar transaction involving Whitman;


sale,
lease or other disposition, directly or indirectly, by merger, consolidation, share exchange or otherwise, of any assets of Whitman representing, in
the aggregate, 10% or more of the assets of Whitman on a consolidated basis;


issuance,
sale or other disposition of securities, or options, rights or warrants to purchase or securities convertible into, such securities, representing
10% or more of the votes attached to the outstanding securities of Whitman;


transaction
with Whitman in which any person will acquire beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, or any "group" as such term is
defined under the Exchange Act shall have been formed which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership, of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of Whitman's common stock;


liquidation,
dissolution, recapitalization or other similar type of transaction with respect to Whitman; or


transaction
which is similar in form, substance or purpose to any of the foregoing transactions. 

        A
"superior proposal" is an unsolicited, bona fide, written acquisition proposal: 


for
consideration consisting of cash, not subject to a financing contingency, and/or securities;


on
terms that Whitman's board of directors determines, based on the written advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, are more
favorable to Whitman's shareholders from a
financial point of view than the merger, or other revised merger proposal submitted by CEC, after consultation with its outside legal counsel; and


that
the third party is reasonably likely to consummate on substantially the terms proposed. 

Conditions to the Merger

    CEC's and Whitman's obligations to effect the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various

receipt
of all consents and approvals from, and making of all filings with, any governmental entity or accrediting body required in connection with the

(1) prevent consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (2) cause any of the transactions contemplated by the parties to be rescinded following consummation of the merger or (3) affect
adversely the right of CEC to own, operate or control any material portion of the assets and operations of the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries following the merger;


cause
the accuracy of the other party's representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and receipt by each party of a certificate to that
effect from a designated executive officer of the other party;


performance
by the other party of its covenants and obligations required by the merger agreement; and


the
absence of any event or development which results in a material adverse effect upon the business of the other party. 

        Whitman.
    The obligations of Whitman to consummate the merger are further subject to the fulfillment of the following
conditions, any of which may be waived in whole or part by Whitman: 


the
shares of CEC common stock issuable to the shareholders of Whitman pursuant to the merger agreement and such other shares required to be reserved for
issuance in connection with the merger must be authorized for listing on the Nasdaq National Market upon official notice of issuance; and


Whitman
must receive an opinion from its counsel to the effect that the merger will constitute a reorganization for federal income tax purposes within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and no gain or loss will be recognized by Whitman or its shareholders as a result of the merger, other than gain, if any, with respect to the receipt of
the cash portion of the purchase price and cash received in lieu of fractional shares. 

        CEC.
    The obligations of CEC to consummate the merger are further subject to the fulfillment of the following conditions, any
of which may be waived in whole or part by CEC: 


CEC's
receipt of all written consents, assignments, waivers, authorizations or other certificates necessary to provide for the continuation in full force and
effect of certain material contracts and existing permits of Whitman, with certain stated exceptions;


CEC
must obtain a written statement from the U.S. Department of Education stating, without unduly burdensome limitations, that it does not see any impediment
to issuing a temporary program participation agreement with respect to each of Whitman's educational institutions after completion of the merger; and


CEC
must receive an opinion from its counsel to the effect that the merger will constitute a reorganization for federal income tax purposes within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and no gain or loss will be recognized by CEC or its stockholders as a result of the merger. 

Termination, Termination Fee, Amendment and Waiver  

        Termination.
    The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the completion of the merger, whether before or
after Whitman shareholder approval: 


by
mutual written consent of CEC and Whitman;


by
either CEC or Whitman:


if
the shareholders of Whitman do not approve the merger;


if
a governmental entity enjoins or otherwise prohibits the merger;


if
the consummation of the merger would be illegal;


if
the merger has not been consummated by September 26, 2003 due to no fault of the terminating party; or


if
the other party breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in
the merger agreement, which breach or failure
to perform cannot be or has not been cured within 20 days after written notice to the breaching party and would result in failure to satisfy a closing condition. 


by
Whitman if the average closing market price of CEC common stock during the pricing period is less than $37.00 unless CEC agrees to issue CEC common stock
valued at $7.55 for each share of Whitman common stock. It is not possible to know whether the average closing price of CEC common stock used in the calculation of the exchange ratio will be below
$37.00 until after the closing has been scheduled. Approval of the merger agreement by Whitman's shareholders will confer on the Whitman board of directors the power, consistent with its fiduciary
duties and without any further action by the Whitman shareholders, to elect to terminate the merger agreement (subject to CEC's right to increase the exchange ratio as described above) or to
consummate the merger even if the average closing price of CEC common stock during the pricing period is less than $37.00. In considering whether to exercise its termination right in that situation,
the Whitman board of directors would, consistent with its fiduciary duties, take into account all relevant facts and circumstances that exist at such time and consult with its financial advisors and
legal counsel. If the Whitman board of directors elects not to terminate the merger agreement under these circumstances, Whitman shareholders could receive shares of CEC common stock valued at less
than $7.55 per share of Whitman common stock in the merger. If Whitman elects to terminate the merger agreement under the provisions discussed above, it is 

possible
that CEC will elect not to increase the exchange ratio, in which case the merger agreement would terminate, the parties would not consummate the merger, Whitman shareholders would not
receive the merger consideration and Whitman would continue as an independent entity; 


by
CEC, if:


the
board of directors of Whitman withdraws or modifies, in a manner adverse to CEC, its recommendation of the merger;


a
third party commences, or files a registration statement with respect to, a tender offer or exchange offer for 10% or more of Whitman's outstanding common
stock and Whitman's board of directors either recommends that shareholders tender their shares or publicly announces its intention to take no position with respect to the offer;


Whitman
materially breaches the no-solicitation or shareholder recommendation provisions of the merger agreement;


an
alternative acquisition proposal is announced or otherwise becomes publicly known, and Whitman's board of directors fails to recommend against Whitman
shareholders' acceptance of the alternative proposal (including by taking no position or indicating its inability to take a position on the proposal)
or, after CEC requests that Whitman do so, its board of directors fails to publicly reconfirm its approval and recommendation of the merger with CEC, in each case, within 10 days; or


the
average closing market price of CEC common stock during the pricing period is greater than $65.00 unless Whitman agrees to have CEC issue common stock
valued at $8.95 for each share of Whitman common stock. 

        Termination Fee.
    Whitman must pay CEC a fee of $10.0 million, plus up to $1.5 million of CEC's cost and
expenses in connection with the merger, if: 


an
acquisition proposal becomes known before the merger agreement is terminated and Whitman enters into an agreement with respect to the acquisition proposal
within 12 months after the merger agreement is terminated by:


Whitman
or CEC for failure to obtain Whitman shareholder approval;


Whitman
for failure to consummate the merger by September 26, 2003; or


CEC
due to the failure of any of Whitman's representations and warranties to be true and correct in all material respects as of March 26, 2003 or due
to Whitman's willful breach of any of its representations and warranties, agreements or covenants after March 26, 2003; 


CEC
terminates the merger agreement:


as
a result of the board of directors of Whitman withdrawing or modifying, in a manner adverse to CEC, its recommendation of the merger;;


as
a result of a third party commencing, or filing a registration statement with respect to, a tender offer or exchange offer for 10% or more of Whitman's
outstanding common stock and Whitman's board of directors either recommending that shareholders tender their shares or publicly announcing its intention to take no position with respect to the offer;


as
a result of Whitman materially breaching the no-solicitation or shareholder recommendation provisions of the merger agreement; or


as
a result of the fact that an alternative acquisition proposal is announced or becomes publicly known and Whitman's board of directors fails to recommend
against Whitman 

shareholders'
acceptance of the alternative proposal (including by taking no position or indicating its inability to take a position on the proposal) or, after CEC's request that Whitman do so, its
board of directors fails to publicly reconfirm its approval and recommendation of the merger with CEC, in each case, within 10 days. 

        The
termination fee could discourage another company from making a competing takeover proposal that could be more advantageous to Whitman's shareholders than the merger because this fee
may make the competing proposal more difficult or expensive and could deter Whitman from entering into an alternative transaction. 

        Amendment.
    The merger agreement may be amended by CEC and Whitman at any time before or after the shareholders' approval of
the merger agreement. The merger agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of both CEC and Whitman. 

        Extension; Waiver.
    At any time prior to the merger, CEC or Whitman may: 


extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party;


waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party contained in the merger agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to
the merger agreement; or


waive
compliance by the other party of the agreements or conditions contained in the merger agreement. 

Any
agreement on the part of CEC or Whitman to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if it is set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of that party. 

THE VOTING AGREEMENT    

        The following summarizes the material terms of the voting agreement. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the voting agreement, which is
incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part. 

        In
connection with the execution of the merger agreement on March 26, 2003, Phillip Frost, M.D., a trust for which Mr. Frost is the sole trustee, Richard C. Pfenniger, Jr.
and Fernando L. Fernandez, the beneficial owners of an aggregate of approximately    % of Whitman's common stock outstanding as of the record date, entered into the voting agreement with
CEC. Pursuant to, and subject to the terms of, the voting agreement, these Whitman shareholders have agreed to appear at the special meeting and vote the shares of Whitman common stock for which they
have voting power in favor of the merger and against any other "acquisition proposal" and have granted to CEC, subject to and conditioned upon CEC's receipt of all required regulatory approvals, if
any, the shareholders' irrevocable proxy for such actions and agreed not to take any other action that could adversely affect the voting agreement or the merger agreement. The shareholders further
agreed not to assign their shares other than to certain permitted transferees, grant any proxies or enter into any voting trusts with respect to their shares, or take any action which would be a
breach of any representation or warranty in the voting agreement.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL
  STATEMENTS OF CEC AND WHITMAN    

        The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2002 gives effect to the proposed merger of CEC and Whitman as if the
merger had occurred on December 31, 2002. The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2002 gives effect to the merger as if
it had occurred on January 1, 2002. The unaudited condensed combined financial statements were prepared from CEC's audited historical consolidated financial statements as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2002 and from Whitman's audited historical consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2002 and Whitman's unaudited historical condensed
consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarters ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. 

        The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the data and, in the opinion of management, have been
prepared on the same basis as that of the underlying audited financial statements. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are a presentation of historical results with
accounting adjustments necessary to reflect the estimated pro forma effect of the merger on the combined financial position and results of operations of CEC and Whitman. The unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements do not reflect the effects of any anticipated changes to be made by CEC to the historical operations, are presented for information purposes only, and should
not be construed to be indicative of combined results of operations or financial position that actually would have occurred had the merger of CEC and Whitman been consummated as of the date indicated
or the combined entity's future results of operations or financial position. 

        The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been prepared using the purchase method of accounting for the proposed merger. The acquired assets and assumed liabilities of
Whitman are stated in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2002 at amounts representing an allocation of the estimated purchase price based upon a
preliminary estimate of the fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities at the assumed December 31, 2002 acquisition date. 

        The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are based upon the financial condition and operating results of Whitman during periods when it was not under the control,
influence or management of CEC. The information presented may not be indicative of the results that would have actually occurred had the acquisition been completed as of January 1, 2002, nor is
it necessarily indicative of the future financial condition or operating results of the combined entity. CEC expects to incur reorganization and integration expenses and experience operating
efficiencies as a result of its acquisition of Whitman. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not give effect to these expenses or any synergies that may occur due to the
integration of Whitman with CEC and should be read along with the historical financial statements of CEC and Whitman and the related notes incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus. 

        Certain
assets and liabilities in Whitman's historical unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2002 have been reclassified in the accompanying unaudited pro
forma condensed combined balance sheet to conform to CEC's balance sheet presentation. Certain expenses in Whitman's historical unaudited consolidated statement of income for the year ended
December 31, 2002 have been reclassified in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income to conform to CEC's statement of income presentation.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED
  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    

1.    Basis of Presentation  

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2002 gives effect to the proposed merger of CEC and Whitman as if the merger
had occurred on December 31, 2002. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2002 gives effect to the merger as if it had occurred on
January 1, 2002. The unaudited condensed combined financial statements were prepared from CEC's audited historical consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2002 and from Whitman's audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2002 and Whitman's unaudited historical condensed financial
statements as of and for the quarters ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. 

        The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the data and, in the opinion of management, have been
prepared on the same basis as that of the underlying audited financial statements. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are a presentation of historical results with
accounting adjustments necessary to reflect the estimated effect of the merger on the combined financial position and results of operations of CEC and Whitman. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial statements do not reflect the effects of any anticipated changes to be made by CEC to the historical operations, are presented for information purposes only, and should not be
construed to be indicative of combined results of operations or financial position that actually would have occurred had the merger of CEC and Whitman been consummated as of the date indicated or the
combined entity's future results of operations or financial position. 

        The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been prepared using the purchase method of accounting for the proposed merger. Accordingly, the estimated purchase price,
including acquisition costs, of approximately $248.8 million has been allocated to the estimated fair values of acquired tangible and intangible assets of $86.9 million and assumed
liabilities of $50.3 million as of December 31, 2002. Our preliminary purchase price allocation has resulted in goodwill totaling $212.2 million. 

        The
estimated purchase price of $248.8 million includes the estimated fair value of CEC common stock to be issued to Whitman shareholders of $123.3 million, cash to be paid
to Whitman shareholders of $89.6 million, estimated cash to be paid to Whitman option holders of $31.9 million, and estimated acquisition costs of $4.0 million. Consideration to
be paid to Whitman option holders, representing the difference between exercise price and per share merger consideration, will be recorded by Whitman as compensation expense in Whitman's statement of
operations prior to closing as a result of modifications to be made to Whitman's option plans in advance of the merger. 

        Certain
assets and liabilities in Whitman's historical unaudited consolidated balance sheet have been reclassified in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance
sheet to conform to CEC's balance sheet presentation. Certain expenses in Whitman's historical unaudited consolidated statement of income have been reclassified in the accompanying unaudited pro forma
condensed combined statement of income to conform to CEC's statement of income presentation. 

2.    Merger Consideration  

        Under the terms of the proposed merger agreement, CEC will acquire 100% of Whitman stock for a combination of cash and CEC common stock. Whitman shareholders will
receive $6.00 in cash and a to-be-determined number of shares of CEC common stock. The value of the CEC common stock consideration component will be approximately $8.25, but is
subject to adjustment. The value of CEC common stock to be issued in exchange for each share of Whitman common stock will be determined based on the average closing price of CEC common stock on the
Nasdaq National Market for the 20-day trading period ending on, and including, the second trading day prior to the day of the closing of the merger. 

        The
exact number of shares of CEC common stock per share of Whitman common stock that each Whitman stockholder will receive will be determined by the merger exchange ratio. The exchange
ratio is (1) the value of the CEC common stock to be issued in the merger per share of Whitman common stock divided by (2) the average closing price of CEC common stock during the
pricing period, unless the exchange ratio is fixed as shown in the table below. The following table shows how the value or number of shares of CEC common stock that Whitman shareholders will receive
for each share of Whitman common stock will be adjusted, based upon the average closing price of CEC common stock reported on the Nasdaq National Market during the pricing period. 

Average Closing Price of CEC Common Stock

During the Pricing Period

Value/Number of Shares of CEC Common Stock per

Share of Whitman Common Stock

Less than $37.00

Number of shares based on a fixed exchange ratio of 0.204

At least $37.00, but less than $44.00

Valued at $8.25 
less
 $0.10 per dollar that the average closing price during the pricing period is below $44.00, subject to proportionate adjustment for fractions of a
dollar

At least $44.00, but less than $58.00

Valued at $8.25

At least $58.00, but no more than $65.00

Valued at $8.25 
plus
 $0.10 per dollar that the average closing price during the pricing period is above $58.00, subject to adjustment for fractions of a dollar

Greater than $65.00

Number of shares based on a fixed exchange ratio of 0.138

        If the average closing price of CEC common stock during the pricing period is less than $37.00, Whitman has the option to terminate the merger
agreement unless CEC agrees to issue CEC common stock valued at $7.55 for each share of Whitman common stock. If the average closing price of CEC common stock during the pricing period is greater than
$65.00, CEC has the option to terminate the merger agreement unless Whitman agrees to have CEC issue common stock valued at $8.95 for each share of Whitman common stock. 

        The
market price of CEC common stock is expected to fluctuate prior to the merger and the exchange ratio is fixed two trading days before the closing of the merger. Therefore, the
average closing price of CEC common stock during the pricing period may be higher or lower than the closing price of CEC common stock on the date of the merger agreement, the date of the Whitman
special meeting or the date that the merger is completed. Instead of issuing fractional shares, CEC will pay cash for fractional shares based on the average closing price of CEC common stock during
the pricing period. 

        Based
upon 14.9 million shares of Whitman common stock outstanding as of April 21, 2003, and an assumed exchange ratio of 0.162, which is based on the average closing
market price of CEC common stock during the 20 consecutive trading days ended April 21, 2003 of approximately $51.00, CEC will issue an aggregate of approximately 2.4 million shares of
CEC common stock in the merger to the holders of these shares of Whitman common stock. Based upon the 46.3 million shares of CEC common stock outstanding as of April 21, 2003, the
holders of these shares of Whitman common stock collectively will hold approximately 5.0% of the shares of CEC common stock outstanding immediately after the merger. 

        Additionally,
each outstanding option to purchase Whitman common stock, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled upon consummation of the merger and exchanged for cash equal to the
positive difference, if any, between (1) the equivalent cash value of the per share merger consideration (with the portion payable in CEC common stock being valued as of the second trading day
prior to the closing of
the merger) and (2) the per share exercise price of the option. This cash value of the per share merger consideration will adjust in the same manner as the value of the CEC common stock
component of the per share merger consideration payable to Whitman shareholders. Assuming per 

share merger consideration of $14.25, a weighted average exercise price of $4.37, and 3.2 million options to purchase Whitman common stock outstanding as of April 21, 2003, CEC will pay
approximately $31.9 million to Whitman option holders upon consummation of the merger. 

        CEC
expects to borrow under its $200 million credit facility the funds necessary to pay the cash consideration payable to Whitman's shareholders and option holders in the merger. 

3.    Pro Forma Balance Sheet Adjustments  

(a)
Represents
the deferred income tax asset recorded in connection with estimated acquisition costs of $4.0 million.

Represents
the estimated fair value of acquired Whitman courseware of $1.6 million. Adjustments to acquired courseware may be made upon the finalization of the valuation of
such asset.

estimated goodwill of $212.2 million is based upon a preliminary allocation of the purchase price as of December 31, 2002. Adjustments to goodwill may be made upon the finalization of
the purchase price allocation. 
(d)
Represents
the estimated fair value of acquired Whitman licensing, accreditation and Title IV participation rights of $10.0 million, Whitman trade names of
$12.0 million, and a covenant not to compete agreement of $90,000. The licensing, accreditation and Title IV participation rights and trade names are indefinite-lived intangible assets and will
not be subject to amortization. The covenant not to compete will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the nine-month term of the agreement. Adjustments to acquired
intangible assets may be made upon the finalization of the valuation of such assets. 
(e)
Represents
estimated acquisition costs of $4.0 million, which includes, among other things, investment banking, legal and accounting costs. This amount does not include any
costs incurred to integrate and restructure the operations of CEC and Whitman. 
(f)
Represents
estimated cash payments of (1) $89.6 million to Whitman shareholders and (2) $31.9 million to pay Whitman option holders the difference between

exchange for all outstanding shares of Whitman common stock and (2) an adjustment to eliminate stockholders' equity reflected on Whitman's historical consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2002. An assumed average stock price of $51.00 was used to value the CEC shares.

(i)
Represents
additional depreciation expense of $0.2 million associated with the depreciation of the estimated fair value of acquired courseware and additional amortization
expense of $90,000 associated with the amortization of the estimated fair value of a nine-month covenant not to compete executed by a Whitman employee. 
(j)
Represents

cash payments to Whitman shareholders and option holders. 
(k)
Represents
the pro forma adjustment necessary to reflect a combined effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2002 of 41.0%. 

COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF STOCKHOLDERS OF CEC
  AND SHAREHOLDERS OF WHITMAN    

        CEC is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware, and Whitman is incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida. If the merger is completed,
Whitman shareholders, whose rights are currently governed by the Florida Business Corporation Act ("FBCA"), the articles of incorporation of Whitman, as amended, and the bylaws of Whitman, as amended,
will become stockholders of CEC, and their rights as such will be governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"), CEC's certificate of incorporation, as amended, and CEC's bylaws, as
amended. The material differences between the rights of holders of Whitman shares and the rights of holders of CEC shares, resulting from the differences in their governing documents and applicable
state corporate law, are summarized below. 

        The
following summary does not purport to be a complete statement of the rights of holders of CEC shares under the applicable provisions of Delaware law, CEC's certificate of
incorporation, as amended, and CEC's bylaws, as amended, or the rights of the holders of Whitman shares under the applicable provisions of Florida law, Whitman's articles of incorporation, as amended,
and Whitman's bylaws, as amended, or a complete description of the specific provisions referred to herein. This summary contains a list of the material differences but is not meant to be relied upon
as an exhaustive list or a detailed description of the provisions discussed. While CEC believes that the provisions of its amended and restated certificate of incorporation and its amended and
restated bylaws are in its stockholders' best interests, shareholders of Whitman should be aware that these provisions could be disadvantageous to them because their overall effect may be to render
more difficult or to discourage the removal of incumbent directors and management or the assumption of effective control by other persons. CEC has also implemented a stockholders' rights plan,
commonly called a "poison pill," which could make an acquisition of CEC more difficult because it substantially reduces or eliminates the expected economic benefit to an acquiror from acquiring CEC in
a manner or on terms not approved by the CEC board of directors. For more information as to how to obtain the full text of each document, see "Where You Can Find More Information" beginning on
page 73.

dividend is declared and/or the preceding year. Subject to the rights of the holders, if any, of preferred stock, holders of CEC stock will be entitled to receive dividends at such times and in such amounts as may be determined by the board of
directors of CEC.

NUMBER OF DIRECTORS:

In accordance with the FBCA, Whitman's bylaws provide that the number of directors will be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of all directors. The Whitman board of directors currently consists of
nine (9) directors. Each director holds office until the annual meeting next succeeding his or her election and until his or her successor is elected and qualified.

In accordance with the DGCL, CEC's certificate of incorporation provides that the board of directors consists of not less than five (5) nor more than nine (9) directors. The exact number is determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the board of directors in office at the time of adoption of such resolution. CEC's board is divided into three classes, each of which will be nearly equal in number as possible. The CEC board of directors currently
consists of seven (7) directors, divided into three classes with staggered three-year terms. Whenever the holders of any one or more classes or series of preferred stock issued by CEC has the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect
directors at an annual meeting or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, filling of vacancies and other features of such directorships are governed by the terms of the certificate of incorporation and any resolutions of the
board of directors applicable thereto, and such directors so elected are not be divided into the three classes described above.

REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS:

Whitman's directors may be removed, with or without cause, at a meeting of shareholders, provided the notice of the meeting states that one of the purposes of the meeting is the removal of the director. A director may be removed only if the number of
votes cast to remove the director exceeds the number of votes cast against removal.

CEC's directors may only be removed for cause, except as otherwise provided by law, by the holders of at least 66

/

% of the shares entitled to vote for the election of directors.

VACANCIES:

Any vacancy occurring on Whitman's board, including any vacancy created by reason of an increase in the number of directors, may be filled by the shareholders in the manner provided by Florida law or by the affirmative vote of a majority of remaining
directors, though less than a quorum, and any director so chosen holds office until the next election of directors by the shareholders. If there are no remaining directors, the vacancy is filled by the shareholders.

If any vacancies occur on CEC's board, or if any new directorships are created, they are filled by a majority of the board of directors. Any director elected to fill a vacancy not resulting from an increase in the number of directors has the same
remaining term as that of his or her predecessor.

ANNUAL MEETING:

The annual meeting of Whitman's shareholders is held at the date and time designated by the board of directors.

The annual meeting of CEC's stockholders is held on the third Thursday in May if not a legal holiday, and, if a legal holiday, then on the next secular day following, at 10:00 a.m., or at such other date and time as will be designated from time
to time by the board of directors and stated in the notice of the meeting.

CALLING A SPECIAL MEETING OF HOLDERS:

Special meetings of Whitman's shareholders may be called upon the written request of the chairman, the chief executive officer, the board of directors (either by action at a meeting, or by a majority of directors acting without a meeting) or
shareholders holding at least 50% of Whitman's stock entitled to vote at the meeting. At least 50% of all votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at the proposed special meeting must sign, date and deliver to the secretary of
Whitman one or more written demands for the meeting describing the purpose or purposes for which it is to be held.

Special meetings of CEC's stockholders may be called only by the board of directors pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of the board of directors. The business transacted at any special meeting of the stockholders is limited to the
purposes stated in the notice for the meeting transmitted to stockholders.

ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE HOLDERS:

Whitman's shareholders may take action without a meeting by written consent if consents setting forth the action taken are signed by at least a majority of shares entitled to vote and are delivered to the secretary of Whitman, or other officer or
agent having custody of Whitman's books within sixty (60) days after the date that the earliest written consent was delivered. If the action creates dissenters' rights, a notice to the shareholders shall contain a clear statement of the right of
dissenting shareholders to be paid fair value of their shares upon compliance with, and as provided for by, the FBCA.

Any action required or permitted to be taken by CEC's stockholders will be effected only at a duly called annual or special meeting of CEC stockholders and may not be effected by consent in writing by the holders of outstanding stock pursuant to
Section 228 of DGCL or any other provision of DGCL.

AMENDMENT OF CHARTER:

Amendments to Whitman's articles of incorporation are governed by the FBCA, which generally requires approval by a majority of directors and by holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote on the amendment.

Under the DGCL, CEC's board must adopt a resolution declaring the advisability of an amendment to the certificate of incorporation and the amendment must be approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding stock entitled to vote upon the
proposed amendment, unless a higher vote is required by the certificate of incorporation (see super-majority voting requirements below).

AMENDMENT OF BYLAWS:

Whitman's bylaws provide that the bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed, and new bylaws adopted by the board of directors or shareholders.

CEC's bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed, or new bylaws may be adopted by the board of directors or by the vote of the holders of at least 80% of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors at an
annual or special meeting of stockholders.

LIMITATION OF PERSONAL LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS:

Under FBCA Section 607.0831, a director is not personally liable for monetary damages to the corporation or any other person for any statement, vote, decision, or failure to act, regarding corporate management or policy, unless the director
breached or failed to perform his duties as director and such breach or failure to perform constitutes: (1) a violation of criminal law, unless the director had reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was lawful or had no reasonable cause
to believe his or her conduct was unlawful; (2) a transaction in which he or she derived improper personal benefit; (3) an unlawful distribution; (4) in a derivative suit, conscious disregard for the best interests of the corporation,
or willful misconduct; or (5) in a proceeding other than a derivative suit, recklessness or an act or omission which was committed in bad faith or with malicious purpose or in a manner exhibiting wanton and willful disregard of human rights,
safety, or property.

In accordance with Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL, CEC's certificate of incorporation provides that no director shall be personally liable for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for (1) any breach of the
director's duty of loyalty to CEC or its stockholders; (2) acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (3) payment of a dividend or the repurchase or redemption of stock in violation of
Delaware law; or (4) any transaction from which the director derived an improper benefit.

INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS:

Under FBCA Section 607.0850, a corporation has the power to indemnify directors and officers (1) for actions taken in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interest of the corporation; and
(2) with respect to any criminal proceeding where they had no reasonable cause to believe that their conduct was unlawful.

In addition, FBCA Section 607.0850 provides that a corporation may advance to a director or officer reasonable expenses incurred in defending any action upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
director or officer to repay such amount if he or she is ultimately found not to be entitled to indemnification.

Whitman's bylaws provide for indemnification of its directors, officers to the full extent permitted by the FBCA.

Under Section 145 of the DGCL, a corporation may indemnify directors and officers (1) for actions taken in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interest of the corporation; and
(2) with respect to any criminal proceeding where they had no reasonable cause to believe that their conduct was unlawful.

In addition, Section 145 of the DGCL provides that a corporation may advance to a director or officer expenses incurred in defending any action upon receipt of an undertaking by the director or officer to
repay the amount advanced if it is ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to indemnification.

CEC's certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for indemnification of its directors and officers to the full extent permitted by the DGCL.

SUPER-MAJORITY VOTING REQUIREMENTS:

Whitman's articles of incorporation and bylaws do not provide for super-majority voting requirements.

In addition to the 80% vote required to amend CEC's bylaws and the 66

/

% required to remove a director, CEC's certificate of incorporation requires the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the voting power of all shares
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors to amend, alter or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with the certificate of incorporation's Article addressing the composition, election and terms of the board of
directors.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS:

Under Section 607.0901 of the FBCA, certain transactions, including, without limitation, a merger, consolidation, certain sales of assets, certain sales of shares, a liquidation or a dissolution, involving a corporation and 10% shareholder (an
interested shareholder) generally must be approved by two-thirds of the outstanding shares other than those shares owned by the interested shareholder. These requirements do not apply if: (1) the business combination has been approved by a
majority of the disinterested directors; (2) the corporation has not had more than 300 shareholders of record at any time during the three years preceding the announcement of the business combination; (3) the 10% shareholder has been the
beneficial owner of at least 80% of the outstanding shares for at least five years before the announcement date; (4) the interested shareholder is the owner of at least 90% of the voting shares, excluding any acquired through a transaction not
approved by a majority of the disinterested directors; or (5) the consideration paid to the holders of acquired shares is at least equal to certain fair price criteria. Although Whitman may opt out of these provisions under certain circumstances,
 it has not done so.

Under Section 203 of the DGCL, which deals with business combinations, a corporation is prohibited from engaging in any business combination with an interested stockholder who, together with affiliates or associates, owns, or who become an
affiliate or associate of the corporation and within a three year period did own, 15% or more of the corporation's voting stock for a three year period following the time the stockholder became an interested stockholder, except under limited
circumstances. Although CEC may elect not to be governed by this provision of Delaware law in its certificate of incorporation, it has not opted to do so.

SHAREHOLDER OR STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS AGREEMENT

Whitman does not have a shareholders' rights agreement.

On May 28, 2002, CEC adopted a Rights Agreement, commonly called a "poison pill," which would substantially reduce or eliminate the expected economic benefit to an acquiror from acquiring CEC in a manner or on terms not approved by the board of
directors. The Rights Agreement, which granted each CEC stockholder a Series A Preferred Stock purchase right, is designed to deter coercive takeover tactics and to prevent an acquiror from gaining control of CEC without offering fair value to
its stockholders.

resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. Any losses resulting from such investments shall be the sole responsibility of Parent and shall not in any way limit Parent's obligations to
holders of Company Stock Certificates. 

        (b)  Prior
to or upon the Effective Time, Parent will instruct the Exchange/Paying Agent to mail as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event
later than five (5) business days after the Exchange/Paying Agent receives an electronic copy of the Company's stock records as of the Effective Time, suitable for the Exchange/Paying Agent's
use, from the Company's transfer agent, to each holder of record of Company Stock Certificates who has not previously surrendered his or her Company Stock Certificates (other than holders of any
shares of Company Common Stock cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(b)): (1) a letter of transmittal reasonably acceptable to the Company (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to such holder's Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Company Stock Certificates to the Exchange/Paying Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as to which Parent and the Company may agree) and (2) instructions reasonably acceptable to the Company for use in effecting the surrender of the
Company Stock Certificates in exchange for Parent Stock Certificates and cash in accordance with Section 3.1 (collectively, the "
Letter of
Transmittal
"). 

        (c)  Upon
the later of the Effective Time and the surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for cancellation (or the affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss or
destruction of such 

A-10

certificates reasonably acceptable to Parent) to the Exchange/Paying Agent together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary documents as may be required pursuant
thereto, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Exchange/Paying Agent shall deliver in accordance with the Letter of Transmittal:
(1) Parent Stock Certificates representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly evidenced by such Company Stock Certificate in accordance with Section 3.1, (2) cash which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly evidenced by such Company Stock Certificate in accordance with Section 3.1 and (3) cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.2(e) (the shares of Parent Common Stock and cash described in clauses (1), (2) and (3) being collectively referred to as the "
Merger
Consideration
"), and the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate evidencing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock and/or cash may be issued and/or paid in accordance with this 

Article 3
 to a transferee if the Company Stock Certificate evidencing such shares is presented to the Exchange/Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence reasonably acceptable to the Exchange/Paying Agent that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Company Stock Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration together with any dividends or other distributions declared or paid on shares of Parent Common Stock after the Effective Time. 

        (d)  All
shares of Parent Common Stock issued and cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Company Stock Certificates in accordance with the terms of this 

Article 3
 shall be deemed to have been issued
and paid, respectively, in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company
Common Stock theretofore represented by such Company Stock Certificates. 

        (e)  Subject
to this Section 3.2(e), no certificates or scrip evidencing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Company Stock Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each
holder of shares of Company Common Stock, upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for exchange pursuant to this Section 3.2, shall be paid an amount in cash (without interest), rounded up
to the nearest cent, determined by multiplying (1) the Effective Time Share Value by (2) the fractional interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into
account all shares of Company Common Stock then held of record by such holder). The Exchange/Paying Agent shall promptly pay such amounts to such holders of Company Stock Certificates subject to, and
in accordance with, the terms of Section 3.2(c). Any payment received by a holder of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to fractional share interests is merely intended to provide a
mechanical rounding off of, and is not separately bargained for, consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if more than one Company Stock Certificate shall be surrendered for the account of the
same holder, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to such holder in exchange for the Company Stock Certificates which have been surrendered shall be computed on the basis of the
aggregate number of shares represented by all of the Company Stock Certificates surrendered for the account of such holder. 

        (f)    Any
portion of the Exchange/Payment Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Company Stock Certificates for twelve (12) months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered by the Exchange/Paying Agent to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Company Stock Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this 

Article 3
 shall thereafter
look only to Parent for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration. 

A-11

        (g)  None
of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the Exchange/Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock or cash from the
Exchange/Payment Fund in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Company Stock Certificate shall not have been
surrendered prior to seven (7) years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration and any cash payable to the holder of such Company
Stock Certificate pursuant to Section 3.2(e) would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

        (h)  Parent
and Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock or Existing Options of the Company such amounts as Parent or Merger Sub is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or Merger Sub, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares
of Company Common Stock or Existing Options of the Company in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or Merger Sub. 

        (i)    If
any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of a customary affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company
Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company Stock Certificate, the Exchange/Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Stock Certificate the Merger Consideration, pursuant to this 
Article 3
. 

        (j)    In
the event this Agreement is terminated without the occurrence of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Exchange/Paying Agent to, return promptly, but,
in any event, within three (3) business days after such termination, any Company Stock Certificates theretofore submitted or delivered to the Exchange/Paying Agent, without charge to the Person
who submitted such Company Stock Certificates. 

        3.3
    Stock Transfer Books.
    After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Company Stock
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange/Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this 

Article 3
, except as otherwise required
by Law. 

        3.4
    Existing Options of the Company.

        (a)  Prior
to the Closing Date, the Company shall take all actions necessary under and legally permissible in accordance with the terms of the 1996 Plan and the Pfenniger
Option (and use its commercially reasonable efforts with respect to the 1986 Plan and 1992 Plan), including without limitation, satisfying any applicable notice requirements, so that each Existing
Option to purchase Company Common Stock granted by the Company which is outstanding at the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled effective at and as of the Effective Time,
without any payment therefor except as otherwise provided for herein. In consideration for the cancellation of each Existing Option to purchase Company Common Stock, the holder of each such Existing
Option to purchase Company Common Stock will be entitled to receive from Parent, promptly after the Closing, cash equal to the product of (1) the positive difference, if any, of the Per Share
Merger Consideration, expressed in terms of cash (with the portion of the Per Share Merger 

A-12

Consideration payable in Parent Common Stock being first determined in accordance with Section 3.1(c) including the Collar, but then valued at the actual Effective Time Share Value, without
regard to the Collar) less the exercise price of each such Existing Option, multiplied by (2) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock (whether vested or unvested) covered by such
Existing Option to purchase Company Common Stock (the "
Per Option Merger Consideration
"), net of any withholding obligations; 

provided, however
, that prior
to payment of the Per Option Merger Consideration to a holder of an Existing Option to purchase Company Common Stock, such
holder must have (i) delivered such Existing Option to Purchase Company Common Stock (or a duly executed affidavit of loss in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent) and (ii) duly
authorized, executed and delivered to the Exchange/Paying Agent an acknowledgment of cancellation and termination or such other document necessary, or customarily required, in a form which shall be
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company, indicating such holder's acknowledgment that, except for such holder's rights to receive the consideration set forth in this Section 3.4(a),
any and all claims with respect to any Existing Option to purchase Company Common Stock shall be fully released and terminated (the "
Option Cancellation and Termination
Acknowledgment
"). Prior to or upon the Effective Time, Parent shall instruct the Exchange/Paying Agent to mail as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but
in no event later than five (5) business days after the Exchange/Paying Agent receives an electronic copy of the Company's option records as of the Effective Time, suitable for the
Exchange/Paying Agent's use, to each Existing Option holder who has not previously exercised his or her Existing Option to purchase Company Common Stock: (1) a letter of transmittal reasonably
acceptable to the Company (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected only upon proper delivery of (i) the Existing Option to purchase Company Common Stock (or a duly executed
affidavit of loss in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent) and (ii) the duly executed Option Cancellation and Termination Acknowledgement, to the Exchange/Paying Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as to which Parent and the Company may agree) and (2) instructions reasonably acceptable to the Company for use in effecting the surrender, cancellation and
termination of the Existing Option to purchase Company Common Stock in exchange for cash in accordance with this Section 3.4(a). 

        (b)  As
of the Effective Time, all Company Option Plans shall terminate and all rights under any provision of any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the
issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be cancelled. At and after the Effective Time, no Person shall have any right
under the Company Option Plans or any other plan, program or arrangement with respect to equity securities of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries (other than as
set forth in Section 3.4(a) above). Without prejudice to the rights of the holders of Existing Options to purchase Company Common Stock to receive the consideration set forth in
Section 3.4(a) above, the Company shall take all such actions necessary under the 1996 Plan and the Pfenniger Option (and use its commercially reasonable efforts with respect to the 1986 Plan
and 1992 Plan) to terminate each such Company Option Plan with respect to Existing Options as of the Effective Time.

        (n)  Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has distributed stock of another Person, or had its stock distributed by another Person, in a transaction that was
purported or intended to be governed in whole or in part by Sections 355 or 361 of the Code. 

        4.15
    Employee Benefits.

        (a)  Section 4.15(a)
of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a list of each Company Benefit Plan (as hereinafter defined) maintained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, the Company has delivered to Parent prior to the date hereof, a true and correct copy of (1) such Company Benefit Plan and all
amendments thereto, (2) each trust agreement, insurance contract or administration agreement relating to such Company Benefit Plan, (3) the most recent summary plan description for each
Company Benefit Plan for which a summary plan description is required, (4) the most recent annual report (Form 5500) filed with the IRS, (5) the most recent determination letter,
if any, issued by the IRS with respect to any Company Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under section 401(a) of the Code, (6) any request for a determination currently pending before
the IRS and (7) all correspondence with the Internal Revenue Service ("
IRS
"), the Department of Labor or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
relating to any outstanding controversy. Except as set forth on Section 4.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, each Company Benefit Plan complies in all material respects with ERISA, the
Code and all other applicable statutes and governmental rules and regulations. At no time has the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates (as hereinafter defined) been required to contribute to, or
otherwise had any liability (including potential liability) with respect to, a plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, a plan subject to the funding requirements of Section 412 of the Code or a
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA). Except as set forth in Section 4.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, all IRS Forms 5500 with respect to the Company

Benefit Plan. No prohibited transactions described in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code have occurred with respect to any Company Benefit Plan except those for which an
exemption under Section 408 of ERISA applies. All Company Benefit Plans that are intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code are the
subject of either a favorable determination letter issued by the IRS or operate under a prototype arrangement with respect to which the IRS issued a favorable opinion letter, and there is no reason
why, to the Company's Knowledge, any Company Benefit Plan is not so qualified in operation. Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has any liability or obligation under any welfare plan
to provide life insurance or medical benefits after termination of employment to any employee or dependent other than as required by Part 6 of Title I of ERISA, Section 4980B of the Code

vacation, severance, death benefit, insurance or other plan, arrangement or understanding, in each case established, maintained or contributed to by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its

" means any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) which is or within the last six
(6) years was under common control or would be or have been considered a single employer with such person pursuant to Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder or pursuant to Section 4001(b) of ERISA and the regulations thereunder. 

        (d)  Section 4.15(d)
of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a list of all (1) severance and employment agreements with officers and employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and each ERISA Affiliate, (2) severance plans, programs and policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries with or relating to its employees and (3) plans, programs,
agreements and other arrangements of the Company and its Subsidiaries with or relating to its employees which contain change of control or similar provisions. The Company has provided to Parent a true
and complete copy of each of the foregoing. Each such plan is designed so that the limit described in Code Section 280G of the Code will not apply to payment made under the plan. 

        (e)  The
Company has complied in all material respects with all of its obligations under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985
("
COBRA
") and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("

Company or any of its Subsidiaries on account of or for: (1) overtime pay, other than overtime pay for the current payroll period; (2) wages or salaries, other than wages or salaries for
the current payroll period; or (3) vacations, sick leave, time off or pay in lieu of vacation or time off, other than vacation, sick leave or time off (or pay in lieu thereof) earned in the

any Subsidiary of the Company or any School an intention to conduct an investigation or review with respect to the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any School, except in the case that
(a) such review has been closed or (b) such review is a routine review pursuant to recertification before the DOE, reaffirmation of accreditation or state license renewal, which review

reports, documents, information, applications and returns required to have been filed by it in order to remain in substantial compliance with the Material Existing Permits, except for such violations

    Existing Permits and Violations of Law.
    Parent, each of its Subsidiaries
and each
of its Schools has and has had since July 1, 1997, all licenses, permits, accreditations, certificates, approvals, exemptions, orders, franchises, qualifications, permissions, agreements and
governmental authorizations required by Law or by any Educational Agency and material to the business of Parent on a consolidated basis together with its Subsidiaries and its Schools. No action or
proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened that is reasonably likely to result in a revocation, non-renewal, termination, suspension or other material impairment of
any Existing Permits which are material to the business of Parent on a consolidated basis together with its Subsidiaries and its Schools, and, to Parent's Knowledge, there is no basis which could be
reasonably expected to cause non-renewal of any such material Existing Permit. The business of Parent, its Subsidiaries and its Schools is not being and has not, since July 1, 1997,
been conducted in violation of any applicable Law or Educational Agency requirement or Accrediting Body standard, except as set forth on Section 5.13 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, or except
in the case that such violation could not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. No Educational Agency or Governmental Entity currently is conducting an investigation of
Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its Schools, and no Educational Agency or 

A-34

Governmental Entity has indicated in writing to Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its Schools an intention to conduct an investigation or review with respect to Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries or any School, except in the case that (a) such review has been closed, (b) such review is described in Section 5.13 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, or
(c) such review is a routine review, pursuant to recertification before DOE, reaffirmation of accreditation or state license renewal, which review could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. 

        5.14
    Revenue Thresholds.
    For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002, each
Parent
Institution had no more than ninety percent (90%) of its revenues derived from the Title IV Programs or pursuant to the Title IV Programs as determined in accordance with 34 C.F.R. 
600.5(d). 

        5.15
    Control Matters.
    To the Knowledge of Parent, since July 1, 1997, no
person
who exercises substantial control over Parent or any Institution (as the term "substantial control" is defined at 34 C.F.R. 600.30) exercised substantial control over another
postsecondary educational institution other than Parent or any Institution (whether or not participating in the Title IV Programs) or any third party servicer (as that term is defined at 34 C.F.R.
668.2) prior to or at the time they were employed by Parent or any Institution. To the Knowledge of Parent, no person who has for any period since July 1, 1997, exercised
substantial control over Parent or any Institution (as the term "substantial control" is defined at 34 C.F.R. 600.30) or any member or members of that person's family, alone or together,
exercised, prior to or concurrent with their position of substantial control with Parent or any Institution, substantial control over an institution other than Parent or any Institution or a
third-party servicer (prior to or during the period such person exercised substantial control over Parent or any Institution) that owes a liability for a violation of any requirement of the Title IV
Programs. To the Knowledge of Parent, since July 1, 1997, no Institution nor any person who exercises substantial control over Parent or any
Institution (as the term "substantial control" is defined at 34 C.F.R. 600.30) has pled guilty to, has pled 
nolo contendere
 to, or has been
found guilty of, a crime involving the acquisition, use or expenditure of funds under the Title IV Programs or has been judicially determined to have committed fraud involving funds under the Title IV
Programs. To the Knowledge of Parent, since July 1, 1997, neither Parent nor any Institution nor any Affiliate of Parent or any Institution that has the power, by contract or ownership
interest, to direct or cause the direction of the management of policies of any Institution, has filed for relief in bankruptcy or has entered against it an order for relief in bankruptcy. Neither
Parent nor any Institution knowingly employs, and, since July 1, 1997 has knowingly employed, any individual or entity in a capacity that involves the administration or receipt of funds under
the Title IV Programs, or knowingly contracted with any institution or third-party servicer, which has been terminated under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, for a reason involving the
acquisition, use or expenditure of federal, state or local government funds, or has been convicted of, or has pled 
nolo contendere
 or guilty to, a crime
involving the acquisition, use or expenditure of federal, state or local government funds, or has been administratively or judicially determined to have committed fraud or any other material violation
of law involving federal, state or local government funds. No Institution not then a School or Affiliate of Parent (whether or not participating in the Title IV Programs) or any third-party servicer
(as that term is defined at 34 C.F.R. 668.2) is, or since July 1, 1997 has been, administered commonly, jointly or in conjunction with Parent or any School, and no other institution or
organization not then a School or Affiliate of Parent has provided educational services on behalf of Parent or any of its Schools, except instruction provided under clinical affiliations. Neither
Parent nor any School provides, or since July 1, 1997, has provided, any Title IV eligible educational instruction on behalf of any other institution or organization of any sort. 

        5.16
    Educational Agency Approval.
    To Parent's Knowledge, there exists no fact
or
circumstance attributable to Parent or Merger Sub or their Affiliates which could reasonably be expected to have a negative impact on Parent's ability to obtain any authorization, consent or similar
approval from the DOE or any other Governmental Entity or Accrediting Body whose authorization, consent or similar 

A-35

approval is contemplated in connection with this Agreement, including, without limitation, any authorization, consent or similar approval which must be obtained preceding or following the Closing
from the DOE or any Educational Agency in order to continue the operations of the Schools as presently conducted. 

        5.17
    Brokers' and Finders' Fees.
    Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has incurred any
brokers', finders' or any similar fee in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

        5.18
    Disclosure.
    No representation or warranty by Parent in this Agreement and
no
statement contained in the Parent Disclosure Letter or any certificate or document delivered by Parent to the Company pursuant to this Agreement, contains any untrue statement of a material fact or
omits any material fact necessary to make the statements herein or therein not misleading when taken together in light of the circumstances in which they were made.

    Regulatory and Other Approvals.

        (a)  The
Company and Parent will (1) take all commercially reasonable actions necessary to file as soon as practicable, notifications under the HSR Act and the other
Antitrust Laws with respect to the Merger, (2) comply at the earliest practicable date with any request for additional information received from the Federal Trade Commission or Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice pursuant to the HSR Act or from any other Governmental Entity pursuant to the other Antitrust Laws, and (3) request early termination of all applicable
waiting periods. 

        (b)  The
Company and Parent will take all commercially reasonable steps necessary, and proceed diligently and in good faith and use all commercially reasonable efforts, as
promptly as practicable to (1) solicit input from Governmental Entities and Educational Agencies regarding the process of obtaining Educational Agency and DOE approvals of the Merger, obtain
all Educational Agency and DOE approvals of the Merger, make all filings with and give all notices to Governmental Entities and Accrediting Bodies, (2) provide such other information and
communications to such Governmental Entities and Accrediting Bodies or other persons as such Governmental Entities and Accrediting Bodies may request and (3) obtain all Educational Agency and
DOE approvals of the Merger, make all filings with and give all notices to Governmental Entities and Accrediting Bodies and obtaining all
licenses required to consummate the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby. Each Party will promptly and regularly advise the other Parties concerning the occurrence and status of any
material discussions or other communications, whether oral or written, with any Educational Agency, other Governmental Entity or other third party with respect to any Educational Approval or other
regulatory approval which must be obtained either prior to or after Closing in order for Parent and Merger Sub to operate the Schools and to participate in any Student Financial Assistance Programs,
including the Title IV Programs (the "
Consents
"), including any difficulties or delays experienced in obtaining any Consent and of any conditions
proposed, considered, or requested for any Consent. Parent will cooperate with the Company, and the Company shall cooperate with Parent, in their respective efforts to obtain any Consents, but neither
party will be required (1) to make any expenditure or payment of funds or to give any other consideration in order to obtain any Consent other than fees or expenses incident to any applications
as filings with respect thereto, or (2) to permit any adverse and unduly burdensome changes in, or the imposition of any adverse and unduly burdensome condition to, any Educational Approval as
a condition to obtaining any Consent. Parent may contact any Educational Agency or Governmental Entity of the Company with respect to the proposed Merger after seven (7) business days after the
date hereof, in order to allow the 

A-41

Company to inform its regulators of the proposed Merger, 
provided, however,
 that Parent shall make such contacts for the sole purpose of facilitating
its receipt of any Consents. After that date, the Company and Parent will provide advance notice to allow the other Party and its agents and representatives to participate in any meetings or telephone
calls initiated by such Party with any Educational Agency or Governmental Entity with regard to any Consent with respect to which the parties are experiencing any significant difficulty or delay in
obtaining. Each Party will promptly advise the other of any telephone calls initiated by any Educational Agency or Governmental Entity with respect to any such Consent. The Company and Parent will
submit to the other Party for prior review each filing proposed to be submitted to any Educational Agency or Governmental Entity regarding the proposed Merger; 
provided,
however,
 if the other Party does not respond to the Party requesting review of the filing within three (3) business days, the Party requesting such review may presume
that the other Party has approved and may proceed to submit such filing. The Company and Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that their respective appropriate officers and
employees shall be available to attend, as any Governmental Entity may reasonably request, any scheduled hearings or meetings in connection with obtaining any Consent. 

        (c)  Subject
to the terms and conditions herein provided, the Company and Parent will take all commercially reasonable steps necessary or desirable, and proceed diligently
and in good faith and use all reasonable efforts to obtain all approvals required by any contract to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. 

        (d)  The
Company and Parent shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the Antitrust Laws, but neither Party will be required (1) to make any expenditure or payment of funds or to give any other consideration
in order to resolve any such objections other than fees or expenses incident to any applications as filings with respect thereto, or (2) to permit any adverse and unduly burdensome changes in,
or the imposition of any adverse and unduly burdensome condition to resolving any such objections. In connection therewith, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or
threatened in writing to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, and, if by mutual agreement, Parent and the Company decide that
litigation is in their best interests, each of
Parent and the Company shall cooperate and use all commercially reasonable efforts vigorously to contest and resist any such action or proceedings and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned
any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of any such transaction. Each of
Parent and the Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with
respect to such transactions as promptly as possible after the date of this Agreement. The obligations of Parent under this Section 6.12 with respect to the Antitrust Laws shall not require
Parent to obtain or attempt to obtain any such waiver, permit, consent, approval or authorization if obtaining such waiver, permit, consent, approval or authorization would require disposition of any
assets of Parent. 

        6.13
    No Solicitation.

        (a)  From
and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time, the Company will not, and will not permit its
directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other representatives, agents or Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, (1) solicit, initiate, or knowingly
encourage any Acquisition Proposals or any inquiries or proposals that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposals, (2) engage in negotiations or discussions concerning,
or provide any non-public information to any person or entity in connection with, any Acquisition Proposal or (3) agree to, approve, recommend or otherwise endorse or support any
Acquisition Proposal. As used herein, the term "
Acquisition  

A-42

 Proposal
" shall mean any proposal relating to a possible (1) merger, consolidation or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(2) sale, lease or other disposition, directly or indirectly, by merger, consolidation, share exchange or otherwise, of any assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries representing, in the
aggregate, ten percent (10%) or more of the assets of the Company on a consolidated basis, (3) issuance, sale or other disposition of (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange
or any similar transaction) securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase or securities convertible into, such securities) representing ten percent (10%) or more of the votes attached to the
outstanding securities of the Company, (4) transaction with the Company in which any person shall acquire beneficial ownership (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under
the Exchange Act), or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, or any "group" (as such term is defined under the Exchange Act) shall have been formed which beneficially owns or has the right to
acquire beneficial ownership of, ten percent (10%) or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, (5) liquidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other similar type of transaction
with respect to the Company, or (6) transaction which is similar in form, substance or purpose to any of the foregoing transactions; 
provided,
however,
 that the term "
Acquisition Proposal
" shall not include the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby or any
proposal or modification thereof submitted by Parent or any of its Affiliates. The Company will, and will direct all its directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and
other representatives, agents and Affiliates to, immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any of the
foregoing. 

        (b)  Notwithstanding
the provisions of Section 6.13(a) above, if a corporation, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, partnership, person or other
entity or group other than Parent or any of its Affiliates (a "
Third Party"
) after the date of this Agreement submits to the Company or its Board of
Directors, not resulting from a breach of Section 6.13(a) above, an unsolicited, bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal, and the Company's Board of Directors reasonably determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel (which may include its regularly engaged outside counsel) and any nationally recognized investment bank (which may include the Financial Advisor),
that such Acquisition Proposal will result in, or upon further discussion with or due diligence by such Third Party could reasonably be expected to constitute or result in, a Superior Proposal (as
defined below), then, in such case (1) the Company may (A) furnish information about its business, to the Third Party under protection of an appropriate confidentiality agreement on
substantially the same terms as the Confidentiality Agreements containing customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all non-public written or oral information furnished to such
Third Party, provided that the Company contemporaneously furnishes to Parent all such non-public information furnished to the Third Party and (B) negotiate and participate in
discussions and negotiations with such Third Party and (2) if the Company's Board of Directors determines that such an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, the Company's Board of
Directors may (but subject in all events to the Company's obligation to hold the Special Meeting and allow the Stockholders to vote on the Merger) withdraw or adversely modify its recommendation of
the Merger. For purposes of this Agreement, 
"Superior Proposal"
 means any unsolicited, bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal for consideration
consisting of cash (not subject to a financing contingency) and/or securities, and otherwise on terms which the Company's Board of Directors determines (based on the written advice of a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation, including, without limitation, the Financial Advisor) are more favorable to the Stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger (or other
revised proposal submitted by Parent as contemplated above), after consultation with its outside legal counsel (which may be its regularly engaged outside legal counsel) and that the Third Party is
reasonably likely to consummate the Superior Proposal on substantially the terms proposed. 

A-43

Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the Company from taking, and disclosing to its shareholders, a position required by Rule 14d-9(e) under the Exchange Act. 

        (c)  The
Company will notify Parent immediately, and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours, if (1) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal is made or
is modified in any respect (including any written material provided by the offeror the principal terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or modification thereto and the identity of the
offeror) or (2) the Company furnishes non-public information to, or enters into discussions or negotiations with respect to an Acquisition Proposal with, any Third Party. 

        (d)  In
addition to the obligations of Company set forth in paragraph (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 6.13, Company, as promptly as practicable,
will advise Parent orally and in writing of any request for information which Company reasonably believes could lead to an Acquisition Proposal or of any Acquisition Proposal, and the material terms
and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. The Company will keep Parent reasonably informed in all material respects of the status of any such request, Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry. In addition to the foregoing, the Company will provide Parent with prior or reasonably contemporaneous telephonic (promptly confirmed in writing) or written notice of any meeting of the
Company's Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) at which the Company's Board of Directors is expected or could reasonably be expected to consider an Acquisition Proposal, together with a copy
of the definitive documentation relating to such Acquisition Proposal to the extent such documentation is then available (and otherwise provide such definitive documentation as soon as available). 

        (e)  It
is understood and agreed that, without limitation of the Company's obligations hereunder, any violation of this Section 6.13 by any director, officer,
Affiliate, investment bank, financial advisor, accountant, attorney or other advisor or representative of the Company, whether or not such person or entity is purporting to act on behalf of the
Company, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.13 by the Company. 

        6.14

either Parent
or the Company prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to 
Article 8 
hereof concerning this Agreement, the transactions described

approval not to be unreasonably withheld), subject to either party's obligations under applicable Law or Stock Market or AMEX listing requirements or rules (but such party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to consult with the other party as to all such public announcements). 

        6.15
    Expenses.

        (a)  Except
as set forth in this Section 6.15 and Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated. 

        (b)  The
Company and Parent each agree to pay one-half (

/

) of any printing, mailing and filing expenses of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and
pre-merger notification and report forms under the HSR Act. 

        (c)  In
connection with any claim, dispute, disagreement or other conflict involving the enforcement of this 
Article 6

or Section 8.3, the parties agree that the prevailing party shall be reimbursed by the other party for all reasonable attorneys' fees and costs and expenses associated with such conflict.

        6.16
    Certain Benefit Plans.

        (a)  Promptly
after the date of this Agreement, the Company's Board of Directors shall adopt resolutions to discontinue (for any applicable period that has not yet commenced)
the distribution of Company Common Stock to any Company Benefit Plan subject to Section 401(a) of the Code and to discontinue the purchase of Company Common Stock under the Company's Employee
Stock Purchase Plan. Prior
to the Closing Date, the Company's Board of Directors shall adopt a resolution freezing and terminating each Company Benefit Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement subject to
Section 401(k) of the Code. The Company shall provide written resolutions reasonably satisfactory to Parent authorizing the foregoing. A copy of such resolutions shall be delivered to Parent
prior to the Closing Date. As soon as practical after the Closing, Parent may cause the Surviving Corporation to file the terminated Company Benefit Plans with the IRS for favorable determination
letters and the Surviving Corporation shall take such other steps as it deems necessary in its sole discretion with respect to the terminated Company Benefit Plans. In connection with such
terminations, the Company is authorized and directed to make, prior to the Closing Date, any matching contributions to any such 401(k) Plan in the amount or percentage required or customarily awarded
under the plan for the plan year of the Closing Date and the previous plan year. 

        (b)  From
and after the date that active employees of the Company who are covered under any Company Benefit Plan cease to be covered under such Plan (herein called the 

"Continuing Employees"
), Parent shall cause
all Continuing Employees to be eligible to participate in all applicable employee benefit plans in which
similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries participate (called "
Parent Plans
"), under the terms and conditions of the applicable Parent
Plans, except as provided herein. For purposes of any length of service requirement, waiting periods, vesting periods or different benefits based on length of service in any Parent Plans for which a
Continuing Employee will be eligible, the Parent shall ensure that service by such Continuing Employee with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to have been service with the Parent
or its Subsidiaries. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any right with respect to continued employment with the Parent. 

        (c)  Parent
shall cause each applicable Parent Plan to grant credit to each Continuing Employee for all service on or prior to the Closing Date with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, for purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual, benefit calculations or allowances (including, without limitation, entitlements to vacation, severance, sick days and other paid
leave). 

        6.17
    Indemnification.

        (a)  The
Company shall, and from and after the Effective Time, the Parent shall, indemnify, defend and hold harmless (and advance expenses to) each Person who is now, or has
been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company (each individually an "
Indemnified
Party
" and, collectively, the "
Indemnified Parties
") to the same extent such Persons are indemnified as of the date of this
Agreement by the Company pursuant to any agreements between such person and the Company and the Company's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement with the approval of the Indemnifying Party (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) as a result of or in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether criminal, civil or administrative, based on or arising out
of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or out of or in connection with activities in such capacity, whether pertaining to any matter
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to,
