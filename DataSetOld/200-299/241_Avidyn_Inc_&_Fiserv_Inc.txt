                                               , 2002

Dear AVIDYN, Inc. Stockholder:

         AVIDYN, Inc. has agreed to be acquired by Fiserv, Inc. through the
merger of AVIDYN and a subsidiary of Fiserv under the terms of an agreement and
plan of merger with Fiserv. Before Fiserv can acquire AVIDYN, AVIDYN must obtain
the requisite approval of its stockholders. AVIDYN will hold a special meeting
of its stockholders on       , 2003, at 9:30 a.m., Central Time, at AVIDYN's
corporate offices at 16980 Dallas Parkway, Suite 120, Dallas, Texas 75248,
during which you will be asked to vote on the merger.

         In the merger, you will receive shares of Fiserv common stock for your
shares of AVIDYN common stock. Fiserv's common stock is traded on the Nasdaq
National Market under the symbol FISV. The exact number of shares that you will
receive will be determined based on a formula set forth in the merger agreement,
which includes an adjustment based upon the net assets of AVIDYN at the
effective time of the merger as agreed upon by the parties. The merger agreement
formula provides that, in exchange for each of your outstanding shares of AVIDYN
common stock, you will receive a fraction of a share of Fiserv common stock
equal to:

       o      $10.5 million, divided by

       o      the number of shares of AVIDYN common stock outstanding
              immediately before the effective time of the merger, divided by

       o      the average closing price for Fiserv common stock for the twenty
              business days ending two business days prior to the effective time
              of the merger;

provided that the $10.5 million amount used in the above calculation will be
increased or decreased by the difference between (1) the total assets of AVIDYN
less the total liabilities of AVIDYN at the effective time of the merger, and
(2) $6.8 million, unless the difference is less than $25,000, in which case no
adjustment to the $10.5 million amount will be made.

         Based on the average closing price for Fiserv common stock of $
for the twenty business days ending two business days prior to the date of the
proxy statement/prospectus accompanying this letter and the 3,620,092 shares of
AVIDYN common stock outstanding on the record date, you would receive
shares of Fiserv common stock for each share of your AVIDYN common stock in the
merger. This estimate assumes no adjustment based upon the net assets of AVIDYN
and is intended only to illustrate the calculation of the merger consideration.
This per share number is not likely to be the actual number of shares of Fiserv
common stock you will receive in the merger for each share of your AVIDYN common
stock because the actual number of shares of Fiserv common stock issuable in the
merger will be a function of the closing sale price for Fiserv common stock for
the twenty business days ending two business days prior to the effective time of
the merger and AVIDYN's net assets at the effective time of the merger.

         The actual number of shares of Fiserv common stock issuable in the
merger will not be determined until after the close of business on the second
business day before the special meeting of AVIDYN stockholders. Fiserv and
AVIDYN expect to notify AVIDYN stockholders of the number of shares of Fiserv
common stock that will be received for shares of AVIDYN common stock pursuant to

the formula above before the date of the AVIDYN special meeting by issuing a
press release and filing it with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

         The proxy statement/prospectus accompanying this letter provides you
with detailed information about the proposed merger. It also contains
information about AVIDYN and Fiserv that has been filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. You are encouraged to read carefully this proxy
statement/prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement/prospectus. You should also consider the matters discussed under "Risk
Factors" on page 16 of the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus before
voting.

         AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION, THE AVIDYN BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY
DETERMINED THAT THE TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER ARE ADVISABLE
AND FAIR TO, AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF, AVIDYN AND ITS STOCKHOLDERS AND
UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND
APPROVAL OF THE MERGER.

         YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT, regardless of the number of shares you
own. Holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of AVIDYN common stock must
vote to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger for the merger to
proceed. Only holders of AVIDYN common stock at the close of business on       ,
2002 will be entitled to vote at the special meeting.

         Please vote your shares as soon as possible so that your shares are
represented at the special meeting. To vote your shares, please complete, sign

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q.       What am I being asked to vote upon at the special meeting?

A.       You are being asked to vote to adopt the merger agreement entered into
         among Fiserv, Fiserv Merger Sub and AVIDYN and to approve the merger
         contemplated by the merger agreement. In the merger, Fiserv Merger Sub,
         a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fiserv, will be merged with and into
         AVIDYN. After the merger is completed, AVIDYN, which will be the
         company surviving the merger, will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of
         Fiserv.

Q.       Why is AVIDYN proposing to merge?

A.       The AVIDYN board of directors has thoroughly considered the advantages
         and disadvantages of the proposed merger. The board believes that it is
         in the best interests of AVIDYN and its stockholders to complete the
         merger and that the merger will provide AVIDYN stockholders with the
         best opportunity for return on their investments, through ownership of
         a larger, more competitive company. The board of directors has
         considered the highly competitive nature of the industry in which
         AVIDYN competes, the additional capital investment that would be
         required for AVIDYN to experience growth as an independent company, the
         increased costs of operating as an independent public company and
         AVIDYN's position in the industry. Based on its consideration of those
         factors, the board believes that AVIDYN would not be able to compete
         effectively in this industry in the future as an independent company.
         The board of directors also believes that following the merger AVIDYN's
         operating subsidiaries will have a stronger competitive position due to
         the increased exposure they will have to Fiserv's current customer base
         and other strategic partners. The board of directors has also
         determined that there is an absence of any other economically
         competitive offers for business combinations. Although an independent
         investment banking firm valuation has not been obtained, the board of
         directors believes that the consideration to be received from Fiserv in
         connection with the proposed merger is fair.

Q.       What will I receive in the merger?

A.       In the merger, you will receive shares of Fiserv common stock for your
         shares of AVIDYN common stock. Fiserv's common stock is traded on the
         Nasdaq National Market under the symbol FISV. The exact number of
         shares that you will receive will be determined based on a formula set
         forth in the merger agreement, which includes an adjustment based upon
         the net assets of AVIDYN at the effective time of the merger as agreed
         upon by the parties. The merger agreement formula provides that, in
         exchange for each of your outstanding shares of AVIDYN common stock,
         you will receive a fraction of a share of Fiserv common stock equal to:

         o        $10.5 million, divided by

         o        the number of shares of AVIDYN common stock outstanding
                  immediately before the effective time of the merger, divided
                  by

         o        the average closing price for Fiserv common stock for the
                  twenty business days ending two business days prior to the
                  effective time of the merger;

         provided that the $10.5 million amount used in the above calculation
         will be increased or decreased by the difference between (1) the total
         assets of AVIDYN less the total liabilities of

                                      -1-

         AVIDYN at the effective time of the merger, and (2) $6.8 million,
         unless the difference is less than $25,000, in which case no adjustment
         to the $10.5 million amount will be made.

         Based on the average closing price for Fiserv common stock of $ for the
         twenty business days ending two business days prior to the date of this
         proxy statement/prospectus and the 3,620,092 shares of AVIDYN common
         stock outstanding on the record date, you would receive shares of
         Fiserv common stock for each share of your AVIDYN common stock in the
         merger. This estimate assumes no adjustment based upon the net assets
         of AVIDYN and is intended only to illustrate the calculation of the
         merger consideration. This per share number is not likely to be the
         actual number of shares of Fiserv common stock you will receive in the
         merger for each share of your AVIDYN common stock because the actual
         number of shares of Fiserv common stock issuable in the merger will be
         a function of the closing sale price for Fiserv common stock for the
         twenty business days ending two business days prior to the effective
         time of the merger and AVIDYN's net assets at the effective time of the
         merger. See "Risk Factors - The number of shares of Fiserv common stock
         that AVIDYN stockholders will receive in the merger will fluctuate due
         to the formula under the merger agreement."

         Please see "The Merger Agreement - Consideration to be Received in the
         Merger" for a more detailed explanation of the merger consideration.

Q.       How will I find out how many shares of Fiserv common stock I will
         receive in the merger?

A.       The actual number of shares of Fiserv common stock issuable in the
         merger will not be determined until after the close of business on the
         second business day before the special meeting of AVIDYN stockholders.
         Fiserv and AVIDYN expect to notify you of the number of shares of
         Fiserv common stock that you will receive for shares of AVIDYN common
         stock pursuant to the formula above before the date of the AVIDYN
         special meeting by issuing a press release and filing it with the SEC.
         See "Risk Factors - The number of shares of Fiserv common stock that
         AVIDYN stockholders will receive in the merger will not be determined
         until shortly before the special meeting."

Q.       What is the determination and recommendation of the AVIDYN board of
         directors with respect to the merger?

A.       The AVIDYN board of directors unanimously determined that the terms of
         the merger agreement and the merger are advisable and fair to, and in
         the best interests of, AVIDYN and it stockholders and has unanimously
         approved the merger agreement and the merger. The AVIDYN board of
         directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders of AVIDYN vote
         "FOR" adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger.

Q.       Will I receive any fractional shares of Fiserv common stock in the
         merger?

A.       Fiserv will not issue fractional shares of common stock in the merger.
         Instead, you will receive a cash payment equal to the fractional
         interest of Fiserv common stock you would have been otherwise entitled
         to receive in the merger multiplied by the average closing price for
         Fiserv common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market for the
         twenty business days ending two business days prior to the effective
         time of the merger.

                                      -2-

Q.       How do I vote?

A.       After carefully reading and considering the information contained in,
         or incorporated by reference in, this proxy statement/prospectus,
         please complete and sign your proxy and return it in the enclosed
         return envelope as soon as possible so that your shares may be
         represented at the special meeting. If you sign and send in your proxy
         and do not indicate how you want to vote, AVIDYN will count your proxy
         as a vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement and approval of
         the merger. If you abstain from voting or do not vote your shares by
         proxy or in person, it will have the same effect as a vote against
         adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger.

         The special meeting will be held on          , 2003, at 9:30 a.m.,
         Central Time at AVIDYN's corporate offices at 16980 Dallas Parkway,
         Suite 120, Dallas, Texas 75248.

Q.       What vote is required to complete the merger?

A.       Adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger requires
         the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of
         AVIDYN common stock outstanding on the record date. Failure to vote,
         abstentions and broker non-votes will not be deemed to be cast either
         "FOR" or "AGAINST" the merger agreement and the merger. However,
         because adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger
         requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
         outstanding shares of AVIDYN common stock, the failure to vote,
         abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote
         "AGAINST" the merger agreement and the merger. In connection with the
         merger agreement, certain AVIDYN directors and/or their affiliates, who
         collectively beneficially own approximately 44.4% of the outstanding
         shares of AVIDYN common stock, entered into agreements to facilitate
         the merger with Fiserv, pursuant to which they agreed to vote their
         shares of AVIDYN common stock in favor of adoption of the merger
         agreement and approval of the merger. See "The Merger - Interests of
         AVIDYN Directors and Officers in the Merger - Agreements to Facilitate
         Merger."

Q.       Can I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy?

A.       You can change your vote at anytime before your proxy is voted at the
         special meeting. You can do this in any one of the following ways:

         o        You can send a written notice to the Secretary of AVIDYN
                  stating that you would like to revoke your proxy.

         o        You can complete and submit a new proxy.

         o        You can attend the special meeting and vote in person. You
                  will not revoke your proxy simply by attending the special
                  meeting unless you complete a ballot.

         If you have instructed a broker to vote your shares, then you must
         follow directions received from your broker to change your vote.

Q.       If my shares are held in "street name" by my broker or nominee, will my
         broker or nominee vote my shares for me?

A.       Your broker or nominee will vote your shares only if you provide
         instructions on how to vote. You should follow the directions provided
         by your broker or nominee regarding how to instruct your broker or
         nominee to vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not
         be voted,

                                      -3-

         which will have the effect of a vote against adoption of the merger
         agreement and approval of the merger.

Q.       Should I send in my stock certificates now?

A.       No. After the merger is completed, Fiserv will instruct EquiServe Trust
         Company, N.A., as the exchange agent, to send you written instructions
         for exchanging your stock certificates. Please do not send in your
         stock certificates with your proxy card.

Q.       When do you expect the merger to be completed?

A.       AVIDYN and Fiserv are working to complete the merger as quickly as
         possible. If AVIDYN stockholders adopt the merger agreement and approve
         the merger at the special meeting, then AVIDYN and Fiserv expect to
         complete the merger on the date of the special meeting.

Q.       Am I entitled to appraisal rights?

A.       Under Delaware law, you may object to the merger and demand in writing
         that AVIDYN pay you in cash the fair value of your shares of AVIDYN
         common stock as determined by a Delaware court. To exercise your
         appraisal rights you must follow detailed procedures set forth in the
         Delaware General Corporation Law. See "The Merger - Appraisal Rights."

Q.       What are the tax consequences of the merger to me?

A.       The exchange of your shares for Fiserv common stock in the merger has
         been structured to be tax-free to you for federal income tax purposes.
         However, you will have to pay taxes on cash received for fractional
         shares. Your tax basis in your total shares of Fiserv common stock
         received and fractional shares deemed received in the merger will equal
         your tax basis in your AVIDYN common stock. Tax matters are
         complicated, and the consequences of the merger to you will depend on
         your particular tax situation. You should consult your own tax advisor
         to fully understand the tax consequences of the merger to you.

Q.       Who can help answer my questions?

A.       If you have any questions about the merger, including how to complete
         and return your proxy card, or if you need additional copies of this
         proxy statement/prospectus or the enclosed proxy, you should contact:

THE COMPANIES

Fiserv, Inc.
255 Fiserv Drive
Brookfield, Wisconsin  53045
(262) 879-5000

         Fiserv is a leading technology resource for information management
systems used by the financial industry. Fiserv, a Wisconsin corporation, was
formed on July 31, 1984, through the combination of two major regional data
processing firms located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Tampa, Florida. These firms
- - First Data Processing of Milwaukee and Sunshine State Systems of Tampa - began
their operations in 1964 and 1971, respectively, as the data processing
operations of their parent financial institutions. Historically, operations were
expanded by developing a range of services for these parent organizations as
well as other financial institutions. Since its organization in 1984, Fiserv has
grown through the continuing development of highly specialized services and
product enhancements, the addition of new clients and the acquisition of firms
complementing the Fiserv organization.

         Headquartered in Brookfield, Wisconsin, Fiserv provides information
management technology and related services to banks, broker-dealers, credit
unions, financial planners and investment advisers, insurance agents and
companies, leasing companies, mortgage lenders and savings institutions. Fiserv
operates centers nationwide for full-service financial data processing, software
system development, item processing and check imaging, technology support and
related product businesses. In addition, Fiserv has business support centers in
Argentina, Australia, Colombia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Poland, Singapore
and the United Kingdom.

AVIDYN, Inc.
16980 Dallas Parkway, Suite 120
Dallas, Texas  75248
(972) 447-6447

         AVIDYN is a healthcare information services company incorporated in
Delaware in 1989 under the name Medical Control, Inc. AVIDYN conducts its
business through two operating companies serving the healthcare industry.
AVIDYN's two operating subsidiaries are ppoONE, Inc., which provides application
service provider eHealth solutions for preferred provider organizations, or
PPOs, and payers, and ValueCHECK, Inc., which provides utilization review and
case management for third party administrators, payers and PPOs.

         ppoONE, using its proprietary application software, database structures
and reports, is an Internet-based application service provider delivering
enterprise software solutions for PPOs, insurance companies and other healthcare
provider network organizations. ppoONE enables such entities and their clients
to manage provider data, contract data and client data, to reprice healthcare
claims to reflect negotiated rates and to produce data analyses.

                                      -5-

         ValueCHECK's primary target market is the self-insured employer.
ValueCHECK's services are primarily distributed through third party
administrators and PPOs. ValueCHECK sells its services on a stand-alone basis.
As of January 1, 2002, ValueCHECK provided service to over 850 employer clients
representing over 1,000,000 covered lives.

         In the first quarter of 2001, AVIDYN sold MedicalControl Network
Solutions, Inc., which provides managed care services primarily through its
preferred provider networks, and Diversified Group Administrators, Inc., which
provides third party administrator services. Accordingly, the historical
operating results of MedicalControl Network Solutions and Diversified Group
Administrators are reported as discontinued operations.

THE SPECIAL MEETING  (PAGE 19)

         The special meeting will be held on         , 2003, at 9:30 a.m.,
Central Time, at AVIDYN's corporate offices at 16980 Dallas Parkway, Suite 120,
Dallas, Texas  75248.

         At the special meeting, AVIDYN stockholders will be asked to vote to
adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger and to conduct any other
business properly brought before the meeting. If AVIDYN stockholders adopt the
merger agreement and approve the merger at the special meeting, then AVIDYN and
Fiserv expect to complete the merger on the date of the special meeting.

RECORD DATE; VOTE REQUIRED  (PAGES 19 AND 20)

         You can vote, or submit a proxy to vote, at the special meeting if you
were a record holder of AVIDYN common stock at the close of business on        ,
2002.  On the record date, there were 3,620,092 shares of AVIDYN common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.

         Holders of AVIDYN common stock as of the record date are entitled to
one vote per share on each matter to be voted on at the special meeting.

         The merger will be approved only if the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of AVIDYN common stock entitled to vote at the special
meeting vote for the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the
merger. In connection with the merger agreement, certain AVIDYN directors and/or
their affiliates, who collectively beneficially own approximately 44.4% of the
outstanding shares of AVIDYN common stock, entered into agreements to facilitate
the merger with Fiserv, pursuant to which they agreed to vote their shares of
AVIDYN common stock in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and
approval of the merger. See "The Merger - Interests of AVIDYN Directors and
Officers in the Merger - Agreements to Facilitate Merger."

RECOMMENDATION OF THE AVIDYN BOARD OF DIRECTORS  (PAGE 22)

         The AVIDYN board of directors unanimously determined that the terms of
the merger agreement and the merger are advisable and fair to, and in the best
interests of, AVIDYN and it stockholders and has unanimously approved the merger
agreement and the merger. The AVIDYN board of directors unanimously recommends
that the stockholders of AVIDYN vote "FOR" adoption of the merger agreement and
approval of the merger.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT  (PAGE 28)

         The merger will be accounted for as a purchase business combination for
financial reporting and accounting purposes.

                                      -6-

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES  (PAGE 28)

         The exchange of AVIDYN common stock for Fiserv common stock in the
merger has been structured to be tax-free to AVIDYN stockholders for federal
income tax purposes. However, AVIDYN stockholders will have to pay taxes on cash
received for fractional shares. An AVIDYN stockholder's tax basis in the total
shares of Fiserv common stock received and fractional shares deemed received in
the merger will equal the stockholder's tax basis in AVIDYN common stock. Tax
matters are complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to any
particular AVIDYN stockholder will depend on the stockholder's particular tax
situation. AVIDYN stockholders should consult their own tax advisors to fully
understand the tax consequences of the merger.

REGULATORY MATTERS (PAGE 30)

         There are no significant federal or state regulatory requirements with
which the parties must comply and no significant federal or state regulatory
approvals that the parties must obtain in connection with the merger.

INTERESTS OF AVIDYN DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS IN THE MERGER  (PAGE 30)

         AVIDYN's stockholders should be aware that some directors and executive
officers of AVIDYN have interests in the merger that are different from, or in
addition to, those of AVIDYN stockholders generally. These interests include the
following:

         o        certain AVIDYN directors and/or their affiliates, who
                  collectively beneficially own approximately 44.4% of the
                  outstanding shares of AVIDYN common stock, entered into
                  agreements to facilitate the merger with Fiserv, pursuant to
                  which they agreed to vote their shares of AVIDYN common stock
                  in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and approval
                  of the merger;

         o        certain executive officers of AVIDYN have agreed to enter into
                  an employment agreement or amend their existing employment
                  agreement;

         o        certain executive officers of AVIDYN will receive an aggregate
                  of $45,000 in bonuses contingent upon and payable at the
                  closing of the merger; and

         o        each of the directors and officers of AVIDYN will be entitled
                  to continued indemnification by AVIDYN and Fiserv.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS  (PAGE 32)

         The Delaware General Corporation Law grants appraisal rights in the
merger to the holders of AVIDYN common stock. Under Section 262 of the Delaware
General Corporation Law, AVIDYN stockholders may object to the merger and demand
in writing that AVIDYN pay to them the fair value of their shares of AVIDYN
common stock as determined by a Delaware court. Stockholders who elect to
exercise appraisal rights must comply with all of the procedures set forth in
Section 262 to preserve their appraisal rights.

TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

         We have attached the merger agreement, which is the legal document that
governs and sets the terms of the merger, as Annex A to this proxy
statement/prospectus. We encourage you to read the merger agreement in its
entirety.

                                      -7-

CONSIDERATION TO BE RECEIVED IN THE MERGER  (PAGE 36)

         At the effective time of the merger, each share of AVIDYN common stock
then issued and outstanding will be converted into the right to receive a
fraction of a share of Fiserv common stock as determined based on a formula
contained in the merger agreement, which includes an adjustment based upon the
net assets of AVIDYN at the effective time of the merger as agreed upon by the
parties. Under this formula, holders of AVIDYN common stock will receive, in
exchange for each of their outstanding shares of AVIDYN common stock, a fraction
of a share of Fiserv common stock equal to:

         o        $10.5 million, divided by

         o        the number of shares of AVIDYN common stock outstanding
                  immediately before the effective time of the merger, divided
                  by

         o        the average closing price for Fiserv common stock for the
                  twenty business days ending two business days prior to the
                  effective time of the merger;

provided that the $10.5 million amount used in the above calculation will be
increased or decreased by the difference between (1) the total assets of AVIDYN
less the total liabilities of AVIDYN at the effective time of the merger, and
(2) $6.8 million, unless the difference is less than $25,000, in which case no
adjustment to the $10.5 million amount will be made.

         Based on the average closing price for Fiserv common stock of $     for
the twenty business days ending two business days prior to the date of this
proxy statement/prospectus and the 3,620,092 shares of AVIDYN common stock
outstanding on the record date, AVIDYN stockholders would receive      shares of
Fiserv common stock for each share of your AVIDYN common stock in the merger.
This estimate assumes no adjustment based upon the net assets of AVIDYN and is
intended only to illustrate the calculation of the merger consideration. This
per share number is not likely to be the actual number of shares of Fiserv
common stock AVIDYN stockholders will receive in the merger for each share of
AVIDYN common stock because the actual number of shares of Fiserv common stock
issuable in the merger will be a function of the closing sale price for Fiserv
common stock for the twenty business days ending two business days prior to the
effective time of the merger and AVIDYN's net assets at the effective time of
the merger. See "Risk Factors - The number of shares of Fiserv common stock that
AVIDYN stockholders will receive in the merger will fluctuate due to the formula
under the merger agreement."

         The actual number of shares of Fiserv common stock issuable in the
merger will not be determined until after the close of business on the second
business day before the special meeting of AVIDYN stockholders. Fiserv and
AVIDYN expect to notify AVIDYN stockholders of the number of shares of Fiserv
common stock that will be received for shares of AVIDYN common stock pursuant to
the formula above before the date of the AVIDYN special meeting by issuing a
press release and filing it with the Securities and Exchange Commission. See
"Risk Factors - The number of shares of Fiserv common stock that AVIDYN
stockholders will receive in the merger will not be determined until shortly
before the special meeting."

         Holders of AVIDYN common stock will receive only whole shares of Fiserv
common stock and will receive cash instead of fractional shares, as described
under "The Merger Agreement - Fractional Shares."

CONDUCT OF AVIDYN'S BUSINESS PRIOR TO THE MERGER  (PAGE 39)

         AVIDYN has agreed that, except as otherwise contemplated by the
agreement, AVIDYN, including its subsidiaries, will conduct its operations in
its ordinary and usual course of business.

                                      -8-

NO SOLICITATION  (PAGE 39)

         AVIDYN has agreed, subject to limited exceptions set forth in the
merger agreement, not to initiate or engage in discussions with any other party
about a business combination with the other person or provide any nonpublic
information to any other person prior to the termination of the merger
agreement.

STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING  (PAGE 41)

         AVIDYN has agreed to use its reasonable efforts to convene the AVIDYN
special meeting as soon as practicable. Under the merger agreement, AVIDYN's
board of directors is required to recommend the adoption of the merger agreement
and the approval of the merger by the stockholders at the special meeting,
unless it complies with certain requirements under the merger agreement. The
board may not withdraw, or modify in a manner adverse to Fiserv, its
recommendation unless AVIDYN has complied with the nonsolicitation covenants of
the merger agreement and such withdrawal or modification is required under
applicable law in order for the board to comply with its fiduciary duties.

NASDAQ LISTING  (PAGE 41)

         Fiserv has agreed to prepare and submit to Nasdaq a listing application
for the Fiserv common stock to be issued in the merger pursuant to the merger
agreement.

CONDITIONS TO COMPLETION OF THE MERGER  (PAGE 42)

         Several conditions must be satisfied or waived before the merger will
be completed, including:

         o        the absence of any order, decree or injunction that prevents
                  or materially delays the merger or materially limits Fiserv's
                  ability to exercise full rights of ownership of AVIDYN or its
                  assets or business;

         o        the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the
                  merger by the AVIDYN stockholders;

         o        Fiserv and AVIDYN will have agreed on the balance sheet of
                  AVIDYN as of the effective time of the merger;

         o        the accuracy of the representations and warranties of AVIDYN
                  and Fiserv, except where the failure of representations and
                  warranties made by AVIDYN to be accurate have not had, and
                  would not be reasonably likely to have, a material adverse
                  effect on AVIDYN;

         o        the fulfillment in all material respects of the covenants of
                  AVIDYN and Fiserv under the merger agreement;

         o        the shares of Fiserv common stock to be issued in the merger
                  shall have been approved for listing on Nasdaq;

         o        the absence of any action or proceeding arising by reason of
                  the merger which is reasonably likely to have a material
                  adverse effect;

         o        AVIDYN will have obtained certain consents or waivers to the
                  merger; and

         o        certain employees of AVIDYN will have executed and delivered
                  to Fiserv employment agreements.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT  (PAGE 43)

         Fiserv and AVIDYN may mutually agree to terminate the merger agreement
at any time. In addition, either Fiserv or AVIDYN may terminate the merger
agreement if specified events do or do not occur. These events include:

         o        if the merger is not completed by May 2, 2003, other than as a
                  result of the failure by the party proposing to terminate the
                  merger agreement to perform its obligations;

         o        if a court or governmental body permanently prohibits the
                  merger or a proceeding for it to do so is pending on and after
                  November 2, 2003;

         o        if the AVIDYN stockholders fail to approve the merger
                  agreement and the merger at the special meeting; or

         o        if a party has materially breached any of its covenants and
                  the other party has not materially breached its obligations
                  under the merger agreement.

         Fiserv may also terminate the merger agreement if:

         o        the AVIDYN board of directors has recommended to the
                  stockholders or entered into an agreement regarding an
                  alternative transaction; or

         o        the AVIDYN board of directors has withdrawn or modified in a
                  manner adverse to Fiserv its recommendation of the merger.

         AVIDYN may also terminate the merger agreement under certain
circumstances if the AVIDYN board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, that an
alternative transaction is more favorable to AVIDYN stockholders than the
merger.

TERMINATION PAYMENT  (PAGE 44)

         AVIDYN must pay Fiserv a termination fee of $400,000 plus all fees and
expenses of Fiserv incurred in connection with the preparation of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement if the merger agreement is
terminated under certain circumstances including the AVIDYN board of directors
recommending an alternative transaction, a withdrawal or modification of the
AVIDYN board of directors in a manner adverse to Fiserv of its recommendation of
the merger, the AVIDYN board of directors authorizing AVIDYN to enter into an
agreement concerning an alternative transaction or AVIDYN entering into an
alternative transaction within twelve months of the date on which AVIDYN
materially breached its covenants under the merger agreement. These
circumstances are described in detail in "The Merger Agreement - Termination
Payment; Expenses."

(1)  Total revenues have been restated to reflect the impact of Fiserv adopting Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 01-14, "Income
     Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for `Out of Pocket' Expenses Incurred," which requires that customer
     reimbursements received for direct costs paid to third parties and related expenses be characterized as revenues. Total
     revenues and expenses have been increased by $216,775 for the nine months ended September 30, 2001, $298,714 for the year ended
     December 31, 2001 and $275,615 for the year ended December 31, 2000. Revenues and expenses for periods 1999 and prior were not
     restated as it was impracticable to obtain this information. The adoption of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 01-14 did not
     impact Fiserv's financial position, operating income or net income.

(2)  On January 1, 2002, Fiserv adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."
     Pro forma net income, adjusted to eliminate historical amortization of goodwill and related tax effects, was $169,198 for the
     nine months ended September 30, 2001, $226,656 for the year ended December 31, 2001 and $193,616 for the year ended December
     31, 2000. The impact of adopting this statement would have increased diluted net income per share by $0.07 for the nine months
     ended September 30, 2001, $0.09 for the year ended December 31, 2001 and $0.09 for the year ended December 31, 2000.

(3)  Net income per share has been restated to recognize three-for-two stock splits effective in August 2001, April 1999 and May
     1998.

__________________
(1)  Net income or loss per share amounts are calculated using weighted average shares outstanding
     for the period. Book value per share amounts are calculated using outstanding shares at the
     period end.
(2)  The AVIDYN equivalent pro forma information is calculated by multiplying the Fiserv pro forma
     per share amounts by      , which is equal to the fraction of a share of Fiserv common stock that
     would be issuable in the merger for each share of AVIDYN common stock under the merger
     agreement formula based on the average closing price for Fiserv common stock of $      for the
     twenty business days ending two business days prior to the date of this proxy statement/
     prospectus and the 3,620,092 shares of AVIDYN common stock outstanding on the record date and
     assuming no adjustment based upon the net assets of AVIDYN. This fraction is only an estimate
     based on the foregoing assumptions. This fraction is not likely to be the actual number of
     shares of Fiserv common stock AVIDYN stockholders will receive in the merger for each share of
     AVIDYN common stock because the actual number of shares of Fiserv common stock issuable in the
     merger will be a function of the closing sale price for Fiserv common stock for the twenty
     business days ending two business days prior to the effective time of the merger and AVIDYN's
     estimated net assets at the effective time of the merger. See "Risk Factors - The number of
     shares of Fiserv common stock that AVIDYN stockholders will receive in the merger will
     fluctuate due to the formula under the merger agreement."

     The following table sets forth the closing prices per share of Fiserv
common stock on the Nasdaq National Market and AVIDYN common stock on the Nasdaq
SmallCap Market on November 1, 2002, the last full trading day prior to the
announcement of the merger agreement, and            , 2002, the latest
practicable full trading day prior to the date of this proxy statement/
prospectus. The following table also sets forth the equivalent per share price
of AVIDYN common stock, which was determined by multiplying the applicable price
of Fiserv common stock by the fraction of a share of Fiserv common stock that
would be issuable in the merger for each share of AVIDYN common stock under the
merger agreement formula, which was 0.1034 as of November 1, 2002 and         as
of        , 2002. The fraction of a share of Fiserv common stock that would be
issuable in the merger was determined based on Fiserv common stock prices using
the formula calculated under the merger agreement as if the closing of the
merger had occurred on those dates and the 3,620,092 shares of AVIDYN common
stock outstanding on the record date and assumes no adjustment based upon the
net assets of AVIDYN.

                            Fiserv            AVIDYN       Estimated Equivalent
             Date        Common Stock      Common Stock   AVIDYN Per Share Price

November 1, 2002           $31.39              $2.35           $3.25
          , 2002           $                   $               $

         The actual equivalent per share price of AVIDYN common stock that
holders of AVIDYN common stock will receive if the merger is completed may
increase or decrease from that noted in the table above. Because the formula in
the merger agreement to determine the number of shares of Fiserv common stock
AVIDYN stockholders will receive in the merger is based in part upon the closing
sale price of Fiserv common stock on the Nasdaq National Market for the twenty
business days ending two business days prior to the effective time of the
merger, AVIDYN stockholders are urged to obtain current market quotations before
making any decision on whether and how to vote shares of AVIDYN common stock at
the special meeting. In addition, AVIDYN stockholders should be aware that the
number of shares of Fiserv common stock to be received in the merger will be a
function of the amount of total assets of AVIDYN less the total liabilities of
AVIDYN, in each case, at the effective time of the merger. See "The Merger
Agreement - Consideration to be Received in the Merger" and "Risk Factors - The
number of shares of Fiserv common stock that AVIDYN stockholders will receive in
the merger will fluctuate due to the formula under the merger agreement."

         The actual number of shares of Fiserv common stock issuable in the
merger will not be determined until after the close of business on the second
business day before the special meeting of AVIDYN stockholders. Fiserv and
AVIDYN expect to notify AVIDYN stockholders of the number of shares of Fiserv
common stock that will be received for shares of AVIDYN common stock pursuant to
the formula above before the date of the AVIDYN special meeting by issuing a
press release and filing it with the SEC. See "Risk Factors - The number of
shares of Fiserv common stock that AVIDYN stockholders will receive in the
merger will not be determined until shortly before the special meeting."

                                      -15-

                                  RISK FACTORS

         You should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition
to those discussed in the documents that AVIDYN and Fiserv have filed with the
SEC that are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, in
determining whether to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger.

THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF FISERV COMMON STOCK THAT AVIDYN STOCKHOLDERS WILL
RECEIVE IN THE MERGER WILL FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE FORMULA UNDER THE MERGER
AGREEMENT.

         In the merger, each share of AVIDYN common stock will be converted into
the right to receive a fraction of a share of Fiserv common stock pursuant to
the formula set forth in the merger agreement. The number of shares of Fiserv
common stock AVIDYN stockholders will receive in the merger is based in part
upon the closing sale price of Fiserv common stock on the Nasdaq National Market
for the twenty business days ending two business days prior to the effective
time of the merger. Variations in Fiserv common stock market price may result
from various factors, including changes in the business, operations or prospects
of Fiserv and general market and economic conditions. AVIDYN stockholders are
urged to obtain current market quotations before making any decision on whether
and how to vote shares of AVIDYN common stock at the special meeting. The number
of shares of Fiserv common stock issuable in the merger is also a function of
the number of shares of AVIDYN common stock outstanding and the amount of total
assets of AVIDYN less the total liabilities of AVIDYN, in each case, at the
effective time of the merger. Changes in these factors will affect the number of
shares of Fiserv common stock and the overall value of the merger consideration
payable to AVIDYN stockholders in the merger. See "The Merger Agreement -
Consideration to be Received in the Merger" for more detailed information on how
the number of shares of Fiserv common stock issuable in the merger is
determined.

THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF FISERV COMMON STOCK THAT AVIDYN STOCKHOLDERS WILL
RECEIVE IN THE MERGER WILL NOT BE DETERMINED UNTIL SHORTLY BEFORE THE SPECIAL
MEETING.

         The actual number of shares of Fiserv common stock that AVIDYN
stockholders will receive in the merger will not be determined until after the
close of business on the second business day before the special meeting of
AVIDYN stockholders. Fiserv and AVIDYN expect to notify AVIDYN stockholders of
the number of shares of Fiserv common stock that will be received for shares of
AVIDYN common stock pursuant to the formula under the merger agreement before
the date of the AVIDYN special meeting by issuing a press release and filing it
with the SEC. However, AVIDYN stockholders that vote by proxy will have voted
their shares of AVIDYN common stock, subject to revocation of their proxy, prior
to knowing the number of shares of Fiserv common stock they will receive in the
merger.

TERMINATION FEES MAY DISCOURAGE OTHER COMPANIES FROM TRYING TO COMBINE WITH
AVIDYN.

         The merger agreement provides for termination fees that could
discourage other companies from trying or proposing to combine with AVIDYN
before Fiserv and AVIDYN complete the merger. An alternative transaction
involving AVIDYN may be more advantageous to its stockholders than the merger.
This provision may discourage other companies from trying to or proposing to
combine with AVIDYN.

FISERV AND AVIDYN MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES IN INTEGRATING OPERATIONS.

         Fiserv and AVIDYN expect some benefits to arise from the merger,
including expansion of AVIDYN's customer base and operating efficiencies. The
extent to which these benefits arise will depend on how and when the businesses
of Fiserv and AVIDYN are integrated after the merger. In the

                                      -16-

past, Fiserv has successfully combined acquired operations, but there are risks
that Fiserv and AVIDYN will not successfully combine their operations in the
time anticipated or fully achieve the anticipated benefits. If the integration
of the businesses proves difficult, then management may divert their attention
from other business concerns.

                                      -17-

            CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

          manner or at all;

     o    failure of AVIDYN stockholders to approve the merger;

     o    AVIDYN's business may not be integrated successfully into Fiserv to
          realize anticipated synergies and cost savings;

     o    the ability of Fiserv and AVIDYN to successfully manage relationships
          with customers during the pendency of and following the transaction;
          and

     o    other factors discussed above under "Risk Factors" and in the filings
          of Fiserv and AVIDYN with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

                               THE SPECIAL MEETING

         This proxy statement/prospectus is furnished in connection with the
solicitation of proxies by the AVIDYN board of directors for use at the special
meeting of AVIDYN stockholders to be held on       , 2003 and at any adjournment
or postponement of the meeting. This proxy statement/prospectus and accompanying
form of proxy are first being mailed to AVIDYN stockholders on or about        ,
2002.

TIME AND PLACE

         The special meeting will be held on       , 2003, at 9:30 a.m., Central
Time, at AVIDYN's corporate offices at 16980 Dallas Parkway, Suite 120, Dallas,
Texas 75248.

PURPOSE OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

         At the special meeting, AVIDYN stockholders will be asked to consider
and vote upon the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the
merger. If AVIDYN stockholders adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger
at the special meeting, then AVIDYN and Fiserv expect to complete the merger on
the date of the special meeting.

         AVIDYN knows of no other matters to be brought before the special
meeting. If any other business should properly come before the special meeting,
the persons named in the enclosed proxy will vote in their discretion.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE AVIDYN BOARD OF DIRECTORS

         THE AVIDYN BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY DETERMINED THAT THE TERMS OF
THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER ARE ADVISABLE AND FAIR TO, AND IN THE BEST
INTERESTS OF, AVIDYN AND ITS STOCKHOLDERS AND HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE
MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER. THE AVIDYN BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY
RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS OF AVIDYN VOTE "FOR" ADOPTION OF THE MERGER
AGREEMENT AND APPROVAL OF THE MERGER.

RECORD DATE; STOCK ENTITLED TO VOTE

         AVIDYN has established the close of business on          , 2002 as the
record date to determine AVIDYN stockholders entitled to vote at the special
meeting. Only holders of AVIDYN common stock of record on the record date are
entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special meeting and any
adjournments or postponements of the meeting. At the close of business on the
record date, 3,620,092 shares of AVIDYN common stock were outstanding and
entitled to vote at the special meeting, and were held by approximately
holders of record. AVIDYN common stock constitutes the only outstanding class of
AVIDYN voting securities. Each share of AVIDYN common stock is entitled to one
vote on the merger agreement and the merger. Votes may be cast at the special
meeting in person or by proxy.

QUORUM

         The presence at the special meeting, either in person or by proxy, of a
majority of the shares of AVIDYN common stock outstanding on the record date is
necessary to constitute a quorum to transact business at that meeting. If a
quorum is not present, it is expected that the special meeting will be adjourned
or postponed in order to solicit additional proxies.

                                      -19-

         Abstentions and "broker non-votes" will be counted for the purpose of
determining whether a quorum is present. Broker non-votes are shares held by
brokers or nominees on behalf of customers that are represented at the meeting
but with respect to which the broker or nominee has not been instructed how to
vote. Brokers holding shares of AVIDYN common stock in street name for customers
are prohibited from voting those customers' shares regarding the merger
agreement and the merger in the absence of specific instructions from those
customers.

VOTE REQUIRED

         Adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger requires
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of AVIDYN common
stock outstanding on the record date. Failures to vote, abstentions and broker
non-votes will not be deemed to be cast either "FOR" or "AGAINST" the merger
agreement and the merger. However, because adoption of the merger agreement and
approval of the merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of AVIDYN common stock, failures to vote,
abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST"
the merger agreement and the merger.

SHARE OWNERSHIP OF MANAGEMENT AND OTHERS

         As of the record date, AVIDYN's directors and executive officers
beneficially owned approximately 44.4 % of the outstanding shares of AVIDYN
common stock. Each AVIDYN director and executive officer has indicated his or
her present intention to vote, or cause to be voted, the AVIDYN common stock
owned by him or her "FOR" adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the
merger.

         On November 2, 2002, John Ward Hunt, AVIDYN's chairman of the board, an
entity controlled by Mr. Hunt and an entity controlled by Frank M. Burke, Jr.,
an AVIDYN director, each entered into an agreement to facilitate the merger,
pursuant to which, among other things, these stockholders agreed to vote their
shares of AVIDYN common stock "FOR" adoption of the merger agreement and
approval of the merger. See "The Merger - Interests of AVIDYN Directors and
Officers in the Merger - Agreements to Facilitate Merger." A copy of the form of
agreement to facilitate the merger is attached as Annex B to this proxy
statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus. On the record date, these stockholders collectively
beneficially owned 44.4% of the outstanding shares of AVIDYN common stock
eligible to vote at the special meeting.

PROXIES; VOTING AND REVOCATION

         Shares of AVIDYN common stock represented by properly executed proxies
received in time for the special meeting will be voted in accordance with
instructions indicated on the proxies. Except for the broker non-votes, proxies
that do not contain voting instructions will be voted "FOR" adoption of the
merger agreement and approval of the merger, and as determined by the AVIDYN
board of directors as to any other matter that may properly come before the
special meeting.

         Any AVIDYN stockholder who executes and returns a proxy may revoke it
at any time prior to the voting of the proxies by giving written notice to the
Secretary of AVIDYN, by executing a later dated proxy or by attending the
special meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the special meeting will not
by itself constitute revocation of a proxy; an AVIDYN stockholder must also vote
in person at the special meeting.

                                      -20-

ADJOURNMENT AND POSTPONEMENT

         If a quorum is not present at the time the special meeting is convened,
or if for any other reason AVIDYN believes that additional time should be
allowed for the solicitation of proxies, then AVIDYN may postpone the meeting or
may adjourn the meeting with or without a vote of stockholders. If AVIDYN
proposes to postpone or adjourn the special meeting by a vote of stockholders,
then the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy will vote all shares of
AVIDYN common stock for which they have voting authority in favor of a
postponement or adjournment. However, these persons will not vote any shares of
AVIDYN common stock for which they have been instructed to vote against the
adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger in favor of that
postponement or adjournment.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

         AVIDYN will pay the cost of soliciting proxies from its stockholders.
In addition to solicitation by mail, AVIDYN directors, officers and employees
may solicit proxies by telephone, fax, the Internet, telegram or in person.
Arrangements will also be made with brokerage houses and other nominees and
fiduciaries for forwarding solicitation material to the beneficial owners of
stock held of record by those persons, and AVIDYN will reimburse those
custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses.

         THE MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED AT THE AVIDYN SPECIAL MEETING ARE OF GREAT
IMPORTANCE TO AVIDYN STOCKHOLDERS. THE AVIDYN BOARD OF DIRECTORS URGES ALL
AVIDYN STOCKHOLDERS TO READ AND CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE INFORMATION PRESENTED IN
THIS DOCUMENT AND TO COMPLETE, DATE, SIGN AND PROMPTLY RETURN THE ENCLOSED PROXY
IN THE ENCLOSED POSTAGE-PAID ENVELOPE.

                                      -21-

                                   THE MERGER

         This section of the proxy statement/prospectus and the next section
entitled "The Merger Agreement" describe the proposed merger. Although Fiserv
and AVIDYN believe that the description in those sections covers the material
terms of the merger agreement, the merger and the related transactions, this
summary may not contain all of the information that is important to you. You
should carefully read the entire proxy statement/prospectus and the other
documents referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus for a more complete
understanding of the merger.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

         Based upon the analysis and discussions of the AVIDYN board of
directors described under "The Merger - AVIDYN's Reasons for the Merger," the
board of directors determined that the best opportunity for AVIDYN to provide
value to its stockholders was to pursue a business combination with another
company. The board of directors also determined that the merger represents the
best potential business combination available to the stockholders of AVIDYN in
the foreseeable future. However, prior to making this determination, AVIDYN's
board of directors and management considered numerous potential business
strategies, business alliances and alternative transactions in an attempt to
maximize the value of AVIDYN's common stock.

         During August and September 2001, Mr. Joseph A. Hensley, President of
AVIDYN and ppoONE, had several discussions with a representative of a potential
acquiror of ppoONE or its proprietary systems, which had been initiated by such
potential acquiror. At a special board meeting on September 13, 2001 called to
discuss the long-term strategy for ppoONE and ValueCHECK, the AVIDYN board of
directors discussed the possibility of a sale transaction with that acquiror.
The board of directors instructed Mr. Hensley to continue to pursue such
discussions. However, those transaction discussions were postponed and
subsequently terminated by the potential acquiror due to its internal issues.

         During November 2001 and December 2001, AVIDYN's board of directors and
management continued to explore alternatives for ppoONE, including strategic
alliances, expanding its products into new markets, cost reductions and changes
in sales staff. During this time, Mr. Hensley and other representatives of
AVIDYN met with representatives of two separate companies on separate occasions
to discuss entering into a strategic alliance with either of them. After
learning more about ppoONE, both of these companies became more interested in
acquiring ppoONE than entering into a strategic alliance. One of these companies
performed initial due diligence during this time.

         At a regularly scheduled board meeting on November 8, 2001, Mr. Hensley
updated the AVIDYN board of directors on the transactions that were being
proposed for AVIDYN and separately for ppoONE. After reviewing AVIDYN's
financial projections for 2002 and 2003, the board of directors instructed Mr.
Hensley to continue responding to proposals for a sale of ppoONE. The board of
directors agreed at this meeting that, absent significantly improved revenue
increases for ppoONE or an acceptable offer for AVIDYN or ppoONE, the board of
directors would meet on January 31, 2002 to discuss the future of ppoONE and
AVIDYN as a whole. After this meeting, Mr. Hensley began making inquires to
companies in the industry that might have an interest in ppoONE.

         At a regularly scheduled board meeting on December 11, 2001 to approve
the 2002 budget for AVIDYN and its subsidiaries, Mr. Hensley summarized for the
AVIDYN board of directors the discussions and proposals from two potential
acquirors regarding the sale of ppoONE. The board of directors discussed the
value of ppoONE and instructed Mr. Hensley to continue his search for possible
acquisition candidates for AVIDYN as well as possible acquirors of ppoONE.

                                      -22-

         On January 31, 2002, at a special meeting of the AVIDYN board of
directors, the board of directors reviewed the long-term strategy for ppoONE.
The board of directors reviewed the declining outlook for new sales and
contracts for ppoONE during 2002 and authorized the elimination of personnel at
ppoONE to bring expenses in line with anticipated revenues. Mr. Hensley
summarized for the board of directors the discussions representatives of AVIDYN
were having with two potential acquirors of ppoONE and one potential acquiror of
AVIDYN. After this meeting, Mr. Hensley made a concerted effort to market ppoONE
for sale.

         Between January 2002 and June 2002, representatives of AVIDYN,
including John Ward Hunt, AVIDYN's chairman of the board, Mr. Hensley, Randall
D. Kurtz, AVIDYN's chief financial officer, and Dwight D. Mankin, senior vice
president, sales of ppoONE and ValueCHECK, participated in discussions and
attended meetings with, and made presentations regarding AVIDYN and ppoONE to,
representatives of four additional potential acquirors of ppoONE or AVIDYN in
addition to Fiserv. Throughout this time period, the AVIDYN board of directors
was apprised by AVIDYN management as to the status of discussions with potential
acquirors and had discussions regarding the future of ppoONE and AVIDYN as a
whole. Three of the potential acquirors performed due diligence on AVIDYN. Three
of the potential acquirors made informal offers to acquire ppoONE or AVIDYN
during this time. However, in each case, AVIDYN declined the proposed
transaction because the board of directors determined that the terms, including
the price and/or structure, of the transaction was not in the best interests of
AVIDYN and its stockholders.

         At a regularly scheduled board meeting on March 7, 2002, Mr. Hensley
summarized for the AVIDYN board of directors the status of discussions and
possible transactions with various entities regarding the sale of ppoONE. The
board of directors asked management to update ppoONE's projections for 2003 so
they could evaluate alternatives with respect to ppoONE.

         At a regularly scheduled board meeting on May 10, 2002, the AVIDYN
board of directors and Mr. Hensley held lengthy discussions regarding the
potential acquirors of ppoONE and the status of Mr. Hensley's discussions with
each of these entities.

         On May 22, 2002, AVIDYN and Trewit Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Fiserv, executed a confidentiality agreement, after which time Trewit was
provided with due diligence materials concerning AVIDYN. On June 19, 2002, an
initial meeting was held among Mr. Hunt, Mr. Hensley and James W. Cox, Trewit's
president, to discuss Fiserv's interest in acquiring or merging with AVIDYN.
Between June 2002 and early September 2002, Mr. Hensley and Mr. Cox continued to
have telephonic discussions regarding Fiserv's interest in a transaction with
AVIDYN.

         During the period from July 2002 through September 2002,
representatives of AVIDYN, including Mr. Hensley, Mr. Kurtz and Mr. Mankin,
participated in discussions and attended meetings with, and made presentations
regarding AVIDYN and ppoONE to, representatives of three additional potential
acquirors of ppoONE or AVIDYN other than Fiserv. However, none of these
potential acquirors had an interest in pursuing a transaction with AVIDYN.

         At a regularly scheduled board meeting on August 8, 2002, the AVIDYN
board of directors and Mr. Hensley held lengthy discussions regarding potential
purchasers of ppoONE or AVIDYN and the status of Mr. Hensley's discussions with
each of these entities. The board of directors and Mr. Hensley discussed each
opportunity and the current status of such discussions. The board of directors
also held a lengthy discussion regarding AVIDYN's business strategy and
alternatives for the future. The alternatives considered by the board of
directors included the possibility of merging with another company or going
private since the cost of being a public company was expected to increase as a
result of

                                      -23-

new corporate governance and disclosure legislation that was being proposed and
adopted, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

         On September 6, 2002, Mr. Cox called Mr. Hensley to inform him that
Fiserv would like to have further discussions regarding a possible transaction.
On September 16, 2002, Mr. Hensley and Mr. Kurtz met with Mr. Cox and James
Lockhart, Trewit's executive vice president and general counsel, and explained
the possible synergies resulting from a combination of the two organizations. On
September 18, 2002, Mr. Cox sent Mr. Hensley a letter expressing an interest in
having further discussions concerning an acquisition of, or merger with, AVIDYN.

         On September 25, 2002, AVIDYN held a special board meeting at which the
AVIDYN board of directors and management reviewed the letter from Trewit, during
which time the board discussed the value of AVIDYN. The board of directors
agreed to proceed with discussions with Trewit regarding a possible business
combination.

         On September 9, 2002, Mr. Hensley met with a representative of another
potential acquiror regarding a possible transaction with AVIDYN. The potential
acquiror was interested in acquiring both ppoONE and ValueCHECK, but did not
desire to acquire the stock of AVIDYN. On September 26, 2002, representatives of
AVIDYN and the potential acquiror met with the outside directors of AVIDYN, and
further discussed the possibility of acquiring the assets of AVIDYN. The AVIDYN
representatives informed the potential acquiror's representative that AVIDYN's
stockholders may have less advantageous tax consequences if the assets of AVIDYN
were sold instead of its stock. In October 2002, the potential acquiror
performed due diligence regarding a possible purchase of AVIDYN's assets. On
November 1, 2002, after AVIDYN had substantially completed negotiations with
Fiserv, a representative of the potential acquiror stated that no offer would be
forthcoming at that time.

         On October 3, 2002, at AVIDYN's invitation, Mr. Cox and Mr. Lockhart of
Trewit met with Mr. Hensley and the outside directors of AVIDYN to discuss the
details of a possible acquisition of, or merger with, AVIDYN, including
negotiating the price and structure of the transaction. AVIDYN's outside
directors encouraged Mr. Cox and Mr. Lockhart to submit a proposed merger
agreement for their review and consideration.

         On October 14 and 15, 2002, Mr. Cox, Mr. Lockhart, Carrie Pope,
Trewit's product manager, and Chad Gross, Trewit's chief technology officer, met
with management of AVIDYN, ppoONE and ValueCHECK and performed due diligence at
AVIDYN's offices in Dallas, Texas.

         On October 21, 2002, at a special meeting of the AVIDYN board of
directors, Mr. Kurtz made a presentation to the board regarding, and the board
discussed, the financial and business terms of the proposed transaction with
Fiserv. The presentation included an overview of Fiserv and its acquisition
strategy, Fiserv's business reputation, and significant financial information
concerning Fiserv. The board of directors and Stephanie L. McVay, AVIDYN's
senior vice president and general counsel, reviewed the terms of the proposed
merger agreement, including the price and structure of the transaction, the
"fiduciary out" provisions and the related termination fee, the balance sheet
adjustment and the definition of material adverse effect.

         At a regularly scheduled board meeting on October 31, 2002, the AVIDYN
board of directors discussed the terms of the merger, AVIDYN management answered
questions of the board regarding the merger agreement. During the meeting,
members of the board and management discussed major open issues concerning the
merger agreement.

                                      -24-

         On November 2, 2002, at a special meeting of the AVIDYN board of
directors, the board approved the final terms of the merger agreement. AVIDYN
and Fiserv signed the merger agreement after the board meeting. Both companies
issued press releases on November 4, 2002 announcing that they had reached an
agreement.

AVIDYN'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

         The healthcare information services industry in which AVIDYN operates
is highly competitive. Many of AVIDYN's competitors have greater financial,
technical and marketing resources than AVIDYN. In response to competitive
pressures, the information services industry has experienced a significant
amount of consolidation during the last several years. Also, many companies
throughout the information services industry have experienced significant
decreases in revenues and earnings growth.

         AVIDYN's board of directors and management spent considerable time
considering the changing market conditions resulting from consolidation and
economic factors in order to evaluate potential strategies for AVIDYN to expand
its market share and remain viable in an increasingly competitive market.
AVIDYN's board of directors and management considered a number of different
options and ultimately determined that, in order to remain successful, AVIDYN's
best option to improve its competitive position and provide its stockholders
with appropriate returns was to pursue a business combination with another
company. Without a business partner, the board of directors does not believe
that AVIDYN could achieve growth, given the increased competition from larger
companies in the healthcare information services industry. Due to the foregoing
business issues, AVIDYN evaluated a number of potential business combinations
and began actively marketing ppoONE for sale during the first quarter of 2002.
See "The Merger - Background of the Merger."

         AVIDYN's board of directors evaluated AVIDYN's future prospects as an
independent public company and determined that the stockholders of AVIDYN would
receive greater value in the merger than AVIDYN could create by pursuing its
existing operations. The board of directors believes that combining AVIDYN's
operations with Fiserv is a necessary step in order to maintain viability in the
healthcare information services industry. The board of directors has determined
that the benefits of the merger, including increased scale, broader client base
and a larger availability of information services, could not be replicated in a
more efficient manner. The board of directors believes the benefits of the
merger will be significant with clients demanding more integration of
information services, including the greater availability of services offered by
the combined company and Fiserv's capital resources, each of which will enable
it to better retain AVIDYN's existing clients. The board of directors also
believes the broad base of Fiserv's clients will allow AVIDYN to increase the
number and variance of its services at lower marginal costs, which will increase
the attractiveness of the combined company. For the foregoing reasons, the board
of directors believes the merger will allow the combined company to more
effectively compete in the healthcare information services industry.

         The board of directors also considered the increasing costs of AVIDYN
operating as an independent public company as a factor supporting the merger.
AVIDYN is a smaller company after selling its third party administrator and
preferred provider organization operating subsidiaries in the first quarter of
2001. However, AVIDYN still has the same costs of compliance as a public company
that it had prior to that time. In addition, the SEC's and Nasdaq's new
corporate governance rules would substantially increase AVIDYN's annual costs of
compliance. Given the current size of AVIDYN's revenues, the board of directors
determined that the costs of compliance exceed any benefit to AVIDYN
stockholders of remaining public. The board of directors considered a number of
alternatives to the merger, such as going private or selling AVIDYN's operating
subsidiaries and liquidating the company. However, the board of directors
determined that none of the available alternatives provided as much value to
AVIDYN stockholders as would be provided by the merger.

                                      -25-

         AVIDYN is proposing the merger to offer to its stockholders what the
board of directors believes to be the best opportunity available to maximize the
value of the AVIDYN common stock. The board of directors believes that the
consideration to be received by AVIDYN stockholders for the AVIDYN common stock
described in "The Merger Agreement - Consideration to be Received in the Merger"
is preferable to AVIDYN attempting to achieve a greater future share price as an
independent publicly-traded company.

         In reaching its determination to approve the merger agreement, the
merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the
AVIDYN board of directors spent considerable time exploring and analyzing the
advantages and disadvantages of the merger and the alternatives available to
AVIDYN, including remaining an independent company. In making its recommendation
to the AVIDYN stockholders, the board of directors considered the following
factors that supported the board's recommendation:

     o    The board of directors' belief that AVIDYN is unable to compete
          effectively in the increasingly competitive healthcare information
          services industry without combining with a larger organization with
          more resources;

     o    The additional capital investment in new technology and processes that
          would be required for AVIDYN's operating subsidiaries to experience
          customer and revenue growth in the foreseeable future and to stay
          competitive in the industry as an independent company, as compared to
          the return on such an investment;

     o    The costs of remaining public, including the increased costs of
          compliance related to the recent corporate governance rules proposed
          or adopted by the SEC and Nasdaq, auditing fees and directors' and
          officers' insurance;

     o    The financial condition, cash flows and results of operations of
          AVIDYN and Fiserv, on both a historical and prospective basis;

     o    Strong historical performance of market prices of Fiserv common stock;

     o    The board of directors' belief that Fiserv's competitive position in
          the industry will allow the combined company to retain existing AVIDYN
          clients and to increase the combined company's client base;

     o    The potential reduction of AVIDYN's operating costs due to economies
          of scale as a combined company;

     o    The board of directors' determination that the consideration to be
          received by the AVIDYN stockholders, and the terms and conditions of
          the merger agreement, are fair to, and in the best interests of,
          AVIDYN and its stockholders;

     o    The opportunity for AVIDYN stockholders to participate after the
          merger, as holders of Fiserv common stock, in a larger, more
          diversified and more competitive company in the healthcare information
          services industry, including the value that may be generated through
          the combination of the companies;

     o    The absence of any other viable proposal to engage in a business
          combination at the time the board of directors met to approve the
          merger agreement and the merger;

                                      -26-

     o    The board of directors' belief, after reviewing with management the
          contacts and discussions that had occurred with potential business
          partners, that the likelihood was low of receiving a proposal for a
          business combination that would be superior to Fiserv's proposal;

     o    The fact that John Ward Hunt, the largest stockholder of AVIDYN,
          entered into an agreement with Fiserv, whereby Mr. Hunt agreed to vote
          his shares of AVIDYN common stock in favor of the merger agreement and
          the merger. Because Mr. Hunt is receiving the same consideration per
          share as the other stockholders, and Mr. Hunt is not receiving any
          other special financial benefit as a result of the merger, the board
          of directors believes that his support of the merger provides evidence
          that the merger is favorable for all AVIDYN stockholders; and

     o    The fact that the merger has been structured to qualify as a tax-free
          exchange to AVIDYN's stockholders.

         The board of directors also considered the following potentially
negative factors concerning the merger:

     o    The risk that the number and value of the shares of Fiserv common
          stock to be received by AVIDYN stockholders may increase or decrease
          as a result of fluctuations in the price of Fiserv common stock and
          AVIDYN's total assets and liabilities prior to the effective time of
          the merger;

     o    The inability, subject to certain conditions, of AVIDYN to provide
          information to, or enter into discussions with, other potential
          business combination partners who might make an unsolicited proposal
          to acquire AVIDYN;

     o    The significant costs required to complete the merger, especially in
          light of the need to obtain a stockholder vote;

     o    The substantial management time and effort required to effectuate the
          merger and the related disruption to AVIDYN's operations; and

     o    The fact that some directors and executive officers of AVIDYN have
          interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to,
          those of AVIDYN stockholders generally as described under "The Merger
          - Interests of AVIDYN Directors and Officers in the Merger."

         The board of directors did not believe that the negative factors were
sufficient, either individually or collectively, to outweigh the potential
advantages of the merger. The foregoing discussion of the information and
factors considered by the board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive,
but it includes all material factors considered by the board. The board did not
attempt to quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors
it considered, and it did not determine that any factor was of particular
importance. A determination of various weightings would, in the view of the
board of directors, be impractical. In addition, individual members of the board
may have given different weight to different factors. Rather, the board of
directors viewed its position and recommendations as being based on the totality
of the information presented to, and considered by, the board.

                                      -27-

RECOMMENDATION OF THE AVIDYN BOARD OF DIRECTORS

         After careful consideration, the AVIDYN board of directors unanimously
determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the merger are advisable
and fair to, and in the best interests of, AVIDYN and its stockholders.
Accordingly, the AVIDYN board of directors unanimously approved the merger
agreement and the merger, and unanimously recommends that the stockholders of
AVIDYN vote "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the
merger.

FISERV'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

         In reaching its determination to approve the merger agreement, the
merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, the Fiserv board of
directors considered a number of factors, including the following:

     o    The board of directors' belief that the acquisition of AVIDYN will
          expand the customer base of Fiserv's Trewit division;

     o    The board of directors' belief that Fiserv's financial stability and
          reputation will encourage existing AVIDYN customers to direct more
          work to AVIDYN;

     o    The board of directors' belief that AVIDYN provides high levels of
          customer service and possesses proprietary technology, each of which
          distinguishes AVIDYN in its markets; and

     o    The board of directors' determination that the terms and conditions of
          the merger agreement, including the form and amount of consideration
          and the representations, warranties, covenants and conditions
          contained in the agreement, are in the best interests of Fiserv and
          its stockholders.

         None of the foregoing factors or groups of factors had particular
prominence in the decision of Fiserv's board of directors to approve the merger
agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, and none
was assigned any specific or relative weight.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

         The merger will be accounted for as a purchase for financial reporting
and accounting purposes, under accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase
price paid by Fiserv for AVIDYN, including direct costs of the merger, will be
allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities of AVIDYN based upon their
fair value as of the effective date of the merger, with the excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets being allocated to
goodwill. After consummation of the merger, the financial condition and results
of operations of AVIDYN will be included, but not separately reported, in the
consolidated financial statements of Fiserv.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

         THIS SUMMARY IS OF A GENERAL NATURE AND IS INCLUDED SOLELY FOR
INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES. IT IS NOT INTENDED TO BE, NOR SHOULD IT BE CONSTRUED AS
BEING, LEGAL OR TAX ADVICE. NO REPRESENTATION WITH RESPECT TO THE CONSEQUENCES
TO ANY PARTICULAR AVIDYN STOCKHOLDER IS MADE. AVIDYN STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO
CONSULT WITH THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE

                                      -28-

MERGER TO THEM IN THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF U.S.
FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN AND OTHER TAX LAWS.

         The following is a summary of the material anticipated U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the merger to AVIDYN stockholders who hold AVIDYN
common stock as a capital asset, that is, generally for investment. The summary
is based on the Internal Revenue Code, Treasury regulations issued under the
Internal Revenue Code, and administrative rulings and court decisions in effect
as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, all of which are subject to
change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. This summary is not a
complete description of all of the tax consequences of the merger and, in
particular, may not address U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to
AVIDYN stockholders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax
law, including, for example, foreign persons, financial institutions, dealers in
securities, traders in securities who elect to apply a mark-to-market method of
accounting, insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, holders who acquired their
shares of AVIDYN common stock pursuant to the exercise of an employee stock
option or right or otherwise as compensation, and stockholders who hold AVIDYN
common stock as part of a "hedge," "straddle," "constructive sale" or
"conversion transaction." In addition, no information is provided in this proxy
statement/prospectus with respect to the tax consequences of the merger under
applicable foreign, state or local laws.

          The parties have structured the merger to qualify as a reorganization
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Assuming that the merger will constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the following will be the material federal
income tax consequences of the merger:

     o    neither Fiserv nor AVIDYN will recognize any gain or loss solely as a
          result of the merger;

     o    AVIDYN stockholders who exchange their AVIDYN common stock for Fiserv
          common stock pursuant to the merger will recognize no gain or loss,
          except with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares of
          Fiserv common stock;

     o    the aggregate tax basis of the full shares of Fiserv common stock
          received and fractional shares deemed received by AVIDYN stockholders
          will equal the aggregate tax basis of the shares of AVIDYN common
          stock surrendered in exchange for the Fiserv common stock; and

     o    the holding period of the shares of Fiserv common stock received in
          the merger, including fractional shares deemed received, will include
          the holding period of the AVIDYN common stock surrendered in exchange
          for the Fiserv common stock.

         AVIDYN stockholders who receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Fiserv common stock in the merger generally will recognize a gain or loss equal
to the difference between the amount of cash received and their tax basis in
shares of AVIDYN common stock that is allocable to the fractional shares. The
gain or loss generally will be a capital gain or loss. In the case of an
individual stockholder, capital gains are subject to a maximum tax rate of 20%
if the individual held his or her AVIDYN common stock for more than one year at
the effective time of the merger. The deductibility of capital losses is subject
to limitations for both individuals and corporations.

         Neither Fiserv nor AVIDYN can provide any assurance that the Internal
Revenue Service will not challenge the conclusions stated above. Neither Fiserv
nor AVIDYN intends to obtain a ruling from the

                                      -29-

Internal Revenue Service or an opinion of tax counsel with respect to the
merger. The summary above is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or a
court.

REGULATORY MATTERS

         There are no significant federal or state regulatory requirements with
which the parties must comply and no significant federal or state regulatory
approvals that the parties must obtain in connection with the merger.

INTERESTS OF AVIDYN DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS IN THE MERGER

         In considering the recommendation of the AVIDYN board of directors with
respect to the merger agreement and merger, AVIDYN stockholders should be aware
that some directors and executive officers of AVIDYN have interests in the
merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of AVIDYN stockholders
generally. The AVIDYN board of directors was aware of these differing interests
and considered them, among other matters, in recommending that AVIDYN
stockholders adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. These interests
are described below.

Agreements to Facilitate Merger

         On November 2, 2002, John Ward Hunt, AVIDYN's chairman of the board,
WLH Family Investment, Ltd., an entity controlled by Mr. Hunt, and Burke,
Mayborn Company, Ltd., an entity controlled by Frank M. Burke, Jr., an AVIDYN
director, each entered into an agreement to facilitate the merger with Fiserv. A
copy of the form of agreement to facilitate the merger is attached as Annex B to
this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus. In the agreement, these stockholders agreed to vote all of
the shares of AVIDYN common stock that they own or for which they have voting
power at any meeting of AVIDYN stockholders, or any adjournment of the meeting,
and in any action by written consent of AVIDYN stockholders:

     o    in favor of the approval of the merger agreement, the merger and the
          other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and

     o    against any action that could reasonably be expected to impede, delay
          or discourage the merger, facilitate an acquisition of AVIDYN by a
          party other than Fiserv or result in any breach of any of AVIDYN's
          representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under the merger
          agreement.

         On the record date, these stockholders collectively beneficially owned
1,606,807 shares of AVIDYN common stock, representing approximately 44.4% of the
outstanding shares of AVIDYN common stock eligible to vote at the special
meeting. Mr. Hunt has pledged 1,000,000 shares of his AVIDYN common stock as
collateral for loans.

         Each agreement provides that it will not be deemed to restrict or limit
the stockholder's right to act in his capacity as an officer or director of
AVIDYN consistent with his fiduciary obligations in such capacity as permitted
under the merger agreement.

         Each agreement also provides that, until the earlier of effective time
of the merger or the termination of the merger agreement, the stockholder agrees
not to:

     o    solicit, initiate, consider, encourage or accept any proposals or
          offers from any person:

                                      -30-

          o    relating to the acquisition of AVIDYN's capital stock or assets;

          o    to enter into a business combination with AVIDYN; or

          o    to enter into an extraordinary business transaction relating to
               AVIDYN; or

     o    participate in any discussions or negotiations with, or furnish
          information to, or otherwise cooperate with, assist or participate in,
          facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by, any person seeking
          to do any of the foregoing.

Employment Agreements

         The merger agreement provides that it is a condition to the closing of
the merger for Joseph Hensley, the president of AVIDYN, to enter into an
amendment to his employment agreement with AVIDYN. The amendment provides for an
initial annual salary equal to Mr. Hensley's current salary of $190,000 and
participation in Fiserv's stock option plan and the management incentive plan of
a Fiserv subsidiary. The amendment also provides for a grant by Fiserv to Mr.
Hensley of an option to purchase 7,000 shares of Fiserv common stock at an
exercise price equal to the market price of a share of Fiserv common stock on
the date of grant. The amendment provides that the initial term of the amended
employment agreement will be one year with automatic annual renewals. However,
Mr. Hensley's employment will be at will and may be terminated by either party
giving fifteen days' written notice. If Mr. Hensley is terminated without cause,
then he will be entitled to severance equal to his annual base salary in effect
at the time of termination. Mr. Hensley's existing employment agreement contains
customary covenants prohibiting solicitation of employees and competition with
AVIDYN for two years after Mr. Hensley's termination.

         The merger agreement provides that it is a condition to the closing of
the merger for John Weymer, the president and chief executive officer of
ValueCHECK, to enter into an employment agreement with ValueCHECK. The
employment agreement provides for an initial annual salary equal to Mr. Weymer's
current salary of $160,000 and participation in Fiserv's stock option plan and
the management incentive plan of a Fiserv subsidiary. The employment agreement
also provides for a grant by Fiserv to Mr. Weymer of an option to purchase 3,000
shares of Fiserv common stock at an exercise price equal to the market price of
a share of Fiserv common stock on the date of grant. The initial term of the
employment agreement will be one year with automatic annual renewals. However,
Mr. Weymer's employment will be at will and may be terminated by either party by
giving fifteen days' written notice. If Mr. Weymer is terminated without cause,
then he will be entitled to severance equal to his annual base salary in effect
at the time of termination. The employment agreement contains customary
covenants prohibiting solicitation of employees and competition with ValueCHECK
for one year after Mr. Weymer's termination.

Employee Bonuses

         On October 31, 2002, the compensation committee of the AVIDYN board of
directors granted bonuses to Mr. Hensley in the amount of $40,000 and Randall D.
Kurtz, AVIDYN's chief financial officer, in the amount of $5,000. These bonuses
were based on AVIDYN's financial performance in 2002, however, they are
contingent upon and payable at the closing of the merger.

                                      -31-

Indemnification

         Fiserv and AVIDYN have agreed in the merger agreement to provide
directors and officers of AVIDYN indemnification to the fullest extent provided
by AVIDYN's certificate of incorporation and by-laws with respect to matters
occurring prior to the effective time of the merger, including the authorization
of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby until the
six-year anniversary date of the effective time of the merger.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

         The Delaware General Corporation Law grants appraisal rights in the
merger to the holders of AVIDYN common stock. Under Section 262 of the Delaware
General Corporation Law, AVIDYN stockholders may object to the merger and demand
in writing that AVIDYN pay to them the fair value of their shares of AVIDYN
common stock. Fair value takes into account all relevant factors but excludes
any appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of the applicable merger.
Stockholders who elect to exercise appraisal rights must comply with all of the
procedures set forth in Section 262 to preserve their appraisal rights. A copy
of Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which sets forth the
appraisal rights, is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement/prospectus.

         Section 262 sets forth the required procedure a stockholder requesting
appraisal must follow. Making sure that a stockholder actually perfects his or
her appraisal rights can be complicated. The procedural rules are specific and
must be followed completely. Failure to comply with the procedure set forth in
Section 262 may cause a termination of a stockholder's appraisal rights. The
following is only a summary of a stockholder's appraisal rights and the
procedure. The following information is qualified in its entirety by the
provisions of Section 262, a copy of which is attached as Annex C to this proxy
statement/prospectus. Please review Section 262 carefully for the complete
procedure. AVIDYN will not give a stockholder any notice other than as described
in this proxy statement/prospectus and as required by the Delaware General
Corporation Law.

         An AVIDYN stockholder who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must
satisfy the provisions of Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.
Section 262 requires the following:

     o    A Stockholder Must Make a Written Demand for Appraisal. A stockholder
          must deliver a written demand for appraisal to AVIDYN before the vote
          on the merger agreement is taken at the special meeting. This written
          demand for appraisal must be provided to AVIDYN separately from the
          stockholder's proxy. In other words, a vote against the merger
          agreement and the merger will not alone constitute a valid demand for
          appraisal. Additionally, this written demand must reasonably inform
          AVIDYN of the stockholder's identity and of the stockholder's
          intention to demand the appraisal of the stockholder's shares of
          AVIDYN common stock.

     o    A Stockholder Must Refrain from Voting for Adoption of the Merger
          Agreement. A stockholder must not vote for approval of the merger
          agreement. If the stockholder votes, by proxy or in person, in favor
          of the merger agreement, this will terminate the right to appraisal.
          The stockholder can also terminate the right to appraisal if the
          stockholder returns a signed proxy and either fails to vote against
          adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger or fails
          to note that the stockholder is abstaining from voting. Appraisal
          rights will be terminated even if the stockholder previously filed a
          written demand for appraisal.

                                      -32-

     o    A Stockholder Must Continuously Hold AVIDYN Shares. A stockholder must
          continuously hold his or her shares of AVIDYN common stock, from the
          date the stockholder makes the demand for appraisal through the
          effective date of the merger. If the stockholder is the record holder
          of AVIDYN common stock on the date the written demand for appraisal is
          made but thereafter transfers the shares prior to the effective date
          of the merger, the stockholder will lose any right to appraisal in
          respect of those shares. AVIDYN stockholders should read the
          paragraphs below for more details on making a demand for appraisal.

         A written demand for appraisal of AVIDYN stock is effective only if it
is signed by, or for, the stockholder of record who owns such shares at the time
the demand is made. The demand must be signed as the stockholder's name appears
on his, her or its stock certificate(s). If a stockholder is the beneficial
owner of AVIDYN common stock, but not the stockholder of record, then the
beneficial owner must have the stockholder of record sign a demand for
appraisal.

         A stockholder who owns AVIDYN common stock in a fiduciary capacity,
such as a trustee, guardian or custodian, must disclose the fact that the
stockholder is signing the demand for appraisal in that capacity.

         A stockholder who owns AVIDYN common stock with more than one person,
such as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, must have all of the owners
sign, or have signed for them, the demand for appraisal. An authorized agent,
which could include one or more of the joint owners, may sign the demand for
appraisal for a stockholder of record. However, the agent must expressly
disclose the identity of the stockholder of record and the fact that the agent
is signing the demand as that stockholder's agent.

         An AVIDYN stockholder who elects to exercise appraisal rights should
mail or deliver a written demand to:

                               AVIDYN, Inc.
                               16980 Dallas Parkway, Suite 120
                               Dallas, Texas  75248
                               Attention:  Secretary

         It is important that AVIDYN receive all written demands for appraisal
before the vote concerning the merger agreement is taken at the special meeting.
As explained above, this written demand should be signed by, or on behalf of,
the stockholder of record. The written demand for appraisal should specify the
stockholder's name and mailing address, the number of shares of stock owned, and
that the stockholder is thereby demanding appraisal of that stockholder's
shares.

         If a stockholder fails to comply with any of these conditions and the
merger becomes effective, then the stockholder will only be entitled to receive
the merger consideration provided in the merger agreement.

         Written Notice. Within ten days after the effective date of the merger,
AVIDYN must given written notice that the merger has become effective to each
stockholder who has fully complied with the conditions of Section 262.

         Petition with the Chancery Court. Within 120 days after the effective
date of the merger, either the surviving corporation or any stockholder who has
complied with the conditions of Section 262, may file a petition in the Delaware
Court of Chancery. This petition should request that the chancery court
determine the value of the shares of stock held by all of the stockholders who
are entitled to appraisal

                                      -33-

rights. If a stockholder intends to exercise rights of appraisal, then the
stockholder should file such a petition in the chancery court. AVIDYN has no
intention at this time to file such a petition. Because AVIDYN has no obligation
to file such a petition, if a stockholder does not file such a petition within
120 days after the effective date of the merger, then the stockholder will lose
his or her rights of appraisal.

         Withdrawal of Demand. If a stockholder decides he or she no longer
wants appraisal rights, then the stockholder may withdraw a demand for appraisal
rights at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger. The
stockholder may also withdraw a demand for appraisal rights after 60 days after
the effective date of the merger, but only with the written consent of AVIDYN.
If a stockholder effectively withdraws a demand for appraisal rights, then the
stockholder will receive the merger consideration provided in the merger
agreement.

         Request for Appraisal Rights Statement. If a stockholder complies with
the conditions of Section 262, then the stockholder will be entitled to receive
a statement from AVIDYN. This statement will set forth the number of shares that
have demanded appraisal rights, and the number of stockholders who own those
shares. In order to receive this statement, a stockholder must send a written
request to AVIDYN within 120 days after the effective date of the merger. After
the merger, AVIDYN has 10 days after receiving a request to mail the statement
to the stockholder.

         Chancery Court Procedures. If a stockholder properly files a petition
for appraisal in the chancery court and delivers a copy to AVIDYN, then AVIDYN
will have 20 days to provide the chancery court with a list of the names and
addresses of all stockholders who have demanded appraisal rights and have not
reached an agreement with AVIDYN as to the value of their shares. The chancery
court will then send notices to all of the stockholders who have demanded
appraisal rights. If the chancery court thinks it is appropriate, it has the
power to conduct a hearing to determine whether the stockholders have fully
complied with Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and whether
they are entitled to appraisal rights under that section. The chancery court may
also require a stockholder to submit his or her stock certificates to the
Registry in Chancery so that it can note on the certificates that an appraisal
proceeding is pending. If a stockholder does not follow the chancery court's
directions, then the stockholder may be dismissed from the proceeding.

         Appraisal of Shares. After the chancery court determines which
stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights, the chancery court will appraise
the shares of stock. To determine the fair value of the shares the chancery
court will consider all relevant factors except for any appreciation or
depreciation due to the anticipation or accomplishment of the merger. After the
chancery court determines the fair value of the shares, it will direct AVIDYN to
pay that value to the stockholders who are entitled to appraisal rights. The
chancery court can also direct AVIDYN to pay interest on the value if the
chancery court determines that the payment of interest is appropriate. In order
to receive the fair value of shares of AVIDYN common stock, a stockholder must
then surrender his or her AVIDYN stock certificates to AVIDYN.

         The chancery court could determine that the fair value of a
stockholder's shares of AVIDYN stock is more than, the same as, or less than the
merger consideration. In other words, if a stockholder demands appraisal rights,
the stockholder could receive less consideration than the stockholder would
under the merger agreement.

         Costs and Expenses of Appraisal Proceeding. The costs and expenses of
the appraisal proceeding may be assessed against AVIDYN and the stockholders
participating in the appraisal proceeding, as the chancery court deems equitable
under the circumstances. A stockholder can request that the chancery

                                      -34-

court determine the amount of interest, if any, AVIDYN should pay on the value
of common stock owned by stockholders entitled to the payment of interest. A
stockholder may also request that the chancery court allocate the expenses of
the appraisal action incurred by any stockholder pro rata against the value of
all of the shares entitled to appraisal.

         Loss of Stockholder's Rights. If a stockholder demands appraisal
rights, from and after the effective date of the merger, the stockholder will
not be entitled to:

     o    vote his or her shares of AVIDYN stock, for any purpose, for which the
          stockholder has demanded appraisal rights;

     o    receive payment of dividends or any other distribution with respect to
          such shares, except for dividends or distributions, if any, that are
          payable to holders of record as of a record date prior to the
          effective time of the merger; or

     o    receive the payment of the consideration provided for in the merger
          agreement, unless the stockholder properly withdraws the demand for
          appraisal.

         If no petition for an appraisal is filed within 120 days after the
effective date of the merger, a stockholder's right to an appraisal will cease.
A stockholder may withdraw a demand for appraisal and accept the merger
consideration by delivering to AVIDYN a written withdrawal of the demand, except
that:

     o    any attempt to withdraw a demand for appraisal made more than 60 days
          after the effective date of the merger will require the written
          approval of AVIDYN; and

     o    an appraisal proceeding in the chancery court cannot be dismissed
          unless the chancery court approves such dismissal.

         If a stockholder fails to comply strictly with the procedures described
above, then the stockholder will lose his or her appraisal rights. Consequently,
a stockholder who wishes to exercise appraisal rights is strongly urged to
consult a legal advisor before attempting to exercise appraisal rights.

         If a stockholder does not vote to adopt the merger agreement and
approve the merger and fails to properly demand appraisal rights, or if for some
reason a stockholder's right to appraisal is withdrawn or lost, the
stockholder's shares will, upon surrender as described above at the effective
time of the merger, be converted into the right to receive the applicable number
of shares of Fiserv common stock as described above.

FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS CONSEQUENCES

         All shares of Fiserv stock received by AVIDYN stockholders in the
merger who are not affiliates of AVIDYN prior to the merger will be freely
transferable. However, shares of Fiserv stock received by persons who are deemed
to be affiliates of AVIDYN prior to the merger may be resold by them only in
transactions permitted by the resale provisions of Rule 145 promulgated under
the Securities Act of 1933, or Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act in
the case of such persons who become affiliates of Fiserv, or as otherwise
permitted under the Securities Act. Persons deemed to be affiliates of AVIDYN
are those individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under
common control with, AVIDYN. Affiliates generally include executive officers and
directors of AVIDYN as well as certain principal stockholders of AVIDYN. This
proxy statement/prospectus does not cover any resales of Fiserv common stock
received by affiliates of AVIDYN in the merger.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

         This section is a summary of the material terms and provisions of the
merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this proxy
statement/prospectus and incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus. The following description is not intended to be a complete
description of all the terms of the merger agreement. You should refer to the
full text of the merger agreement for details of the merger and the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement. You should carefully read the entire merger
agreement for the precise terms of the merger agreement and other information
that may be important to you.

THE MERGER

         The merger agreement provides that, at the effective time of the
merger, Fiserv Merger Sub, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fiserv, will merge with
and into AVIDYN. AVIDYN will be the surviving corporation in the merger and will
become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fiserv.

COMPLETION OF THE MERGER

         The merger will become effective at 11:59 p.m. on the day the parties
file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, unless Fiserv and AVIDYN agree to specify a later time in the
certificate of merger. The parties will file the certificate of merger with the
Delaware Secretary of State as soon as practicable after all conditions to the
merger are fulfilled or waived, unless the merger agreement has been terminated.

CONSIDERATION TO BE RECEIVED IN THE MERGER

         At the effective time of the merger, each share of AVIDYN common stock
then issued and outstanding (other than shares subject to properly exercised
appraisal rights or owned by AVIDYN or Fiserv or their respective subsidiaries,
if any) will be converted into the right to receive a fraction of a share of
Fiserv common stock as determined based on a formula contained in the merger
agreement, which includes an adjustment based upon the net assets of AVIDYN at
the effective time of the merger as agreed upon by the parties. Under this
formula, holders of AVIDYN common stock will receive, in exchange for each of
their outstanding shares of AVIDYN common stock, a fraction of a share of Fiserv
common stock equal to:

     o    $10.5 million, divided by

     o    the number of shares of AVIDYN common stock outstanding immediately
          before the effective time of the merger, divided by

     o    the average closing price for Fiserv common stock for the twenty
          business days ending two business days prior to the effective time of
          the merger;

provided that the $10.5 million amount used in the above calculation will be
increased or decreased by the difference between (1) the total assets of AVIDYN
less the total liabilities of AVIDYN at the effective time of the merger, and
(2) $6.8 million, unless the difference is less than $25,000, in which case no
adjustment to the $10.5 million amount will be made.

         At least ten calendar days prior to the date on which the parties
anticipate the effective time of the merger will occur, AVIDYN will deliver to
Fiserv what it believes to be the balance sheet of AVIDYN as of the effective
time of the merger for purposes of determining the total assets of AVIDYN less
the total

                                      -36-

liabilities of AVIDYN in the formula above. The parties will then proceed in
good faith to finalize, and agree upon, such balance sheet. The balance sheet of
AVIDYN as of the effective time for purposes of this calculation will include,
to the extent unpaid as of the effective time of the merger, an accrual for all
of the costs associated with the merger incurred directly by AVIDYN, provided
that the parties shall agree on a pro rata share of costs for printing and
mailing of materials to AVIDYN stockholders. The bonuses to be paid to certain
executives of AVIDYN as described under "The Merger - Interests of AVIDYN
Directors and Officers in the Merger - Employee Bonuses" will also reduce
AVIDYN's net assets by $45,000.

         Based on the average closing price for Fiserv common stock of $
for the twenty business days ending two business days prior to the date of this
proxy statement/prospectus and the 3,620,092 shares of AVIDYN common stock
outstanding on the record date, you would receive       shares of Fiserv common
stock for each share of your AVIDYN common stock in the merger. This estimate
assumes no adjustment based upon the net assets of AVIDYN and is intended only
to illustrate the calculation of the merger consideration. This per share number
is not likely to be the actual number of shares of Fiserv common stock AVIDYN
stockholders will receive in the merger for each share of AVIDYN common stock
because the actual number of shares of Fiserv common stock issuable in the
merger will be a function of the closing sale price for Fiserv common stock for
the twenty business days ending two business days prior to the effective time of
the merger and AVIDYN's total assets less total liabilities at the effective
time of the merger.

         Fiserv and AVIDYN cannot provide any assurance as to the market price
of Fiserv common stock at any time prior to the effective time of the merger or
the amount by which total assets of AVIDYN will exceed total liabilities of
AVIDYN for purposes of the formula above. Fiserv and AVIDYN encourage AVIDYN
stockholders to obtain current stock price quotations for Fiserv common stock
from a newspaper, the Internet or their broker. See "Risk Factors - The number
of shares of Fiserv common stock that AVIDYN stockholders will receive in the
merger will fluctuate due to the formula under the merger agreement."

         The actual number of shares of Fiserv common stock issuable in the
merger will not be determined until after the close of business on the second
business day before the special meeting of AVIDYN stockholders. Fiserv and
AVIDYN expect to notify AVIDYN stockholders of the number of shares of Fiserv
common stock that will be received for shares of AVIDYN common stock pursuant to
the formula above before the date of the AVIDYN special meeting by issuing a
press release and filing it with the SEC. See "Risk Factors - The number of
shares of Fiserv common stock that AVIDYN stockholders will receive in the
merger will not be determined until shortly before the special meeting."

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

         Promptly after the effective time of the merger, EquiServe Trust
Company, N.A., as exchange agent, will mail to each stockholder of AVIDYN a
letter of transmittal containing instructions for the surrender of certificates
representing shares of AVIDYN common stock in exchange for certificates
representing Fiserv common stock. HOLDERS OF AVIDYN COMMON STOCK SHOULD NOT
RETURN THEIR CERTIFICATES WITH THE ENCLOSED PROXY CARD AND SHOULD NOT SEND THEIR
CERTIFICATES UNTIL THEY RECEIVE A LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL FROM THE EXCHANGE AGENT.

         AVIDYN stockholders who surrender their stock certificates, together
with a properly completed letter of transmittal, will receive stock certificates
representing the shares of Fiserv common stock into which their shares of AVIDYN
common stock were converted in the merger. After the merger, each certificate
previously representing shares of AVIDYN common stock will only represent the
right to

                                      -37-

receive the shares of Fiserv common stock into which AVIDYN common stock have
been converted (and cash in lieu of fractional shares).

FRACTIONAL SHARES

         No fractional shares of Fiserv common stock will be issued in the
merger. Instead, Fiserv will deposit with EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., the
exchange agent, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Fiserv common
stock. From the deposited funds, the exchange agent will pay each holder of
shares of AVIDYN common stock otherwise entitled to receive a fractional share
of Fiserv common stock a cash payment, without interest, in an amount equal to
the fractional share of Fiserv common stock to which the holder would otherwise
be entitled multiplied by the average closing price per share for Fiserv common
stock reported on the Nasdaq National Market for the twenty business days ending
two days prior to the effective time of the merger.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         In the merger agreement, Fiserv and AVIDYN have each made
representations and warranties with respect to, among other things:

     o    corporate matters, including organization, corporate power and good
          standing;

     o    capitalization of the parties;

     o    authorization, execution, delivery and enforceability of the merger

     o    absence of a material adverse effect;

     o    matters relating to the tax-free status of the merger; and

     o    brokers' and finders' fees with respect to the merger.

         In addition, AVIDYN has made representations and warranties to Fiserv
with respect to, among other things:

     o    absence of certain changes or events;

     o    title to AVIDYN's properties and the absence of liens and
          encumbrances;

     o    material contracts;

                                      -38-

     o    minute and stock books;

     o    tax matters;

     o    related party transactions; and

     o    required approvals for the merger agreement and the merger.

CONDUCT OF AVIDYN'S BUSINESS PRIOR TO THE MERGER

         AVIDYN has agreed that, except as otherwise contemplated by the
agreement, AVIDYN, including its subsidiaries, will conduct its operations in
its ordinary and usual course of business. AVIDYN has also agreed to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to preserve its business organization, retain
its officers and employees and maintain existing relationships with licensors,
suppliers, distributors, customers and others with whom it does business.

NO SOLICITATION

         Except as described below in this section, AVIDYN has agreed that it
will not, and will cause its subsidiaries and their officers, directors,
employees, financial advisors, counsel, representatives and agents not to:

     o    directly or indirectly solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate the
          making of an acquisition proposal;

     o    participate or engage in or encourage negotiations or discussions
          with, or provide any nonpublic information to, any person relating to
          an acquisition proposal, or which may reasonably be expected to lead
          to an acquisition proposal; or

     o    agree to or endorse any acquisition proposal.

                                      -39-

         The merger agreement provides that these restrictions will not prohibit
AVIDYN or its board of directors from taking and disclosing to AVIDYN's
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 or from making any disclosure to AVIDYN's stockholders that in the
good faith judgment of AVIDYN's board of directors is required by its fiduciary
duties to its stockholders or otherwise under applicable law.

         An "acquisition proposal" is an offer or proposal for:

     o    a transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which

          o    any person who does not currently own 15% or more of the
               outstanding shares of AVIDYN common stock acquires 15% or more of
               the outstanding shares of AVIDYN common stock, including a tender
               offer or an exchange offer which, if completed, would result in
               any such person acquiring 15% or more of the outstanding shares
               of AVIDYN common stock; or

          o    any person who currently owns more than 15% of the outstanding
               shares of AVIDYN common stock acquires 50% or more of the
               outstanding shares of AVIDYN common stock, including a tender
               offer or an exchange offer which, if completed, would result in
               any such person acquiring 50% or more of the outstanding shares
               of AVIDYN common stock; or

     o    a merger or other business combination involving AVIDYN pursuant to
          which:

          o    any person who does not currently own 15% or more of the
               outstanding shares of AVIDYN common stock acquires securities
               representing 15% or more of the aggregate voting power of all
               outstanding securities of the company surviving the merger or
               business combination; or

          o    any person who currently owns more than 15% of the outstanding
               shares of AVIDYN common stock acquires securities representing
               50% or more of the aggregate voting power of all outstanding
               securities of the company surviving the merger or business
               combination; or

     o    any other transaction pursuant to which any person or entity acquires
          control of assets, including the outstanding equity securities of any
          AVIDYN subsidiary, having a fair market value equal to 15% or more of
          the fair market value of all of the assets of AVIDYN immediately prior
          to such a transaction.

         However, the merger agreement does not prohibit AVIDYN's board of
directors from, prior to obtaining stockholder approval of the merger,
furnishing nonpublic information to or entering into discussions or negotiations
with any person that makes an unsolicited superior proposal if:

     o    in the good faith judgment of AVIDYN's board of directors, the board
          is required by its fiduciary duties to its stockholders or otherwise
          under applicable law to provide such information or enter into such

          modifications to such terms.

         In addition, AVIDYN has agreed that it will notify Fiserv within two
business days if it or its representatives receives an acquisition proposal or
if any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued
concerning an acquisition proposal.

AVIDYN board of directors has in good faith determined, after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside counsel, to be more favorable to AVIDYN
stockholders than the merger.

               fulfill any obligation under the merger agreement or material

               complete the merger;

          o    any court or governmental body has issued a final nonappealable
               order, decree or ruling permanently restraining or enjoining the

                                      -43-

     o    by Fiserv if:

          o    the board of directors of AVIDYN has recommended to the
               stockholders or entered into an agreement regarding a superior
               proposal;

          o    the board of directors of AVIDYN has withdrawn or modified in a

               obligations under the merger agreement and Fiserv has not
               materially breached its obligations under the merger agreement;
               and

     o    by AVIDYN if:

          o    prior to the AVIDYN stockholders approving the merger agreement
               and the merger, if AVIDYN has not materially breached its

               above, any offer that the AVIDYN board of directors reasonably
               and in good faith determines, after consultation with its legal
               and financial advisors, is at least as favorable to AVIDYN's
               stockholders as the superior proposal; or

          o    Fiserv has materially breached any of its covenants or
               obligations under the merger agreement and AVIDYN has not
               materially breached its obligations under the merger agreement.

EFFECT OF TERMINATION

         If the merger agreement is terminated, then the merger agreement will
be void and have no effect, without any liability on the part of any party,
except that no termination of the merger agreement will relieve any party from
liability for any breach of the merger agreement and AVIDYN may have to pay
Fiserv a termination fee as described below.

TERMINATION PAYMENT; EXPENSES

         AVIDYN must pay Fiserv a termination fee of $400,000 plus all fees and
expenses of Fiserv incurred in connection with the preparation of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement if the merger agreement is
terminated:

     o    by Fiserv because the board of directors of AVIDYN has recommended to
          the stockholders or entered into an agreement regarding a superior
          proposal;

     o    by Fiserv because the board of directors of AVIDYN has withdrawn or
          modified in a manner adverse to Fiserv its recommendation of the
          merger;

     o    by AVIDYN if, prior to the AVIDYN stockholders approving the merger
          agreement and the merger, AVIDYN has not materially breached its

          notifies Fiserv that AVIDYN intends to enter into such a binding
          agreement and Fiserv does not make, within five days of receiving the
          notice described above, any offer that the AVIDYN board of directors
          reasonably and in good faith determines, after consultation with its
          legal and financial advisors, is at least as favorable to AVIDYN's
          stockholders as the superior proposal; or

     o    by Fiserv because AVIDYN has materially breached any of its covenants
          or obligations under the merger agreement and Fiserv has not
          materially breached its obligations under the merger agreement and
          within twelve months AVIDYN has entered into a transaction in
          connection with an acquisition proposal.

AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

         The merger agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by all of the parties.

         At any time prior to the effective time of the merger, any party to the
merger agreement may:

     o    extend the time for performance of any of the obligations or other
          acts of the other parties;

     o    waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties in the
          merger agreement or any document delivered pursuant to the merger
          agreement; or

     o    waive compliance with any agreement or condition contained in the
          merger agreement, to the extent permitted by law.

         Any such extension or waiver will only be valid if it is set forth in a
written instrument signed by the party to be bound.

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT

         As an inducement to Fiserv to enter the merger agreement, John Ward
Hunt, AVIDYN's chairman of the board, entered into an indemnification agreement
with Fiserv on November 2, 2002, pursuant to which Mr. Hunt agreed to indemnify
Fiserv against any liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs and expenses,
including attorneys' and court fees, resulting from:

     o    the repurchase by AVIDYN of any of its capital stock prior to the date
          of the indemnification agreement; and

     o    any breach of AVIDYN's representations in the merger agreement
          regarding the absence of undisclosed liabilities.

         Fiserv will not be entitled to recover indemnification for a breach of
AVIDYN's representations regarding the absence of undisclosed liabilities unless
Mr. Hunt has received written notice of the claim or of any pending or
threatened claim within six months after the effective time of the merger.
Fiserv will be entitled to recover indemnification with respect to repurchases
by AVIDYN of its capital stock until the expiration of all applicable statutes
of limitation pertaining to these claims. Fiserv may not seek indemnification
from Mr. Hunt until the aggregate amount of all Fiserv losses exceeds $300,000,
after which Mr. Hunt will be liable for all such losses, including the initial
$300,000. However, in no event will Mr. Hunt be obligated to make
indemnification payments to Fiserv in excess of $2,500,000.

                                      -45-

                       DESCRIPTION OF FISERV CAPITAL STOCK

         As a result of the conversion of shares of AVIDYN common stock to
shares of Fiserv common stock at the completion of the merger, AVIDYN
stockholders will become Fiserv stockholders. Your rights as a Fiserv
stockholder will be governed by Wisconsin law and Fiserv's articles of
incorporation and by-laws. The following summarizes the material terms of
Fiserv's capital stock but does not purport to be complete, and is subject in
all respects to Wisconsin law, Fiserv's articles of incorporation and by-laws
and Fiserv's rights agreement. See "Comparison of Stockholder Rights" and "Where
You Can Find More Information."

FISERV COMMON STOCK

         Fiserv is authorized to issue 300,000,000 shares of Fiserv common
stock. As of       , 2002,          shares of Fiserv common stock were issued
and outstanding, held by approximately       holders of record.

         Holders of Fiserv common stock are entitled to one vote per share on
all matters properly submitted to a vote of stockholders, subject to Section
180.1150 of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law. See "Comparison of
Stockholder Rights - Anti-Takeover Provisions - Control Share Acquisitions."
Fiserv stockholders do not have the right to cumulate their votes in the
election of directors. For that reason, holders of a majority of the shares of
Fiserv common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors may elect all
of the directors standing for election.

         Fiserv common stock does not entitle its holders to any preemptive
rights, redemption privileges, sinking fund privileges or conversion rights. In
the event of liquidation, holders of Fiserv common stock would be entitled to
receive proportionately any assets legally available for distribution to
stockholders of Fiserv with respect to shares held by them, subject to any prior
rights of any Fiserv preferred stock then outstanding. See " - Fiserv Preferred
Stock."

         Fiserv stockholders are entitled to receive the dividends or
distributions that the Fiserv board of directors may declare out of funds
legally available for these payments. The payment of distributions to
stockholders is subject to any prior rights of preferred stock then outstanding.
See " - Fiserv Preferred Stock."

         All of the issued and outstanding shares of Fiserv common stock are,
and upon the issuance of Fiserv common stock in connection with the merger will
be, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable except for possible assessment
in limited circumstances required by Wisconsin law. See "Comparison of
Stockholder Rights - Assessability."

FISERV PREFERRED STOCK

         Fiserv is authorized to issue 25,000,000 shares of Fiserv preferred
stock. As of the date of this document, no shares of Fiserv preferred stock were
outstanding.

         The Fiserv board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock in
one or more series and, with respect to each series, to fix:

     o    the voting rights, if any;

     o    the designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights with
          respect to the rate of dividend;

                                      -46-

     o    the price, the terms and conditions of redemption;

     o    the amounts payable in the event of voluntary or involuntary
          liquidation;

     o    the sinking fund provisions; and

     o    the conversion privileges, if any.

The Fiserv board of directors may also assign to any series of preferred stock
any other terms, conditions, restrictions, limitations, rights and privileges
that it deems appropriate in accordance with Wisconsin law.

         In connection with the issuance of the rights described below, the
Fiserv board of directors has authorized a series of preferred stock designated
as series A junior participating preferred stock. Shares of series A junior
participating preferred stock purchasable upon the exercise of the rights will
not be redeemable. Each share of series A junior participating preferred stock
will be entitled to an aggregate dividend of 225 times the dividend Fiserv
declares per share of its common stock. In the event of Fiserv's liquidation,
the holders of the shares of series A junior participating preferred stock will
be entitled to a minimum aggregate payment of $1.00 per share but will be
entitled to an aggregate payment of 225 times the payment Fiserv makes per share
of its common stock. Each share of series A junior participating preferred stock
will have 225 votes, voting together with Fiserv common stock. Finally, in the
event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which shares of
Fiserv common stock are exchanged, each share of series A junior participating
preferred stock will be entitled to receive 225 times the amount received per
share of Fiserv common stock. These rights are protected by customary
antidilution provisions. There are no shares of series A junior participating
preferred stock currently outstanding.

         The issuance of any series of Fiserv preferred stock, including the
series A junior participating preferred stock, may have an adverse effect on the
rights of holders of Fiserv common stock, and could decrease the amount of
earnings and assets available for distribution to holders of Fiserv common
stock. In addition, any issuance of Fiserv preferred stock could have the effect
of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control.

FISERV RIGHTS PLAN

         Fiserv has entered into a rights agreement pursuant to which each
outstanding share of its common stock, including the shares AVIDYN stockholders
will receive in the merger, has attached one right to purchase shares of Fiserv
series A junior participating preferred stock. Each share of common stock
subsequently issued by Fiserv prior to the expiration of the rights agreement
will likewise have attached one right. Under circumstances described below, the
rights will entitle the holder thereof to purchase additional shares of Fiserv
common stock. In this proxy statement/prospectus, unless the context otherwise
requires, all references to our common stock include the accompanying rights.

         Currently, the rights are not exercisable and trade with Fiserv common
stock. If the rights become exercisable, each right, unless held by a person or
group which beneficially owns more than 15% of Fiserv outstanding common stock
in the aggregate, will initially entitle the holder to purchase 4/9 of one
one-hundredth of a share of Fiserv series A junior participating preferred stock
at a purchase price of $250, subject to adjustment. The rights will only become
exercisable if a person or group has acquired, or announced an intention to
acquire, 15% or more of Fiserv outstanding common stock in the aggregate. Under
some circumstances, including the existence of a 15% acquiring party, each
holder of a right, other than the acquiring party, will be entitled to purchase
at the right's then-current exercise price, shares of Fiserv common stock having
a market value of two times the exercise price. If another corporation

                                      -47-

acquires Fiserv after a party acquires 15% or more of Fiserv common stock, each
holder of a right will be entitled to receive the acquiring corporation's common
shares having a market value of two times the exercise price. The rights
generally may be redeemed at a price of $.01 until a party acquires 15% or more
of Fiserv common stock, and after that time may be exchanged for one share of
Fiserv common stock per right until a party acquires 50% or more of Fiserv
common stock. The rights initially will expire on February 23, 2008. The rights
do not have voting or dividend rights and, until they become exercisable, have
no dilutive effect on Fiserv earnings.

TRANSFER AGENT, REGISTRAR AND EXCHANGE AGENT

       EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. is the transfer agent and registrar for the
Fiserv common stock. EquiServe is also the exchange agent for the merger.

                                      -48-

                        COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS

         The rights of Fiserv stockholders are currently governed by the
Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, or WBCL, and Fiserv's articles of
incorporation and by-laws. The rights of AVIDYN stockholders are currently
governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, and AVIDYN's
certificate of incorporation and by-laws. Upon completion of the merger, the
stockholders of AVIDYN will become stockholders of Fiserv, and the WBCL and
Fiserv's articles of incorporation and by-laws will govern the rights of former
AVIDYN stockholders.

         The following description summarizes the material differences between
the rights of holders of Fiserv common stock and the rights of holders of AVIDYN
common stock. This discussion is not, and does not purport to be, complete or to
identify all differences that may, under given situations, be material to
stockholders. Stockholders should read carefully the relevant portions of the
WBCL, Fiserv's articles of incorporation and by-laws, the DGCL and AVIDYN's
certificate of incorporation and by-laws. Although the WBCL uses the term
"shareholder" to reference holders of stock of a Wisconsin corporation, for
consistency, those holders are referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as
"stockholders."

                                     AVIDYN Stockholder Rights                           Fiserv Stockholder Rights

                              CONVERSION OF SHARES

         SECTION 3.01  CONVERSION OF SHARES.

                  (a) Upon the Effective Time, each share of Company Common
         Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
         (other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant
         to Section 3.01(b) and any Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter defined))
         shall, without any further action on the part of Fiserv or Fiserv Sub,
         on the one hand, or the Company or its stockholders, on the other hand,
         be converted into the right to receive such number of shares of Fiserv
         Common Stock as shall equal the quotient of (A) (I) the Target Value
         (as hereinafter defined) divided by (II) the number of shares of
         Company Common Stock outstanding immediately before the Effective Time
         divided by (B) a number which is equal to the average closing price per
         share for Fiserv Common Stock as reported on the National Market System
         by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated
         Quotations (as reported in The Wall Street Journal) for the twenty
         business days ending two business days prior to the Effective Time
         (such shares of Fiserv Common Stock together with any cash payable
         pursuant to Section 3.03(f) the "Merger Consideration"). "Target Value"
         means the amount of Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand and No/100
         Dollars ($10,500,000.00) increased or decreased by the amount, if any,
         between i) the total assets of the Company as of the Effective Time
         less the total liabilities of the Company as of the Effective Time, as
         determined by reference to the Effective Time Balance Sheet, and ii)
         Six Million Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars ($6,800,000); provided,
         however that no such adjustment shall be made if the adjustment would
         result in increasing or decreasing the Target Value by less then
         $25,000. "Effective Time Balance Sheet" means a balance sheet of the
         Company as of the Effective Time prepared in accordance with GAAP
         consistently applied in accordance with past practices, which balance
         sheet shall include,

                                      A-3

         to the extent unpaid as of the Effective Time, an accrual for all
         Company Merger Costs, it being understood that the Effective Time
         Balance Sheet will be prepared prior to the Effective Time and may
         therefore may be based, to the extent required, on good faith estimates
         by Fiserv, Trewit Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Fiserv ("Trewit")
         and the Company. "Company Merger Costs" shall mean the aggregate of all
         accounting (which shall not include regular audit fees), legal,
         printing, filing, financial advisory (including finders' or investment
         banking fees), costs of preparing, filing and distributing the Proxy
         Statement (as hereinafter defined) and conducting the Company Special
         Meeting (as hereinafter defined) and other fees and expenses of the
         Company and Taxes (as hereinafter defined) of the Company, in each case
         incurred or anticipated to be incurred in connection with the
         transactions contemplated hereby. Such Company Merger Costs shall only
         include those costs incurred by the Company directly, or to the extent
         they involve the printing and mailing of materials to shareholders on
         behalf of both the Company and Fiserv, a prorata share of such costs as
         the Parties shall agree at Closing.

                  (b) All shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Company or
         any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company or Fiserv
         or Fiserv Sub or any other subsidiary of Fiserv immediately prior to
         the Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without any
         conversion thereof.

                  (c) Each share of common stock of Fiserv Sub, par value $.01
         per share ("Fiserv Sub Common Stock"), issued and outstanding
         immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one
         share of the common stock of the Surviving Corporation, par value $.01
         per share ("Surviving Corporation Common Stock").

                  (d) Each share of any other class of capital stock of the
         Company (other than Company Common Stock) shall be canceled without
         payment of any consideration therefor and without any conversion
         thereof.

         SECTION 3.02  Intentionally Omitted.

         SECTION 3.03  EXCHANGE OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK.

                  (a) Promptly after the Effective Time, Fiserv shall cause
         Fiserv's stock transfer agent or such other person as Fiserv may
         appoint to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") to mail to each
         holder of record (other than Fiserv, Fiserv Sub or any other subsidiary
         of Fiserv or the Company) of a certificate or certificates that
         immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares
         of Company Common Stock ("Company Certificates") (i) a form letter of
         transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effective, and
         risk of loss and title to the Company Certificate(s) shall pass, only
         upon delivery of the Company Certificate(s) to the Exchange Agent) and
         (ii) instructions for such holder's use in effecting the surrender of
         the Company Certificates in exchange for certificates representing
         shares of Fiserv Common Stock.

                  (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the
         Exchange Agent shall distribute to holders of shares of Company Common
         Stock, upon surrender to the

                                      A-4

         Exchange Agent of one or more Company Certificates for cancellation,
         together with a duly-executed letter of transmittal, (i) one or more
         Fiserv certificates representing the number of whole shares of Fiserv
         Common Stock into which the shares represented by the Company
         Certificate(s) shall have been converted pursuant to Section 3.01, and
         (ii) a bank check in the amount of cash into which the shares
         represented by the Company Certificate(s) shall have been converted
         pursuant to Section 3.03(f) (relating to fractional shares), and the
         Company Certificate(s) so surrendered shall be canceled. In the event
         of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not
         registered in the transfer records of the Company, it shall be a
         condition to the issuance of shares of Fiserv Common Stock that the
         Company Certificate(s) so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or be
         otherwise in proper form for transfer and that such transferee shall
         (i) pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required, or
         (ii) establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax
         has been paid or is not payable.

                  (c) Holders of Company Common Stock will be entitled to any
         dividends or other distributions pertaining to the Fiserv Common Stock
         received in exchange therefor that become payable to persons who are
         holders of record of Fiserv Common Stock as of a record date on the
         same date as or after the Effective Time, but only after they have
         surrendered their Company Certificates for exchange. Subject to the
         effect, if any, of applicable law, the Exchange Agent shall receive,
         hold, and remit any such dividends or other distributions to each such
         record holder entitled thereto, without interest, at the time that such
         Company Certificates are surrendered to the Exchange Agent for
         exchange. Holders of Company Common Stock will not be entitled,
         however, to dividends or other distributions that become payable before
         or after the Effective Time to persons who were holders of record of
         Fiserv Common Stock as of a record date that is prior to the Effective
         Time.

                  (d) All shares of Fiserv Common Stock issued upon the
         surrender for exchange of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
         terms hereof (including any cash paid for fractional shares pursuant to
         Section 3.03(f) hereof) shall be deemed to have been issued in full
         satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common
         Stock.

                  (e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
         registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
         Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
         immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
         Company Certificates representing such shares are presented to the
         Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
         in this Article III. As of the Effective Time, the holders of Company
         Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to
         have any rights as stockholders of the Company, except such rights, if
         any, as they may have pursuant to Delaware Law. Except as provided
         above, until such Company Certificates are surrendered for exchange,
         each such Company Certificate shall, after the Effective Time,
         represent for all purposes only the right to receive the number of
         whole shares of Fiserv Common Stock into which the shares of Company
         Common Stock shall have been converted pursuant to the Merger as

                                      A-5

         provided in Section 3.01 hereof and the right to receive the cash value
         of any fraction of a share of Fiserv Common Stock as provided in
         Section 3.03(f) hereof.

                  (f) No fractional shares of Fiserv Common Stock and no
         certificates or scrip therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof,
         shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company
         Certificates, no dividend or other distribution of Fiserv shall relate
         to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not
         entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of
         Fiserv. All fractional shares of Fiserv Common Stock to which a holder
         of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time would
         otherwise be entitled, at the Effective Time, shall be aggregated if
         and to the extent multiple Company Certificates of such holder are
         submitted together to the Exchange Agent. If a fractional share results
         from such aggregation, then (in lieu of such fractional share) the
         Exchange Agent shall pay to each holder of shares of Company Common
         Stock who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share
         of Fiserv Common Stock an amount of cash (without interest) determined
         by multiplying (i) the fractional share of Fiserv Common Stock to which
         such holder would otherwise be entitled, by (ii) the amount which is
         equal to the average closing price per share for Fiserv Common Stock as
         reported on the National Market System by the National Association of
         Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotations (as reported in The Wall
         Street Journal) for the twenty business days ending two business days
         prior to the Effective Time. Fiserv will make available to the Exchange
         Agent any cash necessary for this purpose.

                  (g) In the event any Company Certificate shall have been lost,
         stolen, or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for
         such lost, stolen, or destroyed Company Certificate, upon the making of
         an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Fiserv
         Common Stock and cash for fractional shares, if any, as may be required
         pursuant to Section 3.01 and 3.03(f); provided, however, that Fiserv
         may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance
         thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen, or destroyed Company
         Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as Fiserv may direct as
         indemnity against any claim that may be made against Fiserv or the
         Exchange Agent with respect to such Company Certificates alleged to
         have been lost, stolen, or destroyed.

                  (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
         3.03, none of Fiserv or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to a
         holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid
         to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
         escheat or similar law.

         SECTION 3.04 EXCHANGE OF FISERV SUB COMMON STOCK. From and after the
Effective Time, each outstanding certificate previously representing shares of
Fiserv Sub Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to evidence ownership
of and to represent the number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock
into which such shares of Fiserv Sub Common Stock shall have been converted.
Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall issue to
Fiserv a stock certificate or certificates representing such shares of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock in exchange for the certificate or certificates that
formerly represented shares of Fiserv Sub Common Stock, which shall be canceled.

                                      A-6

         SECTION 3.05  DISSENTING SHARES.

                  (a) NO CONVERSION. Notwithstanding any provision of this
         Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock held by a
         stockholder who has demanded and perfected appraisal rights for such
         shares in accordance with Delaware Law, including ss.262 of the
         Delaware Law, and who has not effectively withdrawn or lost such
         appraisal rights ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or
         represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
         Section 3.01(a) and 3.03(f), but the holder thereof shall only be
         entitled to such rights as are granted by Delaware Law.

                  (b) WITHDRAWAL OR LOSS OF DISSENTERS' RIGHTS. Notwithstanding
         the provisions of subsection (a), if any holder of shares of Company
         Common Stock who is otherwise entitled to exercise appraisal rights
         under Delaware Law shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure
         to perfect or otherwise) such appraisal rights, then, as of the later
         of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such
         stockholder's shares shall automatically be converted into and
         represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
         interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate representing such
         shares.

                  (c) NOTICE, ETC. The Company shall give Fiserv and Trewit (i)
         prompt notice of any written demands for the exercise of appraisal
         rights in respect of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of
         such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law
         (including instruments concerning appraisal or dissenters' rights) and
         received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
         negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company
         shall not, except with the prior written consent of Fiserv and Trewit,
         voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for the
         exercise of appraisal rights in respect of any shares of Company Common
         Stock or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

         SECTION 3.06 CLOSING. Evidence of the fulfillment or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VII hereof (the "Closing") shall be provided by
the parties hereto to each other (a) at the offices of AVIDYN, Inc. located at
16980 Dallas Parkway, Suite 120, Dallas, Texas at 10 a.m., local time, on the
business day on which the last of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof
is fulfilled or waived or (b) at such other time and place as the parties hereto
may agree.

         SECTION 3.07 TAX FREE EXCHANGE. The parties intend that the Merger
qualifies as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 368(a)(1)(A) and
(a)(2)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

                                      A-7

                                   ARTICLE IV
                          CERTAIN EFFECTS OF THE MERGER

         SECTION 4.01 EFFECT OF THE MERGER. Upon and after the Effective Time:
(a) Fiserv Sub shall merge with and into the Surviving Corporation; (b) the
separate existence of Fiserv Sub shall cease; (c) the shares of capital stock of
the Company shall be converted as provided in this Agreement; (d) the former
holders of such shares are entitled only to the rights provided in this
Agreement and under Delaware Law and (e) the Merger shall otherwise have the
effect provided under the applicable laws of the State of Delaware.

         SECTION 4.02 FURTHER ASSURANCES. If at any time after the Effective
Time the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further
deeds, assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary,
desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in
the Surviving Corporation, the title to any property or right of the Constituent
Corporations acquired or to be acquired by reason of, or as a result of, the
Merger, or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the
Constituent Corporations agree that the Surviving Corporation and its proper
officers and directors shall and will execute and deliver all such property,
deeds, assignments and assurances in law and do all acts necessary, desirable or
proper to vest, perfect or confirm title to such property or rights in the
Surviving Corporation and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement,
and that the proper officers and directors of the Constituent Corporations and
the proper officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully
authorized in the name of the Constituent Corporations or otherwise to take any
and all such action.

                                    ARTICLE V
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         SECTION 5.01 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY. Except as
otherwise set forth in the Disclosure Schedule (the "Disclosure Schedule")
annexed hereto as Schedule I, the Company represents and warrants to, and agrees
with, Fiserv and Fiserv Sub as follows:

                  (a) ORGANIZATION AND QUALIFICATION, ETC. The Company is a
         corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
         the laws of the State of Delaware, has corporate power and authority to
         own all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it
         is now being conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and is in
         good standing in each other jurisdiction as set forth in the Disclosure
         Schedule where the failure to so qualify would have a Material Adverse
         Effect (as hereinafter defined). The copies of the Company's
         Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws, as amended to date, which
         have been delivered to Fiserv and Trewit, are complete and correct, and
         such instruments, as so amended, are in full force and effect at the
         date hereof.

                  "Material Adverse Effect" for purposes of this Agreement when
         used with respect to any party means any change in, or effect on, or
         series of related changes in, or related effects on, the business of
         such party as currently conducted by such party and its subsidiaries,
         taken as a whole, that would have an adverse impact on the results of
         its operations or financial or other condition of an amount in excess
         of $175,000 other than

                                      A-8

         such changes or effects generally affecting the industry of such party
         and its subsidiaries or the economy of the United States.

                  (b) CAPITAL STOCK.

                           (i) The authorized capital stock of the Company
                  consists of 8,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and
                  4,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.10 per share
                  (the "Preferred Stock"), of which as of the date hereof
                  3,620,092 shares of Company Common Stock and no shares of
                  Preferred Stock are validly issued and outstanding, fully paid
                  and nonassessable, and no shares of Company Common Stock or
                  Preferred Stock are held in the treasury.

                           (ii) There are no options, warrants, calls, rights,
                  commitments or agreements of any character, written or oral,
                  to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound
                  obligating the Company to issue, deliver, sell, repurchase or
                  redeem, or cause to be issued, delivered, sold, repurchased or
                  redeemed any shares of the capital stock of the Company or
                  obligating the Company to grant, extend, accelerate the
                  vesting of, change the price of, otherwise amend or enter into
                  any such option, warrant, call, right, commitment or
                  agreement. There are no outstanding or authorized stock
                  appreciation, phantom stock, profit participation or other
                  similar rights with respect to the Company. There are no
                  voting trusts, proxies or other agreements or understandings
                  with respect to the capital stock of the Company.

                  (c) SUBSIDIARIES. Except as set forth in Section 5.01(c) of
         the Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not own of record or
         beneficially, directly or indirectly, (i) any shares of outstanding
         capital stock or securities convertible into capital stock of any other
         corporation or (ii) any participating interest in any general or
         limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability
         company, joint venture or other non-corporate business enterprise.
         Except as listed in Section 5.01(c) of the Disclosure Schedule, the
         Company owns directly all the outstanding capital stock of the
         subsidiaries listed in the Disclosure Schedule (the "Subsidiaries")
         (except for directors' qualifying shares, if any), free and clear of
         all encumbrances other than Permitted Exceptions (as hereinafter
         defined). The capital stock of each Subsidiary is duly authorized and
         validly issued and outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable. No
         Subsidiary has issued or sold any shares of its capital stock or any
         securities or obligations convertible into or exchangeable for, or
         given any person any right to acquire from such Subsidiary, any shares
         of its capital stock, and no such securities or obligations are
         outstanding. Each Subsidiary is a corporation duly organized, validly
         existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
         organization, and has the corporate power and authority to own and hold
         its properties and to carry on its business as currently conducted. The
         copies of the articles or certificates of incorporation and by-laws
         (or, where applicable, other such similar governance documents) of each
         Subsidiary, as amended to date, which have been delivered to Fiserv
         were complete and correct, and such instruments, as so amended, are in
         full force and effect at the date hereof. For purposes of this Section
         5.01, the term "Company" shall be deemed to include the Subsidiaries
         except in Section

                                      A-9

         5.01(a) through Section 5.01(g) (inclusive) and Section 5.01(y) and
         except where otherwise noted.

                  (d) AUTHORITY RELATIVE TO AGREEMENT. The Company has the
         corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and
         the FIRPTA Affidavit in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit B (the
         "FIRPTA Affidavit") and to consummate the transactions contemplated on
         the part of the Company hereby. The execution and delivery by the
         Company of this Agreement and the FIRPTA Affidavit and the consummation
         by the Company of the transactions contemplated on its part hereby have
         been duly authorized by its Board of Directors. No other corporate
         proceedings on the part of the Company (other than stockholder
         approval) or any Subsidiary are necessary to authorize the execution
         and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, or, subject to obtaining
         the Company Stockholders Approval, the consummation of the transactions
         contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed
         and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization,
         execution and delivery at the Effective Time of the Agreement by Fiserv
         and Fiserv Sub, is its valid and binding agreement, enforceable against
         the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement is
         subject to the effect of (i) any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
         reorganization or similar laws relating to or affecting creditors'
         rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity, including
         concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing
         and other similar doctrines affecting the enforceability of agreements
         generally (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity
         or at law). The Company's Board of Directors has approved this
         Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and such approvals
         are sufficient so that neither the restrictions on "business
         combinations" set forth in Section 203(a) of Delaware Law nor the
         provisions of any other "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
         acquisition," or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation nor
         the provisions of any applicable anti-takeover provisions in the
         Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company will apply to
         this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
         Agreement. Under applicable law, the current Certificate of
         Incorporation of the Company and Nasdaq rules, the affirmative vote of
         the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common
         Stock is the vote required for the stockholders of the Company to
         approve the Merger (the "Company Stockholder Approval").

                  (e) NON-CONTRAVENTION. The execution and delivery of this
         Agreement and the FIRPTA Affidavit by the Company do not and the
         consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby
         will not (i) violate any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation
         or By-laws of the Company or the Certificate of Incorporation or
         By-laws of any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and (ii)
         violate, or result, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or
         both, in a violation of, any provision of, or result in the
         acceleration of or entitle any party to accelerate (whether after the
         giving of notice or lapse of time or both) any obligation under, or
         result in the creation or imposition of any material lien, charge,
         pledge, security interest or other encumbrance upon any of the property
         of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any provision of
         any mortgage or lien or material lease, agreement, license or
         instrument or any order, arbitration award, judgment or decree to which
         the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is

                                      A-10

         a party or by which any of its assets is bound, and do not and will not
         violate or conflict with any other material restriction of any kind or
         character to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject or
         by which any of its assets may be bound, and the same does not and will
         not constitute an event permitting termination of any such mortgage or
         lien or material lease, agreement, license or instrument to which the
         Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or (iii) violate in any
         material respect any law, ordinance or regulation to which the Company
         or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, including the applicable
         requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, state takeover or
         securities laws, the rules of Nasdaq, except, in each case or cases,
         for any such violation, acceleration, imposition, conflict or
         termination which would not, individually or in the aggregate, result
         in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (f) GOVERNMENT APPROVALS. Except for (i) the filing of the
         Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
         Delaware, no consent, authorization, order or approval of, or filing or
         registration with, any governmental commission, board or other
         regulatory body is required for the execution and delivery of this
         Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
         transactions contemplated hereby, except (x) as may be necessary as a
         result of any facts or circumstances relating solely to Fiserv or
         Fiserv Sub or (y) where the failure to obtain such consents,
         authorizations or approvals or to make such filings or registrations
         would not prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated
         hereby.

                  (g) COMPANY SEC REPORTS. The Company has filed with the
         Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), at or prior to the time
         due, and has made available to Fiserv true and complete copies of all
         forms, reports, schedules, registration statements and definitive proxy
         statements (together with all information incorporated therein by
         reference, the "Company SEC Reports") required to be filed by it with
         the SEC since January 1, 2000. As of their respective dates, the
         Company SEC Reports complied as to form in all material respects with
         the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
         (the "Exchange Act") or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
         "Securities Act"), as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of
         the SEC thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Reports. As of their
         respective dates and as of the date any information from such Company
         SEC Reports has been incorporated by reference, the Company SEC Reports
         did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
         state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
         order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
         under which they were made, not misleading.

                  (h) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Each of the financial statements of
         the Company (including the related notes) included or incorporated by
         reference in the Company SEC Reports (including any similar documents
         filed after the date of this Agreement) comply as to form in all
         material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
         published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have
         been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited
         statements, as permitted by Form 10-QSB of the SEC) applied on a
         consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
         indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present the consolidated

                                      A-11

         financial position of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as
         of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations
         and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject to normal year-end
         adjustments in the case of any unaudited interim financial statements).
         Except for liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course
         of business consistent with past practice and which could not
         reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
         Material Adverse Effect, since the date of the most recent audited
         consolidated balance sheet included in the Company SEC Reports, neither
         the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liabilities or
         obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
         otherwise) required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance
         sheet of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries or in the notes
         thereto.

         2001, the Company has not:

                  past practice;

                           (vii) transferred or granted any rights under any

                  of the Company (by position or by department) as of a recent
                  date (a copy of which has been submitted to Fiserv but is not
                  included in the Disclosure Schedule).

         True and complete copies of all documents and descriptions complete in
         all material respects of all oral agreements or commitments (if any)
         referred to in (i) through (iv) above (other than insurance plans which
         have been summarized) have been provided and made available to Fiserv
         or its counsel. The Company has not been notified in writing of any
         claim that any contract listed in the Disclosure Schedule for this
         subsection (l) is not valid and enforceable in accordance with its
         terms for the periods stated therein, or that there is under any such
         contract any existing default or event of default or event which with
         notice or lapse of time or both would constitute such a default, except
         for any such claim which would have, individually or when taken

         5.01(l), a Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 5.01(l) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of the
         Company's top 10 clients according to revenue for the year ended
         December 31, 2001, and each client with which the Company currently has

         list of all effective agreements between such client and the Company.

                  (m) LITIGATION. There are no actions, suits or proceedings
         with respect to the business of the Company pending against the Company
         of which the Company is aware at law or in equity, or before or by any

         commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality (individually, a
         "Governmental Entity"), nor, to the knowledge of the Company, has the
         Company received any notice or threat of any such actions, suits or
         proceedings with respect to the business of the Company except as would

         proceeding or investigation that the Company believes could have a
         Material Adverse Effect, the forum, the parties thereto, the subject
         matter thereof and the amount of damages claimed or other remedy
         requested. No Governmental Entity has at any time challenged or
         questioned the legal right of the Company to manufacture, offer or sell
         any of its products or services in the present manner or style thereof.

                  (n) LABOR CONTROVERSIES. Except as would not reasonably be
         expected to have in the aggregate a Material Adverse Effect:

                  between the Company and any employees or any unresolved labor

                  bargaining agreement is being negotiated by the Company;

                           (ii) the Company is in compliance, and has not
                  received notice of, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, has
                  there been threatened any claim that the Company has not
                  complied, with all laws relating to the employment of labor,
                  including provisions thereof relating to wages, hours,
                  collective bargaining, the payment of social security and
                  similar Taxes, equal employment opportunity, employment
                  discrimination and employment safety nor has the Company
                  received notice of or, to the knowledge of the Company, has
                  there been threatened any claim that it is liable for any
                  arrears of wages or any Taxes or penalties for failure to
                  comply with any of the foregoing; and the Company is not
                  liable for any payment to any trust or other fund governed by
                  or maintained by or on behalf of any governmental authority
                  with respect to unemployment compensation benefits, social
                  security or other benefits or obligations for employees (other
                  than routine payments to be made in the ordinary course of
                  business and consistent with past practice) and there are no
                  pending, threatened or reasonably anticipated claims or
                  actions against the Company under any worker's compensation
                  policy or long-term disability policy; and

                           (iii) the Company does not now, nor has it ever had
                  the obligation to, maintain, establish, sponsor, participate
                  in or contribute to any international or foreign employee
                  benefit plan.

                  (o) USE OF REAL PROPERTY. The Company has not received any
         notice of violation of any applicable zoning or building regulation,
         ordinance or other law, order, regulation or requirement relating to

         environmental matters being set forth in Section 5.01(p) hereof) or any
         notice of default under any lease, contract, commitment, license or
         permit, relating to the use and operation of the owned or leased real
         property listed in the Disclosure Schedule, in either case which could
         reasonably be expected to have in the aggregate a Material Adverse
         Effect and, to the knowledge of the Company, there is no such violation
         or default which would have in the aggregate a Material Adverse Effect.
         The Company has not received any notice that any plant or other
         building that is owned or covered by a lease set forth in the
         Disclosure Schedule hereto does not substantially conform with all
         applicable ordinances, codes, regulations and requirements, and the
         Company has not received any notice that any law or regulation
         presently in effect or condition precludes or restricts continuation of
         the present use of such properties by the Company.

                  "Hazardous Material"), but excluding office and janitorial
                  supplies properly and safely maintained. No Hazardous
                  Materials have been released in violation of any applicable
                  law, as a result of the actions of the Company, or, to the
                  Company's knowledge, as a result of any actions of any third
                  party or otherwise, in, on or under any property, including
                  the land and the improvements, ground water and surface water
                  thereof, that the Company has at any time owned, operated,
                  occupied or leased.

                           (ii) HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ACTIVITIES. The Company has
                  not transported, stored, used, manufactured, disposed of,
                  released or exposed its employees or others to Hazardous

                  referred to as "Hazardous Materials Activities") in violation
                  of any rule, regulation, treaty or statute promulgated by any
                  Governmental Entity in effect prior to or as of the date
                  hereof to prohibit, regulate or control Hazardous Materials or
                  any Hazardous Material Activity.

                           (iii) PERMITS. The Company currently holds all
                  environmental approvals, permits, licenses, clearances and

                  bona fide transactions in the ordinary course of business.
                  Except for amounts also recorded as deferred revenue, these

                  arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have
                  been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and no
                  further deliveries or services are required to be provided in
                  order to entitle the Company or its assignees to collect the
                  accounts receivable in full. No such account has been assigned
                  or pledged to any other person, firm or corporation.

                           (ii) NO UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. The Company does not

                  accrued, absolute, contingent, matured, unmatured or other
                  (whether or not required to be reflected in the Company
                  Financial Statements), that in the aggregate exceed $50,000,
                  and which (A) has not been reflected (which such term
                  "reflected" does not include any such liability, indebtedness,
                  etc. that is mentioned only in the footnotes to the Company
                  Financial Statements) or reserved against in the most recent
                  Company Financial Statements or (B) has arisen other than in
                  the ordinary course of the Company's business and consistent
                  with past practices since the date of the latest balance sheet
                  included in the Company Financial Statements. The Company does
                  not have any outstanding payables, whether reflected on the
                  Company Financial Statements or not, which (C) exceed $50,000
                  or (D) are more than 30 days past due.

                  (r) COMPLIANCE WITH LAW; RESTRICTIONS ON BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

                           (i) NO DEFAULTS. The Company is not in default with
                  respect to any order of any court, governmental authority or
                  arbitration board or tribunal to which it is a party or, to
                  the knowledge of the Company, to which the Company is subject
                  and which applies to its business, and, to the knowledge of
                  the Company, the Company has not been notified that it is in
                  violation of any laws, ordinances, governmental rules or
                  regulations to which it is subject or that it has failed to
                  obtain any licenses, permits, franchises or other governmental
                  authorizations necessary to the ownership of its assets and
                  properties or to the conduct of its business.

                  aliens who have been continually employed by the Company since

                  no agreement (noncompete or otherwise), commitment, judgment,
                  injunction, order or decree to which the Company is a party or
                  otherwise binding upon the Company which has or reasonably
                  would be expected to have the effect of prohibiting or

                  (tangible or intangible) by the Company or the conduct of
                  business by the Company. Without limiting the foregoing, the
                  Company has not entered into any agreement under which the
                  Company is restricted from selling, licensing or otherwise
                  distributing any of its products to any class of customers, in
                  any geographic area, during any period of time or in any
                  segment of the market.

                           (iv) EMPLOYEES. To the knowledge of the Company, no
                  employee of the Company (A) is in violation of any term of any
                  employment contract, patent disclosure agreement,
                  non-competition agreement or any restrictive covenant to a
                  former employer relating to the right of any such employee to
                  be employed by the Company because of the nature of the
                  business conducted or presently proposed to be conducted by
                  the Company or to the use of trade secrets or proprietary

                  interest, other than such consents, licenses, permits, grants
                  or authorizations the failure to obtain which would not,
                  either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
                  Adverse Effect ("Company Authorizations"), which Company
                  Authorizations are in full force and effect and constitute all
                  Company Authorizations required to permit the Company to
                  operate or conduct its business or hold any interest in its
                  properties or assets and each such Company Authorization is
                  listed on Section 5.01(r)(v) of the Disclosure Schedule.

                  Section 5.01(s)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule, (A) no Employee
                  Plan is maintained, administered or contributed to by any
                  entity other than the Company, and (B) no Employee Plan is
                  maintained under any trust arrangement which covers any
                  employee benefit arrangement which is not an Employee Plan.

                           (ii) DELIVERY OF COPIES OF PLANS, DOCUMENTS, ETC. The
                  Company has delivered or has caused to be delivered to Fiserv
                  and Trewit true and complete copies of (A) the Employee Plans
                  (including related trust agreements, custodial agreements,
                  insurance contracts, investment contracts and other funding
                  arrangements, if any, and adoption agreements, if any), (B)
                  any amendments to Employee Plans, (C) written interpretations
                  of the Employee Plans, (D) material employee communications by
                  the plan administrator of any Employee Plan (including, but
                  not limited to, summary plan descriptions and summaries of
                  material modifications, as defined under ERISA), (E) the three
                  most recent annual reports (e.g., the complete Form 5500
                  series) prepared in connection with each Employee Plan (if
                  such report was required), including all attachments
                  (including the audited financial statements, if any) and (F)
                  the three most recent actuarial valuation reports prepared in
                  connection with each Employee Plan (if any such report was
                  required).

                           (iii) NO CHANGE IN BENEFITS. There has been no
                  amendment to, written interpretation or announcement (whether
                  or not written) by the Company relating to, or change in
                  employee participation or coverage under any Employee Plan
                  that would increase materially the expense of maintaining such
                  Employee Plan above the level of expense incurred in respect
                  of such Employee Plan for the most recent plan year with
                  respect to Employee Plans. The execution of this Agreement and
                  the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby do
                  not and will not constitute an event under any Employee Plan,
                  which either alone or upon the occurrence of a subsequent
                  event will or may result in any payment, acceleration, vesting
                  or increase in benefits to any employee, former employee or
                  director of the Company.

                           (iv) COMPLIANCE. Each Employee Plan has been
                  maintained in compliance with its terms and the requirements
                  prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and
                  regulations, including but not limited to, ERISA and the Code,
                  which are applicable to such Employee Plan.

                           (v) QUALIFICATION, ETC. Each Pension Plan is
                  "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code,
                  and has been qualified during the period from the date of its
                  adoption to the date of this Agreement, and each trust created
                  thereunder is tax-exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code. The
                  Company has

                                      A-25

                  delivered or caused to be delivered to Fiserv the latest
                  determination letters of the Internal Revenue Service relating
                  to each Pension Plan. Such determination letters have not been
                  revoked. Furthermore, there are no pending proceedings or, to
                  the knowledge of the Company, threatened proceedings in which
                  the "qualified" status of any Pension Plan is at issue and in
                  which revocation of the determination letter has been
                  threatened. Each such Pension Plan has not been amended or
                  operated, since the receipt of the most recent determination
                  letter, in a manner that would adversely affect the
                  "qualified" status of the Plan. No distributions have been
                  made from any of the Pension Plans that would violate in any
                  respect the restrictions under Treasury Regulation Section
                  1.401(a)(4)-5(b), and none will have been made by the
                  Effective Time.

                           (vi) NO CLAIMS. There are no pending or, to the
                  knowledge of the Company, threatened (A) claims, suits or
                  other proceedings by any employees, former employees or plan
                  participants or the beneficiaries, spouses or representatives
                  of any of them, other than ordinary and usual claims for
                  benefits by participants or beneficiaries, or (B) suits,
                  investigations or other proceedings by any federal, state,
                  local or other governmental agency or authority, of or against
                  any Employee Plan, the assets held thereunder, the trustee of
                  any such assets or the Company relating to any of the Employee
                  Plans. If any of the actions described in this subsection are
                  initiated prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
                  notify Fiserv of such action prior to the Effective Time.

                           (vii) NO PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS. The Company has not
                  engaged (A) in any transaction or acted or failed to act in a
                  manner that violates the fiduciary requirements of Section 404
                  of ERISA, or (B) in any "prohibited transaction" within the
                  meaning of Section 406(a) or 406(b) of ERISA, or of Section
                  4975(c) of the Code, with respect to any Employee Plans, and
                  will not so engage, act or fail to act prior to the Effective
                  Time. Furthermore, to the knowledge of the Company, no other
                  "party in interest", as defined in Section 3(14) of ERISA, or
                  "disqualified person", as defined in Section 4975(e)(2) of the
                  Code, has engaged in any such "prohibited transaction".

                           (viii) NO LIABILITY. No liability has been incurred
                  by the Company or by a trade or business, whether or not
                  incorporated, which is deemed to be under common control or
                  affiliated with the Company within the meaning of Section 4001
                  of ERISA or Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (an
                  "ERISA Affiliate") for any Tax, penalty or other liability
                  with respect to any Employee Plan and, to the knowledge of the
                  Company, such Plans do not expect to incur any such liability
                  prior to the Effective Time.

                           (ix) REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS. The Company has made all
                  required contributions under each Pension Plan on a timely
                  basis or, if not yet due, adequate accruals therefore have
                  been provided for in the financial statements. No Pension Plan
                  has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" within the
                  meaning of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code and
                  no Pension

                                      A-26

                  Plan has applied for or received a waiver of the maximum
                  funding standards imposed by Section 412 of the Code.

                           (x) PBGC. Except for required premium payments, no
                  liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the
                  "PBGC") has been incurred by the Company with respect to any
                  Pension Plan that has not been satisfied in full, and no event
                  has occurred and there exists no condition or set of
                  circumstances that could result in the imposition of any such
                  liability. The Company has complied, or will comply, with all
                  requirements for premium payments, including any interest and
                  penalty charges for late payment, due to PBGC on or before the
                  Effective Time with respect to each Pension Plan for which any
                  premiums are required. No proceedings to terminate, pursuant
                  to Section 4042 of ERISA, have been instituted or, to the
                  knowledge of the Company, are threatened by the PBGC with
                  respect to any Pension Plan (or any Pension Plan maintained by
                  an ERISA Affiliate). There has been no termination or partial
                  termination, as defined in Section 411(d) of the Code and the
                  regulations thereunder, of any Pension Plan. No reportable
                  event, within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA, has
                  occurred with respect to any Pension Plan.

                           (xi) BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS. As of the date of this
                  Agreement, with respect to each Pension Plan which is covered
                  by Title IV of ERISA and which is not a multiemployer plan,
                  the current value of the accumulated benefit obligations
                  (based on the actuarial assumptions that would be utilized
                  upon termination of such Pension Plan) do not exceed the
                  current fair value of the assets of such Pension Plan. Except
                  as listed in Section 5.01(s)(xi) of the Disclosure Schedule,
                  there has been (A) no material adverse change in the financial
                  condition of any such Pension Plan, and (B) no change in
                  actuarial assumptions with respect to such Pension Plan as a
                  result of plan amendment, written interpretations,
                  announcements, change in applicable law or otherwise which,
                  individually or in the aggregate, would result in the value of
                  any such Pension Plan's accrued benefits exceeding the current
                  value of such Pension Plan's assets.

                           (xii) NO MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN. Neither the Company nor
                  any ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained, adopted or
                  established, contributed or been required to contribute to, or
                  otherwise participated or been required to participate in, nor
                  will they become obligated to do so through the Effective
                  Time, any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of
                  ERISA). No amount is due from, or owed by, the Company or any
                  ERISA Affiliate on account of a "multiemployer plan" (as
                  defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) or on account of any
                  withdrawal therefrom.

                           (xiii) NO POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS. No Employee Plan
                  provides benefits, including any severance or other
                  post-employment benefit, salary continuation, termination,
                  death, disability or health or medical benefits (whether or
                  not insured), life insurance or similar benefit with respect
                  to current or former employees (or their spouses or
                  dependents) of the Company beyond their

                                      A-27

                  retirement or other termination of service other than (A)
                  coverage mandated by applicable law, (B) death, disability or
                  retirement benefits under any Pension Plan, (C) deferred
                  compensation benefits accrued as liabilities on the Company
                  Financial Statements, (D) benefits, the full cost of which is
                  borne by the current or former employee (or his or her
                  beneficiary) or (E) as expressly contemplated by this
                  Agreement.

                           (xiv) COBRA. The Company has complied with, and
                  satisfied, the requirements of Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I
                  of ERISA and Section 4980(B) of the Code, and all regulations
                  thereunder ("COBRA") with respect to each Employee Plan that
                  is subject to the requirements of COBRA. Each Employee Plan
                  that is a group health plan, within the meaning of Section
                  9805(a) of the Code, has complied with and satisfied the
                  applicable requirements of Sections 9801 and 9802 of the Code.

                  (t) INSURANCE. The Disclosure Schedule summarizes the amount
         and kinds of insurance as to which the Company has insurance policies,
         contracts or fidelity bonds relating to the business or operations of
         the Company. All such insurance policies, contracts and bonds are in
         full force and effect. All such insurance policies, contracts and bonds
         covering the assets, business, equipment, properties, operations,
         employees, officers and directors of the Company contain provisions
         which are reasonable and customary in the Company's industry, and there
         is no claim by the Company pending under any of such policies or bonds
         as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the
         underwriters of such policies or bonds. All premiums due and payable
         under all such policies, contracts and bonds have been paid and the
         Company is otherwise in compliance in all material respects with the
         terms of such policies, contracts and bonds (or other policies,
         contracts and bonds providing substantially similar insurance
         coverage). No notice of cancellation or termination of any such
         insurance policies, contracts or bonds has been given to the Company by
         the carrier of any such policy, contract or policy.

                  (u) BANK ACCOUNTS. Section 5.01(u) of the Disclosure Schedule
         lists all bank, money market, savings and similar accounts and safe
         deposit boxes of the Company, specifying the account numbers and the
         authorized signatories of persons having access to them.

                  (v) MINUTE BOOKS. The minute books and stock books or share
         ledgers, as the case may be, of the Company made available to Fiserv
         and Trewit are the only minute books and stock books or share ledgers,
         as the case may be, of the Company and contain a reasonably accurate
         summary of all meetings of directors (including committees thereof) and
         shareholders or actions by written consent and of all transactions in
         the capital stock of the Company since the time of incorporation of the
         Company.

                  (w) TAXES.

                                      A-28

                           (i) COMPLIANCE GENERALLY. The Company (A) has duly
                  and timely filed or caused to be filed with the appropriate
                  authorities all Tax Returns of, related to or including the
                  Company, including its income, assets, payroll or operations,
                  and properly included the items related thereto in such Tax
                  Returns, which Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in
                  all material respects, and (B) has duly and timely paid or
                  caused to be paid to the appropriate authorities all Taxes
                  that are due and payable on or before the Effective Time, and
                  has properly accrued on its books and records in accordance
                  with GAAP any Tax not then due. The Company has complied with
                  all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to the
                  reporting, payment, collection and withholding of Taxes and
                  has duly and timely collected or withheld and paid over to the
                  appropriate authorities all amounts required to be so
                  collected or withheld and paid over under all applicable laws.
                  Except as set forth in Section 5.01(w)(i) of the Disclosure
                  Schedule, all Taxable years or periods for the assessment of
                  Taxes are closed either by agreement with the applicable
                  Taxing authority or by operation of the normal statute of
                  limitations or, if not yet closed, will close by operation of
                  the normal statute of limitations for such Tax Returns
                  (without extension). Section 5.01(w)(i) of the Disclosure
                  Schedule sets forth a list of each jurisdiction where the
                  Company files a Tax Return and the type of Tax Returns filed
                  during the past five years. The Company has made available for
                  review by Fiserv and Trewit true, correct and complete copies
                  of all Tax Returns filed by or with respect to the Company
                  during the past five years and of all correspondence to or
                  from a Taxing authority relating thereto and with respect to
                  any Proceeding (as hereinafter defined).

                           (ii) NO ADJUSTMENTS. Except as set forth in Section
                  5.01(w)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedule, no Taxing authority
                  has asserted any adjustment that would result in an additional
                  Tax for which the Company is or may be liable or with respect
                  to which a lien may be imposed on any asset or property of the
                  Company which has not been fully paid or which adjustment, if
                  asserted, would apply to any other period. No such adjustment
                  is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, being
                  considered and there is no basis for any such adjustment.
                  There is no pending audit, examination, investigation,
                  dispute, proceeding or claim (collectively, a "Proceeding")
                  relating to any Tax for which the Company is or may be liable
                  or which could result in a lien on any of the Company's assets
                  or property, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no Taxing
                  authority is contemplating such a Proceeding and there is no
                  basis for any such Proceeding.

                           (iii) NO OTHER ARRANGEMENTS. The Company is not a
                  party to any agreement, contract or arrangement for services
                  that would result, individually or in the aggregate, in the
                  payment of any amount that would not be deductible by reason
                  of Section 162, 280G or 404 of the Code. The Company is not a
                  "consenting corporation" within the meaning of Section 341(f)
                  of the Code. The Company does not have any "tax-exempt bond
                  financed property" or "tax-exempt use property" within the
                  meaning of Section 168(g) or (h), respectively, of the Code.
                  The Company has not entered into any sale-leaseback or
                  leveraged lease

                                      A-29

                  transaction. None of the assets of the Company is required to
                  be treated as being owned by any other person pursuant to the
                  "safe harbor" leasing provisions of Section 168(f)(8) of the
                  Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as in effect prior to the
                  repeal of said leasing provisions. The Company has never made
                  or been required to make an election under Section 338 of the
                  Code. The Company has never been included in a consolidated,
                  combined or unitary Tax Return. The Company is not and has
                  never been a party to any Tax sharing or Tax allocation
                  agreement, arrangement or understanding. No Tax authority has
                  ever asserted that the Company should file a Tax Return in a
                  jurisdiction where it does not file. The Company does not have
                  outstanding any power of attorney or ruling request, request
                  to consent to change a method of accounting, subpoena or
                  request for information with or by any Taxing authority in
                  connection with any Tax matter. There is no outstanding power
                  of attorney authorizing anyone to act on behalf of the Company
                  in connection with any Tax, Tax Return or Proceeding relating
                  to any Tax. The Company is not required to include any
                  adjustment under Section 481 of the Code (or any similar
                  provision of applicable law) in income for any period (or
                  portion of a period) beginning after the Closing Date. During
                  the last two years, the Company has not engaged in any
                  exchange with a related person (within the meaning of Code
                  Section 1031(f)) under which gain realized was not recognized
                  under Section 1031 of the Code.

                  immediately prior to the transaction.

                           (vii) Prior to the effectiveness and at the time of
                  the Merger, the Company has no plan or intention to issue
                  additional shares of its stock that would result in Fiserv

                  of Section 368(c) of the Code.

                  a business, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation section
                  1.368-1(d), which will be owned by the Surviving Corporation
                  following the Merger.

                          (ix) At the time of the Merger, the Company will not
                  have outstanding any warrants, options, convertible
                  securities, or any other type of right pursuant to which any
                  person could acquire stock in the Company or in the Surviving
                  Corporation (a) that, if exercised, would affect Fiserv's
                  control of the Surviving Corporation within the meaning of
                  Section 368(c) of the Code, or (b) that, whether exercised or
                  not, would adversely affect Fiserv's ability to include the
                  Surviving Corporation in its consolidated, combined or unitary
                  tax returns for federal, state or local tax purposes.

                           (x) The Company is not an investment company as

         Sub has the corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
         Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated on its part

         Agreement and the consummation by each of them of the transactions
         contemplated on its part hereby have been duly authorized by their
         respective Board of Directors and, in the case of Fiserv Sub, its sole

         pledge, security interest or other encumbrance upon any of the property
         of Fiserv or Fiserv Sub pursuant to any provision of any mortgage or
         lien or material lease, agreement, license or instrument or any order,
         arbitration award, judgment or decree to which Fiserv or Fiserv Sub is
         a party or by which any of their respective assets is bound and do not
         and will not violate or conflict with any other material restriction of
         any kind or character to which Fiserv or Fiserv Sub is subject or by
         which any of its assets may be bound, and the same does not and will
         not constitute an event permitting termination of any such mortgage or

         Fiserv or Fiserv Sub is a party or (iii) violate in any material
         respect any law, ordinance or regulation to which Fiserv or Fiserv Sub

         Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
         Delaware and (ii) applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the

         registration with, any governmental commission, board or other
         regulatory body is required for or in connection with the execution and
         delivery of this Agreement by Fiserv and Fiserv Sub and the
         consummation by Fiserv and Fiserv Sub of the transactions contemplated
         hereby, except (x) as may be necessary as a result of any facts or
         circumstances relating solely to the Company or (y) where the failure
         to obtain such consents, authorizations or approvals or to make such
         filings or registrations would not prevent the consummation of the
         transactions contemplated hereby.

                  (e) FISERV SEC REPORTS. Fiserv has filed with the SEC, at or
         prior to the time due, and has made available to the Company true and
         complete copies of all forms, reports, schedules, registration
         statements and definitive proxy statements (together with all
         information incorporated therein by reference, the "Fiserv SEC
         Reports") required to be filed by it with the SEC since January 1,
         2000. As of their respective dates, the Fiserv SEC Reports complied as
         to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange
         Act or the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
         regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Fiserv SEC
         Reports. As of their respective dates and as of the date any
         information from such Fiserv SEC Reports has been incorporated by
         reference, the Fiserv SEC Reports did not contain any untrue statement
         of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
         stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
         light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

                  (f) FISERV FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Each of the financial
         statements of Fiserv (including the related notes) included or
         incorporated by reference in the Fiserv SEC Reports (including any
         similar documents filed after the date of this Agreement) comply as to
         form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements
         and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
         thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the
         case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC)
         applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as
         may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present the
         consolidated financial position of the Fiserv and its consolidated
         subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of
         their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject to
         normal year-end adjustments in the case of any unaudited interim
         financial statements). Except for liabilities and obligations incurred
         in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and
         which could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
         aggregate, a Fiserv Material Adverse Effect (as defined herein), since
         the date of the most recent audited consolidated balance sheet included
         in the Fiserv SEC Reports, neither the Fiserv nor any of the Fiserv
         Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
         accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) required by

                                      A-34

         GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of the Fiserv and
         its consolidated subsidiaries or in the notes thereto.

                  (g) PROXY STATEMENT; REGISTRATION STATEMENT; OTHER
         INFORMATION. The information, taken as a whole, with respect to Fiserv
         or its subsidiaries to be included in the Proxy Statement or the
         Registration Statement will not, in the case of the Proxy Statement or
         any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, at the time of the
         mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements
         thereto, and at the time of the Company Special Meeting, or, in the
         case of the Registration Statement, at the time it becomes effective or
         at the effective time of any post-effective amendment, contain any
         untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
         required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
         statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
         made, not misleading, except that no representation is made by Fiserv
         or Fiserv Sub with respect to information supplied in writing by the
         Company or any affiliate of the Company specifically for inclusion in
         the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement. Each of the Proxy
         Statement and Registration Statement (as it relates to Fiserv and its
         subsidiaries) will comply as to form in all material respects with the
         provisions of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as applicable.

                  (h) CAPITALIZATION OF FISERV SUB. The authorized capital stock
         of Fiserv Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common stock, $.01 par value,

                  acquire any of the Fiserv Common Stock issued in the
                  transaction.

         fully paid and nonassessable shares of Fiserv Common Stock.

                  ( l) ABSENCE OF MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT. Since December 31,
         2001, Fiserv has not experienced any change that could have a Fiserv
         Material Adverse Effect. "Fiserv Material Adverse Effect" means any
         change in, or effect on, or series of related changes

                                      A-36

         in, or related effects on, the business of Fiserv as currently
         conducted by Fiserv and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that is
         materially adverse to the results of its operations or financial or
         other condition before giving effect to the transactions contemplated
         by this Agreement and other than such changes or effects generally
         affecting the industry of Fiserv and its subsidiaries or the economy of
         the United States.

                  ( m) BROKERS. All negotiations relative to this Agreement and
         the transactions contemplated hereby have been carried out by Fiserv,
         Trewit and Fiserv Sub directly with the Company, without the
         intervention of any person on behalf of Fiserv or Fiserv Sub in such
         manner as to give rise to any valid claim by any person against the
         Company or Fiserv or Fiserv Sub for a finder's fee, brokerage
         commission or similar payment.

         the Board of Directors of the Company has in good faith determined
         after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, to

                  (c) The Company agrees that it will notify Fiserv within two
         (2) business days if it or any of its Representatives receives an
         Acquisition Proposal or if any discussions or negotiations are sought
         to be initiated or continued with the Company or its Representatives
         concerning an Acquisition Proposal.

                  (d) Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company will
         immediately terminate all discussions with any person or entity (other

         thereof or supplements thereto, in each case in the form or forms
         mailed to the Company's stockholders and Fiserv's stockholders, the
         "Proxy Statement") and Fiserv shall prepare and file with the SEC a

         thereto, the "Registration Statement") in which the Proxy Statement
         shall be included as a prospectus, in connection with the registration

         made by Fiserv or the Company without the approval of the other party
         (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Fiserv
         and the Company each will advise the other, promptly after it receives
         notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become
         effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the

         and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
         information.

         Statement, Fiserv shall promptly inform the Company. All documents that

         Effective Time any event or circumstance relating to the Company or any
         of its Subsidiaries, or their respective

                                      A-41

                  (e) by the Company prior to Company Stockholder Approval being
         obtained if (i) it is not in material breach of its obligations under
         this Agreement and has complied with, and continues to comply with, all
         requirements, conditions and procedures of Section 6.07 in all material
         respects, (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company has authorized,
         subject to terminating this Agreement, the Company to enter into a
         binding written agreement concerning a transaction that constitutes a
         Superior Proposal and the Company notifies Fiserv in writing that it
         intends to enter into such binding agreement, which notice must have
         attached to it the most current version of such agreement ready for
         execution, and (iii) Fiserv does not make, within five business days
         after receipt of such notice from the Company, any offer that the Board
         of Directors of the Company reasonably and in good faith determines,
         after consultation with its financial and legal advisors, is at least
         as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as the Superior
         Proposal and during such five business-day period the Company
         reasonably considers and discusses in good faith all proposals
         submitted by Fiserv and, without limiting the foregoing, meets with,
         and causes its financial advisors and legal advisors to meet with,
         Fiserv and its advisors from time to time as reasonably requested by
         Fiserv to reasonably consider and discuss in good faith Fiserv's
         proposals. The Company agrees (x) that it will not enter into a binding
         agreement referred to in clause (ii) above until at least the sixth
         business day after Fiserv has received the notice to Fiserv required by
         clause (ii) above, and (y) to notify Fiserv promptly if its intention
         to enter into the binding agreement included in its notice to Fiserv
         shall change at any time after giving such notice;

                                      A-49

                  (f) by Fiserv and Fiserv Sub if (i) Fiserv and Fiserv Sub are
         not in material breach of their obligations under this Agreement and
         (ii) there has been a material breach by the Company of any of its
         covenants (including without limitation the covenants contained in
         Section 6.07) or obligations under this Agreement or by an Affiliate of
         the Company under such person's affiliate's letter described in Section
         6.11 or by an officer, director or stockholder of the Company under
         such person's Agreement to Facilitate Merger described in Section 6.19
         such that the conditions in Section 7.02 will not be satisfied, and the
         breach is not curable or, if curable, is not cured by the Company
         within 30 calendar days after receipt by the Company of written notice
         from Fiserv of such breach;

                  (g) by the Company if (i) the Company is not in material
         breach of its obligations under this Agreement and (ii) there has been
         a material breach by Fiserv and Fiserv Sub of any of their
         representations, warranties, or obligations under this Agreement such
         that the conditions in Section 7.03 will not be satisfied, and the
         breach is not curable or, if curable, is not cured by Fiserv or Fiserv
         Sub within 30 calendar days after receipt by Fiserv of written notice
         from the Company of such breach.

         SECTION 8.02 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of the termination and
abandonment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability, on the part of
any party or its affiliates, directors, officers or shareholder, other than the
provisions of this Section 8.02.

                  (a) Nothing contained in this Section 8.02 shall relieve any
         party from liability for any breach of this Agreement and the
         Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination and abandonment
         of this Agreement.

                  (b) In recognition of the time, efforts, and expenses expended
         and incurred by Fiserv and its subsidiaries with respect to the Company
         and the opportunity that the acquisition of the Company presents to
         Fiserv, if (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(d)
         or 8.01(e) or (ii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
         8.01(f) and within twelve months after such termination the Company
         shall have consummated a transaction of the type described in clauses
         (i) through (iii) of the definition of "Acquisition Proposal", then the
         Company shall pay to Fiserv a fee in the amount of $ 400,000 plus
         Fiserv Transaction Expenses (the "Fee"), payable upon the same date
         that this Agreement is so terminated. The Fee, if payable, shall be
         paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
         designated by Fiserv for such purpose. The Company acknowledges that
         the agreements contained in this Section 8.02(b) are an integral part
         of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and are not a
         penalty, and that, without these agreements, Fiserv would not enter
         into this Agreement. If the Company fails to pay promptly the fee due
         pursuant to this Section 8.02(b), the Company shall also pay to Fiserv
         Fiserv's and its subsidiaries' costs and expenses (including legal fees
         and expenses) in connection with any action, including the filing of
         any lawsuit or other legal action taken to collect payment. "Fiserv
         Transaction Expenses" shall mean the aggregate of all fees and expenses
         of Fiserv and/or its Affiliates (including, without limitation, Trewit)
         incurred in connection with the

                                      A-50

         preparation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including without
         limitation all accounting, legal, printing, filing, financial advisory

         review of the Company, (ii) negotiating and preparing this Agreement
         and (iii) preparing, filing and distributing the Proxy Statement and
         Registration Statement.

warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document, certificate
or writing delivered pursuant hereto or (c) to the extent permitted by
applicable laws, waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements
or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any party to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly,
the parties further agree that each party will be entitled to seek an injunction

resources expended, actually incurred in connection with such suit or action.

         SECTION 9.11 INVALID PROVISIONS. If any provision of this Agreement is
held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future law,
rule or regulation, such provision shall be fully severable and this Agreement
shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision has never comprised a part hereof. The remaining provisions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom.
Furthermore, in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there
shall be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and
enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision as may be possible.

                     FORM OF AGREEMENT TO FACILITATE MERGER

THIS AGREEMENT TO FACILITATE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered
into as of November 1, 2002 by and among FISERV, INC., a Wisconsin corporation
("Fiserv"), FISERV MERGER SUB, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Fiserv Sub") and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Fiserv and [___________] (the "Stockholder").

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, the Stockholder owns beneficially and of record
or has the power to vote, or direct the vote of, [_______] shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Company Common Stock"), of Avidyn, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company");

WHEREAS, on the date hereof, Fiserv, Fiserv Sub, FISERV MERGER SUB, a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Fiserv Sub ("Merger Sub"), and the
Company are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of even date
herewith (as the same may be amended from time to time, the "Merger Agreement";
capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement), which provides, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions thereof, for the merger of Merger Sub with and into
the Company (the "Merger"); and

WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of Fiserv and Fiserv Sub to enter
into the Merger Agreement, Fiserv and Fiserv Sub have requested that the
Stockholder agree, and, in order to induce Fiserv and Fiserv Sub to enter into
the Merger Agreement, the Stockholder has agreed, to enter into this Agreement;

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and in order to
induce Fiserv and Fiserv Sub to execute the Merger Agreement and to proceed as
contemplated by the Merger Agreement toward the consummation of the Merger, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which is
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1.    VOTE IN FAVOR OF MERGER. During the period commencing on the date hereof
      and terminating upon the earlier of the effective time of the Merger or
      the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms,
      Stockholder, in his or her capacity as a stockholder of the Company or as
      a representative with the authority to vote shares of Company Common
      Stock, agrees to vote (or cause to be voted) all shares of Company Common
      Stock presently owned by Stockholder or for which Stockholder has voting
      power, and all shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which
      Stockholder in the future acquires ownership or voting power, at any
      meeting of the Stockholders of the Company (or any adjournment thereof),
      and in any action by written consent of the Stockholders of the Company,
      (i) in favor of the approval, consent, and ratification of the Merger
      Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby, and (ii)
      against any action that could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere,
      delay, or discourage the Merger, facilitate an acquisition of the Company,
      in any manner, by a party (other than Fiserv or a subsidiary of Fiserv),
      or result in any breach of representation, warranty, covenant, or
      agreement of the Company under the Merger Agreement. To the extent
      inconsistent with the foregoing provisions of this Section 1, Stockholder
      hereby revokes any and all previous proxies with respect to any shares of
      Company Common Stock that Stockholder owns or has the right to vote.
      Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to restrict or limit
      Stockholder's right to act in his or her capacity as an officer or
      director of the Company consistent with his or her fiduciary obligations
      in such capacity as permitted under the Merger Agreement.

2.    NO SOLICITATION. Between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of (i)
      the Effective Time or (ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement in
      accordance with Article VIII thereof, the

                                       B-1

      Stockholder hereby agrees neither to (a) solicit, initiate, consider,
      encourage or accept any other proposals or offers from any person or
      entity (A) relating to any acquisition or purchase of all or any portion
      of the capital stock of the Company or assets of the Company, (B) to enter
      into any business combination with the Company or (C) to enter into any
      other extraordinary business transaction involving or otherwise relating
      to the Company, nor (b) to participate in any discussions, conversations,
      negotiations and other communications regarding, or furnish to any other
      person or entity any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate
      in any way, assist or participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort
      or attempt by any other person or entity to seek to do any of the
      foregoing. The Stockholder immediately shall cease all existing
      discussions, conversations, negotiations and other communications with any
      person or entity (other than Fiserv or a subsidiary of Fiserv) conducted
      heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing.

3.    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF STOCKHOLDER. Stockholder represents and
      warrants to Fiserv and Fiserv Sub that Stockholder has the legal capacity
      to enter into and perform all of Stockholder's obligations under this
      Agreement. The execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement by
      Stockholder will not violate any other agreement to which Stockholder is a
      party, including, without limitation, any voting agreement, stockholders
      agreement, or voting trust. This Agreement has been duly executed and
      delivered by Stockholder and constitutes a legal, valid, and binding
      agreement of Stockholder, enforceable against him or her in accordance
      with its terms.

4.    SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement shall be binding upon any permitted
      purchasers, donees, pledgees, and other transferees of Comp
