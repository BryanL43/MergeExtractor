To

A MERGER PROPOSALYOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT  

        We are pleased to inform you that the boards of directors of Zoran Corporation and Oak Technology, Inc. have unanimously approved the merger of Oak
Technology, Inc. with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Zoran. If the proposed merger is completed, each outstanding share of Oak common stock will be converted into the right to receive
(i) 0.2323 of a share of Zoran common stock, and (ii) $1.78 in cash. Zoran stockholders will continue to own their existing shares. Zoran common stock is listed on The NASDAQ National
Market under the symbol "ZRAN." 

        We
cannot complete the merger unless the stockholders of both Zoran and Oak approve proposals relating to the merger. The stockholders of Zoran will vote to approve the issuance of
shares of Zoran common stock in the merger at Zoran's 2003 annual meeting of stockholders, and the stockholders of Oak will vote to approve the merger and the adoption of the merger agreement at a
special meeting of the stockholders being held for that purpose. 

        After
careful consideration, the boards of directors of both companies have determined that the merger is fair and in the best interests of each company's stockholders and recommend that
the stockholders of their companies vote FOR the merger proposals and related matters. 
This joint proxy statement/prospectus provides you with detailed information about the
merger and the other matters to be voted on at the stockholders' meetings. We urge you to read this joint proxy statement/prospectus carefully in its entirety, including the risk factors beginning on

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ZORAN/OAK MERGER    

Q:    Why are Zoran and Oak proposing the merger?  

        A:    The
boards of directors of Zoran and Oak believe that the technologies and products of the two companies are complementary and will enable the combined company to design
and market a more comprehensive portfolio of digital consumer electronics and imaging products. By integrating the two companies' product lines and offering customers a more comprehensive set of
digital consumer electronics and imaging products, especially in the high definition television, or HDTV, market currently addressed by Oak, and the digital video disc, or DVD, market currently
addressed by Zoran, the combined company will be well positioned to participate in the high growth digital television market. In addition, the board of directors of each company believes that the two
companies' customer bases are complementary, which should enable the combined company to engage in meaningful cross-selling opportunities with existing customers as well as create new customer
relationships. The board of directors of Zoran and Oak each believes that, by integrating the two companies' product lines and building on complementary customer relationships, the combined company
can become the preferred supplier for customers and, as a result, build both market share and revenue. The board of directors of each company also believes that the combined company will achieve
better acceptance in the capital markets due to its increased liquidity, larger float and larger market capitalization than either company currently has on its own, and, as a result, increase
stockholder liquidity and stock value and reduce stock volatility. The board of directors of each company also anticipates that the merger will enable the combined company to increase efficiencies in
the development of new products by sharing technologies, reduce operational costs due to economies of scale and more efficiently utilize its sales and corporate infrastructure. 

Q:    What will the Oak stockholders receive in the merger?  

        A:    For
each share of Oak common stock they hold, Oak stockholders will be entitled to receive (i) 0.2323 of a share of Zoran common stock and (ii) $1.78 in
cash. 

Q:    If I am an Oak stockholder, will I be able to trade the stock I receive in the merger?  

        A:    The
shares of Zoran common stock issued to you in the merger will be freely tradeable, unless you are an affiliate of Oak. Generally, persons who are affiliates of Oak
must comply with Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933 if they wish to sell or otherwise transfer any of the shares of Zoran they receive in the merger. 

Q:    How will the merger affect Oak stock options?  

        A:    Each
option to purchase shares of Oak common stock outstanding as of the effective time of the merger will be assumed by Zoran and become exercisable for shares of Zoran
common stock after the merger, provided that the per share exercise price of the assumed Oak option, as adjusted in connection with the assumption by Zoran, would not exceed an amount, or "assumption
threshold," equal to 105% of the closing sale price of a share of Zoran common stock on the last trading day prior to the completion of the merger. The number of shares of Zoran common stock issuable
upon the exercise of each assumed Oak option will be determined by multiplying 0.3333 by the number of shares of Oak common stock underlying the option, with the resulting number being rounded down to
the nearest whole number. The per share exercise price of each assumed Oak option will be determined by dividing the aggregate exercise price of the Oak option by the number of shares of Zoran common
stock purchasable under such option, as calculated in the previous sentence. 

        Under
the terms of the merger agreement, Zoran will not assume Oak options that would, following assumption, have a per share exercise price greater than the assumption threshold, and
these options will instead terminate and cease to be outstanding in accordance with their terms as of the effective time of the merger. Immediately after the completion of the merger, Zoran will grant
each holder of these "underwater" options who remains an employee of the surviving corporation a 

nonstatutory
stock option to purchase shares of Zoran common stock to compensate such holder for the termination of his or her options. 

Q:    If I am a Zoran stockholder, what will happen to my shares in the merger?  

        A:    Your
shares will not be converted in the merger and will continue to be outstanding following the merger. 

Q:    What stockholder approvals are needed in connection with the merger?  

        A:    For
Zoran, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast, in person or by proxy, on the proposal is required to approve the issuance of the shares
of Zoran common stock in connection with the merger. Each holder of Zoran common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Four stockholders of Zoran, Levy Gerzberg, President and Chief Executive
Officer of Zoran, Camillo Martino, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Zoran, Karl Schneider, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer of Zoran, and Isaac Shenberg,
Senior Vice President, Business and Strategic Development of Zoran, who as of the record date held an aggregate of    % of the outstanding Zoran common stock, are parties to voting
agreements with Oak and have agreed, among other things, to vote all of their shares of Zoran common stock in favor of the proposal to issue shares of Zoran common stock in connection with the merger. 

        For
Oak, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Oak common stock is required to adopt and approve the merger agreement. Each holder of Oak common
stock is entitled to one vote per share. Four stockholders of Oak, Young K. Sohn, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Oak, John S. Edmunds, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief
Financial Officer of Oak, Simon P. Dolan, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Imaging Group of Oak, and David J. Power, Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of Oak, who as of the
record date held an aggregate of    % of the outstanding Oak common stock, are parties to voting agreements with Zoran and have agreed, among other things, to vote all of their shares of
Oak common stock in favor of the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. 

Q:    What risks should I consider in deciding whether to vote for the merger?  

        A:    You
should consider the risk factors set forth in the section entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on page 19 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

Q:    What are the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to Oak stockholders?  

        A:    We
expect that the merger will be tax-free to you for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except that you will recognize taxable gain, if any, equal to the
lesser of (1) the sum of the fair market value of the shares of Zoran common stock you receive plus the amount of cash you receive, minus the tax basis of your shares of Oak common stock, or
(2) the amount of cash you receive. 

        For
a more detailed description of the tax consequences of the merger, you should review the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled "The Merger and Related
TransactionsU.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations" beginning on page 76. The tax consequences to each Oak stockholder will depend on the facts of that stockholder's own situation.
Oak stockholders should consult their own tax advisors to determine their particular tax consequences. 

Q:    What do I need to do to cast my vote?  

        A:    To
vote your shares, you should mail your signed proxy card or instruction form in the enclosed return envelope or vote via the Internet or by telephone as instructed on
your enclosed proxy 

card
or instruction form as soon as possible so that your shares may be represented at the Zoran or Oak stockholders' meeting. If your shares are held in "street name" by your broker, your broker will
vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote. You should follow the directions provided by your broker regarding how to instruct your broker to vote your shares. Without
instructions, your shares will not be voted at the stockholders' meeting. 

Q:    What if I don't vote?  

        A:    If
an Oak stockholder fails to respond, or if such stockholder responds but abstains from voting, it will have the same effect as a vote against the merger. If a Zoran
stockholder fails to respond, or if such stockholder responds but abstains from voting, it will not affect the outcome of the vote directly but could affect Zoran's ability to achieve a quorum. If a
stockholder of either company responds and does not indicate how he or she wants to vote, the proxy will be counted as a vote in favor of the merger or in favor of the issuance of Zoran common stock
in the merger, as the case may be. 

Q:    Can I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy?  

        A:    Yes.
You can change your vote by delivering a signed notice of revocation or a subsequently dated, signed proxy card to the corporate secretary of Zoran or Oak, as the
case may be, before the annual or special meeting, as appropriate, via the Internet or by telephone, or by attending the stockholders' meeting and voting in person. 

Q:    If I am an Oak stockholder, should I send in my stock certificates now?  

        A:    No.
You will receive written instructions from the Exchange Agent on how to exchange your Oak stock certificates for shares of Zoran common stock and cash. Please do not
send in your stock certificates with your proxy. 

Q:    If I am an Oak stockholder, am I entitled to appraisal rights?  

        A:    Yes.
Under Delaware law, you are entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger. For a more detailed description of the appraisal rights and the requirements
to perfect such appraisal rights, see the section in this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled "The Merger and the Related TransactionsAppraisal Rights for Oak Stockholders"
beginning on page 81.

 Overview and Structure of the Merger (see page 47)  

        Under the terms of the merger agreement, Oak will merge with and into Zinc Acquisition Corporation, a newly formed and wholly-owned subsidiary of Zoran. Zinc
Acquisition Corporation will

the surviving corporation in the merger. Effective upon the filing of the certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State, Zinc Acquisition Corporation intends to change its name to Oak

 Reasons for the Merger (see pages 53 through 57)  

        The Zoran and Oak boards of directors have determined that the merger agreement, including, in the case of Zoran, the issuance of shares of Zoran common stock to
Oak stockholders, is in the best interests of their respective stockholders. The board of directors of each company believes that combining Zoran and Oak will create the following benefits: 


increased
product offerings in the digital consumer electronics and imaging markets;


combined
technological skills in the consumer home entertainment markets;


increased
manufacturing efficiencies;


opportunities
to accelerate sales growth by selling complementary products to each other's customers; and


opportunities
to reduce overhead and redundant costs to enhance the efficient use of capital. 

        To
review the reasons for the merger in greater detail, as well as the related risks and uncertainties, see pages 54 through 58. 

 The Stockholders' Meetings (see pages 43 through 46)  

        Annual Meeting of the Zoran Stockholders.
    The Zoran annual meeting will be held at Zoran's corporate headquarters located at
3112 Scott Boulevard, Santa Clara, California 95054 on              , 2003, starting at 2:00 p.m. local time. 

        Special Meeting of the Oak Stockholders.
    The Oak special meeting will be held at Oak's corporate headquarters located at 1390

 Recommendations to Stockholders (see page 53)  

 To Zoran Stockholders:  

        Zoran's board of directors believes that the merger is in the best interests of Zoran's stockholders and unanimously recommends that Zoran's stockholders vote 

"FOR"
 the issuance of shares of Zoran common stock in connection with the merger. 

 To Oak Stockholders:  

        Oak's board of directors believes that the merger is in the best interests of Oak's stockholders and unanimously recommends that Oak's stockholders vote 

"FOR"
 the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. 

 Risks Relating to the Merger (see pages 19 through 42)  

        In considering whether to vote your shares in favor of the merger and related matters, stockholders of each of Oak and Zoran should consider various risks
relating to the merger, including risks associated with a fixed exchange ratio, risks relating to the integration of the companies, and risks relating to the companies' respective businesses. We urge
you to read carefully the risk factors described in the section entitled "Risk Factors" on pages 19 through 42 in making your decision. 

 What Oak Stockholders Will Receive in the Merger (see page 84).  

        Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding share of Oak common stock will be automatically converted into the right to receive (i) 0.2323 of a share
of Zoran common stock and (ii) $1.78 in cash. Oak stockholders will also receive cash as payment for fractional shares resulting from the conversion of the shares of Oak common stock into
shares of Zoran common stock. 

 Stock Option Plans and Stock Purchase Plan (see pages 85 through 86).  

        The merger agreement provides that all options to purchase Oak common stock outstanding under Oak's stock option plans as of the effective time of the merger and
that would, upon assumption by Zoran, have a per share exercise price that does not exceed an amount, or the "assumption threshold," equal to 105% of the closing sale price of a share of Zoran common
stock on the last trading day prior to the completion of the merger will be assumed by Zoran and converted into options to purchase 0.3333 of a share of Zoran common stock for each share of Oak common
stock underlying the Oak option. Any Oak options that would, upon assumption by Zoran, have a per share exercise price exceeding the assumption threshold, will not be assumed by Zoran and instead will
terminate and cease
to be outstanding in accordance with their terms as of the effective time of the merger. Immediately after completion of the merger, Zoran will grant each holder of such options who remains an
employee of the surviving corporation a nonstatutory stock option to purchase a number of shares of Zoran common stock determined by multiplying the number of shares underlying the terminated Oak
option by a valuation ratio and by further multiplying the resulting number by 0.3333. You should review the section entitled "The Merger Agreement and Related AgreementsOak Stock
Options" for a more complete description of how options to purchase Oak common stock are being treated in the merger. 

        Immediately
prior to completion of the merger, Oak will apply any funds credited as of that date under the Oak employee stock purchase plan within each participant's payroll withholding
account to the purchase of shares of Oak common stock in accordance with the terms of that plan. Any shares of Oak common stock purchased under the plan will then be converted into shares of Zoran
common stock and cash as provided in the merger agreement. 

 Stock Ownership Following the Merger (see page 19).  

        Based on the number of shares of Oak common stock issued and outstanding on a fully-diluted basis calculated using the treasury stock method as of May 4,
2003, the holders of Oak common stock will own approximately 33.4% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis calculated using the treasury stock method. 

 Conditions to Completion of the Merger (see pages 90 through 91).  

        The merger will not be completed unless specific conditions are met, including the approval of the merger and related matters by the Oak stockholders and the
Zoran stockholders, Zoran's and Oak's respective representations and warranties being true and correct as of the closing, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on the relevant party or the consummation of the merger, expiration of the waiting period under United States antitrust laws, and Zoran and Oak each having complied in all material respects with their
respective obligations under the merger agreement. 

 "No Solicitation" Provisions (see pages 88 through 89).  

        The merger agreement contains detailed provisions that prohibit both Oak and Zoran from initiating or engaging in discussions with a third party regarding certain
extraordinary transactions, including a business combination, sale of substantial assets, or sale of a material number of shares of their capital stock until the completion of the merger or the
termination of the merger agreement. The merger agreement does not, however, prohibit the board of directors of either Oak or Zoran from 

considering
and possibly recommending an unsolicited bona fide written superior proposal from a third party in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to its respective company's stockholders. 

 Termination of the Merger Agreement (see pages 91 through 92).  

        Zoran and Oak can jointly agree to terminate the merger agreement at any time. Either company may also terminate the merger agreement in certain other
circumstances, including the following: 


the
merger is not completed by December 4, 2003, so long as the failure to complete the merger is not the result of the failure by that company to fulfill its
obligations under the merger agreement, and provided that this deadline can be extended for up to 90 days if the delay is due to the absence of legal approvals or third-party consents and such
approvals or consents can reasonably be expected to be obtained within such 90-day period;


the
other company fails to obtain the requisite approval of its stockholders at its stockholders' meeting;


the
other company materially breaches its representations and warranties or fails to perform its obligations under the merger agreement;


the
other company's board of directors has failed to recommend the merger to its stockholders or has withdrawn or adversely modified its recommendation of the merger; or


the
terminating company's board of directors has determined to recommend an alternative transaction to its stockholders after having made a determination that such
transaction constitutes a superior proposal. 

 Payment of Termination Fees (see pages 92 through 93).  

        The merger agreement provides that each company will pay a termination fee in the amount of $10,740,000 under the following circumstances: 


Oak
is required to pay Zoran the termination fee if (1) Zoran terminates the merger agreement because, at the Oak stockholders' meeting, the Oak stockholders do not
approve the adoption of the merger agreement and, at the time of the Oak stockholder vote, there is an alternative transaction with respect to Oak that has been publicly announced or disclosed,
(2) Zoran terminates the merger agreement because Oak's board of directors has failed to recommend the merger to its stockholders or has withdrawn or adversely modified its recommendation of
the merger, or (3) Oak terminates the merger agreement in favor of a superior proposal;


Zoran
is required to pay Oak the termination fee if (1) Oak terminates the merger agreement because, at the Zoran stockholders' meeting, the Zoran stockholders do not
approve the issuance of the shares of Zoran common stock in connection with the merger and, at the time of the Zoran stockholder vote, there is an alternative transaction with respect to Zoran that
has been publicly announced or disclosed, (2) Oak terminates the merger agreement because Zoran's board of directors has failed to recommend that its stockholders approve the issuance of shares
of Zoran common stock in the merger or has withdrawn or adversely modified its recommendation of the merger, or (3) Zoran terminates the merger agreement in favor of a superior proposal. 

 Opinions of Financial Advisors (see pages 57 through 73).  

        In deciding to approve the merger, the board of directors of each of Zoran and Oak considered, among other things, opinions from their respective financial
advisors. 

        The
board of directors of Zoran received an opinion from Merrill Lynch that, as of the date of the opinion, and based upon and subject to the assumptions, considerations and limitations
set forth in its opinion, the merger consideration was fair from a financial point of view to Zoran. The board of 

directors
of Oak received an opinion from Morgan Stanley that, as of the date of the opinion, and based upon and subject to the assumptions, considerations and limitations set forth in its opinion,
the consideration to be received by the holders of Oak common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders. The full text of these opinions are
attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex D and Annex E, respectively. We urge you to read the opinions carefully. 

 Board Composition Following the Merger (see pages 161 through 162)  

        The merger agreement provides that Zoran will expand its board of directors to nine members, and will elect three directors of Oak to serve on Zoran's board of
directors, effective upon the completion of the merger. David Rynne, Peter Simone and Young Sohn have been designated as the Oak directors who will be elected to Zoran's board. 

 Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (see pages 73 through 76)  

        Some of the directors and executive officers of Oak have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Oak stockholders
generally. These interests include, among other things, employment with, or the performance of consulting services for, Zoran, service as directors of the combined company, severance payments in
connection with the merger, acceleration of option vesting in connection with the merger, and the right to continued indemnification and insurance coverage by Zoran for acts or omissions occurring
prior to the merger. 

 Accounting Treatment of the Merger (see page 79)  

        Under generally accepted accounting principles, Zoran will account for the merger using the purchase method of accounting. Under the purchase method of
accounting, the purchase price recorded by Zoran will be equal to the market value of its common stock issued and the cash paid to the Oak stockholders in connection with the merger and the fair value
of the Oak options that will be assumed by Zoran, each determined at the date of the merger, plus the amount of directly related acquisition costs. 

 Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (see pages 76 through 79)  

        It is a condition to completion of the merger that Zoran and Oak receive opinions from their respective legal counsel that the merger constitutes a
"reorganization" within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. If the merger qualifies as a reorganization, Oak stockholders will not recognize any loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, but will recognize gain, if any (measured by the sum of the fair market value of the shares of Zoran common stock received plus the amount of cash received, minus the tax basis of the shares
of Oak common stock exchanged in the merger), but only to the extent of the amount of cash received. 

 Regulatory Matters (see pages 79 through 80)  

        Under U.S. antitrust laws, Zoran and Oak may not complete the merger until they have notified the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal
Trade Commission of the merger and filed the necessary report forms, and until a required waiting period has ended. Zoran and Oak filed the required information and materials to notify the Department
of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission of the merger on May 23, 2003, and the waiting period will expire on June 23, 2003. 

        Zoran
and Oak must obtain any consents, authorizations, approvals, filings or exemptions in connection with compliance with the rules of The NASDAQ National Market and make such filings
and approvals as are required to be made or obtained under the securities or "Blue Sky" laws of various states in connection with the issuance of Zoran common stock. 

 Appraisal Rights (see pages 81 through 83)  

        If the merger is consummated, Oak stockholders will be entitled to seek appraisal rights in connection with the merger under Delaware law. 

 Completion and Effectiveness of the Merger  

        Zoran and Oak will complete the merger when all of the conditions to completion of the merger are satisfied or waived in accordance with the merger agreement. The
merger will become effective when Zoran files a certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State. Provided that the stockholders of both Oak and Zoran approve the merger proposals at their
respective meetings, Zoran and Oak expect to complete the merger promptly following the meetings. 

 Listing of Zoran Common Stock and Delisting and Deregistration of Oak Common Stock (see page 80)  

        Application will be made to have the shares of Zoran common stock issued in the merger approved for listing on The NASDAQ National Market, where Zoran's common
stock is currently traded under the symbol "ZRAN." If the merger is completed, Oak common stock will cease to be listed on The NASDAQ National Market and will be deregistered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, and Oak will cease to file periodic reports with the SEC. 

PROPOSAL 2:    ELECTION OF DIRECTORS OF ZORAN (see pages 160 through 163)  

        At the Zoran annual meeting, Levy Gerzberg, Uzia Galil, James D. Meindl, James B. Owens, Jr., Arthur B. Stabenow and Philip M.
Young will stand for reelection to serve as directors until the next annual meeting of the Zoran stockholders. 

PROPOSAL 3:    APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT TO ZORAN'S CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION (see pages 164 through 165)  

        At
the Zoran annual meeting, stockholders will be asked to approve an amendment to Zoran's certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Zoran common stock
from 55,000,000 to 105,000,000. 

PROPOSAL 4:    APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT TO ZORAN'S 1995 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (see pages 166 through 169)  

        At
the Zoran annual meeting, stockholders will be asked to approve an amendment to Zoran's 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares of Zoran common stock
authorized for issuance under such plan. 

PROPOSAL 5:    RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS OF ZORAN (see page 170)  

        At the Zoran annual meeting, stockholders will be asked to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Zoran's independent accountants for the year
ending December 31, 2003.

SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA
  COMBINED FINANCIAL DATA
  OF ZORAN AND OAK    

        The following information has been derived from the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements set forth elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus
and should be read in connection with that information. 

        The
unaudited pro forma combined financial information illustrates the estimated effects of the merger as if the merger had occurred at January 1, 2002 for the statement of
operations information and at March 31, 2003 for the balance sheet information. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information has been prepared based on the purchase method of
accounting and does not include the impact of non-recurring charges directly attributable to the merger. The basic and diluted unaudited pro forma per share information for Zoran is based on the
weighted average number of outstanding shares of Zoran common stock, adjusted to include the estimated number of shares of Zoran common stock that would be issued in the merger. 

        Under
the merger agreement, each share of Oak common stock outstanding on the date of consummation will be exchanged for 0.2323 of a share of Zoran common stock plus $1.78 in cash. The
estimated purchase price of $446.3 reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements was computed assuming the acquisition was consummated on June 3, 2003. Neither the final
number of Zoran shares to be issued, nor the value of such shares, will be known until the date of consummation of the merger. The actual purchase price will be determined on the basis of the number
of shares of Oak common stock outstanding on the date of completion of the merger, the market value of Zoran common stock on that date, the actual number of shares of Zoran common stock issuable upon
exercise of the assumed Oak options and the determination of actual direct merger costs. 

        The
following information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial position that would have occurred had the
merger been consummated on January 1, 2002 or March 31, 2003 nor is it necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial position.

Recent Share Price  

        On May 2, 2003, the last trading day before the proposed merger was announced, the closing price of Zoran common stock on The NASDAQ National Market was
$17.64 per share and the closing price of Oak common stock on The NASDAQ National Market was $4.74 per share. On            , 2003, the last trading day prior to the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, the closing price of Zoran common stock on The NASDAQ National Market was $    per share, the closing price of Oak common stock on The NASDAQ National Market was
$    per share. 

        The
information above shows only historical comparisons. We urge you to obtain current market quotations for Zoran common stock and Oak common stock. No assurances can be given as to the
market prices of Zoran common stock or Oak common stock at any time before the consummation of the merger or as to the market price of Zoran common stock at any time after the consummation of the
merger. Because the exchange ratio is fixed, the exchange ratio will not be adjusted for decreases in the market price of Zoran common stock, which may occur before the merger becomes effective. In
the event the market price of Zoran common stock increases or decreases prior to the consummation of the merger, the value of the Zoran common stock to be received in the merger in exchange for the
Oak common stock would correspondingly decrease or increase. 

        Following
the merger, all Oak common stock will be owned by Zoran, and as a result, Oak common stock will no longer be listed on The NASDAQ National Market. 

Dividend Information  

        Neither Zoran nor Oak has ever declared or paid cash dividends on its common stock. If the merger is not consummated, Oak anticipates that it would continue its
policy of retaining any and all earnings to finance the operation and expansion of its business. Zoran currently anticipates that it will retain all available funds for use in its business and does
not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, whether or not the merger is consummated. 

CAUTIONARY INFORMATION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS    

        The Securities and Exchange Commission encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company's future
prospects and make informed investment decisions. This joint proxy statement/prospectus contains such "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. These statements may be made directly in this joint proxy statement/prospectus referring to Zoran and Oak, and they may also be made a part of this joint proxy statement/prospectus by reference
to other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Zoran and Oak, which is known as "incorporation by reference." These statements may include information regarding the period
following completion of the merger. Words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expects," "projects," "intends," "plans," "believes" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any
discussion of future operating or financial performance, or the merger of Zoran and Oak, identify forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are management's present expectations of
future events and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, including the risks
described in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus under the section entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on page 19. Stockholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of
the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus or the date of the document incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Neither Zoran nor Oak is under any obligation, and
each expressly disclaims any obligation, to update or alter any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

        All
subsequent forward-looking statements attributable to Zoran or Oak or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements
contained or referred to in this section. 

RISK FACTORS    

        The following risk factors should be considered by Oak stockholders in evaluating whether to approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger and by
Zoran stockholders in evaluating whether to approve the issuance of shares of Zoran common stock in connection with the merger. Oak stockholders voting in favor of the approval and adoption of the
merger agreement will be choosing to exchange your current investment in Oak common stock for an investment in Zoran common stock. An investment in Zoran common stock involves a high degree of risk.
In addition to the other information contained in or annexed to this joint proxy statement/prospectus, you should carefully consider the following risk factors. 

Risks Relating to the Merger  

Changes in stock prices could decrease the value of the Zoran common stock to be issued in the merger.  

        Upon completion of the merger, each share of Oak common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.2323 of a share of Zoran common stock and $1.78 in
cash. The exchange ratio for the merger consideration is fixed, and neither the exchange ratio for the stock portion of the merger consideration nor the $1.78 per share cash consideration will be
adjusted in the event of any increase or decrease in the market price of either Oak common stock or Zoran common stock. The prices of Zoran common stock and Oak common stock at the closing of the
merger might vary from their prices on the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and on the date of the stockholders' meetings. These prices might vary because of changes in the business,
operations or prospects of Zoran or Oak, investors' assessments of the likelihood that the merger will be completed, the timing of the completion of the merger, the perceived prospects of
post-merger operations for the combined company, regulatory considerations, general market and economic conditions and other factors. Neither Zoran nor Oak is permitted to abandon the
merger nor is Oak permitted to resolicit the vote of its stockholders solely because of changes in the market price of either Zoran common stock or Oak common stock. Therefore, because the market
price of Zoran's common stock is subject to fluctuation, the value of the Zoran shares to be received by Oak stockholders in the merger will depend on the market price of Zoran shares at the effective
time of the merger and could be substantially less than the value of the Zoran shares at the time the merger agreement was executed. 

        The
market price of Zoran common stock has historically been highly volatile and may continue to be so in the future. In addition to conditions that affect the market for stocks of
technology companies generally, factors such as new product announcements by Zoran or its competitors, quarterly fluctuations in Zoran's operating results and challenges associated with the
integration of Oak's business may have a significant impact on the market price of Zoran shares. These conditions could cause the price of Zoran shares to fluctuate substantially over short periods. 

The issuance of shares of Zoran common stock in the merger will substantially reduce the percentage interests of current Zoran stockholders.  

        Based on the number of shares of Oak common stock issued and outstanding on a fully diluted basis as of May 4, 2003 calculated using the treasury stock
method, former Oak stockholders will own approximately 33.4% of the combined company on a fully-diluted basis calculated using the treasury stock method following the completion of the merger. In
addition, "underwater" Oak options held by former Oak employees who continue as employees of Zoran will be replaced with newly issued options to purchase Zoran common stock following completion of the
merger. The issuance of these shares in connection with the merger will cause a significant reduction in the relative percentage interests of current Zoran stockholders in earnings, voting power,
liquidation value and book and market value. 

The combined company may not achieve strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits.  

        Both companies expect to realize strategic and other financial and operating benefits as a result of the merger, including, among other things, significant cost
savings. However, neither company can predict with certainty the extent to which these benefits will actually be achieved or the timing of any such benefits. The following are factors that may prevent
the combined company from realizing these benefits: 


the
inability of the combined company to increase product sales;


unfavorable
customer reaction to the combined company's products;


competitive
factors, including technological advances attained by competitors and patents granted to or contested by competitors, which would enhance their ability to
compete against the combined company;


the
failure of key markets for the combined company's products to develop to the extent or as rapidly as currently expected;


changes
in technology that increase the number of competitors that the combined company faces after the merger or require the combined company to make significant capital
expenditures to develop competitive products; and


the
failure to retain key employees. 

        Failure
to achieve the strategic objectives of the merger could have a material adverse effect on the revenues, the levels of expenses and the operating results of the combined company
and could result in the combined company not achieving the anticipated potential benefits of the merger. In addition, Zoran and Oak cannot assure you that the growth rate of the combined company will
equal the historical growth rate experienced by either Zoran or Oak. 

Zoran and Oak may not successfully integrate their businesses and may not realize the anticipated benefits of the merger.  

        Achieving the benefits of the merger will depend in substantial part on the successful integration of the two companies' technologies, operations and personnel.
Zoran and Oak will face significant challenges in integrating their organizations and operations in a timely and efficient manner. Some of the challenges involved in this integration include: 


demonstrating
to the customers of Zoran and Oak that the merger will not result in adverse changes in client service standards or business focus and helping customers
conduct business easily with the combined company;


consolidating
and rationalizing corporate, IT, engineering and administrative infrastructures;


integrating
product offerings;


coordinating
sales and marketing efforts to effectively communicate the capabilities of the combined company;


coordinating
and rationalizing research and development activities to enhance introduction of new products and technologies with reduced cost; and


preserving
important relationships of both Zoran and Oak and resolving potential conflicts that may arise. 

        The
integration of Zoran and Oak will be a complex, time consuming and expensive process and will require significant attention from management and other personnel, which may distract
their attention from the day-to-day business of the combined company. The diversion of management's 

attention
and any difficulties associated with integrating Oak into Zoran could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of the combined company after the merger and the value of Zoran
shares, and could result in the combined company not achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger. It is not certain that Zoran and Oak can be successfully integrated in a timely manner or at all
or that any of the anticipated benefits will be realized. Failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the business and operating results of the combined company. 

To be successful, the combined company must retain and motivate key employees, which will be more difficult in light of uncertainty regarding the
merger, and failure to do so could seriously harm the combined company.  

        To be successful, the combined company must retain and motivate executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, marketing and
information technology support positions.
Employees of Zoran or Oak may experience uncertainty about their future role with the combined company until or after strategies with regard to the combined company are announced or executed. This
potential uncertainty may adversely affect the combined company's ability to attract and retain key personnel. The combined company must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on
the strategies and goals of the combined company, which may be particularly difficult due to the potential distractions of the merger or the loss of key employees due to such uncertainties. 

If customers delay or defer purchasing decisions as a result of the merger, the operating results and prospects of the combined company could be
adversely affected.  

        Oak and Zoran cannot assure you that their customers will continue their current buying patterns. Oak's or Zoran's customers may delay or defer purchasing
decisions in response to the announcement of the proposed merger. Any such delay or deferral in purchasing decisions by such customers could have a material adverse effect on the business or operating
results of Oak or Zoran, regardless of whether the merger is ultimately completed. 

Some of Oak's officers and directors have interests that differ from other stockholders' interests and may influence them to support and approve the
merger.  

        Some of the officers and directors of Oak have interests in the merger that differ from the interests of other Oak stockholders. For example, Young K. Sohn,
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Oak, John S. Edmunds, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Oak, and Simon Dolan, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Imaging
Group of Oak, have entered into employment agreements with Zoran. In addition, David Auld, Chief Technical Officer, has also entered into an employment agreement with Zoran. These arrangements include
option grants, annual salaries and bonus payments in amounts which may exceed their current arrangements with Oak, together with benefits generally comparable to those available to Zoran's other
senior executives. As a result, these officers could be more likely to support the proposal to approve the merger agreement and the merger than if they did not have these interests. In addition, three
directors of Oak, David Rynne, Peter Simone and Young Sohn, will join Zoran's board of directors upon completion of the merger. As of the record date, Oak's executive officers, directors and principal
stockholders together owned approximately             shares of Oak common stock, which represents approximately      % of all outstanding shares of Oak
common stock entitled to
vote at the special meeting of Oak stockholders. John S. Edmunds, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Oak, Young K. Sohn, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of Oak, Simon
Dolan, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Imaging Group of Oak, and David J. Power, Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of Oak, have entered into voting agreements requiring them to
vote in favor of the merger. Oak stockholders should review the section titled "Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger" beginning on page       for a complete description of these
employment and consulting arrangements and voting agreements. 

As a result of the merger, the combined company will be a larger and more geographically diverse organization, and if the combined company's management
is unable to manage the combined organization efficiently, its operating results will suffer.  

        Following the merger, the combined company will have approximately 650 employees. As a result, the combined company will face challenges inherent in efficiently
managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs. The inability to manage
successfully the geographically more diverse and substantially larger combined organization could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of the combined company after the merger and,
as a result, on the market price of Zoran's common stock. 

Charges to earnings resulting from the merger may adversely affect the market value of Zoran's common stock following the merger.  

        In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the combined company will account for the merger using the purchase method of accounting, which
will result in charges to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on the market value of Zoran's common stock following completion of the merger. Under the purchase method of accounting,
the combined company will allocate the total estimated purchase price to Oak's net tangible assets, amortizable intangible assets, intangible assets with indefinite lives and in-process research and
development based on their fair values as of the date of completion of the merger, and record the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill. The portion of the estimated purchase
price allocated to in-process research and development will be expensed by the combined company in the quarter in which the merger is completed. The combined company will incur additional depreciation
and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in connection with the merger. In addition, to the extent the value of goodwill or
intangible assets with indefinite lives becomes impaired, the combined company may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. These depreciation, amortization,
in-process research and development and potential impairment charges could have a material impact on the combined company's results of operations. 

Zoran and Oak expect to incur significant costs associated with the merger which could adversely affect future liquidity and operating results.  

        Zoran estimates that it will incur transaction costs of approximately $5.5 million associated with the merger, which will be included as a part of the
total purchase costs for accounting purposes. Oak estimates that it will incur transaction costs of approximately $5.3 million which will be expensed as incurred. These amounts are estimates
and could increase. In addition, Zoran and Oak believe that the combined entity may incur charges to operations, in amounts that are not currently reasonably estimable, in the quarter in which the
merger is completed or in subsequent quarters, to reflect costs associated with integrating the two companies. The combined company may incur additional material charges in subsequent quarters to
reflect additional costs associated with the merger. These significant
costs associated with the merger could adversely affect the future liquidity and operating results of the combined company. 

Zoran and Oak may be unable to obtain the required regulatory approvals for completing the merger and the merger may not close.  

        As a condition to the obligations of Zoran and Oak to complete the merger, the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
of 1976, or the HSR Act, must have expired or been terminated. In addition to the U.S. regulatory antitrust requirements under the HSR Act, the merger may be subject to foreign antitrust laws or
foreign governmental approval requirements, which 

will
require the companies to make filings with applicable foreign governmental authorities. Regulators may require Zoran, Oak or the combined company to agree to operating restrictions, before or
after receipt of Oak stockholder approval. If Zoran and Oak decline to agree to such restrictions, the merger might not be completed. If any agreements regarding operating restrictions are required
under applicable law or by governmental authorities, under the terms of the merger agreement, neither Zoran nor Oak is obligated to agree to the divestiture of any businesses, product lines or assets.
In addition, even if regulatory approvals are obtained, any federal, state or foreign governmental entity or any private person may challenge the merger at any time before or after its completion. 

The merger may fail to qualify as a reorganization, resulting in recognition by Oak stockholders of taxable gain or loss in respect of Oak shares.  

        Zoran and Oak intend the merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Although the Internal
Revenue Service, or IRS, has not provided a ruling on the matter, each of Zoran and Oak will obtain a legal opinion from its respective tax counsel that the merger will constitute a reorganization for
federal income tax purposes. The opinions furnished by Zoran's and Oak's tax counsel will not bind the IRS or prevent the IRS from adopting a contrary position. If the merger fails to qualify as a
reorganization, Oak stockholders generally would recognize gain or loss on each share of Oak common stock surrendered in an amount equal to the difference between the adjusted tax basis in that share
and the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value of the Zoran common stock received in exchange for that share upon completion of the merger. 

Risks Relating to Zoran, Oak and the Combined Company  

Zoran's and Oak's quarterly revenues and operating results fluctuate due to a variety of factors, which may result in volatility or a decline in the
prices of their stock and of the stock of the combined company.  

        Zoran's and Oak's quarterly operating results have varied significantly due to a number of factors, including: 


fluctuation
in demand for their products;


the
timing of new product introductions or enhancements by Zoran, Oak and their competitors;


the
level of market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of their products and their customers' products;


the
timing or cancellation of large customer orders;


the
length and variability of the sales cycle for their products;


pricing
policy changes by Oak and Zoran and their competitors and suppliers;


the
cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry;


the
availability of development funding and the timing of development revenue;


changes
in the mix of products sold;


seasonality
in demand for their products;


increased
competition in product lines, and competitive pricing pressures; and


the
evolving and unpredictable nature of the markets for products incorporating Zoran's and Oak's integrated circuits and embedded software. 

        Zoran
and Oak expect that their operating results and those of the combined company will continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of these factors and a variety of other factors,
including: 


the
cost and availability of adequate foundry capacity;


fluctuations
in manufacturing yields;


changes
in or the emergence of new industry standards;


failure
to anticipate changing customer product requirements;


the
loss or gain of important customers;


product
obsolescence; and


the
amount of research and development expenses associated with new product introductions. 

        The
operating results of Zoran, Oak and the combined company could also be harmed by: 


economic
conditions generally or in various geographic areas where they or their customers do business;


acts
of terrorism and international conflicts or crises, such as the recent outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS;


other
conditions affecting the timing of customer orders;


changes
in governmental regulations that could affect their products; or


a
downturn in the markets for their customers' products, particularly the consumer electronics market. 

        These
factors are difficult or impossible to forecast. Zoran and Oak place orders with independent foundries several months in advance of the scheduled delivery date, often in advance of
receiving non-cancelable orders from their customers. This limits their ability to react to fluctuations in demand for their products. If anticipated shipments in any quarter are canceled
or do not occur as quickly as expected, or if Zoran or Oak fails to foresee a technology change that could render a product obsolete, expense and inventory levels could be disproportionately high. If
anticipated license revenues in any quarter are canceled or do not occur, gross margins may be reduced. A significant portion of Zoran's and Oak's expenses are relatively fixed, and the timing of
increases in expenses is based in large part on their forecast of future revenues. As a result, if revenues do not
meet Zoran's, Oak's and the combined company's expectations, they may be unable to quickly adjust expenses to levels appropriate to actual revenues, which could harm their operating results. 

        Product
supply and demand fluctuations common to the semiconductor industry are historically characterized by periods of manufacturing capacity shortages immediately followed by periods
of overcapacity, which are caused by the addition of manufacturing capacity in large increments. The industry has moved from a period of capacity shortages in 2000 to the current condition of excess
capacity. Zoran and Oak cannot predict whether they can or will achieve timely, cost-effective access to that capacity when needed, or if there will be a capacity shortage again in the
future. 

        As
a result of these factors, Zoran's, Oak's and the combined company's operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Any shortfall in revenues or net income from
levels expected by the investment community could cause a decline in the trading prices of these companies' stock. 

Zoran's and Oak's customers experience fluctuating product cycles and seasonality, which causes their sales to fluctuate.  

        Because the markets that Zoran's and Oak's customers serve are characterized by numerous new product introductions and rapid product enhancements, their operating
results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. During the final production of a mature product, Zoran's and Oak's customers typically exhaust their existing inventory of these companies'
products. Consequently, orders for such products may decline in those circumstances, even if the products are incorporated into both mature products and replacement products. A delay in the customer's
transition to commercial production of a replacement product would delay Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's ability to recover the lost sales from the discontinuation of the related mature
product. Zoran's and Oak's customers also experience significant seasonality in the sales of their consumer products, which affects their orders of these companies' products. Typically, the second
half of the calendar year represents a disproportionate percentage of sales for each company's customers due to the holiday shopping period for consumer electronics products, and therefore, a
disproportionate percentage of Zoran's and Oak's sales. Zoran and Oak expect these sales fluctuations to continue for the foreseeable future. 

Product supply and demand in the semiconductor industry is subject to cyclical variations.  

        The semiconductor industry is subject to cyclical variations in product supply and demand. Downturns in the industry often occur in connection with, or
anticipation of, maturing product cycles for both semiconductor companies and their customers and declines in general economic conditions. These
downturns have been characterized by abrupt fluctuations in product demand, production over-capacity and accelerated decline of average selling prices. In some cases, these downturns have
lasted more than one year. A downturn in the semiconductor industry could harm Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's sales and revenues if demand drops, or their gross margins if average selling
prices decline. 

Zoran's, Oak's and the combined company's success for the foreseeable future will be dependent on growth in demand for integrated circuits for a limited
number of applications.  

        In
recent years Zoran has derived a substantial majority of its product revenues from the sale of integrated circuits for DVD and digital camera applications. Zoran expects that sales of
its products for these applications will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenues for the foreseeable future. Following the recent transfer of its Optical Storage business to
Sunplus, Oak's future financial performance will increasingly depend on its ability to successfully develop and market next generation and new products in the digital television, HDTV and digital
imaging markets. If the markets for these products and applications decline or fail to develop as expected, or Zoran, Oak or the combined company is not successful in its efforts to market and sell
its products to manufacturers who incorporate integrated circuits into these products, its financial results will be harmed. 

Zoran's, Oak's and the combined company's financial performance is highly dependent on the timely and successful introduction of new and enhanced
products.  

        Zoran's, Oak's and the combined company's financial performance depends in large part on its ability to successfully develop and market next-generation and new
products in a rapidly changing technological environment. If Zoran, Oak or the combined company fails to successfully identify new product opportunities and timely develop and introduce new products
that achieve market acceptance, it may lose its market share and its future revenue and earnings may suffer. In recent years, Zoran's success has been dependent on its successful development and
timely introduction of integrated circuits for DVD players, DVD recorders and digital cameras. These markets are characterized by the incorporation of a steadily increasing level of integration and
numbers of features on a chip at the 

same
or lower system cost, enabling original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, to continually improve the features or reduce the prices of the systems they sell. If Zoran or the combined company is
unable to continually develop and introduce integrated circuits that feature increasing levels of integration and new features at competitive prices, its operating results will suffer. 

        In
the consumer electronics market, Oak's performance has been highly dependent upon the successful development and timely introduction of new products and solutions for broadband
digital television and HDTV. In the digital office market, Oak's performance depends on its ability to successfully develop embedded image processing system on a chip, or SOC, solutions for the
digital office market, in particular, embedded digital color copier technology and image processing chips for a variety of imaging peripherals, including printers and multi-function peripherals, or
MFPs. Among other technological changes, embedded PDF and color capability are rapidly emerging as market requirements for printers and other imaging devices. Some of Oak's competitors have the
capacity to supply these solutions, and some of their solutions are well received in the marketplace. Oak faces the challenges of developing digital television and HDTV solutions as well as developing
imaging products that will require greater color and image complexity capability, including web-based documents, and work with higher-performing devices in networked environments. If Oak
or the combined company is unable to meet these challenges with the development of products that can effectively compete in the OEM software and solutions market, its future results of operations
could suffer. 

Zoran, Oak, and the combined company must keep pace with rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards in their respective markets to
remain competitive.  

        Zoran's, Oak's and the combined company's success will depend on their ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards and their
customers' changing demands. The consumer electronics market, in particular, is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions, short
product life cycles and increasing demand for higher levels of integration. Oak's, Zoran's and the combined company's ability to adapt to these changes and to anticipate future standards, and the rate
of adoption and acceptance of those standards, will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving their competitive position and prospects for growth. If new industry standards emerge, the
companies' products or the products of their customers could become unmarketable or obsolete, and the companies could lose market share. Oak, Zoran or the combined company could be required to incur
substantial unanticipated costs to comply with these new standards. 

        Zoran's,
Oak's and the combined company's success will also depend on the successful development of new markets and the application and acceptance of new technologies and products in
those new markets. For example, Zoran's and the combined company's success will depend on the ability of their customers to develop new products and enhance existing products in the recordable DVD
player market. Oak's and the combined company's success will also depend on the ability of their customers to develop new products and enhance existing products for the broadband digital television
and HDTV markets and to introduce and promote those products successfully. These markets may not continue to develop to the extent or in the time periods that Zoran and Oak anticipates due to factors
outside of Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's control, such as delays in implementation of FCC 02-320 requiring all new televisions to include a digital receiver. If new markets do
not develop as Zoran and Oak anticipate, or if Oak's, and if the merger is completed, the combined company's products do not gain widespread acceptance in these markets, Oak's and the combined
company's business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The emergence of new markets for Zoran's, Oak's and the combined company's products is
also dependent in part upon third parties developing and marketing content in a format compatible with commercial and consumer products that incorporate Zoran's, Oak's and the combined company's
products. If content compatible with commercial and consumer products that incorporate Zoran's, Oak's and the 

combined
company's products is not available, manufacturers may not be able to sell products incorporating Zoran's, Oak's and the combined company's products, and Zoran's, Oak's and the combined
company's sales to manufacturers would suffer. 

Zoran and Oak rely on independent foundries and contractors for the manufacture, assembly and testing of their integrated circuits and other hardware
products, and the failure of any of these third parties to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested could damage Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's relationships with its customers and
harm its sales and financial results.  

        Zoran and Oak do not operate any manufacturing facilities, and they rely on independent foundries to manufacture substantially all of their products. These
independent foundries fabricate products for other companies and may also produce products of their own design. From time to time there are manufacturing capacity shortages in the semiconductor
industry. Neither Zoran nor Oak has long-term supply contracts with any of its suppliers, including Zoran's principal supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC.
Therefore, their suppliers are not obligated to manufacture products for Zoran or Oak for any specific period, in any specific quantity or at any specified price, except as may be provided in a
particular purchase order. 

        Zoran's
and Oak's reliance on independent foundries involves a number of risks, including: 


the
inability to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity;


the
unavailability of or interruption in access to certain process technologies necessary for manufacture of Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's products;


lack
of control over delivery schedules;


lack
of control over quality assurance;


lack
of control over manufacturing yields and cost; and


potential
misappropriation of Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's intellectual property. 

        In
addition, TSMC and some of Zoran's other foundries are located in areas of the world that are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes. While the 1999 earthquake in Taiwan did
not have a material impact on Zoran's independent foundries, a similar event centered near TSMC's facility could severely reduce TSMC's ability to manufacture Zoran's integrated circuits. The loss of
any of Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's manufacturers as a supplier, their inability to expand the supply of their products in response to increased demand, or any of those companies'
inability to obtain timely and adequate deliveries from its current or future suppliers due to a natural disaster or any other reason could delay or reduce shipments of its products. Any of these
circumstances could damage Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's relationships with current and prospective customers and harm its sales and financial results. 

        Zoran
and Oak also rely on independent contractors for the assembly and testing of their products. Their reliance on independent assembly and testing houses limits their control over
delivery schedules, quality assurance and product cost. Disruptions in the services provided by Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's assembly or testing houses or other circumstances that would
require them to seek alternative sources of assembly or testing could lead to supply constraints or delays in the delivery of their products. These constraints or delays could damage Zoran's, Oak's or
the combined company's relationships with current and prospective customers and harm their financial results. 

        Zoran's,
Oak's and the combined company's reliance on independent manufacturers and third party assembly and testing vendors involves a number of additional risks, including: 


the
loss of a foundry as a supplier; 


inability
to expand foundry capacity in a period of increased demand for Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's products;


inability
to obtain timely and adequate deliveries from current or future suppliers;


delays
in shipments of Oak's, Zoran's or the combined company's products, resulting in delay in recognition of revenue or receipt of payment;


product
defects and the difficulty of detecting and remedying product defects;


the
unavailability of, or interruption in access to, certain process technologies;


reduced
control over delivery schedules, quality assurance and costs; and


manufacturing
yields below acceptable minimums, particularly with respect to .13 micron processes used in Oak's HDTV products. 

        Oak
and Zoran each use a limited number of suppliers for its products. As a result, the likelihood of and the consequences from the occurrence of these factors for Zoran, Oak and the
combined company are magnified. 

Because foundry capacity is limited from time to time, Zoran, Oak or the combined company may be required to enter into costly long-term
supply arrangements to secure foundry capacity.  

        If Zoran, Oak or the combined company is not able to obtain additional foundry capacity as required, its relationships with its customers would be harmed and its
sales would likely be reduced. In order to secure additional foundry capacity, Zoran has considered, and Zoran or the combined company will continue to consider, various arrangements with suppliers,
which could include, among others: 


option
payments or other prepayments to a foundry;


nonrefundable
deposits with or loans to foundries in exchange for capacity commitments;


contracts
that commit Zoran or the combined company to purchase specified quantities of silicon wafers over extended periods;


issuance
of Zoran's equity securities to a foundry;


investment
in a foundry;


joint
ventures; or


other
partnership relationships with foundries. 

Zoran,
Oak or the combined company may not be able to make any such arrangement in a timely fashion or at all, and such arrangements, if any, may not be on terms favorable to Zoran or the combined
company. Moreover, if Zoran or the combined company is able to secure foundry capacity, it may be obligated to utilize all of that capacity or incur penalties. Such penalties may be expensive and
could harm Zoran's or the combined company's financial results. 

If Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's independent foundries do not achieve satisfactory yields, those companies' relationships with their
customers may be harmed.  

        The fabrication of silicon wafers is a complex process. Minute levels of contaminants in the manufacturing environment, defects in photomasks used to print
circuits on a wafer, difficulties in the fabrication process or other factors can cause a substantial portion of the integrated circuits on a wafer to be non-functional. Many of these
problems are difficult to detect at an early stage of the manufacturing process and may be time consuming and expensive to correct. As a result, foundries 

often
experience problems achieving acceptable yields, which are represented by the number of good integrated circuits as a proportion of the number of total integrated circuits on any particular
wafer. Poor yields from Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's independent foundries would reduce its ability to deliver its products to customers, harm its relationships with customers and harm its
business. 

Zoran and Oak face competition or potential competition from companies with greater resources than that of Zoran, Oak or the combined company, and if
Zoran, Oak or the combined company is unable to compete effectively with these companies, its market share may decline and its business could be harmed.  

        Oak and Zoran face intense competition in the markets in which they compete. Oak and Zoran expect that the level of competition will increase in the future from
existing competitors and from other companies that may enter its existing or future markets with solutions that may be less costly or provide higher performance or additional features. 

        Competition
in the compression technology market has historically been dominated by large companies, such as STMicroelectronics, and companies that develop and use their own integrated
circuits, such as Sony and Matsushita. As this market continues to develop, Zoran faces competition from other large semiconductor vendors, including: 


ALi
Corporation;


Atmel
Corporation;


Cirrus
Logic (Crystal Semiconductor);


ESS
Technology, Inc.;


Fujitsu;


LSI
Logic;


MediaTek Inc.;


Motorola;


Omnivision
Technologies, Inc.;


Sunplus
Technology; and


Texas
Instruments. 

        Zoran
also faces competition from internally developed solutions developed and used by major Japanese original equipment manufacturers, who may also be Zoran's customers. 

        Oak's
principal competitors in the broadband digital television and set top box markets include: 


ATI
Technologies;


Broadcom;


Genesis
Microchip/Pixelworks;


Sigma
Designs;


ST
Microelectronics; and


Trident
Microsystems;


in-house,
captive suppliers. 

Oak
expects competition to continue to increase as industry standards become well known and as other competitors enter its target market. 

        Oak's principal competitors in the digital office market include: 


Adobe;


Agilent;


Electronics
for Imaging, Inc.


Oasis
Semiconductor;


Peerless
Systems Corporation;


TAK
ASIC; and


in-house,
captive suppliers. 

Oak
also expects increased competition from the merchant market in the future. 

        Many
of these existing competitors, as well as OEM customers that are expected to compete in the future have substantially greater financial, manufacturing, technical, marketing,
distribution and other resources, broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than Zoran or Oak. In addition, much of Zoran's, Oak's and the combined company's success is
dependent on the success of their OEM customers. Oak's OEM customers in the digital imaging markets compete fiercely with one another for market share in a market characterized by rapid development
cycles, short product life cycles and ever-increasing consumer demand for greater performance and functionality at reduced prices. 

        The
DVD market continues to expand, and additional competitors are expected to enter the market for DVD players and software. Some of these potential competitors may develop captive
implementations for use only with their own PC and consumer electronics products. It is also possible that application software vendors, such as Microsoft, may attempt to enter the DVD application
market in the future. This increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced profit margins and loss of market share. 

        The
future growth of the digital office market is highly dependent on OEMs' continuing to outsource an increasing portion of their product development work. While the trend toward
outsourcing on the part of Oak's OEM customers has accelerated in recent years, any reversal of this trend, or a change in the way they outsource, could seriously harm Oak's or the combined company's
business. Similarly, significant market trends leading to changes in the way Oak's competitors do business may enable them to compete more effectively against Oak or the combined company than they
have in the past. Additionally, changes in strategy by its competitors, for example price reductions, new product introductions or new marketing/distribution methods, could make it more difficult for
Oak or the combined company to compete effectively, cause reduced market demand for its products or render its products obsolete. 

        If
Zoran, Oak, the combined company or their OEM customers are unable to compete successfully against their current and future competitors, Zoran, Oak or the combined company could
experience price reductions, order cancellations and reduced gross margins, any one of which could harm its business. 

Zoran's and Oak's products are characterized by average selling prices that decline over relatively short time periods; if Zoran, Oak or the combined
company is unable to reduce its costs or introduce new products with higher average selling prices, its financial results will suffer.  

        Average selling prices for Zoran's and Oak's products decline over relatively short time periods. Many of Zoran's and Oak's manufacturing costs are fixed. When
Zoran's or Oak's average selling prices decline, its revenues decline unless it sells more units, and its gross margins decline unless it is 

able
to reduce its manufacturing costs by a commensurate amount. Zoran's or Oak's operating results suffer when gross margins decline. Zoran, Oak and the combined company may experience these problems
in the future and cannot predict when they may occur or how severe they may be. 

Zoran and Oak derive most of their revenue from sales to a small number of large customers, and if Zoran, Oak or the combined company is not able to
retain these customers, or such customers reschedule, reduce or cancel orders, Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's revenues would be reduced and its financial results would suffer.  

        Zoran's and Oak's largest customers account for a substantial percentage of its revenues. In 2002, sales to Fujifilm accounted for approximately 37% of Zoran's
total revenues, and Zoran's four largest customers accounted for approximately 59% of its total revenues. Similarly, during Oak's fiscal 2002, LG Electronics accounted for 20% of Oak's total revenues
and Oak's top 10 customers accounted for approximately 69% of its total revenues. Sales to these large customers have varied significantly from year to year and will continue to fluctuate in the
future. These sales also may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Zoran, Oak or the combined company may not be able to retain its key customers, or these customers may cancel purchase
orders or reschedule or decrease their level of purchases from Zoran, Oak or the combined company. Any substantial decrease or delay in sales to one or more of Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's
key customers could harm its sales and financial results. In addition, any difficulty in collecting amounts due from one or more key customers could harm Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's
financial results. 

        Fujifilm
has been Zoran's largest customer over the last five years. Fujifilm purchases Zoran's products primarily as a reseller. Fujifilm acts as the primary reseller in Japan of
products developed by Zoran under development contracts with Fujifilm. Zoran may sell these products directly in Japan only to specified customers with Fujifilm's consent. Fujifilm provides more sales
and marketing support than Zoran's other resellers. Fujifilm has also provided funding to support Zoran's development efforts. If Zoran's relationship with Fujifilm were terminated, Zoran's or the
combined company's business could be harmed. 

Zoran's and Oak's products generally have long sales cycles and implementation periods, which increases their costs and those of the combined company in
obtaining orders and reduces the predictability of their earnings and those of the combined company.  

        Zoran's and Oak's products are technologically complex. Prospective customers generally must make a significant commitment of resources to test and evaluate
Zoran's and Oak's products and to integrate them into larger systems. As a result, Zoran's and Oak's sales processes are often subject to delays associated with lengthy approval processes that
typically accompany the design and testing of new products. The sales cycles of Zoran's and Oak's products often last for many months or even years. Longer sales cycles require Zoran and Oak to invest
significant resources in attempting to make sales and delay the generation of revenue. 

        Long
sales cycles also subject Zoran, Oak and the combined company to other risks, including customers' budgetary constraints, internal acceptance reviews and cancellations. In addition,
orders expected in one quarter could shift to another because of the timing of customers' purchase decisions. The time required for Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's customers to incorporate
those company's products into their own can vary significantly with the needs of customers and generally exceeds several months, which further complicates Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's
planning processes and reduces the predictability of its operating results. 

Zoran and Oak are not protected by long-term contracts with their customers.  

        Zoran and Oak generally do not enter into long-term purchase contracts with customers, and they cannot be certain as to future order levels from
customers. Customers generally purchase Zoran's and Oak's products subject to cancelable short-term purchase orders. Zoran and Oak cannot predict whether its current customers will
continue to place orders, whether existing orders will be canceled, or whether customers who have ordered products will pay invoices for delivered products. When Zoran or Oak does enter into a
long-term contract, the contract is generally terminable at the convenience of the customer. In the event of an early termination by one of Zoran's or Oak's major customers, it is unlikely
that Zoran, Oak or the combined company will be able to rapidly replace that revenue source, which would harm its financial results. 

        Oak
has experienced significant changes from year to year in the composition of its major customer base and believes this pattern will continue. Oak is continuing its efforts to increase
penetration in existing large customers as well as engage new large OEM customers. 

        The
current weakness in demand being experienced in the semiconductor markets, and Oak's recent entry into the digital television and HDTV markets, coupled with the overall poor
macroeconomic environment, however, makes it difficult to forecast future financial performance for Zoran, Oak and the combined company. In addition, some of Oak's customers have chosen, and may
continue to choose, to award their design wins and business on a project-by-project basis to different vendors. The current economic recession notwithstanding, the loss of, or
a significant reduction in, purchases or commitments by current major customers which is not offset by corresponding increases from other current or future customers would have a material adverse
effect on Zoran's, Oak's and the combined company's business, financial condition and results of operations. If sales to current customers cease or are reduced, Zoran, Oak and the combined company may
be unable to obtain the orders from new customers necessary to offset any such losses or reductions. 

Zoran and Oak are dependent upon their international sales and operations; economic, political or military events in a country where Zoran, Oak or the
combined company makes significant sales or has significant operations could interfere with its success or operations there and harm its business.  

        During 2002, 97% of Zoran's total revenues and 89% of Oak's total revenues were derived from international sales. Zoran and Oak anticipate that international
sales will continue to represent a significant portion of their total revenues and those of the combined company for the foreseeable future. In addition, substantially all of Zoran's and Oak's
semiconductor products are manufactured, assembled and tested outside of the United States by independent foundries and subcontractors. 

        Zoran,
Oak and the combined company is subject to the risks inherent in doing business internationally, including: 


unexpected
changes in regulatory requirements;


fluctuations
in exchange rates;


political
and economic instability;


imposition
of tariffs and other barriers and restrictions;


the
burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws; and


health
risks in a particular region. 

        The
majority of Zoran's research and development personnel and facilities and a portion of its sales and marketing personnel are located in Israel. Political, economic and military
conditions in Israel directly affect Zoran's operations. Some of Zoran's officers and employees in Israel are obligated to 

perform
up to 39 days of military reserve duty annually. The absence of these employees for significant periods during the work week may cause Zoran to operate inefficiently during these
periods. 

        Zoran's
operations in China are subject to the economic and political uncertainties affecting that country. For example, the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth in the
past decade, but such growth has been uneven across geographic and economic sectors and has recently been slowing. This growth may continue to decrease and any slowdown may have a negative effect on
Zoran's business. During 2000 and 2001, Zoran also opened offices in Taipei, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Seoul, Korea, and its operations are subject to the economic and political uncertainties affecting
these countries as well. 

        Zoran's
and Oak's significant concentration of manufacturing activities with third party foundries in Taiwan exposes them and the combined company to the risk of political instability in
Taiwan, including the potential for conflict between Taiwan and China. Zoran and Oak have several significant OEM customers in Japan, Korea and other parts of Asia. Adverse economic circumstances in
Japan and elsewhere in Asia could affect these customers' willingness or ability to do business with Zoran, Oak or the combined company in the future or their success in developing and launching
devices containing its products. 

        Zoran's
and Oak's significant operations and manufacturing activities in Taiwan, China and other parts of Asia expose them to risks associated with the outbreak of SARS in the region. 

The recent outbreak of SARS may adversely affect Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's business.  

        The recent outbreak of SARS in a number of Asian countries could have a negative effect on Zoran's, Oak's and the combined company's manufacturing production
capabilities, on their ability to effectively
market and sell its products due to SARS-related travel restrictions and on the general financial markets and business activity in Asia. The SARS outbreak has been significantly focused on
Asia, where many of Zoran's, Oak's and the combined company's current and prospective customers are located. In addition, most of Zoran's and Oak's manufacturing activities are carried out by a third
party foundries in Taiwan and Singapore. Should the SARS illness spread to new regions in Asia or elsewhere or intensify in severity in areas already affected, causing reduced demand for current and
prospective customers of Zoran, Oak or the combined companies or disrupting the manufacture of those companies' products, Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's operating results could be harmed. 

The prices of Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's products may become less competitive due to foreign exchange fluctuations.  

        Foreign currency fluctuations may affect the prices of Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's products. Prices for such products are currently denominated in
U.S. dollars for sales to Zoran's and Oak's customers throughout the world. If there is a significant devaluation of the currency in a specific country, the prices of Zoran's, Oak's or the combined
company's products will increase relative to that country's currency, and those products may be less competitive in that country. Also, Zoran, Oak or the combined company cannot be sure that its
international customers will continue to be willing to place orders denominated in U.S. dollars. If not, Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's revenue and operating results will be subject to
foreign exchange fluctuations. 

Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's ability to compete could be jeopardized if it is unable to protect its intellectual property rights.  

        Zoran's and Oak's success and ability to compete depend in large part upon protection of their proprietary technology. Zoran and Oak rely on a combination of
patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, non-disclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect 

their
proprietary rights. These agreements and measures may not be sufficient to protect Zoran's, Oak's or the combined comopany's technology from third-party infringement, or to protect those
companies from the claims of others. Monitoring unauthorized use of Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's products is difficult, and they cannot be certain that the steps they have taken will
prevent unauthorized use of their technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect their proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. The laws of certain foreign
countries in which Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect their products or intellectual
property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States and thus make the possibility of piracy of its technology and products more likely in these countries. If competitors are able to
use Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's technology, those companies' ability to compete effectively could be harmed. 

        The
protection offered by patents held by Zoran and Oak is subject to numerous uncertainties. For example, Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's competitors may be able to effectively
design around those patents, or the patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Those competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior
to Zoran's or Oak's technology. Moreover, while Zoran and Oak hold or have applied for patents relating to the design of their products, some of their products are based in part on standards, for
which they do not hold patents or other intellectual property rights. 

        Oak
generally limits access to and distribution of the source and object code of its software and other proprietary information. With respect to its page description language software
and drivers for the digital office market and in limited circumstances with respect to firmware and platforms for its HDTV products, Oak grants licenses that give its customers access to and
restricted use of the source code of Oak's software. This increases the likelihood of misappropriation or misuse of Oak's technology. 

Zoran, Oak or the combined company could become subject to claims and litigation regarding intellectual property rights, which could seriously harm its
business and require it to incur significant costs.  

        In recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving patents and other intellectual property rights. In the past, Zoran and Oak
have been subject to claims and litigation regarding alleged infringement of other parties' intellectual property rights. Zoran, Oak or the combined company could become subject to litigation in the
future either to protect its intellectual property or as a result of allegations that Zoran, Oak or the combined company infringes others' intellectual property rights. Claims that Zoran's, Oak's or
the combined company's products infringe proprietary rights would force that company to defend itself and possibly its customers or manufacturers against the alleged infringement. These claims and any
resulting lawsuit, if successful, could subject Zoran, Oak or the combined company to significant liability for damages or invalidation of its proprietary rights. These lawsuits, regardless of their
success, would likely be time-consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention. Any potential intellectual property litigation could force Zoran, Oak or
the combined company to do one or more of the following: 


stop
selling products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;


obtain
from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology, which license may not be available on reasonable terms
or at all;


pay
damages; or


redesign
those products that use such technology. 

        If
Zoran, Oak or the combined company is forced to take any of the foregoing actions, its business could be severely harmed. 

        Although
patent disputes in the semiconductor industry have often been settled through cross-licensing arrangements, Zoran, Oak and the combined company may not be able in any or every
instance, to settle an alleged patent infringement claim through a cross-licensing arrangement. Zoran and Oak have a more limited patent portfolio than many of their competitors. If a successful claim
is made against Zoran, Oak, the combined company or any of its customers and a license is not made available to it on commercially reasonable terms or it is required to pay substantial damages or
awards, its business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. 

        In
the past, Oak has incurred significant legal expenses in connection with intellectual property claims it has initiated. Additionally, Zoran, Oak or the combined company may be
required to defend and indemnify against third party infringement claims pursuant to terms of existing agreements with its customers. In January 2001, Samsung was notified by Pitney Bowes that
its use of Oak's iRET technology infringed Pitney Bowes's U.S. Patent No. 4,386,272. Oak is defending Samsung against this allegation of infringement pursuant to its indemnification obligation
under an earlier license agreement between Samsung and XLI, a subsidiary of Oak. 

If necessary licenses of third-party technology are not available to Zoran, Oak or the combined company or are very expensive, Zoran's, Oak's or the
combined company's products could become obsolete.  

        From time to time Zoran, Oak or the combined company may be required to license technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements.
Third party licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If Zoran, Oak or the combined company is unable to obtain any third-party license required to develop new
products and product enhancements, it may have to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost, either of which could seriously harm the competitiveness of
its products. 

        Certain
technology used in Oak's products is licensed from third parties, and in connection with these licenses, Oak is required to fulfill confidentiality obligations and, in some
cases, pay royalties. Some of Oak's products require various types of copy protection software that Oak must license from third
parties. If Oak is unable to obtain or maintain its right to use the necessary copy protection software, it would be unable to sell and market these products. Oak's agreements with third parties often
have no specified term and may be terminated by either party in the event of breach by the other party. Oak's business could be adversely affected by the loss for any reason of these third-party
agreements. Given the trend to include increasing levels of functionality on a chip, in the future it may be necessary or desirable for Zoran, Oak or the combined company to seek additional licenses
to intellectual property rights held by third parties or purchase products manufactured or sold by third parties with respect to some or all of its product offerings. However, those licenses or
purchases may not be available on terms acceptable to them, if at all. If Zoran, Oak or the combined company is unable to enter into such license arrangements on acceptable terms or to maintain its
current licenses on acceptable terms, its business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer. 

If Zoran, Oak or the combined company is not able to apply its net operating losses against taxable income in future periods, Zoran's, Oak's or the
combined company's financial results will be harmed.  

        Zoran's, Oak's and the combined company's future net income and cash flow will be affected by their ability to apply Zoran's and Oak's net operating losses, or
"NOLs," against taxable income in future periods. Zoran's NOLs totaled approximately $34.0 million for federal and $4.0 million for state tax reporting purposes as of December 31,
2002. Oak's NOLs totaled approximately $212.0 million for federal and $60.0 million for state tax reporting purposes as of December 31, 2002. As a result of the change of control
resulting from Zoran's initial public offering in 1995, the amount of NOLs that Zoran can use to reduce future taxable income for federal tax purposes is limited to approximately $3.0 million
per year. The Internal Revenue Code contains a number of provisions that could limit the use of NOLs against income of Zoran or the combined company following the merger as a result of 

the
merger or as a result of the combination of these transactions. Zoran's future utilization of Oak's NOLs may be further limited due to prior acquisitions or the gain on the SunPlus transaction. No
opinion or IRS ruling has been sought regarding the potential application of any of these provisions. Changes in tax laws in the United States may further limit Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company
ability to utilize these net operating losses. Any further limitation on Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's ability to utilize their respective NOLs could harm that company's financial
condition. 

Any acquisitions Zoran or the combined company makes could disrupt its business and severely harm its financial condition.  

        Zoran has made investments in, and acquisitions of, other complementary companies, products and technologies. During 2000, Zoran acquired PixelCam and Nogatech,
and the combined company may acquire additional businesses, products or technologies in the future. In the event of any future acquisitions, Zoran or the combined company could: 


issue
stock that would dilute its current stockholders' percentage ownership;


incur
debt;


assume
liabilities;


incur
expenses related to the future impairment of goodwill and the amortization of other intangible assets; or


incur
other large write-offs immediately or in the future. 

        Zoran's
or the combined company's operation of any other acquired business will also involve numerous risks, including: 


problems
combining the purchased operations, technologies or products;


unanticipated
costs;


diversion
of management's attention from Zoran's or the combined company's core business;


adverse
effects on existing business relationships with customers;


risks
associated with entering markets in which Zoran or the combined company has no or limited prior experience; and


potential
loss of key employees, particularly those of the purchased organizations. 

        Zoran
or the combined company may not be able to successfully complete the integration of the business, products or technologies or personnel that it might acquire in the future, and any
failure to do so could disrupt Zoran's or the combined company's business and seriously harm its financial condition. 

        In
addition, Zoran has made minority equity investments in early-stage companies, and it expects to continue to review opportunities to make additional investments in such companies
where it believes such investments will provide Zoran or the combined company with opportunities to gain access to important technologies or otherwise enhance important commercial relationships. Zoran
has little or no influence over the early-stage companies in which it has made or may make strategic, minority equity investments. Each of these investments involves a high degree of risk. Zoran or
the combined company may not be successful in achieving the technological or commercial advantage upon which any given investment is premised, and failure by the early-stage company to achieve its own
business objectives could result in a loss of all or part of Zoran's invested capital and require Zoran or the combined company to write off all or a portion of such investments. 

Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's products could contain defects, which could reduce sales of those products or result in claims against Zoran,
Oak or the combined company.  

        Zoran and Oak develop complex and evolving products. Despite testing by Zoran, Oak or the combined company and their customers, errors may be found in existing or
new products. This could result in, among other things, a delay in recognition or loss of revenues, loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance. These defects may cause Zoran, Oak or
the combined company to incur significant warranty, support and repair costs, divert the attention of that company's engineering personnel from its product development efforts and harm its
relationships with customers. The occurrence of these problems could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's products and would likely harm its
business. Defects, integration issues or other performance problems in Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's products could result in financial or other damages to customers or could damage market
acceptance of such products. Customers of Zoran, Oak or the combined company could also seek damages from that company for their losses. A product liability claim brought against Zoran, Oak or the
combined company, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time consuming and costly to defend. 

Zoran, Oak or the combined company may need additional funds to execute its business plan, and if it is unable to obtain such funds, it will not be able
to expand its business as planned.  

        Zoran, Oak or the combined company may require substantial additional capital to finance its future growth, secure additional foundry capacity and fund its
ongoing research and development activities beyond 2003. Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 


acceptance
of and demand for its products;


the
types of arrangements that it may enter into with its independent foundries; and


the
extent to which it invests in new technology and research and development projects. 

        To
the extent that its existing sources of liquidity and cash flow from operations are insufficient to fund its activities, Zoran, Oak or the combined company may need to raise
additional funds. If it raises additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of its existing stockholders would be reduced. Further, such equity securities may
have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's common stock. Additional financing may not be available to Zoran, Oak or the combined company when
needed or, if available, it may not be available on terms favorable to Zoran, Oak or the combined company. 

If the combined company fails to manage its future growth, if any, its business would be harmed.  

        Zoran and Oak anticipate that the future growth of the combined company, if any, will require it to recruit and hire a substantial number of new engineering,
managerial, sales and marketing personnel. The combined company's ability to manage growth successfully will also require it to expand and improve administrative, operational, management and financial
systems and controls. Many of Zoran's key operations, including the major portion of its research and development operations and a significant portion of its sales and administrative operations, are
located in Israel. A majority of Zoran's sales and marketing and certain of its research and development and administrative personnel, including its President and Chief Executive Officer and other
officers, are based in the United States. The geographic separation of these operations places additional strain on Zoran's resources and its ability to manage growth effectively, and this will
continue to be true of the combined company. If the combined company is unable to manage growth effectively, its business would be harmed. 

Zoran and Oak rely on the services of their executive officers and other key personnel, whose knowledge of Zoran's and Oak's business and industry would
be extremely difficult to replace.  

        Zoran's and Oak's success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of their senior management, as will continue to be the case with the
combined company. Management and other employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with Zoran, Oak or the combined company at any time upon short notice. The loss of key personnel could delay
product development cycles or otherwise harm Zoran's, Oak's or the combined company's business. Zoran and Oak believe that the future success of the combined company will also depend in large part on
its ability to attract, integrate and retain highly-skilled engineering, managerial, sales and marketing personnel, located in the United States, Israel and China. Competition for such personnel is
intense, and the combined company may not be successful in attracting, integrating and retaining such personnel. Failure to attract, integrate and retain key personnel could harm the combined
company's ability to carry out its business strategy and compete with other companies. 

Risks Relating to Zoran  

Zoran's business and future operating results could be harmed by terrorist activity or armed conflict.  

        Zoran's business and operating results are subject to uncertainties arising out of possible terrorist attacks on the United States and other regions of the world
including locations where Zoran maintains operations and by armed conflict in the Middle East and related economic instability. Zoran's operations could be harmed due to: 


disruption
in commercial activities associated with heightened security concerns affecting international travel and commerce;


reduced
demand for consumer electronic products due to a potential extension of the global economic slowdown;


tightened
immigration controls that may adversely affect the residence status of key non-U.S. managers and technical employees in Zoran's U.S. facilities or
Zoran's ability to hire new non-U.S. employees in such facilities; or


potential
expansion of armed conflict in the Middle East which could adversely affect Zoran's operations in Israel. 

The Israeli rate of inflation may negatively impact Zoran's costs if it exceeds the rate of devaluation of the new Israeli Shekel against the United
States dollar.  

        A portion of the cost of Zoran's operations, relating mainly to its personnel and facilities in Israel, is incurred in New Israeli Shekels. As a result, Zoran
bears the risk that the rate of inflation in Israel will exceed the rate of devaluation of the New Israeli Shekel in relation to the United States dollar, which will increase Zoran's costs as
expressed in United States dollars. To date, Zoran has not engaged in hedging transactions. In the future, Zoran may enter into currency hedging transactions to decrease the risk of financial exposure
from fluctuations in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against the New Israeli Shekel. These measures may not adequately protect Zoran from the impact of inflation in Israel. 

The government programs in which Zoran participates and tax benefits Zoran receives require it to meet several conditions and may be terminated or
reduced in the future, which would increase Zoran's costs.  

        In the year ended December 31, 2002, Zoran did not receive proceeds from grants for research and development from the Chief Scientist in Israel's Ministry
of Industry and Trade. However, Zoran did receive an aggregate of $1,500,000 in such grants in the three months ended March 31, 2003 and an 

aggregate
of $333,000 in such grants during 2000. Zoran plans to seek additional grants from the Chief Scientist in the future. To be eligible for these grants, Zoran's development projects must be
approved by the Chief Scientist on a case-by-case basis. If Zoran's development projects are not approved by the Chief Scientist, Zoran will not receive grants to fund these
projects, which would increase Zoran's research and development costs. Zoran also receives tax benefits, in particular exemptions and reductions as a result of the "Approved Enterprise" status of
Zoran's existing operations in Israel. To be eligible for these tax benefits, Zoran must maintain its Approved Enterprise status by meeting conditions, including making specified investments in fixed
assets located in Israel and investing additional equity in its Israeli subsidiary. If Zoran fails to meet these conditions in the future, the tax benefits would be canceled and Zoran could be
required to refund the tax benefits already received. These tax benefits may not be continued in the future at their current levels or at any level. Israeli governmental authorities have indicated
that the government may reduce or eliminate these benefits in the future, which would harm Zoran's business. 

If Zoran does not maintain current development contracts or is unable to enter into new development contracts, its business could be harmed.  

        Zoran historically has generated a significant percentage of its total revenues from development contracts, primarily with key customers. These development
contracts have provided Zoran with partial funding for the development of some of its products. Under these contracts, Zoran receives payments upon reaching certain development milestones. If Zoran
fails to achieve the milestones specified in its existing development contracts, if its existing contracts are terminated or if Zoran is unable to secure future development contracts, Zoran's ability
to cost-effectively develop new products would be reduced and its business would be harmed. 

Provisions in Zoran's charter documents and Delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control of Zoran.  

        Zoran's certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire Zoran, even if
doing so would be beneficial to its stockholders. These include prohibitions: 


prohibiting
a merger with a party that has acquired control of 15% or more of Zoran's outstanding common stock, such as a party that has completed a successful tender offer,
until three years after that party acquired control of 15% of Zoran's outstanding common stock;


authorizing
the issuance of up to 3,000,000 shares of "blank check' preferred stock;


eliminating
stockholders' rights to call a special meeting of stockholders; and


requiring
advance notice of any stockholder nominations of candidates for election to Zoran's board of directors. 

Zoran's stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate widely.  

        The market price of Zoran's common stock has fluctuated significantly since Zoran's initial public offering in 1995. Between March 31, 2002 and
March 31, 2003, the closing sale price of Zoran's common stock, as reported on The NASDAQ National Market, ranged from a low of $9.11 to a high of $31.81. The market price of Zoran's common
stock is subject to significant fluctuations in the future in response to a variety of factors, including: 


announcements
concerning the business of Zoran or of its competitors or customers;


quarterly
variations in operating results;


changes
in analysts' earnings estimates; 


announcements
of technological innovations;


the
introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by Zoran or its competitors;


loss
of key personnel;


proprietary
rights or other litigation;


general
conditions in the semiconductor industry; and


developments
in the financial markets. 

        In
addition, the stock market has, from time to time, experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for semiconductor companies or
technology companies generally and which have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. Broad market fluctuations of this type may reduce the future market price of
Zoran's common stock. 

Risks Relating to Oak  

        In addition to the risks described above, you should also consider the following risks, which relate specifically to Oak, in determining whether to approve the
merger agreement and exchange your investment in Oak for an investment in Zoran. The following risks should be considered together with the information about Oak's business, financial condition and
results of operations provided elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

It is difficult for Oak to forecast the level or source of its revenues for its ongoing businesses.  

        Historically, Oak's business has depended largely on the success of its Optical Storage products, including its CD-RW products as well as its Combo
(combination DVD and CD-RW) and DVD RW products. Oak's operating losses generally have been due to its dependence on its PC Optical Storage business, which during fiscal year 2002
accounted for approximately 67% of its revenues. Oak recently transferred certain assets of its Optical Storage business to Sunplus Technology Co., Ltd., a Taiwanese company. As a result, it is
not possible to use Oak's historical financial information to predict Oak's future operating results. Following the recent transfer of certain assets of its Optical Storage business, Oak's digital
imaging and digital television businesses will serve as the primary source of revenue which are difficult to forecast. Oak anticipates that Optical Storage revenues will represent a small portion of
the overall revenue as compared to the ongoing digital imaging and digital television businesses. 

Oak has a recent history of operating losses and may not become or remain profitable.  

        Oak has sustained significant losses in recent years and may not become profitable in the future. While Oak had net income of $5.9 million in fiscal 1998,
its current loss trend began in calendar year 1998, resulting in operating losses of $9.1 million for fiscal 1998, $61.9 million for fiscal 1999, $61.1 million for fiscal 2000,
$19.6 million for fiscal 2001 and $29.9 million for fiscal 2002 (in each case before adjustments for non-operating income or loss, or income tax expense or benefit). If Oak
incurs additional losses or fails to achieve profitability in the future, this will significantly harm its business and may affect the trading price of Oak's common stock. 

Oak's future imaging revenues will depend on future royalties from shipment of OEM devices.  

        Oak anticipates that the royalty streams derived from OEMs' shipments of office equipment containing Oak products, and the sale of related products and services
to manufacturers of office equipment will account for a significant portion of its Imaging Group revenue for the foreseeable future. In order to assure that Oak will derive future royalty streams from
the shipment of OEM 

devices,
Oak and its OEMs are required to develop and release in a regular and timely manner new office products with increased speed, enhanced output resolutions, reduced memory requirements,
multiple functions, and network connectivity. OEMs are under tremendous pressure to continually shorten the development cycles of these products, leading to increased complexity and development
costs to Oak and its OEMs. Oak's success will depend on, among other things, the following: 


the
rate at which OEMs serving the digital office market outsource their technology needs;


market
acceptance of its technology and products and the office devices of its OEMs;


the
ability of Oak and its OEMs to meet industry changes and market demands in a timely manner;


achievement
of new design wins by Oak;


successful
implementation of Oak's technology and products in new office devices being developed by its OEMs; and


successful
marketing of those devices by the OEMs. 

Oak is a defendant in several lawsuits.  

        Oak and various of its directors and former officers are parties to a consolidated class action lawsuit filed on behalf of all persons who purchased or acquired
Oak common stock for the period from July 27, 1995 to May 22, 1996, alleging state securities law and other violations. Additionally, various of Oak's directors and former officers are
defendants in three consolidated derivative actions which allege a breach of fiduciary duty and a claim under California securities laws. Based on its current information, including the California
Supreme Court's recent denial of the plaintiffs' petition for review, Oak believes this litigation to be at an end, finally concluded in favor of Oak. Oak is also a party to various other legal
proceedings, including a number of patent-related matters. In connection with these lawsuits, management time has been, and will continue to be, expended. In addition, while Oak has incurred, and
expects to continue to incur, substantial legal and other expenses, an estimate of such loss or range of loss cannot be made. No provision for any liability that may result upon adjudication has been
made in Oak's financial statements. 

Regulation of Oak's customers' products may slow the process of introducing new products and could impair Oak's ability to compete.  

        The Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, has broad jurisdiction over Oak's target markets in its digital television business. Various international entities
or organizations may also regulate aspects of its business or the business of its customers. Although Oak's products are not directly subject to regulation by any agency, the transmission pipes, as
well as much of the equipment into which Oak's products are incorporated, are subject to direct government regulation. For example, before they can be sold in the United States, advanced televisions
and emerging interactive displays must be tested and certified by Underwriters Laboratories and meet FCC regulations. Accordingly, the effects of regulation on Oak's customers or the industries in
which its customers operate may in turn harm its business. FCC regulatory policies affecting the ability of cable operators or telephone companies to offer certain services and other terms on which
these companies conduct their business may impede sales of its products. In addition, Oak's digital television business may also be adversely affected by the imposition of tariffs, duties and other
import restrictions on systems of suppliers or by the imposition of export restrictions on products that Oak sells internationally. Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws
or regulations in the United States or elsewhere could harm Oak's business. For example, any delays by the FCC in imposing its requirement that all new televisions have a digital receiver could have
an adverse effect on Oak's HDTV business. 

Provisions in Oak's charter documents and rights plan could make it more difficult to acquire Oak and may reduce the market price of Oak stock.  

        Oak's board of directors has the authority to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and
restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to, and may be adversely
affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of
control of Oak without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock. Oak has no present plans to issue shares of preferred
stock. Further, certain provisions of Oak's charter documents, including provisions eliminating the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent and limiting the ability of stockholders
to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice, may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of Oak, which could have an adverse effect
on the market price of the stock. In addition, Oak's charter documents do not permit cumulative voting and provide that Oak's board of directors will be divided into three classes, each of which
serves for a staggered three-year term, which may also make it more difficult for a third-party to gain control of the board of directors. 

        In
addition, 400,000 shares of Oak's preferred stock are designated as series A junior participating preferred stock under a rights plan, commonly referred to as a "poison pill."
Under certain
circumstances involving a proposed change-in-control of Oak, the rights related to the series A junior participating preferred stock may be triggered, the effect of
which may delay or prevent a third party from gaining control of or acquiring Oak. In connection with the merger agreement with Zoran, Oak amended the rights plan to exclude the proposed merger as a
triggering event under the plan.

Matters to be Considered at the Stockholders' Meetings  

 Zoran Annual Meeting  

 Proposal 1: Issuance of Shares of Zoran Common Stock in the Merger with Oak  

        On May 4, 2003, Zoran's board of directors adopted a resolution approving the issuance of shares of Zoran common stock in the merger with Oak. This share
issuance proposal is being submitted for approval by the Zoran stockholders pursuant to the requirements of the National Association of Securities Dealers applicable to companies with securities
quoted on The NASDAQ National Market. 

Zoran's board of directors unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the issuance of Zoran common stock in the merger with Oak.

 Proposal 2: Election of Directors  

        Zoran's board of directors is comprised of six directors. All six directors will be elected at the annual meeting. If any nominee for any reason is unable or
unwilling to serve as a director, the proxies may be voted for such substitute nominee as the proxy holder may determine. Zoran is not aware of any nominee who will be unable or unwilling to serve as

 Proposal 3: Approval of Amendment to Zoran's Certificate of Incorporation  

        The Zoran stockholders are being asked to approve an amendment to Zoran's certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock
by 50,000,000 shares, to a total of 105,000,000 shares. As of March 31, 2003, a total of approximately 27,400,000 shares of Zoran common stock were outstanding and approximately
3,183,000 shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to Zoran's stock option and employee stock purchase plans. In addition, based on the number of outstanding shares of Oak common stock and
options to purchase Oak common stock as of May 4, 2003, if the merger is consummated, it will result in the issuance of approximately 13,100,000 shares to former stockholders of Oak and the
assumption or replacement of options that will be exercisable for up to an additional 4,558,000 shares. 

Zoran's board of directors unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" approval of the amendment to Zoran's certificate of incorporation.

Plan, leaving approximately 201,985 shares available for issuance. 

Zoran's board of directors unanimously recommends a vote "for" approval of the amendment to Zoran's 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

of record. 

 Record Date for the Oak Special Meeting  

        Oak's board of directors has fixed the close of business on June 30, 2003 as the record date for determination of Oak stockholders entitled to notice of
and to vote at the special meeting. On the record date, there were                        shares of Oak common stock outstanding,
held by approximately                        holders of record. 

Vote Required  

        Zoran.
    A majority of the shares of Zoran common stock issued and outstanding as of the record date must be represented,
either in person or by proxy, to constitute a quorum at the Zoran annual meeting. If a quorum is present, the six nominees for director receiving the highest number of votes will be elected as
directors. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Zoran common stock present or represented by proxy and voting at the annual meeting is required to approve the following
proposals: 


approval
of the issuance of shares of Zoran common stock in connection with the merger;


approval
of an amendment to Zoran's 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares of Zoran common stock authorized for issuance under such plan; and


ratification
of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Zoran's independent accountants for the year ending December 31, 2003. 

Finally,
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Zoran common stock issued and outstanding as of the record date is required to approve the proposal to amend Zoran's
certificate of incorporation. 

        Oak.
    A majority of the shares of Oak common stock issued and outstanding as of the record date must be represented, either in
person or by proxy, to constitute a quorum at the Oak special meeting. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Oak's common stock issued and outstanding as of the record
date is required to approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. 

Voting of Proxies; Quorum; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes  

        All shares of Zoran common stock represented by properly executed proxies received before or at the Zoran annual meeting and all shares of Oak common stock
represented by properly executed proxies received before or at the Oak special meeting will, unless the proxies are revoked, be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on those proxies. If
no instructions are indicated on a properly executed proxy card, in the case of Oak stockholders, the shares will be voted FOR approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger
and, in the case of Zoran stockholders, the shares will be voted FOR approval of the issuance of shares of Zoran common stock in connection with the merger and FOR the other proposals discussed in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus. You are urged to mark your proxy card to indicate how you wish to vote your shares. 

        If
your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, that brokerage firm or bank will not be permitted to vote your shares with respect to any of the proposals related to
the merger unless you provide instructions as to how to vote your shares. If an executed proxy card is returned by a broker or bank holding shares which indicates that the broker or bank has not
received voting instructions and does not have discretionary authority to vote on the proposals, the shares will be considered present at the meeting for purposes of determining the presence of a
quorum, but will not be considered to have been voted in favor of the proposal. Your broker or bank will vote your shares on that proposal only if you provide instructions on how to vote by following
the information provided to you by your broker. Please note that if your shares are held of record by a broker, bank or nominee and you wish to vote at the meeting, you will not be permitted to vote
in person unless you first obtain a proxy issued in your name from the record holder. 

        A
properly executed proxy marked 
abstain
, although counted for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum and determining the
aggregate voting power and number of shares represented and entitled to vote at each of the stockholders' meetings, will not be voted. Accordingly, because the affirmative vote of holders of a
majority of the shares of Oak common stock issued and outstanding as 

of
the record date is required for approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger, and the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of Zoran common stock
issued and outstanding as of the record date is required for approval of the amendment to Zoran's certificate of incorporation, a proxy marked 
abstain,

as well as a failure to vote or a broker non-vote, will have the effect of a vote against the proposal. 

        A
stockholder may revoke his or her proxy at any time before it is voted by: 


notifying
in writing the Secretary of Zoran at 3112 Scott Boulevard, Santa Clara, California 95054, if you are a Zoran stockholder, or the Secretary of Oak at 1390 Kifer
Road, Sunnyvale, California 94086, if you are an Oak stockholder, that you wish to revoke your proxy;


granting
a subsequently dated proxy; or


appearing
in person and voting at the special meeting if you are a holder of record. 

        Attendance
at the annual or special meeting will not in and of itself constitute revocation of a proxy. 

Solicitation of Proxies  

        Zoran and Oak will share equally the expenses incurred in connection with the printing and mailing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Zoran and Oak will
request banks, brokers and other intermediaries holding shares of Zoran or Oak common stock beneficially owned by others to send this joint proxy statement/prospectus to, and obtain proxies from, the
beneficial owners and will reimburse the holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing. Solicitation of proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone, telegram and other electronic means,
advertisements and personal
solicitation by the directors, officers or employees of Zoran and Oak. No additional compensation will be paid to directors, officers or employees for such solicitation.

        Georgeson
Shareholder Communications, Inc. may solicit proxies on behalf of Oak at an approximate cost of $50,000 plus reasonable expenses. Oak will bear its own expenses in

stock certificates will be mailed to you by Zoran's Exchange Agent.

May 4, 2003, at 4:00 p.m., Oak's board of directors met to consider the revised terms of the merger. Representatives from Morgan Stanley and Wildman Harrold also
participated in the board meeting. The board initially met outside the presence of Mr. Sohn to consider the Zoran board's proposal with respect to Mr. Sohn's severance arrangement and
the process for selecting which Oak board members would be asked to join the Zoran board. A representative of Gray Cary was asked to join a portion of the meeting via telephone to discuss the Zoran
board's position on these issues. Separately, Dr. Gerzberg joined a portion of the meeting to discuss the Zoran board's position on these issues. After the Gray Cary representative and
Dr. Gerzberg had departed the meeting, representatives from Morgan Stanley presented a financial analysis with respect to the proposed merger and delivered its fairness opinion. Oak's outside
legal counsel reported on the final results of its legal due diligence review. The Oak board considered and discussed the risks and benefits of the proposed 

merger,
taking into account the revised terms and reports regarding the due diligence review, concluded that the proposed merger was in the best interests of Oak and its stockholders and approved the
merger agreement and the merger, and related transactions. The Oak board also approved an amendment of Mr. Sohn's employment agreement increasing his severance benefits from 18 to
29 months in consideration of Mr. Sohn entering into a non-competition agreement with Zoran. 

        On
May 4, 2003, following the Oak board meeting, legal counsel to Zoran and Oak made final revisions to the merger agreement and related agreements, and representatives of Zoran
and Oak executed and delivered the merger agreement. 

        On
May 5, 2003, prior the opening of trading on The NASDAQ National Market, Zoran and Oak issued a joint press release announcing the signing of the merger agreement. 

        On
June 6, 2003, representatives of Zoran and Oak executed an Amendment to the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization to modify and clarify the provisions relating to Zoran's
assumption of Oak options, the methodology for determining the number of shares to be subject to the new Zoran options to be granted to replace the underwater Oak options which will not be assumed by
Zoran and which will terminate, and to designate Messrs. Rynne, Simone and Sohn as the three members of Oak's board of directors to be elected to serve on Zoran's board of directors, effective
upon the consummation of the merger. 

Recommendation of Zoran's and Oak's Boards of Directors  

        After due consideration, Zoran's board of directors has determined that the merger is fair to and in the best interests of Zoran and its stockholders.
Accordingly, Zoran's board of directors unanimously recommends that Zoran stockholders vote 
"FOR"
 approval of the issuance of the shares of Zoran common
stock in connection with the merger. 

        After
due consideration, Oak's board of directors has determined that the terms of the merger and the merger agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of, Oak's stockholders.
Accordingly, Oak's board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger and unanimously recommends that the stockholders of Oak vote
"
FOR"
 approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger. 

Reasons for the Merger  

 General  

        The boards of directors of Zoran and Oak each approved the merger agreement, found the merger to be fair to and in the best interests of its respective company
and its stockholders, and resolved to recommend that the stockholders vote in favor of the Zoran merger proposal or the Oak merger proposal, as the case may be. 

        In
reaching their separate decisions, each board consulted with its company's senior management and financial and legal advisors and considered a number of factors. In view of the
complexity and wide variety of information and factors, both positive and negative, considered by each board, neither board found it practical to quantify, rank or otherwise assign any relative or
specific weights to the factors it considered. In addition, neither board reached any specific conclusion with respect to each of the factors it considered or any aspect of any particular factor.
Instead, each board conducted an overall
analysis of the factors it considered. In considering those factors, individual members of each board may have given weight to different factors. 

        The
factors considered by each board were not identical to the factors considered by the other board. However, both boards identified a number of potential material benefits, common to
both companies and their respective stockholders, that both boards expect will result from the merger. In 

addition,
both boards identified a number of risks affecting both companies in connection with the merger and other considerations common to both companies. These common benefits, risks and other
considerations are described below. The specific factors that each board separately considered are also listed below. This section, read as a whole, includes the material factors considered by each
board of directors in approving the merger. 

 Joint Reasons for the Merger  

        Both boards believe that the combination of Zoran and Oak will create a stronger, more competitive industry participant, based on the potential benefits of the
merger, including: 


the
complementary nature of the products, services, technologies and customers of Zoran and Oak;


the
more diversified and balanced product portfolio resulting from the combination of each company's products;


the
opportunity to accelerate revenue growth as a result of an integrated product offering that addresses a wider range of digital consumer electronics and imaging products;


the
potential ability of the combined entity to capitalize on the complementary products and customer relationships in high-growth consumer electronics markets
such as the digital TV, DVD, digital camera and digital imaging markets;


the
potential ability of the combined company to effectively develop new products in the consumer electronics markets by sharing technologies and intellectual property,
utilize its worldwide sales and marketing infrastructure and reduce manufacturing costs; and


the
potential for cross-selling opportunities. 

        In
the course of their separate deliberations, each board considered the following factors: 


the
prospects of each company on a stand-alone basis, including potential risks and rewards associated with remaining independent;


the
nature of the industry in which Zoran and Oak operate and the belief that greater size, resources and geographic scope are increasingly required for companies to compete
in this industry;


current
financial market conditions and historical market prices, volatility and trading information with respect to Zoran and Oak common stock;


results
of the due diligence investigation conducted by management, accountants, legal counsel and financial advisors;


the
percentage ownership of the combined company of the stockholders of Zoran and Oak; and


possible
alternative means of achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger, including the possibility of a combination with other companies. 

        Both
boards also recognize the risks inherent in the transaction, including: 


the
risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized;


the
risk that Zoran and Oak would not be successful in integrating their products, technology and organizations;


the
risk of management and employee disruption associated with the merger, including the risk that despite the efforts of the combined company, key personnel might not
remain employed with the combined company; 


the
risk that the merger may not be consummated; and


the
other risks described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus under the section titled "Risk Factors." 

        Both
boards determined that the potential benefits of the merger outweighed the potential risks. Each board also determined that the provisions of the merger agreement, including the
exchange ratio, each company's representations and warranties, covenants, and the conditions to their respective obligations, were the reasonable product of arms-length negotiations. 

 Zoran's Reasons for the Merger  

        Zoran's board of directors has unanimously determined that the proposed merger with Oak is in the best interests of Zoran and its stockholders. In addition to the
joint reasons for the merger, Zoran's board believes that the combined company would benefit from the following: 


Oak's
complementary technologies and products, especially in the digital TV markets, and the ability of the combined company to expand its existing customer base and market
share in the digital consumer electronics market by integrating the product lines of each company;


Oak's
intellectual property portfolio and related expertise, especially intellectual property relating to front-end optical recording;


access
to Oak's customer relationships, providing cross-selling opportunities to existing customers as well as opportunities to build new relationships;


the
opportunity to achieve synergies and realize significant cost savings, including operational efficiencies, such as acceleration of various product development activities
by leveraging Oak's intellectual property, reduced overhead and, in geographic areas where the two companies overlap, increased efficiency in the combined company's sales channels; and


Oak's
existing market position as a leading supplier of HDTV integrated circuits, providing the combined company with access to this high-growth market segment. 

        Zoran's
board considered a number of additional factors in evaluating the merger with Oak, including the following: 


information
regarding Oak's business, historical financial performance and condition, cash balances, operating performance, prospects, contractual obligations and management
experience;


the
consideration Zoran will pay in the merger in light of comparable merger transactions;


the
fact that the proposed issuance of shares of Zoran common stock in connection with the merger must be approved by the Zoran stockholders;


the
views of Zoran's senior management regarding the integration of Oak;


the
structure and terms of the merger and its effect on existing Zoran stockholder value, including the following:


the
number of shares of Zoran common stock to be issued in the merger and the dilutive effect on existing Zoran stockholders;


the
aggregate cash consideration to be paid to the Oak stockholders and the cash balances of Oak as of the date of the merger agreement, and the potential effect on Zoran's
existing cash balances, taking into account the limitations contained in the merger agreement regarding significant capital expenditures by Oak prior to the completion of the proposed merger; and 


the
capital and resources required for the merger and the potential revenue and cost synergies expected from the merger; and


the
opinion of Merrill Lynch to Zoran's board of directors (the full text of which is attached as Annex D, and which describes the assumptions made, matters considered and
limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion) stating that, as of May 4, 2003, the consideration to be paid by Zoran in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial
point of view, to
Zoran and the financial presentation made to the Zoran board in connection with the delivery of the opinion. 

        The
foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by Zoran's board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but is intended to include the material factors
considered by the Zoran board. Zoran's board of directors did not find it practical to and did not quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to the specific factors considered, and individual
directors may have given different weight to different factors. 

        Zoran's
board of directors also considered a number of uncertainties (in addition to the uncertainties listed in the section entitled "Joint Reasons for the Merger"),
including the challenges of combining the businesses of Zoran and Oak and the risk of diverting management resources from other strategic opportunities and operational matters for an extended period
of time. For further discussion of these risks, see the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled "Risk Factors." 

 Oak's Reasons for the Merger  

        Oak's board believes that the merger is fair to Oak's stockholders and in their best interests, and has unanimously recommended the approval and adoption of the
merger agreement and the merger with Zoran. In addition to the joint reasons for the merger, Oak's board believes that the combined company would benefit from the following: 


Zoran's
complementary technologies and products, especially in the digital TV markets;


Access
to Zoran's customer relationships, providing cross-selling opportunities to existing customers as well as the opportunity to build new relationships; and


Zoran's
greater financial resources, providing the combined company with the necessary capital for growth. 

        Oak's
board considered a number of additional factors in evaluating the merger with Oak, including the following: 


information
concerning Zoran's business, historical financial performance and condition, operations, technology, products, strategic partners, customers, competitive
positions, prospects and management;


the
historical market prices and recent trading activity of shares of Oak common stock and Zoran common stock, including the fact that the offer price per share of Oak
common stock implied by the exchange ratio and the per share cash consideration represented a significant premium to the market price of Oak common stock relative to that of Zoran common stock at the
time the merger agreement was executed;


the
aggregate cash consideration to be paid to the Oak stockholders;


the
opinion of Morgan Stanley, Oak's financial advisor, that, as of May 4, 2003 and based upon and subject to the assumptions, considerations and limitations set
forth in its opinion, the consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Oak common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders;


the
opportunity for Oak's stockholders to continue to participate in the potential future growth and success of Oak and Zoran and the possible synergies to be realized from
the merger through their receipt of shares of Zoran common stock in the merger; 


the
fact that the receipt of Zoran common stock by the holders of Oak common stock in the merger is expected to be tax-free to such holders for U.S. federal
income tax purposes;


the
terms of the merger and the merger agreement, including the parties' representations, warranties and covenants, and the conditions to their respective obligations;


the
likelihood of completing the merger, given the limited nature of the conditions to closing the merger and the need for relatively few regulatory approvals or consents,
and the favorable prospects for receiving these necessary approvals and consents and completing the merger;


the
fact that the merger must be approved be the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Oak common stock; and


the
fact that, while the merger agreement prohibits Oak from soliciting proposals concerning an acquisition of Oak, Oak's board of directors, in the exercise of its
fiduciary duties, would be able to provide information to, and engage in negotiations with, a third party that makes an unsolicited superior acquisition proposal, and that Oak's board of directors
would be able to withdraw its recommendation of the merger agreement and the merger to the Oak stockholders, if the board of directors determined that its fiduciary duties so required and upon payment
to Zoran of a termination fee in the amount of $10,740,000. 

        In
addition to those described in "Joint Reasons for the Merger," the Oak board identified and considered a number of other uncertainties and risks concerning the merger,
including: 


the
risk that Oak might suffer employee attrition or fail to retain key personnel due to uncertainties associated with the merger, and that customers may delay purchases of
Oak's products until the merger is completed;


the
risks associated with an investment in Zoran common stock described in periodic reports previously filed with the SEC by Zoran, including those factors discussed in this
proxy statement/prospectus under "Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Zoran, Oak and the Combined Company" beginning on page 23.


the
risk that the per share value of the consideration actually received by Oak stockholders might be significantly less than the per share price implied by the exchange
ratio prior to the announcement of the merger because the exchange ratio will not be adjusted for changes in market price of either Zoran common stock or Oak common stock; and


the
amount of the termination fee and the events triggering payment of the termination fee under the merger agreement. 

        Oak's
board of directors did not believe that the negative factors were sufficient, individually or in the aggregate, to outweigh the potential advantages of the merger. 

        The
foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by Oak's board of directors is not meant to be exhaustive, but includes the material factors considered by the Oak
board. In view of the variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger, Oak's board of directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign
relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determinations and recommendations. In addition, individual members of Oak's board of directors may have given different weights to
different factors. 

Opinion of Financial Advisor to Zoran  

        Zoran retained Merrill Lynch to act as its financial advisor with respect to the transaction. In connection with that engagement, Zoran requested that Merrill
Lynch evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, to Zoran of the merger consideration in the merger. At the meeting of Zoran's board of directors on May 4, 2003, Merrill Lynch
rendered its oral opinion to the Zoran board, subsequently confirmed in writing, that as of May 4, 2003, based upon the assumptions made, matters 

considered
and limits of such review, as set forth in its opinion, the merger consideration was fair to Zoran from a financial point of view. 

        The
full text of Merrill Lynch's opinion, which sets forth material information relating to Merrill Lynch's fairness opinion, including the assumptions made, matters considered and
qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Merrill Lynch, is attached as Annex D and is incorporated into this document by reference in its entirety. This description of
Merrill Lynch's opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to, and should be reviewed together with, the full text of the opinion. You are urged to read the opinion and consider it carefully.
Merrill Lynch's opinion is addressed to Zoran's board of directors and addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to Zoran. The terms of the merger,
including the merger consideration, were determined through negotiations between Zoran and Oak and were not determined or recommended by Merrill Lynch. Merrill Lynch's opinion does not address the
merits of the underlying decision of Zoran to engage in the transaction and does not constitute, nor should it be construed as, a recommendation to any stockholder of Zoran or Oak as to how to vote on
the Zoran share issuance or any matter related to the merger. 

        In
arriving at its opinion, Merrill Lynch, among other things: 


reviewed
certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Oak and Zoran that Merrill Lynch deemed to be relevant;


reviewed
certain information, including publicly available financial forecasts, relating to the business, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of Oak and
Zoran furnished to Merrill Lynch or discussed with Merrill Lynch by Oak and Zoran, as well as the amount and timing of the cost savings and related expenses and synergies expected to result from the
merger (referred to in this document as the "expected synergies"), furnished to Merrill Lynch by Zoran;


conducted
discussions with members of senior management and representatives of Oak and Zoran concerning the matters described above, as well as their respective businesses
and prospects before and after giving effect to the merger and the expected synergies;


reviewed
the historical market prices and valuation multiples for shares of Oak common stock and Zoran common stock and compared them with those of certain publicly traded
companies that Merrill Lynch deemed to be relevant;


reviewed
the results of operations of Oak and Zoran and compared them with those of certain publicly traded companies which Merrill Lynch deemed to be relevant;


compared
the proposed financial terms of the merger with the financial terms of certain other transactions that Merrill Lynch deemed to be relevant;


participated
in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of Oak and Zoran and their financial and legal advisors;


reviewed
the potential pro forma impact of the merger;


reviewed
the merger agreement; and


reviewed
such other financial studies and analyses and took into account such other matters as Merrill Lynch deemed necessary, including its assessment of general economic,
market and monetary conditions. 

        In
preparing its opinion, Merrill Lynch assumed and relied on the accuracy and completeness of all information supplied or otherwise made available to it, discussed with or reviewed by
or for it, or publicly available, and Merrill Lynch did not assume any responsibility for independently verifying such information or undertake an independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the
assets or liabilities of Oak or Zoran, nor was Merrill Lynch furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal, and Merrill 

Lynch
did not evaluate the solvency or fair value of Oak or Zoran under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In addition, Merrill Lynch did not assume any
obligation to conduct any physical inspection of the properties or facilities of Oak or Zoran. With respect to the publicly available financial forecast information discussed with Merrill Lynch by Oak
and Zoran, the managements of Oak and Zoran advised Merrill Lynch, and Merrill Lynch assumed, that such financial forecast information represented reasonable estimates and judgments as to the future
financial performance of Oak and Zoran, respectively. With respect to the expected synergies furnished to and discussed with Merrill Lynch, management of Zoran advised Merrill Lynch, and Merrill Lynch
assumed, that they had been reasonably prepared and reflected the best currently available estimates and judgment of Zoran's management as to the expected synergies. 

        Merrill
Lynch's opinion was necessarily based upon market, economic and other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on the date of the opinion, and upon the information made
available to Merrill Lynch as of the date of the opinion. Merrill Lynch assumed that in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or other consents or approvals (contractual or otherwise) for
the merger, no restrictions, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, will be imposed that will have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits of the
transaction. Merrill Lynch has no obligation to update its opinion to take into account events occurring after the date that its opinion was delivered to Zoran's board of directors. Circumstances
could develop prior to consummation of the merger that, if known at the time Merrill Lynch rendered its opinion, would have altered such opinion. Merrill Lynch has expressed no opinion as to the
prices at which shares of Zoran common stock or Oak common stock will trade following the announcement or consummation of the transaction. In addition, as described above, Merrill Lynch's fairness
opinion was among several factors taken into consideration by Zoran's board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger agreement and the merger. Consequently, Merrill Lynch's
analysis described below should not be viewed as determinative of the decision of Zoran's board of directors or the Zoran management with respect to the fairness of the merger consideration. 

        The
matters considered by Merrill Lynch in arriving at its opinion are based on numerous macroeconomic, operating and financial assumptions with respect to industry performance, general
business and economic conditions, many of which are beyond the control of Oak and Zoran, and involve the application of complex methodologies and educated judgment. Any estimates incorporated in the
analyses performed by Merrill Lynch are not necessarily indicative of actual past or future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than these estimates. Estimated values
do not purport to be appraisals and do not necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or companies may be sold in the future. 

        At
the meeting of Zoran's board of directors held on May 4, 2003, Merrill Lynch presented certain financial analyses accompanied by delivery of its written materials in connection
with the delivery of its oral opinion at that meeting and its subsequent written opinion. The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Merrill Lynch in arriving at its
opinion.

        Analyst Stock Price Targets.
    Using publicly available securities research analyst estimates, Merrill Lynch noted that the
range of the analyst stock price targets for Oak was $6.00$7.00. 

        Comparable Public Trading Multiples Analysis.
    Using publicly available securities research analyst estimates and other
information, Merrill Lynch compared selected financial and trading data of Oak with similar data for selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses that Merrill Lynch judged to be reasonably
comparable to those of Oak. These companies were: 


nVidia
Corporation


ATI
Technologies Inc.


OmniVision
Technologies, Inc.


Genesis
Microchip Incorporated


Zoran
Corporation


Silicon
Image, Inc.


Pixelworks, Inc.


ESS
Technology, Inc. 


Cirrus
Logic, Inc. 

        Merrill
Lynch used publicly available securities research analyst estimates for each of these companies to determine multiples of the equity value of the comparable companies to several
estimated financial metrics for the comparable companies. In calculating the implied equity value per Oak share derived from Oak's calendar year 2005 estimated earnings per share, Merrill Lynch
applied the calendar year 2004 estimated earnings per share multiple range to the calendar year 2005 estimated earnings per share and discounted the result by the estimated cost of equity of 25.0%.
The following table
summarizes the derived ranges of multiples and the ranges of equity values per Oak share implied by such multiples, assuming publicly available securities research analyst estimates for Oak:

        No
company used in the above analysis is identical to Oak. In evaluating companies identified by Merrill Lynch as comparable to Oak, Merrill Lynch made judgments and assumptions with
regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Oak, such as the impact of competition on the
business of Oak and the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any material change in the financial condition and prospects of Oak or the industry or in the financial markets in
general. A complete analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the comparable companies and other factors that could
affect the public trading values of such comparable companies to which they are being compared; mathematical analysis is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected company data. 

        Merrill
Lynch noted that as of May 2, 2003 Oak's closing share price as a percentage of its 52-week high was 32.8% while the mean of the comparable companies was
53.0%. Merrill Lynch also noted that Oak's calendar year 2004 estimated gross margins and 5-year earnings per share growth rates were 60.0% and 30.0%, respectively, while the means of the
comparable companies were 42.7% and 22.7%, respectively. 

        Comparable Transaction Analysis.
    Using publicly available securities research analyst estimates and other information,
Merrill Lynch examined the following transactions that Merrill Lynch deemed to be relevant to determine the multiple of the value of such transactions at the time of announcement to 

estimates
at the time of announcement of the current calendar year revenues and next calendar year revenues for the target companies. The precedent transactions that Merrill Lynch considered are: 

Acquiror

Target

 Pixelworks, Inc.

 Genesis Microchip Incorporated

 Oak Technology, Inc.

 TeraLogic, Inc.

 IXYS Corporation

 Clare, Inc.

 DSP Group, Inc.

 Parthus Technologies plc

 Creative Technology Ltd.

 3Dlabs Inc.

 Intersil Corporation

 Elantec Semiconductor, Inc.

 Digi International Inc.

 NetSilicon, Inc.

 GlobeSpan, Inc.

 Virata Corporation

 Genesis Microchip Incorporated

 Sage, Inc.

 Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.

 General Semiconductor, Inc.

 TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc.

 Sawtek, Inc.

        All
calculations of multiples paid in the selected transactions were based on public information available at the time of public announcement. Merrill Lynch's analysis did not take into
account different market and other conditions during the period in which the selected transactions occurred. The following table summarizes the derived ranges of multiples and the ranges of equity
values per Oak share implied by such multiples, assuming publicly available securities research analyst estimates for Oak:

        Using
the same transactions, Merrill Lynch also calculated the exchange ratio premiums paid in such transactions. The following table summarizes the derived ranges of premiums and the
ranges of equity values per Oak share implied by such premiums: 

Premium range

$

5.75 - $7.25

        Merrill
Lynch noted that, as of May 2, 2003, the premiums to 1 day, 1 month and 3 month prior average exchange ratios for the proposed Zoran-Oak
transaction were 24.1%, 15.4% and 20.9%, respectively. 

        It
should be noted that no transaction utilized in the analysis above is identical to the proposed Zoran-Oak transaction. A complete analysis involves complex considerations
and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the companies involved in these transactions and other factors that could affect the transaction multiples or
premiums paid in such comparable transactions to which the transaction is being compared; mathematical analysis (such as determining the mean or the median) is not in itself a meaningful method of
using selected transaction data. 

        Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.
    Merrill Lynch performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Oak based on publicly available
securities research analyst estimates, with and without giving effect to expected synergies. In each case, Merrill Lynch calculated a range of equity values per share for Oak based upon the sum of the
discounted net present value of Oak's four and one-half year stream of projected unlevered free cash flows plus the discounted net present value of the terminal value based 

on
a range of multiples of its projected 2008 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA. 

        Using
discount rates ranging from 18% to 22% and terminal value multiples of estimated 2008 EBITDA ranging from 7.0x to 9.0x, Merrill Lynch calculated the following range of implied
equity values per share of Oak common stock:

        Comparable Public Trading Multiples Analysis.
    Using publicly available securities research analyst estimates and other
information, Merrill Lynch compared selected financial and trading data of Zoran with similar data for selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses that Merrill Lynch judged to be
reasonably comparable to those of Zoran. These companies were: 


MediaTek, Inc.

        Merrill
Lynch used publicly available securities research analyst estimates for each of these companies to determine multiples of the equity value of the comparable companies to several
estimated financial metrics for the comparable companies. The following table summarizes the derived ranges of multiples
and the ranges of equity values per Zoran share implied by such multiples, assuming publicly available securities research analyst estimates for Zoran:

company used in the above analysis is identical to Zoran. In evaluating companies identified by Merrill Lynch as comparable to Zoran, Merrill Lynch made judgments and assumptions with
regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, 

many
of which are beyond the control of Zoran, such as the impact of competition on the business of Zoran and the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any material change in the
financial condition and prospects of Zoran or the industry or in the financial markets in general. A complete analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial
and operating characteristics of the comparable companies and other factors that could affect the public trading values of such comparable companies to which they are being compared; mathematical
analysis is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected company data. 

        Merrill
Lynch noted that as of May 2, 2003 Zoran's closing share price as a percentage of its 52-week high was 65.6% while the mean of the comparable companies was
50.6%. Merrill Lynch also noted that Zoran's calendar year 2004 estimated gross margins and
5-year earnings per share growth rates were 38.1% and 21.0%, respectively, while the means of the comparable companies were 45.3% and 23.3%, respectively. 

        Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.
    Merrill Lynch performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Zoran, without giving effect to the
transaction, based on publicly available securities research analyst estimates. Merrill Lynch calculated a range of equity values per share for Zoran based upon the sum of the discounted net present
value of Zoran's four and one-half year stream of projected unlevered free cash flows plus the discounted net present value of the terminal value based on a range of multiples of its
projected 2008 EBITDA. 

        Using
discount rates ranging from 18% to 22% and terminal value multiples of estimated 2008 EBITDA ranging from 7.0x to 9.0x, Merrill Lynch calculated the following range of implied
equity values per share of Zoran common stock:

 Pro Forma Combination Analysis  

        Accretion/(Dilution) Analysis.
    Merrill Lynch analyzed certain pro forma effects expected to result from the merger,
including, among other things, the expected effect of the merger on the estimated earnings per share for Zoran for calendar year 2004. The estimated percentage accretion to Zoran's earnings per share
for calendar year 2004, based on the average of publicly available forecasts prepared by securities research analysts, and assuming expected synergies, is 6.3%. 

        The
actual results achieved by the combined company after the merger may vary from such estimated results and the variations may be material.The summary set forth above does not purport
to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Merrill Lynch in arriving at its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving various determinations as to
the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, such an opinion is not readily susceptible to
partial analysis or summary description. No company, business or transaction used in such analyses as a comparison is identical to Zoran or Oak or the merger, nor is an evaluation of such analyses
entirely mathematical. In arriving at its opinion, Merrill Lynch did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the
significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly, Merrill Lynch believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and of the
factors considered by it, without considering all factors and analyses, would, in the view of Merrill Lynch, create an incomplete and misleading view of the analyses underlying Merrill Lynch's
opinion. 

        Zoran
retained Merrill Lynch based upon Merrill Lynch's experience and expertise. Merrill Lynch is an internationally recognized investment banking firm with substantial experience in
transactions similar to the proposed Zoran-Oak transaction. Merrill Lynch, as part of its investment banking business, is continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities
in connection with business combinations and acquisitions and for other purposes and has substantial experience in transactions similar to the proposed Zoran-Oak transaction. 

        Under
the terms of the engagement letter between Merrill Lynch and Zoran, Merrill Lynch provided financial advisory services and the financial fairness opinion in connection with the
transaction, and Zoran agreed to pay Merrill Lynch a customary fee, a significant portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the transaction. In addition, Zoran has agreed to indemnify
Merrill Lynch and its affiliates, their respective directors, officers, agents, employees and controlling persons against certain liabilities and expenses, including certain liabilities under the
federal securities laws, related to or arising out of Merrill Lynch's engagement. 

        In
the ordinary course of its business, Merrill Lynch may actively trade in the securities of Zoran and Oak, for its own account and for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly,
may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. 

Opinion of Financial Advisor to Oak  

        Under an engagement letter dated May 2, 2003, which superceded and replaced a prior engagement letter dated October 22, 2001, Oak formally retained
Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated to provide it with certain financial advisory services in connection with a strategic transaction. Morgan Stanley was selected by Oak based on Morgan Stanley's
qualifications, expertise and reputation and its knowledge of the business and affairs of the industry in which Oak operates. At a meeting of Oak's board of directors on May 4, 2003, Morgan
Stanley rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that as of May 4, 2003 and based upon and subject to the assumptions, considerations and limitations set forth in the
opinion, the consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Oak common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders. 

        The
full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley, dated as of May 4, 2003, is attached as Annex E. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion. We urge you to read the entire opinion carefully. Morgan
Stanley's opinion is directed to Oak's board of directors and addresses only the fairness to holders of shares of Oak common stock, from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be received
by such holders pursuant to the merger agreement as of the date of the opinion. It does not address any other aspect of the merger and does not address the prices at which Oak common stock or Zoran
common stock will trade following the consummation of the merger, nor does it constitute a recommendation to any holder of Oak common stock as to how to vote at Oak's special meeting. The summary of
the opinion of Morgan Stanley set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of its opinion. 

        In
rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things: 


reviewed
certain publicly available financial statements and other information of Oak and Zoran, respectively;


reviewed
certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning Oak and Zoran, prepared by the managements of Oak and Zoran, respectively;


reviewed
certain financial projections for Oak and Zoran, prepared by the managements of Oak and Zoran, respectively;


discussed
certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the merger with the managements of Oak and Zoran and reviewed estimates of such benefits
prepared by the managements of Oak and Zoran;


reviewed
the pro forma impact of the merger on the earnings per share and certain other financial metrics of Zoran;


reviewed
information relating to the relative financial contributions of Oak and Zoran to the combined company as a result of the merger;


discussed
the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of Oak and Zoran with senior executives of Oak and Zoran, respectively;


reviewed
the reported prices and trading activity for Oak common stock and Zoran common stock; 


compared
the financial performance of Oak and Zoran and the prices and trading activity of the Oak common stock and Zoran common stock with that of certain other comparable
publicly-traded companies and their securities;


reviewed
the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition transactions;


participated
in discussions and negotiations among representatives of Oak, Zoran and their financial and legal advisors;


reviewed
the draft merger agreement dated May 4, 2003, and certain related documents; and


performed
such other analyses and considered such other factors as Morgan Stanley deemed appropriate. 

        In
rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon without independent verification the accuracy and completeness of the information reviewed by it for the purposes of its
opinion. With respect to the financial projections and information relating to the strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the merger, Morgan Stanley assumed that they were
reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the future financial performance of Oak and Zoran, respectively. Morgan Stanley relied upon the
assessment by the management of Oak and Zoran of their ability to retain key employees. Morgan Stanley also relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment by the managements of Oak and
Zoran of Oak's and Zoran's technologies and products, the timing and risks associated with the integration of Oak and Zoran and the validity of, and risks associated with, Oak's and Zoran's existing
and future products and technologies. 

        In
addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement, including, among other things, that the receipt
of Zoran common stock by the holders of Oak common stock in the merger would be tax-free to such holders pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Morgan Stanley did not make any
independent valuation or appraisal of the assets, liabilities or technology of Oak and Zoran, nor was it furnished with any such appraisals. Morgan Stanley's opinion was necessarily based on
financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of May 4, 2003. 

        In
arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley was not authorized to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from any other party with respect to the acquisition of Oak or any of its assets. 

        The
following is a brief summary of the financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion dated May 4, 2003. These summaries of financial analyses
include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables
alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. 

        Historical Common Stock Performance.
    Morgan Stanley's analysis of Oak's common stock performance consisted of a historical
analysis of closing prices and trading volumes over the period of May 2, 2002 to May 2, 2003. During that period based on closing prices on the NASDAQ National Market, Oak common stock
achieved a high closing price per share of $14.24 on May 16, 2002 and a low closing price per share of $1.12 on October 9, 2002. Additionally, Morgan Stanley noted that the Oak common
stock closed at a price per share of $4.74 on May 2, 2003. Morgan Stanley's analysis of Zoran's common stock performance consisted of a historical analysis of closing prices and trading volumes
over the period of May 2, 2002 to May 2, 2003. During that period based on closing prices on the NASDAQ National Market, Zoran common stock achieved a high closing price per share of
$26.27 on May 15, 2002 and a low closing price per share of $9.11 on October 9, 2002. Additionally, Morgan Stanley noted that the Zoran common stock closed at a price per share of $17.64
on May 2, 2003. 

Based
on the closing prices of Oak and Zoran on May 2, 2003 of $4.74 and $17.64, respectively and the consideration set forth in the merger agreement, the implied transaction value was $5.88
per share for Oak common stock. 

        Comparative Stock Price Performance.
    Morgan Stanley performed historical analyses of closing prices of Oak common stock,
Zoran common stock, the NASDAQ index and a market capitalization weighted index of digital consumer integrated circuit, or IC, companies consisting of Mediatek Inc., LSI Logic Corp., Sunplus
Technology Co Ltd., ATI Technologies Inc., Cirrus Logic, Inc., Electronics for Imaging, Inc. ESS Technology, Inc., Genesis Microchip Inc., Omnivision
Technologies Inc. and Pixelworks Inc. Morgan Stanley compared the performance of such indices to the performance of the Oak common stock and the Zoran common stock during the period from
October 7, 2002 to May 2, 2003. Morgan Stanley observed that over such period, the digital consumer IC company index increased 19%, the NASDAQ index increased 34%, the Oak common stock
increased 70% and the Zoran common stock increased 89%. 

        Analyst Stock Price Targets.
    Morgan Stanley reviewed the publicly available equity analyst price targets for both Oak and
Zoran common stock as set forth below: 

Company

Range of Stock

Price Targets

Oak

$

3.00 - $7.00

Zoran

$

20.00 - $33.00

        Morgan
Stanley noted that for Oak the present value of the stock price targets ranged from $2.55-$5.95 per share versus a transaction value of $5.88 per share for Oak common
stock. Morgan Stanley also noted that for Zoran the present value of the price targets ranged from $16.88-$27.85 per share compared to a price of $17.64 per share for Zoran common stock on
May 2, 2003. 

        Contribution Analysis.
    Morgan Stanley analyzed the relative contribution of Oak and Zoran to current net cash and to
estimated revenues, gross profit, operating income and net income of the combined company for calendar years 2002, 2003 and 2004 based on publicly available research estimates for Oak and Zoran and
the market value of both companies on May 2, 2003. Morgan Stanley's contribution analysis assumed no cost savings or other combination benefits. Morgan Stanley then adjusted the relative
contribution by each company in light of each company's capital structure in 

order
to determine the implied pro forma ownership of the combined company. The range of results is set forth below:

        Morgan
Stanley noted that Oak stockholders would receive approximately 33.4% pro forma ownership in Zoran on a fully diluted basis calculated using the treasury stock method plus
approximately $100 million in cash, and the implied relative value contribution of Oak, measured by dividing the equity value of Oak implied by the transaction ("Oak Equity Value") by the sum
of the market value of Zoran plus the Oak Equity Value, would be 41.0%. 

        Comparable Companies Analysis.
    While noting that no comparable public company is exactly identical to Oak or Zoran, Morgan
Stanley compared selected financial information for Oak and Zoran with publicly available information for comparable digital consumer IC companies. Based upon publicly available estimates of certain
equity research analysts and First Call consensus mean estimates and using the closing prices as of May 2, 2003, Morgan Stanley calculated, for each of these companies, the stock trading price
divided by the earnings per share estimates for calendar years 2003 and 2004 (the "price/earnings" multiple) and aggregate value divided by the revenue estimates for calendar years 2003 and 2004 (the
"aggregate value/revenue" multiple). Aggregate value of a company is defined as the 

market
value of equity less cash plus the value of any debt, capital lease and preferred stock obligations of the company. The following table shows the results of these calculations:

        Morgan
Stanley noted that by using the closing prices on May 2, 2003 and based on the consideration set forth in the merger agreement, the calendar year 2004 aggregate
value/revenue multiple for Oak was 2.0x, and the calendar year 2004 price/earnings multiple was 42.0x. 

        No
company included in the comparable company analyses is identical to Oak or Zoran. In evaluating the comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to
industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. Many of these matters are beyond the control of Oak or Zoran, such as the impact of competition on
the business of Oak or Zoran and the industry in general, industry growth and the absence of any material adverse change in the financial condition and prospects of Oak or Zoran or the industry or in
the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the average or median, or the high or low, is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable company data. 

        Precedent Transaction Analysis.
    Morgan Stanley compared acquisition premiums in selected public technology transactions from
September 1, 2001 to May 2, 2003. The following table presents the premiums by quartile implied by the offer price to the common stock price one day before the announcement of the
transaction and the common stock price thirty trading days prior to the announcement of the transaction:

        Morgan

1-day prior price and to the price thirty trading days prior to the announcement of the transaction were 24% and 43%, respectively. 

        No
transaction included in the precedent transaction analysis is identical to the merger. In evaluating the precedent transactions, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with
regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. Many of these matters are beyond the control of Oak or Zoran, such as the impact of
competition on the business of Oak or Zoran and the industry in general, industry growth and the absence of any material adverse change in the financial condition and prospects of Oak or Zoran or the
industry or in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the average or median, or the high or the low, is not in itself a meaningful method of using precedent
transaction data. 

        Discounted Equity Valuation ("DEV") Analysis.
    Morgan Stanley performed an analysis of the implied present value per share of
each of Oak's and Zoran's common stock on a standalone basis based on future equity values calculated by applying various growth rates to First Call consensus mean estimates as of May 2, 2003
for Oak and Zoran, respectively. The following table shows the results of these calculations:

        Morgan
Stanley noted that for Oak the implied value per share ranged from $2.74-$6.07 versus a transaction value of $5.88 per share for Oak common stock and that for Zoran
the implied value per share ranged from $15.03-$31.71 per share compared to a price of $17.64 per share for Zoran common stock on May 2, 2003. 

        Pro Forma Analysis of the Merger.
    Morgan Stanley analyzed the pro forma impact of the merger on estimated earnings per share
for Zoran for calendar year 2004. The pro forma results were calculated as if the merger had closed prior to the beginning of the 2004 calendar year and were based on estimated earnings derived from
First Call consensus mean estimates for Oak and Zoran. The following table presents the pro forma calendar year 2004 estimated Zoran cash earnings per share and accretion/(dilution) based on the
consideration as set forth in the merger agreement, excluding any amortization of acquisition related intangibles, and assuming realization of approximately $14 million in pretax synergies
during calendar year 2004.

preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley
considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to any particular analysis or factor considered by it. Furthermore, Morgan Stanley believes that
the summary provided and the analyses described above must be considered as a whole and that selecting any portion of Morgan Stanley's analyses, without considering all its analyses, would create an
incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley's opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions, so that the range of
valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley's view of the actual value of Oak or Zoran. 

        In
performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are
beyond the control of Oak or Zoran. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley's analysis are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those suggested by such estimates. The analyses performed were prepared solely as part of Morgan Stanley's analysis of the fairness to holders of Oak common stock from a financial point
of view of the
consideration pursuant to the merger agreement of 0.2323 shares of Zoran common stock and cash in the amount of $1.78 for each share of Oak common stock and were conducted in connection with the
delivery of the Morgan Stanley opinion dated May 4, 2003 to the board of directors of Oak. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which Oak common stock or
Zoran common stock might actually trade. 

        The
consideration pursuant to the merger agreement and other terms of the merger agreement were determined through arm's length negotiations between Oak and Zoran and were approved by
Oak's board of directors. Morgan Stanley provided advice to Oak during such negotiations; however, Morgan Stanley did not recommend any specific consideration to Oak or that any specific consideration
constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger. In addition, as described above, Morgan Stanley's opinion and presentation to Oak's board of directors was one of many factors taken into
consideration by Oak's board of directors in making its decision to approve the merger. Consequently, the Morgan Stanley analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the
opinion of Oak's board of directors with respect to the value of Oak or of whether Oak's board of directors would have been willing to agree to a different consideration. 

        Morgan
Stanley is an internationally recognized investment banking and advisory firm. Morgan Stanley, as part of its investment banking and financial advisory business, is continuously
engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwriting, competitive bidding, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted
securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary course of business, Morgan Stanley or its affiliates may at any time hold long or short positions, trade
or otherwise effect transactions, for its own account or for the accounts of investment funds or other clients under the management of Morgan Stanley and for the accounts of its customers, in the
equity or debt securities or senior loans of Oak and/or Zoran. 

        Pursuant
to an engagement letter dated May 2, 2003, which superceded and replaced a prior engagement letter dated October 22, 2001, Morgan Stanley provided financial
advisory services in connection with the merger, and Oak agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a customary financial advisory fee, a significant portion of which is to be paid upon completion of the merger.
Oak has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its reasonable expenses incurred in performing its services. In addition, Oak has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, their
respective directors, officers, agents and employees and each person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses, including certain
liabilities under the federal securities laws, related to or arising out of Morgan Stanley's engagement and any related transactions. 

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger  

        In considering the recommendation of Oak's board of directors with respect to the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and approval of the merger, Oak
stockholders should be aware that certain members of the management of Oak and the Oak board of directors have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Oak
stockholders generally. Oak's 

board
of directors was aware of these interests and considered the following matters, among others, in approving the merger agreement and the merger: 

 Acceleration of Option Vesting for Oak Directors and Executive Officers  

        As of May 31, 2003, directors and executive officers of Oak (and their respective affiliates) beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately 8,579,970 shares of
Oak common stock, including shares issuable upon exercise of options to purchase Oak common stock. Upon completion of the merger, it is anticipated that the former directors and executive officers of
Oak (and their respective affiliates) collectively will beneficially own less than    % of the outstanding shares of Zoran common stock. 

        As
of May 31, 2003, directors and executive officers of Oak held outstanding stock options to purchase an aggregate of approximately 8,196,040 shares of Oak common stock. Any of these
options remaining outstanding as of the effective time of the merger and that would, upon assumption by Zoran, have a per share exercise price that does not exceed an amount, or "assumption
threshold," equal to 105% of the closing sale price of a share of Zoran common stock on the last trading day prior to the effective time of the merger will be assumed by Zoran in accordance with the
merger agreement. Any of these options that would, upon assumption, have a per share exercise price exceeding this assumption threshold will not be assumed by Zoran and instead will terminate and
cease to be outstanding as of the effective time of the merger. However, Zoran will grant to any such holder of a terminated underwater Oak option who remains an employee of the surviving corporation
an option to purchase shares of Zoran common stock. You should review the discussion in the section entitled "The Merger AgreementOak Stock Options" beginning on page 85 for a more
detailed description of the assumption and replacement of certain Oak stock options. 

        As
of May 31, 2003, options to purchase an aggregate of approximately 571,040 shares of Oak common stock were held by Oak's non-employee directors under Oak's 1994 Outside
Director Stock Option Plan and 1994 Stock Option Plan. Under these plans, all of the unvested option shares held by non-employee directors will vest in full and become exercisable
immediately prior to the merger. Assuming such individuals continue in Oak's service through the closing of the merger and no additional options are granted to them after May 31, 2003 and prior
to the closing date,
the non-employee directors will hold the following number of option shares as of the closing date:

        Under
the Amended and Restated Agreement of Plan Participation entered into by Oak and Young Sohn pursuant to Oak's Retention and Severance Plan for the Chief Executive Officer, the
vesting of Mr. Sohn's options will accelerate by 30 months from the effective date of the merger. See "The Merger Agreement and Related AgreementsEmployment and Related
Agreements" for a more detailed discussion of Mr. Sohn's severance arrangement. 

        Under
Oak's Executive Retention and Severance Plan adopted as of April 9, 2002, and the related Agreement of Plan Participation entered into by Oak and each of John S.
Edmunds, Simon P. Dolan, David J. Power, Francis Yu, John Squire, David Auld, Dawn Thompson, Robert Lensch and Barry Cornell as of May 6, 2002, if any such individual's (including
any individual subject to this plan who will 

not
be a continuing employee of Zoran following completion of the merger) options are not fully assumed or replaced with fully-equivalent substitute options by Zoran, the vesting of such person's
options will accelerate in full. If any such individual's employment is terminated without cause or the individual resigns for good reason, as described in the plan, after the public announcement of
the merger and within 12 months after the closing of the merger, the vesting of his or her options will accelerate by 12 months from the date of termination. Each of John S.
Edmunds, Simon P. Dolan and David Auld have signed employment agreements providing, among other things, that no acceleration will occur as a result of the merger under the Oak Retention and
Severance Plan, and instead, these three individuals will be entitled to severance benefits set forth in their individual employment agreements. See "The Merger Agreement and Related
AgreementsEmployment and Related Agreements" for additional details. In addition, these individuals will be eligible, along with all other Oak stockholders and option holders, to exchange
their shares of Oak common stock for shares of Zoran common stock and have their options assumed or replaced, as the case may be, under the terms of the merger agreement. 

        Assuming
that the other severance plan participants continue in Oak's service through the closing of the merger and no additional options are granted to them after May 31, 2003
and prior to the closing date, each such individual will hold the following number of option shares on such date:

        Under
the noncompetition agreement entered into by Oak and Jon Castor on October 7, 2002, if Mr. Castor's employment is terminated for any reason (other than for cause or
voluntarily), all of his unvested options will continue to vest for the remainder of the 18-month non-compete period ending April 7, 2004. Assuming that
Mr. Castor continues in Oak's service through the closing of the merger and no additional options are granted to him prior to the closing date, he will hold options to purchase 415,000 shares
of Oak common stock on such date, all of which are unvested. 

 Employment-Related Interests  

        Immediately prior to the signing of the merger agreement, each of Young K. Sohn, John S. Edmunds, Simon P. Dolan and David Auld entered into employment agreements
with Zoran providing these individuals with special employment rights and severance benefits effective upon consummation of the merger. The terms of these employment agreements are summarized in the
section entitled "The Merger Agreement and Related AgreementsEmployment and Related Agreements." 

 Appointment of Oak Directors to the Zoran Board  

        The merger agreement provides that Zoran will cause three current members of Oak's board of directors, David Rynne, Peter Simone and Young Sohn, to be elected to
serve as directors of the combined company effective upon the completion of the merger. 

 Indemnification Agreements  

        The merger agreement provides that Zoran will obtain, prior to the closing of the merger, and maintain for at least six years after the effective time of the
merger, directors' and officers' liability insurance policies on substantially the same terms and conditions as Oak's insurance policies in effect as of May 4, 2003 with respect to events
occurring prior to the effective time of the merger. If, however, comparable coverage is unavailable for an aggregate premium of less than 250% of the aggregate annual premiums currently paid by Oak
for such insurance, then Zoran will only be required to obtain such lesser coverage as may be obtained for such amount. 

U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations  

        In the opinions of Wildman, Harrold, Allen & Dixon, counsel to Oak, and Gray Cary Ware & Freidenrich LLP, counsel to Zoran, the following discussion
addresses the material U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to the merger that may be applicable to Oak stockholders. These opinions and the following discussion are based on currently
existing provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, existing treasury regulations and current administrative rulings and court decisions, all of which are subject to change. Any such change, which may
or may not be retroactive, could alter the tax consequences to Zoran, Oak, the merger subsidiary or Oak stockholders. 

        Oak
stockholders should be aware that this discussion does not address all federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to particular Oak stockholders that are subject to
special rules or that may be important in light of such stockholders' individual circumstances, including without limitation, stockholders who: 


are
dealers in securities or foreign currency;


are
subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code;


are
foreign persons or entities;


are
financial institutions or insurance companies;


do
not hold their Oak shares as capital assets;


acquired
their shares in connection with the stock option or stock purchase plans or in other compensatory transactions; or


hold
Oak capital stock as part of an integrated investment (including a "straddle," pledge against currency risk, "constructive" sale or "conversion" transaction) comprised
of shares of Oak capital stock and one or more other positions. 

        In
addition, the following discussion does not address: 


tax
consequences of the merger under foreign, state or local tax laws;


tax
consequences of transactions effectuated before, after or concurrently with the merger (whether or not any such transactions are undertaken in connection with the
merger) including any transaction in which Oak shares are acquired or Zoran shares are disposed of; or


tax
consequences to holders of options, warrants or similar rights to acquire Oak capital stock, including the assumption by Zoran of outstanding options and subscriptions
to acquire Oak capital stock. 

Accordingly, Oak stockholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences of the merger, including the applicable federal,
state, local and foreign tax consequences of the merger.

        Completion
of the merger is conditioned on receipt of tax opinions ("Tax Opinions") by Oak and Zoran from their respective counsel, Wildman, Harrold, Allen & Dixon and Gray Cary
Ware & 

Freidenrich
LLP to the effect that the merger will be treated as a "reorganization" qualifying under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and that each of Zoran, Oak
and the merger subsidiary will be a party to the "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Tax Opinions will be based on representations of Zoran,
Oak and the merger subsidiary, and, as explained more fully below, are subject to certain assumptions, limitations and qualifications. In the event that this opinion requirement is waived as a result
of a material change in the tax consequences of the merger from those expressed in this tax consequences section, a revised tax consequences section will be prepared and distributed to Oak
stockholders as part of a revised joint proxy statement/prospectus for the merger. 

        The
following material federal income tax consequences will generally result from the merger constituting a reorganization within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code: 


Oak
stockholders will generally recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the amount of gain realized (i.e., the excess of the sum of the
amount of cash and the fair market value of the Zoran common stock received pursuant to the merger over the stockholder's adjusted tax basis in the shares of Oak common stock surrendered) or
(2) the amount of cash received pursuant to the merger. For this purpose, gain or loss must be calculated separately for each identifiable block of shares surrendered in the exchange, and a
loss realized on one block of shares may not be used to offset a gain realized on another block of shares. Oak stockholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the manner in which cash and
Zoran common stock should be allocated among different blocks of Oak common stock. Any recognized gain will generally be long-term capital gain if the stockholder's holding period with
respect to the Oak common stock surrendered is more than one year at the effective time of the merger. If, however, the cash received has the effect of the distribution of a dividend, the gain will be
treated as a dividend to the extent of the stockholder's ratable share of accumulated earnings and profits as calculated for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Zoran and Oak expect that there will
likely not be any such accumulated earnings and profits as of the effective time of the merger. Under the recently enacted Jobs and
Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, any dividends received in the merger by individual stockholders would generally be subject to the same maximum 15% tax rate that applies to
long-term capital gains recognized in the merger. Short term capital gains are subject to tax at ordinary income tax rates.


The
aggregate tax basis of Zoran common stock received (including fractional shares deemed received and redeemed as described below) will be equal to the aggregate adjusted
tax basis of the shares of Oak common stock surrendered for Zoran common stock and cash, reduced by the amount of cash received by the holder pursuant to the merger (excluding any cash received
instead of a fractional share of Zoran common stock) and increased by the amount of gain (including any portion of the gain that is treated as a dividend as described below but excluding any gain or
loss resulting from the deemed receipt and redemption of fractional shares described below), if any, recognized by the holder on the exchange.


The
holding period of the Zoran common stock received by an Oak stockholder in the merger should include the period for which the surrendered Oak capital stock was
considered to be held, provided that the Oak common stock so surrendered is held as a capital asset at the time of the merger.


Cash
payments received by an Oak stockholder in lieu of fractional shares of Zoran common stock should be treated as if fractional shares of Zoran common stock had been
issued in the merger and then redeemed by Zoran. An Oak stockholder receiving cash in lieu of a fractional share will recognize capital gain or loss with respect to such payment measured by the
difference (if any) between the amount of cash received and the basis in the fractional share.


Neither
Zoran, the merger subsidiary nor Oak should recognize gain or loss solely as a result of the merger. 

        Although
Zoran and Oak will receive Tax Opinions that will provide that the merger will constitute a reorganization, a recipient of shares of Zoran common stock could recognize gain to
the extent that those shares were considered to be received in exchange for services or property other than solely Oak common stock. All or a portion of such a gain may be taxable as ordinary income.
An Oak stockholder could also have to recognize gain to the extent such stockholder was treated as receiving (directly or indirectly) consideration other than Zoran common stock in exchange for Oak
capital stock. 

        Zoran
and Oak will not request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") in connection with the merger, and the Tax Opinions will not be binding upon the IRS. The IRS is
therefore not precluded from successfully asserting a contrary opinion. In addition, the Tax Opinions will be subject to certain assumptions, limitations and qualifications, including the assumptions
that: 


Original
documents (including signatures) are authentic, documents submitted to counsel as copies conform to the original documents, and there has been (or will be by the
effective time of the merger) due execution and delivery of all documents where due execution and delivery are prerequisites to the effectiveness of such documents;


All
statements, covenants, representations and warranties in the merger agreement, in the representations received from Zoran, the merger subsidiary and Oak to support the
opinions, and in other documents related to Zoran, the merger subsidiary and Oak and relied upon by counsel to support the opinions are, in each case, true and accurate. Any such representation or
statement made "to the knowledge of" or otherwise similarly qualified is correct without such qualification and all such statements and representations, whether or not qualified, will remain true
through the effective time of the merger. In addition, as to all matters in which a person or entity making such a representation has represented that such person or entity either is not a party to,
does not have, or is not aware of any plan, intention, understanding or agreement to take an action, there is in fact no plan, intention, understanding or agreement and such action will not be taken;


The
merger will be consummated pursuant to the merger agreement and will be effective under the laws of the state of Delaware;


The
fair market value of the Zoran common stock (as of the effective time of the merger) received by Oak stockholders pursuant to the merger will equal or exceed 50% of the
total consideration received by the Oak stockholders (including stockholders who exercise dissenters' rights) in exchange for their shares of Oak common stock;


Zoran
and Oak will report the merger on their respective U.S. federal income tax returns in a manner consistent with the qualification of the merger as a reorganization; and


Representations
made by Zoran, its subsidiary and Oak in certain certificates to be delivered to counsel by the respective management of Zoran, its subsidiary and Oak will
be true and accurate. 

        A
successful IRS challenge to the reorganization status of the merger as a result of a failure to meet any of the requirements of a reorganization would result in Oak stockholders
recognizing taxable capital gain or loss with respect to their shares of Oak capital stock surrendered equal to the difference between their bases in such shares and the sum of cash and the fair
market value, as of the date the merger is completed, of the Zoran common stock received. In such event, a stockholder's aggregate basis in the Zoran common stock so received would equal its fair
market value as of the date the merger is completed and the stockholder's holding period for such stock would begin the day after the merger. 

        Reporting Requirements.
    Each Oak stockholder that receives Zoran common stock in the merger will be required to file a
statement with his or her federal income tax return providing his or her basis in the Oak stock surrendered and the fair market value of the Zoran common stock and any cash received in the merger, and
to retain permanent records of this information relating to the merger. 

        Backup Withholding.
    Certain non-corporate Oak stockholders may be subject to backup withholding at a 28% rate on
cash payments received instead of fractional shares of Zoran common stock. Backup withholding generally will not apply, however, to an Oak stockholder who (a) furnishes a correct taxpayer
identification number and certifies that he, she or it is not subject to backup withholding on the substitute Form W-9 or successor form included in the letter of transmittal to be
delivered to Oak stockholders following the date of the merger, (b) provides a certification of foreign status on the appropriate form or (c) is otherwise exempt from backup withholding. 

        Dissenting Stockholders.
    An Oak stockholder that exercises such stockholder's right to seek an appraisal of such
stockholder's shares of Oak common stock generally will recognize capital gain or loss measured by the difference between the amount of the cash received and the tax basis of the shares of Oak common
stock exchanged, provided (1) the Oak stockholder does not actually or constructively own any Zoran common stock after the exchange or (2) the Oak stockholder's ownership of Zoran common
stock after the exchange is minimal and the stockholder exercises no control with respect to corporate affairs. Since the law in this area is substantially underdeveloped, there may be alternative
U.S. federal income tax treatement, none of which is a clearly identifiable prominent alternative under current U.S. federal income tax law. Capital gain or loss will be long-term capital
gain or loss if the shares of Oak common stock exchanged by such dissenting stockholder have been held for more than one year as of the effective time of the merger. 

Accounting Treatment  

        Under generally accepted accounting principles, Zoran will account for the merger using the purchase method of accounting. Based on the number of shares of Oak
common stock and options to purchase Oak common stock outstanding as of June 3, 2003, under the purchase method of accounting, the total estimated purchase price recorded by Zoran will be
approximately $446.3 million, consisting of cash of $100.3 million, 13,097,000 shares of Zoran common stock with a fair value of $268.3 million, 4,558,000 shares of Zoran common
stock with a fair value of approximately $72.2 million for Zoran stock options and approximately $5.5 million in estimated transaction expenses. The actual purchase price will be
determined on the basis of the number of shares of Oak common stock outstanding at the date of completion of the merger, the market value of Zoran common stock on that date, the actual number of
shares of Zoran common stock issuable upon exercise of the assumed options and the actual amount of direct merger costs. Under the purchase method of accounting, Zoran will allocate the purchase price
to Oak's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair value as of the date of completion of the merger. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible
and intangible assets acquired will be recorded as goodwill and will not be amortized consistent with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets." 

U.S. Regulatory Requirements  

        Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, or HSR Act, and the rules promulgated thereunder by the Federal Trade Commission, or
FTC, the merger may not be completed until notifications have been given and certain information has been furnished to the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, or Antitrust
Division, and specified waiting period requirements have been satisfied. Zoran and Oak filed notification and report forms under the HSR Act with the FTC and the Antitrust Division on May 23,
2003, together with a request for early termination of the applicable waiting period. At any time before or after completion of the merger, 

notwithstanding
any expiration or early termination of the HSR Act waiting period, the Antitrust Division or the FTC could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable
in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the consummation of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of Zoran or Oak. In addition, at any time before or after the completion
of the merger, and notwithstanding the expiration or early termination of the HSR Act waiting period, any state could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in
the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the consummation of the merger or seeking divestiture of Oak or businesses of Zoran or Oak. Private parties may also seek to take legal
action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. 

Non-U.S. Regulatory Requirements  

        Neither Zoran nor Oak is aware of any material foreign governmental approvals or actions that are required to complete the merger. Zoran and Oak conduct
operations in a number of foreign countries, some of which have voluntary and/or post-merger notification systems. Should any approval or action be required, Zoran and Oak currently plan
to seek such approval or take such action. Failure to obtain approval or take action is not anticipated to have a material effect on the merger, Zoran or Oak. 

Restrictions on Resale of Zoran Common Stock  

        All shares of Zoran common stock received by Oak stockholders in the merger will be freely transferable, except that shares of Zoran common stock received by
persons who are deemed to be affiliates of Oak for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act may be resold by them only in transactions permitted by the resale provisions of
Rule 145, or Rule 144 in the case of such persons who become affiliates of Zoran, or as otherwise permitted under the Securities Act. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates of Oak or
Zoran generally include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with, such party and may include officers and directors of such party as well as principal
stockholders of such party. The merger agreement provides that Oak will use its best efforts to cause each of its affiliates to execute a written agreement to the effect that such person will not
offer or sell or otherwise dispose of any of the shares of Zoran common stock issued to such person in or pursuant to the merger in violation of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC thereunder. 

NASDAQ National Market Quotation  

        It is a condition to the merger that the shares of Zoran common stock to be issued in the merger or reserved for issuance in connection with the options assumed
in the merger be approved for quotation on The NASDAQ National Market. Zoran has begun preparation of a notification for listing of such shares of Zoran common stock on The NASDAQ National Market. 

Delisting and Deregistration of Oak Common Stock  

        If the merger is consummated, the Oak common stock will no longer meet the requirements for continued listing on The NASDAQ National Market and will be
deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

Treatment of Stock Certificates  

        After the completion of the merger, each stock certificate previously representing shares of Oak common stock will automatically, with no further action by the
holder of the stock certificate, represent the right to receive 0.2323 of a share of Zoran common stock and $1.78 in cash for each share of Oak common stock represented by the stock certificate. As
promptly as practicable after completion of the 

merger,
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, Zoran's exchange agent, will mail a letter of transmittal with instructions to each holder of record of Oak common stock outstanding immediately
prior to the completion of the merger for use in exchanging, by book-entry transfer or otherwise, stock certificates formerly representing shares of Oak common stock for certificates
representing shares of Zoran common stock. 

No stock certificates should be surrendered by any holder of Oak common stock until the holder has received the letter of transmittal and instructions from
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company.
 Zoran stockholders will keep their current stock certificates as the merger does not require surrender of Zoran stock
certificates. 

Appraisal Rights for Oak Stockholders  

        The Delaware General Corporation Law grants appraisal rights in the merger to the holders of Oak common stock who do not vote for the merger and who follow
certain procedures. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, Oak stockholders may demand in writing that Oak pay the fair value of their shares. Fair value takes into account all relevant factors,
but excludes any appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of the merger. Stockholders who elect to exercise appraisal rights must strictly comply with all of the applicable procedures to preserve
those rights. These procedures are set forth in Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which is set forth in Annex F to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

        Failure
to comply with the procedures set forth in Section 262 may cause a stockholder to lose his or her appraisal rights. The following summary of appraisal rights and the
related procedures is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of Section 262, which should be reviewed for a complete description of the procedures. Oak will not give any notice to its
stockholders relating to appraisal rights other than as described in this document and required by the Delaware General Corporation Law. 

        If
you are an Oak stockholder and you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you must comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.
Section 262 requires, in part, the following: 

        Written Demand for Appraisal.
    You must deliver a written demand for appraisal to Oak before the vote is taken at the special
meeting. The written demand must be separate and apart from any vote against the merger. 

        Refrain from Voting for Approval of the Merger.
    You must not vote for approval of the merger. If you vote in favor of the
merger, your right to appraisal will terminate, even if you previously submitted a written demand for appraisal. 

        Continuously Hold Oak Shares.
    You must continuously hold your shares of Oak stock from the date you make the demand for
appraisal through the closing of the merger. 


A
written demand for appraisal of Oak stock is only effective if it is delivered by, or for, the stockholder of record who owns such shares at the time the demand is made.
The demand must be signed as the stockholder's name appears on its stock certificate(s). If you are the beneficial owner of Oak stock but not the stockholder of record, you must have the stockholder
of record deliver a written demand for appraisal.


If
you own Oak stock in a fiduciary capacity, such as a trustee, guardian or custodian, you must disclose the fact that you are delivering the demand for appraisal in that
capacity.


If
you own Oak stock with more than one person, such as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand for appraisal must be made by or on behalf of all record owners.
An 

authorized
agent, which could include one or more of the joint owners, may deliver the demand for appraisal for the stockholder of record; however, the agent must expressly identify the stockholders
of record and state that the agent is delivering the demand as agent for these stockholders. 


If
you are a record owner, such as a broker, who holds Oak stock as a nominee for others, you may exercise a right of appraisal with respect to the shares held for one or
more beneficial owners, while not exercising such right for other beneficial owners. In such a case, you should specify in the written demand the number of shares as to which you wish to demand
appraisal and clearly identify the beneficial owners for whom you are demanding appraisal. If you do not expressly specify the number of shares, Oak will assume that your written demand covers all the
shares that are held in your name.


You
should address the written demand to Oak Technology, Inc., 1390 Kifer Road, Sunnyvale, CA 94086, Attention: John S. Edmunds, Chief Financial Officer. It is
important that Oak receive all written demands before the vote concerning the merger agreement is taken. As explained above, this written demand should be delivered by, or on behalf of, the
stockholder of record. It should specify the stockholder's name and mailing address, the number of shares of stock owned, and that the stockholder is demanding appraisal of such stockholder's shares.


If
you fail to comply with any of these conditions and the merger becomes effective, you will only be entitled to receive the merger consideration provided for in the merger
agreement. 

        Written Notice.
    Within 10 days after the closing of the merger, Zoran must give written notice that the merger has
become effective to each Oak stockholder who has fully complied with the requirements of Section 262. 

        Petition in the Chancery Court.
    Within 120 days after the closing of the merger, either Zoran or any Oak stockholder
who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 may file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery. This petition should request that the chancery court determine the value of
the shares of Oak stock held by all of the stockholders who are entitled to appraisal rights. Zoran has no intention at this time to file such a petition; accordingly, if you intend to exercise your
rights of appraisal, you should file such a petition in the chancery court. Because Zoran has no obligation to file such a petition upon the merger, if no stockholder files such a petition within
120 days after the closing, all stockholders who have previously demanded appraisal will lose their rights of appraisal and receive the merger consideration provided for in the merger
agreement. 

        Withdrawal of Demand.
    If you change your mind and decide you no longer want appraisal rights, you may withdraw your demand
for appraisal at any time within 60 days after the closing of the merger. You may also withdraw your demand for appraisal more than 60 days after the closing of the merger, but only with
Zoran's written consent. If you effectively withdraw your demand for appraisal, you will receive the merger consideration provided for in the merger agreement. 

        Request for Appraisal Rights Statement.
    If you have complied with the conditions of Section 262, you will be entitled
to receive a statement from Zoran that sets forth the number of shares that have demanded appraisal and the number of stockholders who own those shares. In order to receive this statement, you must
send a written request to Zoran within 120 days after the closing of the merger. Zoran must mail the statement within 10 days after it receives the request. 

        Chancery Court Procedures.
    If you or another stockholder properly files a petition for appraisal in the chancery court and
delivers a copy to Zoran, Zoran will then have 20 days to provide the chancery court with a list of names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded appraisal rights and have not
reached an agreement with Zoran as to the value of their shares. The chancery court will then send notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of the petition to Zoran and all of the 

stockholders
in the list submitted to the chancery court. If the chancery court decides it is appropriate, it has the power to conduct a hearing to determine whether the stockholders have fully
complied with Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and whether they are entitled to appraisal rights under that section. The chancery court may also require a stockholder to
submit his or her stock certificate(s) to the Registry in Chancery so that it can note on the certificate(s) that an appraisal is pending. If you do not follow the chancery court's directions, you may
be dismissed from the proceeding. 

        Appraisal of Shares.
    After the chancery court determines which stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights, the chancery
court will appraise the shares. To determine the fair value of the shares, the chancery court will consider all relevant factors except for any appreciation or depreciation due to the anticipation or
accomplishment of the merger. After the chancery court determines the fair value of the shares, it will direct Zoran to pay that value to the stockholders who are entitled to appraisal rights. The
chancery court can also direct Zoran to pay interest, simple or compound, on that value if the chancery court determines that interest is appropriate. In order to receive the fair value for your
shares, you must surrender your Oak stock certificates to Zoran. 

        The
chancery court could determine that the fair value of the shares of stock is more than, the same as, or less than the merger consideration. Accordingly, if you exercise appraisal
rights, you could receive less consideration than you would under the merger agreement. 

        Costs and Expenses of Appraisal Proceeding.
    The costs and expenses of the appraisal proceeding may be assessed against Zoran
and the stockholders participating in the appraisal proceeding, as the chancery court deems equitable under the circumstances. You can request that the chancery court determine the amount of interest,
if any, Zoran should pay on the value of stock owned by stockholders entitled to the payment of interest. You may also request that the chancery court allocate the expense of the appraisal action
incurred by any stockholder pro rata against the value of all of the Oak shares entitled to the appraisal. 

        Loss of Stockholders' Rights.
    If you demand appraisal, after the closing of the merger you will not be entitled to: 


vote
the shares of Oak stock for which you have demanded appraisal;


receive
payment of dividends or any other distribution with respect to such shares, except for dividends or distributions, if any, that are payable to holders of record as
of a record date prior to the effective time of the merger; or


receive
payment of the consideration provided for in the merger agreement. However, you can regain these rights if no petition for an appraisal is filed within
120 days after the closing of the merger, or if you deliver to Zoran a written withdrawal of your demand for an appraisal and your acceptance of the merger, either within 60 days after
the closing of the merger or with the written consent of Zoran. As explained above, these actions will also terminate your appraisal rights. An appraisal proceeding in the chancery court cannot be
dismissed unless the chancery court approves. The chancery court may condition its approval of dismissal upon any terms that it deems just. 

THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND RELATED AGREEMENTS    

        THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL PROVISIONS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND RELATED AGREEMENTS BUT DOES NOT PURPORT TO DESCRIBE ALL THE TERMS OF THESE
AGREEMENTS. THE FULL TEXT OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT IS ATTACHED AS ANNEX A TO THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS AND INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. THIS SUMMARY IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY
REFERENCE TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT. YOU ARE URGED TO READ THE MERGER AGREEMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY. 

The Merger  

        The merger agreement provides that, following the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the merger by Oak's stockholders, the approval
of the issuance of shares of Zoran common stock in the merger by Zoran's stockholders, and the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions to the merger: 


Oak
will be merged with and into Zinc Acquisition Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Zoran; and


Oak
will cease to exist, and Zinc Acquisition Corporation will continue as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Zoran. 

        If
all such conditions to the merger are satisfied or waived, the merger will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State. 

Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws  

        The merger agreement provides that, at the effective time of the merger, the restated certificate of incorporation of Zinc Acquisition Corporation will be the
restated certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation, and the bylaws of Zinc Acquisition Corporation will be the bylaws of the surviving corporation. 

Zoran Board of Directors  

        The merger agreement provides that Zoran will take all necessary corporate action to elect three directors of Oak to Zoran's board of directors, effective as of
the effective time of the merger. Pursuant to these provisions, David Rynne, Peter Simone and Young Sohn, have been designated as the Oak directors who will be elected to Zoran's board. 

Conversion of Shares of Oak Common Stock  

        Upon completion of the merger and pursuant to the merger agreement, each issued and outstanding share of Oak common stock will be converted into the right to
receive 0.2323 of a share of Zoran common stock and $1.78 in cash. 

No Fractional Shares  

        No fractional shares of Zoran common stock will be issued in connection with the merger. Instead, Oak stockholders will receive an amount of cash, in lieu of a
fraction of a share of Zoran common stock, equal to the product of that fraction multiplied by the closing price for a share of Zoran common stock on The NASDAQ National Market on the last trading day
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. 

Oak Stock Options  

        Zoran has agreed to assume all options to purchase Oak common stock outstanding as of the effective time under Oak's 1988 Stock Option Plan, as amended, 1994
Stock Option Plan, as amended, Amended and Restated 1994 Outside Directors Stock Option Plan, Executive Stock Option Plan and the 2002 Stock Option Plan for the TeraLogic Group, that would, upon
assumption by Zoran, have a per share exercise price that does not exceed the agreed upon "assumption threshold," an amount equal to 105% of the closing sale price of a share of Zoran common stock on
the last trading day prior to the effective time of the merger. Each option assumed by Zoran will be subject to, and exercisable upon, the same terms and conditions as under the applicable Oak option
plan and option agreement under which such option was granted, except that: 


each
assumed option will be exercisable for, and represent a right to acquire, the number of shares of Zoran common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to
the number of shares of Oak common stock subject to such option immediately prior to the effective time of the merger multiplied by 0.3333; and


the
per share exercise price of each assumed Oak option will be an amount equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Oak option divided by the number of shares of Zoran
common stock purchasable under such option. 

        The
method of calculating the number of shares of Zoran common stock and the exercise price per share will be computed differently in the case of any assumed Oak option which immediately
prior to the effective time qualified as an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code if necessary to preserve the qualification of such option as an incentive stock
option. 

        Any
Oak options that would, upon assumption by Zoran, have an exercise price that is greater than the assumption threshold ("underwater options") will not be assumed by Zoran and instead
will terminate and cease to be outstanding as of the effective time of the merger, in accordance with the terms of the relevant Oak option plan and applicable agreements. Zoran has also agreed to
issue nonstatutory stock options to purchase shares of Zoran common stock to those holders of the terminated underwater options, provided they remain as employees of the surviving corporation after
the completion of the merger. Each such new Zoran option granted to the holder of a terminated underwater option will be exercisable for, and represent a right to acquire, the number of shares of
Zoran common stock equal to the number of shares of Oak common stock subject to the terminated underwater option immediately prior to the effective time of the merger multiplied by a valuation ratio
and further multiplied by 0.3333. The valuation ratio will be determined using the same method provided for determining exchange ratios under a proposed stock option exchange program described in the
proxy statement filed by Oak in connection with its annual meeting of stockholders held on December 18, 2002. Under this methodology, separate valuation ratios will be established for one or more
groups of terminated underwater options having per share exercise prices falling within specified ranges. The valuation ratio to be applied to terminated underwater options having exercise prices
falling within a given price range will be determined using an option valuation model. The option valuation model will be applied to determine the approximate value per share of a terminated
underwater option having the average exercise price within the price range and also the approximate value per share of a hypothetical Oak option having an exercise price equal to the closing sale
price of a share of Oak common stock on The Nasdaq National Market on the last trading day prior to the effective time of the merger. The valuation ratio applicable to terminated underwater options
within the given price range will be the fraction by which an at-the-money Oak option for one share must be multiplied to have the same value under the option valuation model as a terminated
underwater option for one share having the average exercise price within the given price range. 

        Each
new Zoran option granted to the holder of a terminated underwater Oak option will have an exercise price per share equal to the closing sale price of a share of Zoran common stock
on the date 

of
grant. The Zoran option will have the same vesting schedule as the terminated underwater option to which it relates and otherwise will be subject to the terms and conditions of the Zoran stock
option plan under which it is granted and the standard form of option agreement used in connection with such plan. 

        Zoran
has agreed to file a registration statement on Form S-8 that will register the Zoran common stock subject to the assumed Oak stock options within 10
business days after the effective time of the merger. 

Oak Employee Stock Purchase Plan  

        On or before the last trading day prior to the effective time of the merger, Oak shall terminate all offering and purchase periods in progress under Oak's Amended
and Restated 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. On this date, Oak shall apply any funds credited as of such date to the purchase of shares of Oak common stock in accordance with the terms of the plan.

No Solicitation by Zoran or Oak  

        The merger agreement provides that neither Zoran nor Oak will, directly or indirectly, through any of its officers, directors, employees, representatives or
agents: 


solicit,
initiate, seek, entertain or knowingly encourage or support any inquiries or proposals that constitute, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a proposal or
offer for a merger, 

consolidation,
business combination, sale of substantial assets, sale of a material number of shares of capital stock of Zoran or Oak, as the case may be (including without limitation by way of a
tender offer), other than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals are referred to as an "acquisition proposal;" 


engage
or participate in negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide any nonpublic information to any person or entity relating to, any acquisition proposal; or


agree
to approve or recommend any acquisition proposal. 

        However,
the merger agreement does not prevent Zoran or Oak or either company's board of directors from providing non-public information to, or engaging or participating in
discussions or negotiations with, any person or entity in connection with an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal by such person or entity or recommending such an unsolicited bona fide
written acquisition proposal to the stockholders of Zoran or Oak, as the case may be, if and only to the extent that: 


in
the case of Oak, the board of directors of Oak determines in good faith that such acquisition proposal, if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated, and believes
in good faith (after consultation with an independent, nationally recognized financial advisor) that such acquisition proposal would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to Oak's
stockholders from a financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement, and determines in good faith, after consultation with and based upon the advice of outside legal
counsel, that such action is necessary to comply with its fiduciary duties to Oak stockholders under applicable law, or in the case of Zoran, the board of directors of Zoran determines in good faith,
after consultation with and based upon the advice of outside legal counsel, that such action is necessary to comply with its fiduciary duties to Zoran stockholders under applicable law; or


prior
to furnishing such non-public information to such person or entity, Oak's board of directors or Zoran's board of directors, as the case may be, receives
from such person or entity an executed confidentiality agreement with terms no more favorable to such party than those contained in the non-disclosure agreement between Zoran and Oak. 

        In
addition, nothing in the merger agreement prevents either Oak or Zoran from complying with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act with regard to an acquisition proposal. 

        Each
of Zoran and Oak is required to notify the other company, orally and in writing, within 24 hours after receipt of any acquisition proposal or request for
non-public information or access to its properties, books or records in connection with an acquisition proposal. 

Indemnification and Insurance  

        The merger agreement provides that from and after the completion of the merger, Zoran and the surviving corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
person who was, as of the date of the merger agreement or had been at any time prior to the date thereof or who becomes prior to the completion of the merger, an officer or director of Oak or any of
its subsidiaries against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement with the approval of the indemnifying party, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, the fact that such person
is or was a director, officer or employee of Oak or any subsidiary, whether pertaining to any matter existing or occurring prior to or after the effective time and whether asserted or claimed prior
to, or at or after, the effective time. After the completion of the merger, Zoran and the surviving corporation will fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of Oak pursuant to Oak's bylaws
and any indemnification agreements with Oak directors and officers existing as of the date of the merger agreement. 

        In addition, Zoran has agreed to maintain in effect a policy or policies of director and officer liability insurance with coverage substantially comparable to policies in force as of the
date of the merger agreement covering the present directors and officers of Oak as of the date of the merger agreement for a period of not less than six years following the effective time; provided
that Zoran is not required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 250% of the annual premiums currently paid by Oak for such insurance; and, provided further, that if during such period the
annual premiums for such comparable insurance coverage exceed such amount, Zoran will be obligated to obtain a policy which, in the reasonable judgment of Zoran, provides the best coverage available
for a cost not exceeding such amount. 

Termination of Oak 401(k) Plan  

        Prior to the effective date of the merger, Oak will terminate any and all 401(k) plans, unless Zoran provides written notice to Oak that any 401(k) plan should
not be terminated. Unless Zoran provides such written notice to Oak, no later than five business days prior to the closing date, Oak shall provide to Zoran copies of duly adopted resolutions by Oak's
board of directors authorizing the termination of such 401(k) plans and, with respect to each 401(k) plan, an executed amendment to the 401(k) plan sufficient to assure compliance with all applicable
requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder so that the tax-qualified status of the 401(k) plan shall be maintained at the time of termination.

        The
merger agreement provides, however, that Oak will pay to Zoran a termination fee of $10,740,000 in cash if the merger agreement is terminated under the following circumstances: 


Zoran
terminates the merger agreement because Oak's board of directors has withdrawn or modified its recommendation or resolved or publicly announced its intention to do so;


Zoran
terminates the merger agreement because an alternative transaction has been completed or Oak's board of directors shall have recommended to the Oak stockholders an
alternative transaction or shall have resolved or publicly announced its intention to do so;


Zoran
terminates the merger agreement because a tender offer or exchange offer for more than 20% of the outstanding shares of Oak is commenced and Oak's board of directors
shall have recommended, or resolved or publicly announced its intention to recommend, that the Oak stockholders tender their shares in such tender offer or exchange offer, or resolved or publicly
announced its intention to take no position with respect to such tender offer or exchange offer;


Zoran
terminates the merger agreement because at the Oak stockholders' meeting, the requisite vote of the stockholders in favor of the merger is not obtained, and at the

Industry Background  

        Until the mid-1990s, video images and audio soundtracks were transmitted, edited and stored almost exclusively using analog formats. More recently,
however, advances in technology have allowed audio and video to be processed and stored in digital form. Unlike analog formats, which are inherently unstable and difficult to edit and enhance, digital
formats permit the manipulation of audio and video signals through digital signal processing and offer a number of fundamental advantages over analog technologies. Through complex digital signal
processing operations, digital audio and video signals may be compressed, providing significant storage and transmission efficiencies. They also may be filtered, allowing for noise reduction, and they
may be transmitted and reproduced without perceptible image or sound degradation. Digital formats provide users with additional benefits, including random
access to data, superior editing capabilities and enhanced security features such as protection against unauthorized copying and controlled and secure access. 

        One
of the most significant barriers to the widespread adoption of digital technology had been the huge amount of data required to represent images and sounds in a digital format, making
cost-effective storage or transmission impractical. Through digital compression techniques, a substantial number of the redundancies inherent in audio and video data can be identified and
eliminated, significantly reducing the overall amount of data which needs to be retained. Compression techniques introduced in the early 1990s allowed a two-hour movie to be compressed and
stored on only two video CDs with video resolution comparable to that of a standard VHS tape. More recent techniques allow the storage of a full-length movie of more than three hours on a
single DVD, with substantially improved audio and video quality and the incorporation of additional data, such as additional languages, scenes and director and actor commentary. Additionally, digital
compression of video data allows previously unmanageable amounts of data to be stored in the memory of a standard personal computer, thereby permitting the data to be accessed and edited easily.
Digital audio compression allows efficient storage and delivery of multi-channel audio, making possible high-quality special effects such as multi-channel surround sound, virtual surround
sound and wireless audio delivery via two speakers or headphones. In the field of still photography, digital compression allows dozens or hundreds of digital pictures to be stored on a single memory
card, depending on the resolution desired. 

        To
drive the implementation and speed the adoption of products based on digital formats, industry participants organized committees to define international compression standards. The
principal standards in use today include the following: 


The
Joint Photographic Experts Group, or JPEG, standard for the high quality compression of still images and the real-time, low-cost compression and
decompression of moving images;


The
MPEG 1 standard, adopted by the Moving Pictures Experts Group, or MPEG, for the compression of both audio and video data at the high compression ratios necessary
for the limited storage capacity of the CD-ROM format;


The
MPEG 2 standard, subsequently adopted by the Motion Pictures Expert Group, for the compression of both audio and video data, designed to provide improved quality
in broadcast and video playback applications;


The
MPEG 4 standard is an extension of MPEG 1 and MPEG 2 that provides the ability to view, access and manipulate objects rather than pixels, which is
especially significant in video streaming, digital television, module multimedia and video game applications; and


Dolby
AC-3, also known as Dolby Digital, developed by Dolby Laboratories, an industry standard for the compression of audio for use in multi-channel digital
surround sound systems. 

        These
industry standard techniques have enabled the dramatic growth in digital multimedia markets, including the following: 

        DVD Players and Recorders.
    DVD players and recorders use MPEG 2 video compression and Dolby Digital audio technology
to provide significantly higher quality playback or recording than is possible with VCR or video CD technology. According to Cahners In-Stat Group, sales of DVD players are expected to
grow from approximately 53 million units in 2002 to almost 84 million units by 2006. Sales of DVD recorders are expected to grow from approximately 1 million units in 2002 to
approximately 31 million in 2006. 

        Filmless Digital Cameras.
    Filmless digital cameras use JPEG compression technology to capture high resolution images that can
be viewed, edited and stored on a computer system and transmitted over telephone lines and computer networks. According to Cahners In-Stat and other marketing research firms, sales of
megapixel digital cameras are expected to grow from approximately 24 million units in 2002 to just under 47 million units in 2006. 

        Additional
products and markets are developing based on these established compression standards as well as compression technologies such as Meridian Lossless PCM, or MLP, a new standard
for DVD audio, Microsoft Windows Media Audio, or WMA, and MP3, a compression standard for the download of audio recordings from the Internet. 

        These
established and emerging compression standards specify data formats in which compressed data must be presented in order to enable products from different vendors to interact and
permit the capture, transmission, storage and display of audio and video data in digital format. These standards do not specify the compression methodologies to be employed or additional functionality
which may be used to enhance or manipulate digital signals. These standards, therefore, do not determine image or sound quality or compression efficiency. For example, data compression may comply with
relevant standards despite being poorly processed and containing artifacts which result in image degradation in video applications or poor sound quality in audio applications. As a result, there can
be significant
differences in overall image or sound quality between two solutions based on the same standard. Therefore, integrated circuit manufacturers can differentiate their products on the basis of the quality
of their compression solution. 

        Historically,
as system vendors sought compression solutions, the cost, complexity, and time required to compress and decompress data have imposed significant limitations on the use of
digital compression. Over the last several years, as cost-effective compression solutions have emerged, product 

manufacturers
have increasingly sought to design and market lower-cost digital audio and video systems and products to address high volume consumer applications. In addition, product
manufacturers are facing competitive pressure to introduce their products more rapidly. To address these issues, OEMs seek to integrate multiple functions on individual chips in order to reduce
their costs, speed time-to-market and produce smaller products with reduced power consumption. They also seek solutions that can be easily integrated into their commercial and
consumer products. The current challenge to manufacturers of compression integrated circuits is, therefore, to provide product manufacturers with high-quality, cost-effective,
standards-based solutions that deliver flexible control, image enhancement, audio effects and other functions in addition to high quality compression solutions. 

Zoran Solutions  

        Zoran provides feature-rich, cost-effective, standards-based solutions for a broad range of digital video and audio applications. Zoran
was a pioneer in the development of high performance digital signal processor products, and has developed expertise in digital signal processing, integrated circuit design, mathematical algorithms and
software development, as well as proprietary digital signal processing, video and audio compression technologies. Zoran applies its multi-disciplinary expertise and proprietary technologies to the
development of fully-integrated solutions for high-growth multimedia markets. The key elements of Zoran's solution are the following: 

        Standards-Plus Methodology.
    Zoran has leveraged its broad multi-disciplinary expertise and proprietary digital
signal processing and compression technologies to develop what Zoran refers to as "standards-plus" solutions. Zoran has enabled OEMs to improve image and sound quality and deliver
superior products to end users by adding more features around compression standards, such as more efficient use of memory, processing and communication resources, as well as audio and image
enhancement algorithms. Zoran has also provided OEMs the ability to include OEM-programmable effects, as well as variable compression ratios for video. These
"standards-plus" features allow Zoran's customers to differentiate their products from those of their competitors. 

        Expandable and Programmable Architecture.
    Zoran designs its integrated circuits to enable easy adaptation for a broad range
of specific applications. Zoran can vary the architecture of its chips by adding or deleting modules, and Zoran can also modify the software embedded in the chips themselves to address specific
applications. Zoran also licenses ready-to manufacture "cores"building blocks of integrated circuitsthat can be integrated into its customers' chips. Combined
with the enhanced functionality of Zoran's "standards-plus" technology, Zoran's expandable and programmable architecture facilitates product design, upgrades and customization,
substantially accelerating Zoran's customers' time to market with differentiated products. 

        Integrated System Solutions.
    Zoran helps its customers meet their total system requirements by providing integrated products
that combine hardware and software to address required system functions and features on a single integrated circuit or chip set, reducing the number of integrated circuits, and in some cases providing
a complete solution on a single chip. As a result, Zoran's customers' total system cost can be reduced and they can concentrate on differentiating their products from those of their competitors. For
example, Zoran introduced the Camera On A Chip, or COACH, which includes most of the electronics of a filmless digital camera. 

        Cost-Effective Products.
    Zoran focuses on reducing the feature size, power requirements and number of integrated
circuits necessary to perform required system functions, including compression functions. This reduces Zoran's customers' manufacturing costs for their products which incorporate Zoran's integrated
circuits, and also reduces the operating costs for these products, enabling the use of Zoran's products in a broader range of high volume applications. The modular nature of Zoran's architecture
reduces Zoran's new product development costs, and enables Zoran's design engineers to meet Zoran's customers' new product specification and cost parameters. 

        Copy-Ready System Reference Designs.
    Zoran provides its customers with a broad range of engineering reference
boards and products complete with device driver software, embedded software and detailed schematics. These products substantially shorten Zoran's customers' product design time. 

Strategy  

        Zoran provides cost-effective, high-performance digital audio and video solutions addressing selected high-growth applications
enabled by compression in evolving multimedia markets. Key elements of Zoran's strategy include the following: 

        Focus On High-Growth Applications.
    Zoran's strategy is to focus on providing digital video and audio solutions
for emerging high-growth consumer electronics, PC and communications applications. Zoran's current focus markets include DVD players and recorders, filmless digital cameras, digital
television, or DTV, professional and consumer video editing systems and digital speakers and audio systems. 

        Leverage Existing Technology and Expertise.
    Zoran intends to continue to identify those markets that it believes have the
highest growth potential for its products and to actively pursue those markets. Zoran's proprietary digital signal processing and compression technologies can be used to serve emerging markets for
digital video and audio. Potential markets include home network audio and video appliances, as well as personal digital video and audio devices. 

        Further Penetrate Key International Markets.
    In 1998, Zoran opened an office in Shenzhen, China. During 2000, Zoran opened
offices in Taiwan and Japan. In 2001, Zoran opened offices in Korea and Hong Kong. Zoran believes that by opening these offices it is better able to provide sales, marketing, and applications support
for these growing consumer electronics markets. 

        Extend Technological Leadership.
    Zoran's years of experience in the fields of digital signal processing, integrated circuit
design, algorithms and software development have enabled Zoran to become a leader in the development of digital audio and video solutions enabled by compression. Using its multi-disciplinary
expertise, Zoran has developed new technologies for compression of digital audio and video. For example, Zoran's proprietary bit rate control technology has helped Zoran provide reliable and
inexpensive JPEG-based video compression, and Zoran's proprietary Virtual Multi-Channel Digital, or VMD, technology enables high-quality surround-sound effects from two
low-cost audio speakers, rather than the four or five speakers required by other technologies. During 2000, Zoran acquired PixelCam Inc., which enabled Zoran to combine its Camera
On A Chip, or COACH, processor with PixelCam's CMOS sensor, providing a more integrated system. Furthermore, during 2000 Zoran acquired Nogatech Inc., which provided Zoran with low cost PC
connectivity and MPEG-4 technologies. Zoran intends to continue to invest in its own research and development, and to evaluate opportunities to acquire additional technologies in order to
maintain and extend its technological leadership. 

        Expand Strategic Partnerships.
    Zoran works closely in the product development process with leading manufacturers of products
that incorporate its integrated circuits. Zoran also works closely with key customers and provides them early access to its technologies. Potential products are designed to meet customer-driven
product requirements defined jointly by Zoran and its partners with the partner providing technological input and, in selected cases, a portion of the development funding. This strategy has enabled
Zoran to develop products with substantial financial and other assistance while retaining ownership of the technology and ensuring an established customer for the product once development is
completed. In some cases, Zoran's strategic partners also provide sales and marketing support. Zoran has also established long-term relationships with strategic partners that provide
manufacturing capacity and will seek to develop additional strategic relationships with manufacturers. 

Markets and Applications  

        Zoran's products are currently used in a variety of consumer multimedia and PC applications, including the following: 

 Video Playback Systems  

        Currently, three types of digital video playback systems are available for consumer video applications: video CD players, Super Video CD players and DVD players. 

        Video
CD players are essentially CD audio players with MPEG 1 decoders and a video output. Video CD players offer video playback of near-VCR quality and
two-channel stereo audio playback. Compression enables 60 to 70 minutes of video to be stored on a single CD. Video CD players can also play karaoke titles and were particularly popular in
China, although Zoran believes that the volume for these players has declined due to the growth of the DVD player market. Zoran formerly sold MPEG 1-based products to manufacturers
of stand-alone video CD players but is no longer selling these products for this market. 

        In
1998, the Chinese government adopted the Super Video CD standard. By utilizing MPEG 2 compression technology as well as graphics, Super Video CD offers substantially higher
audio and video quality than is possible with a video CD player. The Super Video CD standard is also being replaced by DVD players. 

        DVD
players, the latest generation of video playback systems, use MPEG 2 video compression and Dolby Digital or similar audio technology to provide significantly higher quality
playback than is possible with VCRs, Video CD or Super Video CD players. DVD players are sold as stand-alone products and are also bundled with other functions including DVD+VCR combinations,
DVD-Receivers and DVD+TV combinations. In addition, the DVD player can act as a platform for playback and editing of digital still images from digital cameras through integrated memory
card slots or via direct connection to digital cameras. DVD players are also included in place of CD-ROM drives in some PCs, where they are referred to as DVD-ROMs. 
DVD-ROMs are also sold as upgrade products. The growth in the DVD market is demonstrated by the rapidly growing sales of DVD players, the increasing number of models and
manufacturers, and the increasing number of DVD titles available for purchase and rent. 

 Filmless Digital Cameras  

        Filmless digital cameras allow the capture of high resolution images, the viewing, editing and storage of such images on a computer system and their transmission
over telephone lines and computer networks. High quality copies of these images can be printed using color printers. In addition, digital cameras can be connected directly to a PC for downloading of
pictures and to a television for displaying pictures. The original digital cameras were developed for the professional market and currently sell at prices of $1,000 to $3,000. As technology has
advanced and manufacturing costs have decreased, digital cameras for the consumer market have been introduced in the $69 to $600 price range. Compression technology has also enabled the development of
digital video security cameras and low cost digital video cameras for use with PCs. 

 Digital Video Recording Systems  

        Digital video recording systems are aimed at replacing the analog VCR. Digital video recording systems will not only store home made movies and TV programs but
will allow them to be easily edited. In addition, digital video recording systems will enable high quality time shifting of TV program viewing by recording the program so that it can be watched
simultaneously or on a delayed basis. The recording media includes DVD recordable media and hard disks. Digital video recording systems use MPEG 2 as the video compression format and Dolby
Digital or MPEG audio as the audio format. 

 PC Video Systems  

        Historically, professional video editing systems were comprised of expensive pieces of analog audio and video equipment. Compression technology allows digital
video images to be stored in a computer's memory in sufficient volume to enable capture and "cut and paste" editing to be performed through random access to stored images. As the cost of compression
technology has declined, a number of manufacturers have designed low cost digital video capture and editing systems that run on PCs, creating a new category of users in the corporate, education and
government markets. 

        The
availability of universal serial bus, or USB, connectors on most PCs currently being manufactured creates an opportunity for the development of low-cost external video
capture and editing accessories that can be easily installed by consumers. Zoran believes that enhanced support of video in consumer PCs, and the growing popularity of wideband Internet services will
open new opportunities for video capture and sharing applications on the PC and will increase the popularity of such products. 

 Digital Audio Systems  

        Digital audio facilitates enhanced audio playback with features such as multi-channel surround sound and virtual surround sound utilizing two channel technology.
Many standards have emerged for the digital compression of audio. 

        Current
digital audio compression standards in use include Dolby Digital, DTS, MLP and MP3. Dolby Digital and DTS are competing standards of audio compression for use in multi-channel
digital surround sound systems in movie theaters and at home. MLP was developed for audio compression in DVD audio. MP3 is one of the compression standards recognized for the download of audio
recordings over the Internet. Zoran's audio integrated circuits support all of these standards. The principal products using compressed digital audio in the consumer market are DVD players and
recorders, PCs incorporating DVD-ROMs, digital speakers and portable MP3 players. 

 Other Applications  

        Other existing and potential applications for Zoran's audio and video compression technologies include Internet audio and video appliances, digital television and
television set-top boxes, as well as personal digital audio and video devices. 

Image and Video Technology  

        The JPEG Standard.
    In 1991, the Joint Photographic Experts Group, or JPEG, Committee of the International Standards
Organization completed a technical specification for a standard to compress individual digitized images which may consist of still images or consecutive frames of video data. JPEG has been widely
adopted for video editing applications, since each frame in the video is individually compressed, allowing cutting and pasting of sequences as well as modification of individual frames. Images are
compressed through elimination of spatial redundancies within an image and the filtering of high frequency areas to which the eye is less sensitive. Using these techniques, the JPEG compression
standard is able to reduce the data necessary to represent an image without significant degradation of image quality. Still images or motion video can be compressed to varying degrees using JPEG, with
greater compression resulting in lower quality. Typically, four-to-one or five-to-one compression yields broadcast image quality while
20-to-1 compression is similar to VHS quality. 

        Zoran JPEG Technology.
    Zoran's JPEG technology incorporates a proprietary bit rate control algorithm that enables Zoran's
JPEG-based products to compress any image to a predetermined size while optimizing video quality using pre-selected parameters. Without this feature, the JPEG compression
process results in compressed data files of various sizes based on the actual content of the original image given a constant degree of compression. An image with large amounts of visual detail 

will
generate a larger data file than that generated from an image with less detail. Performance of many video applications is hampered by variability in the size of the compressed images in a video
sequence, which can result in inefficient use of available memory, bus speed or communication channel capacity or even the loss of images. Zoran's bit rate control is a "standards-plus"
solution that uses real-time digital signal processing algorithms to optimize video quality based on pre-selected parameters, which can be programmed by OEMs, without the loss
of any image or video frame. Zoran's bit rate control has been incorporated in Zoran's JPEG-based devices that are used in video editing systems, filmless and tapeless digital cameras,
color scanners, PC-based security systems, video conferencing and other applications. Other features of Zoran's JPEG-based products include their ability to handle a wide range
of compression ratios, to perform a "lossless" compression algorithm in the same JPEG device, to rapidly scan or browse a large number of images and utilize advanced image processing algorithms that
enable bit rate control of USB data, vertical blank interval detection, infrared remote control detection and scene analysis for computer control applications. Zoran implements these functions in a
single integrated circuit while it believes most other manufacturers either offer fewer functions or require multiple chips, resulting in higher manufacturing costs and greater power consumption. 

        CMOS Sensor Technology.
    With the widespread availability of inexpensive complementary metal oxide semiconductor, or CMOS,
fabrication facilities, image sensor designers are now able to offer a single chip solution to perform the "light-to-bytes" function at a quality level that is competitive with
the long established charge coupled device, or CCD, sensor technology, but with far greater operational flexibility and at much lower power consumption. CMOS sensors can scan in a variety of modes and
directions and perform analog-domain pre-processing of the signal which may be advantageous from a system perspective. Although the greater pixel circuit complexity results in a larger
imager today, progress is being made to both reduce the geometry of the pixel and use more aggressive design rules. The result will be a sensor which provides both cost reduction and performance
enhancement benefits to the system designer over the traditional CCD-based solution. 

        Zoran CMOS Sensor Technology.
    The PixelCam ZR32112 and ZR32312 are high performance 1.3 megapixel CMOS image sensors that are
ideal for digital still and video imaging products. Using Zoran's proprietary Distributed-Pixel Amplifier design, the pixel response is independent of its distance from each column's CDS circuitry.
This unique architecture results in an extremely uniform pixel array with low fixed-pattern noise without the need for off-chip background frame subtraction circuitry. The bank of analog
front-end circuits quantizes each pixel to 10 bit resolution. This highly parallel approach eases speed requirements on individual analog circuits and reduces overall power consumption.
Separate programmable red, green and blue PGA circuits enable analog-domain color balance. The flexibility of these sensors' output image format permits the tradeoff between resolution and frame rate.
The image output may also be horizontally "mirrored" and vertically "flipped". 

        The MPEG Standards.
    In 1991, the Moving Pictures Expert Group, or MPEG, Committee of the International Standards Organization
completed a technical specification for a standard to compress moving audio and video into a single data stream. Like JPEG, MPEG 1 removes spatial redundancies from single frames of video data.
MPEG 1 improves on JPEG by also removing redundancies that occur between consecutive video frames. Because video represents movement, it is possible to detect and estimate the movement of
similar picture elements between video frames, a process called motion estimation. MPEG motion estimation uses the content of previous and future frames to predict the content of the current frame
without using its full content. MPEG 1 implements audio compression by exploiting psycho-acoustic masking, taking advantage of the fact that the ear is less sensitive to a quiet note at one
frequency when a much louder note is present at a nearby frequency. MPEG 1 often achieves audio compression ratios of six-to-one and video compression ratios of over
100-to-1. MPEG 1 is particularly suitable for low-cost CD-ROM applications due to its low-cost implementation. 

        In
1993, the MPEG 2 video committee completed a technical specification to address the more stringent requirements of the broadcast industry. MPEG 2 provides more
sophisticated prediction techniques, enabling a compression solution to comprehend video as interlaced fields of data, rather than individual frames. MPEG 2 also allows for operation at higher
resolution and at higher bit rates than MPEG 1,
resulting in improved image quality for high motion, high detail video. MPEG 2 typically achieves compression ratios of 50-to-1. Because of its higher bit rate,
MPEG 2 technology cannot be used in standard CD-ROM applications, but can be used in DVD players. 

        MPEG 4
builds on the experience of the MPEG 1 and MPEG 2 standards, which are currently used in digital video applications. MPEG 4 is rich in features, and
can be customized to serve the needs of specific industries while preserving a high level of interoperability across a variety of applications. It allows a new level of interaction with visual
content, providing the ability to view, access and manipulate objects rather than pixels. MPEG 4's impact is especially significant in video streaming, digital television, mobile multimedia and
game applications. 

        Zoran MPEG Technology.
    Beginning in 1997, Zoran established itself as a leading provider of MPEG 2 technology for DVD
and Super Video CD applications. Zoran introduced the first DVD decoder device integrating digital video with multi-channel digital audio and programmable audio effects for use in DVD players. Zoran
also introduced new MPEG compression chip cores that can be integrated into chips manufactured by OEM customers, enabling these customers to reduce the cost of custom chip design and accelerate the
time-to-market of their products. 

Audio Technology  

        The Dolby Digital Standard.
    In 1992, Dolby Laboratories launched Dolby Digital, an audio compression technique which has
emerged as an industry standard. Dolby Digital was developed as a successor to Dolby's Pro-Logic analog technique for use in multi-channel digital surround sound systems. It is currently
used in movie theaters comprising over 24,000 screens worldwide and is also used in home theater and computer multimedia applications. Digital compression of audio data allows the storage of full
quality multi-channel audio playback in the limited space allocated for audio in video-oriented formats. It also facilitates the seamless integration of sound with compressed video. The Dolby Digital
audio compression standard is currently the principal audio compression technique used in DVD players. Dolby Digital has also been adopted as a standard for use in high-definition
television and digital cable systems. 

        Other Audio Standards.
    Other digital audio compression standards currently in use include DTS, an audio compression standard
that competes with Dolby Digital, MLP, a compression standard for DVD audio, and MP3, used for the download of audio recordings from the Internet. 

        Zoran Audio Technology.
    Working closely with Dolby Laboratories, Zoran has developed a programmable audio digital signal
processing engine with an architecture optimized for Dolby Digital and other demanding audio applications and Zoran was the first to develop a single-chip solution for Dolby Digital
decoding. Zoran's Vaddis DVD decoders and audio processors now incorporate this engine to allow systems manufacturers to replace system components with software modules, differentiate their products
from their competition, use Zoran's SiliconSoftware library of advanced audio algorithms, and reduce system costs and time to market. In addition to Dolby Digital, Zoran's DVD decoders
and audio processors support all principal audio compression standards, including DTS, MLP and MP3. Zoran's integrated circuits also include additional functions such as Virtual Multi-Channel Digital,
surround sound for headphones, High-Definition CD, karaoke processing and speaker equalization.

    Zoran's Vaddis decoders perform all the audio and video decoding and display requirements of the DVD
specification, including MPEG 2 audio and video decoding, Dolby Digital, DTS and MLP audio decoding, on-screen display, decryption required for copyright protection and presentation of
graphic information. The Vaddis has additional computation power that can be utilized for customer differentiation features. For example, it can incorporate virtual surround sound algorithms without
the addition of hardware. This allows the user to enjoy the theater-like sound obtained from six speakers using a system that includes only two speakers and the Vaddis. The Vaddis IV LC
incorporates a more powerful audio digital signal processor that enables the support of advanced audio 

algorithms
like MPEG 5.1, and DTS and audio DVD, which are needed in today's DVD player systems. The Vaddis 5E incorporates a host controller and progressive scan output and is targeted for the entry
to mid-range segment of the market. The Vaddis V integrates the host controller and incorporates DVD audio capability and progressive scan output features that are part of current
high-end DVD player systems. The Vaddis 6 is a DVD system on a chip which integrates the functionality of the Vaddis 5E with the functionality of the front end servo and read channel,
further reducing chip count and system cost for DVD player manufacturers. Vaddis decoders are being used in DVD players manufactured by Orion, Samsung, Sanyo, Sharp, Toshiba and others. Zoran provides
full reference designs of DVD players, based on Zoran's Vaddis chips, that help its customers accelerate their time to market for their products. 

        Filmless Digital Camera Products.
    Zoran's JPEG technology is used in filmless digital cameras. In September 1999,
Zoran introduced the Camera On A Chip, or COACHan integrated system on a chip solution that includes most of the electronics of a filmless digital camera. The COACH can be connected
directly to a high-resolution (up to 4 mega pixel) CCD or CMOS sensor, process the video information in real time, compress the captured image in real time to a flash memory, interface an
LCD or micro display and interface to all types of flash memory. Among the unique capabilities of the COACH is the ability to transfer in real-time, over a USB bus, high quality video to
the PC and thus serve also as a PC video camera. The COACH also allows for direct connection to a printer, including color correction and special effects, for the non-PC consumer
environment. The COACH is supplemented by full filmless digital camera reference designs, "CamON" and "CamMini," shortening the time to market for COACH customers. Zoran's
PixelCam CMOS sensor products currently deliver CCD image quality with 1.3 megapixel resolution at one-half the power dissipation and twice the integration level of CCD sensors. The
sensor's architecture is scalable, which will enable higher resolution product offerings as the digital camera OEM's needs change. These products also offer the digital camera manufacturer longer
battery life and reduced "time to next shot". 

        PC Video Products.
    Zoran's ZR36060 codec is a compression/decompression device used for real time encoding and decoding of
JPEG video for editing applications. It is fully compliant with JPEG standards. The ZR36060 utilizes Zoran's proprietary bit rate control technology for high quality video capture. The ZR36060 can be
installed in a chipset that includes the ZR36067 motion controller for PCI board implementation or pre/post-processing devices such as an integrated color
space/raster-to-block converter. The ZR36067 is a PCI motion JPEG controller targeting consumer-priced but professional quality desktop PCI video editing systems. The ZR36503
is a video chip for video communication across the USB channel to the PC. The ZR36504 chip incorporates video, audio and data streaming into a single chip for video, audio and data transfer across the
USB channel to the PC. 

        Digital Audio Products.
    The ZR38601, a single-chip digital audio processor designed to support the PC and home
theater digital speaker market, takes advantage of most of the advanced audio algorithms included in Zoran's Silicon Software library. Its eight channel output architecture supports the latest home
theater applications, including Dolby Surround EX 6.1 channel sound. The ZR38601's ability to accept six individual channels of audio input also makes it the ideal processor for today's four channel
Direct Sound computer games. The ZR38650, a true multi-standard digital audio processor, takes advantage of Zoran's complete SiliconSoftware library. It is designed to support the large mid and low
range audio/video receiver market, while providing features previously available only on more expensive models. 

        Integrated Circuit Cores.
    Zoran offers multimedia integrated circuit, or intellectual property ("IP"), cores which can be
incorporated into its customers' chips. For example, Zoran licenses a video decoder IP core for conversion of an NTSC, PAL, or SECAM TV signal into a format that allows the information in the TV
signal to be displayed on a TV monitor. This IP core enables the integration of TV functionality into integrated circuits for LCD panels, LCD-TVs, Plasma Display TVs, set-top
boxes, Digital TVs ("DTVs"), projector systems, PC video capture and other applications. Zoran's video encoder IP cores perform the reverse function, converting component video data into an NTSC, PAL 

or
SECAM TV signal. This IP core has applications in ICs for graphics display, set-top boxes, digital cameras, DTVs, DVD players, gaming systems and other applications. 

Customers  

        The following table lists representative customers, as well as other OEMs who purchase Zoran's products through Zoran's resellers. Each of these customers

        Fujifilm purchases Zoran's products primarily as a reseller. Fujifilm acts as Zoran's primary reseller in Japan and accounts for most of Zoran's
product sales in Japan. 

        During
2001, sales to Fujifilm accounted for 29.2% of Zoran's total revenues, including 30.6% of product sales. During 2002, sales to Fujifilm accounted for 36.6% of Zoran's total
revenues, including 38.4% of product sales. During 2001, Zoran's four largest customers accounted for 56.3% of Zoran's revenues, and during 2002, Zoran's four largest customers accounted for 58.6% of
Zoran's revenues. 

Research and Development  

        Zoran believes that its future success depends on its ability to continue to enhance its existing products and to develop new products that maintain technological
competitiveness and compliance with new standards in rapidly evolving consumer-oriented digital audio and video markets. Zoran attempts to leverage its expertise in the fields of digital signal
processing, integrated circuit design, algorithms and software development to maintain its position as a leader in the development of digital audio and 

video
solutions enabled by compression. Accordingly, Zoran devotes a significant portion of its resources to maintaining and upgrading its products to reduce integrated circuit cost, feature size,
power consumption and the number of integrated circuits required to perform compression and other functions necessary for the evolving digital audio and video application markets. In addition, Zoran
seeks to design integrated circuits and cores, as well as copy-ready reference designs which can reduce the time needed by manufacturers to integrate its products into their own products. 

        Zoran
has historically generated a significant percentage of its total revenues from development contracts with its strategic partners. These development contracts provide that Zoran
will receive payments upon reaching certain development milestones and that Zoran will retain ownership of the intellectual property developed. Development contracts have enabled Zoran to fund
portions of its product development efforts, to respond to the feature requirements of its customers, to accelerate the incorporation of its products into its customers' products and to accelerate the
time-to-market of its customers' products. Zoran anticipates, however, that in the future development contracts with strategic partners will fund a smaller portion of its
development efforts then in the past. 

        Zoran
is a party to research and development agreements with the Chief Scientist in Israel's Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Israel-United States Binational Industrial Research
and Development Foundation. These organizations fund up to 50% of incurred project costs for approved projects up to contract maximums. The agreements require Zoran to use its best efforts to achieve
specified results and to pay royalties at rates of 3% to 5% of resulting product sales and up to 30% of resulting license revenues, up to a maximum of 100% to 150% of the total funding received.
Reported research and development expenses are net of these grants, which fluctuate from period to period. In 2000, Zoran earned total grants of $333,000. Zoran did not receive any grants from these
organizations in 2001 or 2002. The terms of Israeli Government participation also contain restrictions on the location of research and development activities, and the terms of the grants from the
Chief Scientist prohibit the transfer of technology developed pursuant to these grants to any person without the prior written consent of the Chief Scientist. 

        As
of December 31, 2002, Zoran had a staff of 136 full-time and 30 part-time research and development personnel, 152 of whom are based in Israel. 

Sales and Marketing  

        Zoran's sales and marketing strategy is to focus on providing solutions, primarily compression related, for manufacturers seeking to design audio and video
products for emerging high volume consumer applications. In cooperation with leading manufacturers of audio and video equipment in the commercial and consumer markets, Zoran attempts to identify
market segments which have the potential for substantial growth. To implement Zoran's strategy, Zoran has established a direct sales force located at several sales and marketing offices, and a
worldwide network of independent sales representatives and resellers. In some cases, Zoran's strategic partners also provide sales and marketing support. 

        Zoran
works closely in the product development process with strategic partners to incorporate its integrated circuits and software into their products. Potential products are designed to
meet customer-specific product requirements defined jointly by Zoran and its strategic partners with its partners providing technological input, and in some cases, a portion of the development
funding. This strategy has permitted Zoran to develop products with substantial financial and other assistance, while retaining ownership of the technology and ensuring an established customer for the
product once development is completed. In addition, Zoran's application engineers assist customers in designing their products to incorporate Zoran's integrated circuits. 

        Zoran's
sales are generally made pursuant to purchase orders received between one and six months prior to the scheduled delivery date. Zoran sells its products primarily through its
29-person direct sales staff, of whom 3 are located in the United States and 26 are located internationally. 

Zoran's
United States sales staff is primarily responsible for sales in North America and South America. Zoran's Israeli sales staff is primarily responsible for sales in Europe and the Middle East.
Zoran's sales staffs in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea and Taiwan are responsible for sales in their respective regions. In addition, Zoran sells its products indirectly through 5 commissioned sales
representatives as well as selected distributors. Zoran typically warrants its products for a 12-month period. To date, Zoran has not experienced material product returns or warranty
expense. 

        Zoran
has opened offices in other parts of the world in order to better address specific markets. During 1998, Zoran opened an office in Shenzhen, China as part of its effort to capture
a leadership position in the Chinese digital audio and video markets. During 2000, Zoran opened an office in Taipei, Taiwan in an effort to better address the digital camera market. As of
December 31, 2002, Zoran had a staff of 77 employees in its China office and 12 employees in its Taiwan office, including sales, applications and customer support employees. In addition, in
2001 Zoran opened offices in Hong Kong and Korea, which had staffs of 6 employees and 7 employees, respectively, as of December 31, 2002. These offices also provide sales, applications and
customer support. 

        Zoran
distributes its DVD integrated circuit products in Japan primarily through Fujifilm. Fujifilm acts as the primary reseller in Japan of products developed by Zoran under development
contracts with Fujifilm. Zoran may sell these products directly in Japan only to specified customers with Fujifilm's consent. Zoran also operates an office in Tokyo to help promote its products in
Japan, manage the sales of products not sold through Fujifilm, such as integrated circuit cores and certain filmless digital camera and JPEG products, and provide applications support for some of its
customers. 

        Zoran
sells its Dolby technology enabled products under a perpetual, non-exclusive license from Dolby to sell products that incorporate the Dolby Digital algorithm. Zoran is
not required to pay license fees or royalties to Dolby under this agreement. Zoran's customers enter into license agreements directly with Dolby, pursuant to which they pay royalties to Dolby. Under
Zoran's agreement with Dolby, Zoran may sell its Dolby Digital-based products only to customers who are licensees of Dolby. To date, most potential customers for Zoran's Dolby Digital-based products
are licensees of Dolby. However, the failure or refusal of potential customers to enter into license agreements with Dolby in the future could harm Zoran's sales. 

        Zoran
sells its DTS Technology-based products under a non-exclusive license from DTS Technology LLC to sell products that incorporate the DTS algorithm. Zoran is not required
to pay royalties to DTS Technology under this agreement. Zoran's customers enter into license agreements directly with DTS, pursuant to which they pay royalties to DTS. Under Zoran's agreement with
DTS, Zoran may sell its DTS-based products only to customers who are licensees of DTS. The failure or refusal of potential customers to enter into license agreements with DTS in the future
could harm Zoran's sales. 

Backlog  

        Sales of Zoran's products are made pursuant to firm purchase orders. However, sometimes Zoran allows customers to cancel or reschedule deliveries. In addition,
purchase orders are subject to price renegotiations and to changes in quantities of products ordered as a result of changes in customers' requirements and manufacturing availability. Zoran's business
is characterized by short lead times and quick delivery schedules. As a result of these factors, Zoran does not believe that backlog at any given time is a meaningful indicator of future sales. 

Manufacturing  

        Zoran contracts its wafer fabrication, assembly and testing to independent foundries and contractors, which enables it to focus on its design strengths, minimize
fixed costs and capital expenditures and gain access to advanced manufacturing facilities. Zoran's engineers work closely with 

Zoran's
foundry partners and subcontractors to increase yields, lower manufacturing costs and assure quality. 

        Zoran's
primary foundry is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, which has manufactured integrated circuits for Zoran since 1987. TSMC is currently manufacturing Zoran's
DVD, audio, JPEG and some of Zoran's digital camera products. In addition, National Semiconductor manufactures some of Zoran's digital camera products. Hyundai and Fujitsu manufacture Zoran's USB
multimedia controller chips. Zoran's independent foundries fabricate products for other companies and may also produce products of their own design. 

        All
of Zoran's devices are currently fabricated using standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor process technology with 0.18 micron to 0.8 micron feature sizes. All of Zoran's
semiconductor products are currently being assembled by one of seven independent contractors, ASE, Amkor, ASAT, Kingpak, Kyocera, STATS or Vate, and tested by those contractors or other independent
contractors. 

        Zoran
currently purchases products from all of its foundries under individually negotiated purchase orders. Zoran does not currently have a long-term supply contract with
TSMC, and therefore TSMC is not obligated to manufacture products for Zoran for any specific period, in any specific quantity or at any specified price, except as may be provided in a particular
purchase order. 

Competition  

        Zoran's existing and potential competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have substantially greater resources in the following
areas: 


finance;


manufacturing;


technology;


marketing;
and


distribution.

        Some
of these competitors also have broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than Zoran does. Some of Zoran's principal competitors maintain their own
semiconductor foundries and may therefore benefit from capacity, cost and technical advantages. ALi Corporation, LSI Logic, ESS, Cirrus Logic, Matsushita, MediaTek, National Semiconductor,
STMicroelectronics, Sony, Texas Instruments and Winbond have introduced integrated audio and video devices for DVD applications. These manufacturers, as well as others, are licensed by Dolby to
incorporate Dolby Digital technology in their products. In addition, some manufacturers, including Sony, incorporate compression technologies other than Dolby Digital in audio products that compete
with products using Zoran's integrated circuits. In the markets for JPEG-based products for use in filmless digital cameras, Zoran's principal competitors are in-house
solutions developed and used by major Japanese OEMs, as well as products sold by Atmel, Omnivision, Sunplus and Texas Instruments. Motorola is providing CMOS sensor products. In the market for
JPEG-based products for desktop video editing applications, Zoran's principal competitors are Divio and Sunplus. Cirrus Logic (Crystal Semiconductor), Fujitsu, Motorola, STMicroelectronics
and Yamaha are currently shipping Dolby Digital-based audio compression products. 

        Zoran
believes that its ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving markets for high performance audio and video compression technology depends on a number of factors,
including the following: 


price,
quality, performance and features of its products; 


the
timing and success of new product introductions by itself, its customers and its competitors;


the
emergence of new industry standards;


its
ability to obtain adequate foundry capacity;


the
number and nature of its competitors in a given market; and


general
market and economic conditions. 

        The
markets in which Zoran competes are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change, declining average unit selling prices and rapid product obsolescence.
Zoran expects competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter its existing or future markets with solutions which may be less costly or provide
higher performance or more desirable features than Zoran's products. 

        The
DVD market is growing, and additional competitors are expected to enter the market for integrated circuits used in DVD players. Zoran believes that several large Japanese consumer
electronics companies may be planning to enter this market and may attempt to develop MPEG 2 hardware or software to compete with its products. Some of these potential competitors may develop captive
implementations for use only with their own PC and commercial and consumer electronics products. This increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced profit margins and loss of market
share. 

        Historically,
average unit selling prices in the semiconductor industry in general, and for Zoran's products in particular, have decreased over the life of a particular product. Zoran
expects that the average unit selling prices of its products will continue to be subject to significant pricing pressures. In order to offset expected declines in the average unit selling prices of
its products, Zoran will likely need to reduce the cost of its products. Zoran intends to accomplish this by implementing design changes that lower the cost of manufacture, assembly and testing, by
negotiating reduced charges by its foundries as and if volumes increase, and by successfully managing its manufacturing and subcontracting relationships. Since it does not operate its own
manufacturing, assembly or testing facilities, Zoran may not be able to reduce its costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own
facilities. If Zoran fails to introduce lower cost versions of its products in a timely manner or to successfully manage its manufacturing, assembly and testing relationships its business would be
harmed. 

Proprietary Rights and Licenses  

        Zoran's ability to compete successfully is dependent in part upon Zoran's ability to protect Zoran's proprietary technology and information. Although it relies on
a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws and licensing arrangements to protect some of its intellectual property, Zoran believes that factors such as the technological and
creative skills of its personnel and the success of its ongoing product development efforts are more important in maintaining its competitive position. Zoran generally enters into confidentiality or
license agreements with its employees, resellers, customers and potential customers and limits access to its proprietary information. Zoran currently holds several U.S. patents, and has additional
patent applications pending, that pertain to technologies and processes relating to its current business. Zoran's intellectual property rights, if challenged, may not be upheld as valid, may not be
adequate to prevent misappropriation of Zoran's technology or may not prevent the development of competitive products. Additionally, Zoran may not be able to obtain patents or other intellectual
property protection in the future. In particular, the existence of several consortiums that license patents relating to the MPEG standard has created uncertainty with respect to the use and
enforceability of patents implementing that standard. Furthermore, the laws of certain foreign countries in which Zoran's products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold, including various
countries in Asia, may not protect Zoran's products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States and thus make the possibility of piracy of Zoran's technology
and products more likely in these countries. 

        Zoran
sells its Dolby Digital-based products under a perpetual non-exclusive license from Dolby which permits it to incorporate the Dolby Digital algorithm into its products.
Zoran's customers enter into license agreements with Dolby pursuant to which they pay royalties directly to Dolby. Under its agreement with Dolby, Zoran may sell its Dolby Digital-based products only
to customers who are licensees of Dolby. To date, most potential customers for Zoran's Dolby Digital-based products are licensees of Dolby. However, the failure or refusal of potential customers to
enter into license agreements with Dolby in the future could harm Zoran's business. Zoran sells its DTS Technology-based products under a non-exclusive license from DTS Technology LLC to
sell products that incorporate the DTS algorithm. Zoran is not required to pay royalties to DTS under this agreement. Zoran's customers enter into license agreements directly with DTS, pursuant to
which they pay royalties to DTS. Under its agreement with DTS, Zoran may sell its DTS-based products only to customers who are licensees of DTS. The failure or refusal of potential
customers to enter into license agreements with Dolby in the future could harm Zoran's sales. 

        The
semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights, which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive
litigation. Zoran or its foundries from time to time are notified of claims that Zoran may be infringing patents or other
intellectual property rights owned by third parties. Zoran has been subject to intellectual property claims and litigation in the past and it may be subject to additional claims in the future. In
particular, given the uncertainty discussed above regarding patents relating to the MPEG standard, it is difficult for Zoran to assess the possibility that its activities in the MPEG field may give
rise to future patent infringement claims. Litigation by or against Zoran relating to patent infringement or other intellectual property matters could result in significant expense to Zoran and divert
the efforts of its technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation results in a determination favorable to Zoran. In the event of an adverse result in any such litigation, Zoran
could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacture, use and sale of infringing products, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, discontinue the
use of certain processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology. Licenses may not be offered or the terms of any offered licenses may not be acceptable to Zoran. If Zoran fails to obtain a
license from a third party for technology that it uses, Zoran could incur substantial liabilities and be forced to suspend the manufacture of products, or the use by its foundries of certain
processes. 

Employees  

        As of December 31, 2002, Zoran had 311 full-time and 68 part-time and contract employees, including 136 full-time and
30 part-time and contract employees primarily involved in research and development activities, 159 in marketing and sales, 40 in finance and administration and 14 in manufacturing control
and quality assurance. Zoran has 151 full-time employees and 36 part-time and contract employees based in Israel, including 166 employees who are primarily involved in
engineering and research and development. Zoran has 75 employees at its facilities in Santa Clara, California. The remaining employees are located in Zoran's international offices in Canada, China,
Hong Kong, Japan, Korea and Taiwan. Zoran believes that its future success will depend in large part on its ability to attract and retain highly-skilled, engineering, managerial, sales and marketing
personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense. Zoran's employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit, and Zoran has never experienced a work stoppage. Zoran believes that its
employee relations are good. 

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF ZORAN    

Overview  

        From its inception in 1981 through 1991, Zoran derived the substantial majority of its revenue from digital filter processors and vector signal processors used
principally in military, industrial and medical applications. In 1989, Zoran repositioned its business to develop and market data compression products for the evolving multimedia markets and
discontinued development of digital filter processor and vector signal processor products. In 1994, Zoran discontinued production of these products. Zoran's current lines of digital audio and video
products include integrated circuits and related products used in digital versatile disc, or DVD, players and recorders, movie and home theater systems, filmless digital cameras and video editing
systems. 

        Zoran
derives most of its revenues from the sale of its integrated circuit products. Historically, average selling prices in the semiconductor industry in general, and for Zoran's
products in particular, have decreased over the life of a particular product. Average selling prices for Zoran's hardware products have fluctuated substantially from period to period, primarily as a
result of changes in Zoran's customer mix of original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, sales versus sales to resellers and the transition from low-volume to high-volume
production. In the past, Zoran has reduced the prices of some of its products in order to better penetrate the consumer market. Zoran believes that, as its product lines continue to mature and
competitive markets evolve, it is likely to experience further declines in the average selling prices of its products, although it cannot predict the timing and amount of such future changes with any
certainty. 

        Zoran's
cost of product sales consists primarily of fabrication costs, assembly and test costs, and the cost of materials and overhead from operations. If Zoran is unable to reduce its
cost of product sales to offset anticipated decreases in average selling prices, its product gross margins will decrease. Zoran's product gross margin is also dependent on product mix and on the
percentage of products sold directly to Zoran's OEM customers versus indirectly through Zoran's marketing partners who purchase Zoran's products at lower prices but absorb most of the associated
marketing and sales support expenses, maintain inventories and provide customer support and training. Lower gross margins on sales to distributors are partially offset by reduced selling and marketing
expenses related to such sales. Product
sales in Japan are primarily made through Fujifilm, Zoran's strategic partner and distributor in Japan. Fujifilm provides more sales and marketing support than Zoran's other distributors. Zoran
expects both product and customer mix to continue to fluctuate in future periods, causing further fluctuations in margins. 

        Zoran
also derives revenue from licensing its software and other intellectual property. Licensing revenue includes one-time license fees and royalties based on the number of
units distributed by the licensee. In addition, Zoran has historically generated a significant percentage of its total revenues from development contracts, primarily with key customers, although
development revenue has declined substantially as a percentage of total revenues over the past several years. These development contracts have provided Zoran with partial funding for the development
of some of its products. These development contracts provide for license and milestone payments which are recorded as development revenue. Zoran classifies all development costs, including costs
related to these development contracts, as research and development expenses. Zoran retains ownership of the intellectual property developed by it under these development contracts. While it intends
to continue to enter into development contracts with certain strategic partners, Zoran expects development revenue to continue to decline as a percentage of total revenues. 

        Zoran's
research and development expenses consist of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in ongoing research, design and development activities and costs of engineering
materials and supplies. Zoran is also a party to research and development agreements with the Chief Scientist in Israel's Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Israel-United States Binational
Industrial Research and 

Development
Foundation, which fund up to 50% of incurred project costs for approved products up to specified contract maximums. These agreements require Zoran to use its best efforts to achieve
specified results and require it to pay royalties at rates of 3% to 5% of resulting product sales, and up to 30% of resulting license revenues, up to a maximum of 100% to 150% of total funding
received. Reported research and development expenses are net of these grants, which fluctuate from period to period. Zoran believes that significant investments in research and development are
required for it to remain competitive and it expects to continue to devote significant resources to product development, although such expenses as a percentage of total revenues may fluctuate. 

        Zoran's
selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, royalties, sales commissions, product promotion and other professional services.
Zoran expects that selling, general and administrative expenses will continue to increase to support its anticipated growth. 

        Zoran
conducts most of its research and development and certain sales and marketing and administrative operations in Israel through Zoran's wholly-owned Israeli subsidiary. As a result,
some of Zoran's expenses are incurred in New Israeli Shekels. To date, substantially all of Zoran's product sales and Zoran's development and licensing revenue have been denominated in U.S. dollars
and most costs of product sales have been incurred in U.S. dollars. Zoran expects that most of its sales and costs of sales will continue to be denominated and incurred in U.S. dollars for the
foreseeable future. Zoran
has not experienced material losses or gains as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations and have not engaged in hedging transactions to reduce its exposure to such fluctuations. Zoran may in
the future elect to take action to reduce its foreign exchange risk. 

        Zoran's
effective income tax rate has benefited from the availability of net operating losses which Zoran has utilized to reduce taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes and
by Zoran's Israeli subsidiary's status as an "Approved Enterprise" under Israeli law, which provides a ten-year tax holiday for income attributable to a portion of Zoran's operations in
Israel. Zoran's U.S. federal net operating losses expire at various times between 2003 and 2020, and the benefits from Zoran's subsidiary's Approved Enterprise status expire at various times beginning
in 2003. 

        On
April 21, 2002, Zoran's Board of Directors approved a three-for-two split of Zoran's common stock which was effected in the form of a fifty percent
stock dividend, paid on May 22, 2002 to stockholders of record on May 7, 2002. All share and per share information for all periods presented in this report are on a
post-split basis. 

Recent Developments  

        On May 4, 2003, Zoran entered into a merger agreement with Oak Technology, Inc., pursuant to which Oak will merge with a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Zoran, and each outstanding share of Oak's common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.2323 of a share of Zoran common stock and $1.78 in cash. The transaction is expected
to be completed in the third quarter of 2003, and is subject to approval by the stockholders of both companies, expiration of the waiting period under United States antitrust laws and other customary
closing conditions. If the merger is consummated, it will be accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, the results of operations of Oak (beginning with the closing date of the acquisition) and the
estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be included in Zoran's consolidated financial statements beginning with the quarter in which the closing takes place. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

        Zoran's discussion and analysis of Zoran's financial condition and results of operations are based upon Zoran's consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires Zoran to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. 

On
an on-going basis, Zoran evaluates its estimates, including bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets and income taxes. Zoran bases these estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

        Zoran
believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements: 


Zoran
recognizes development revenue using the percentage-of-completion method. Under the percentage-of-completion method,
revenue recognized is that portion of the total contract price equal to the ratio of costs expended to date to the anticipated final total costs, based on current estimates of the costs to complete
the project. These estimates are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the contracts. Any revisions are recorded in the accounting period in which the revisions are made.


Inventories
are recorded at the lower of standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in-first-out basis, or market value.
Zoran writes down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand and market conditions. Actual demand and market conditions may be different from those projected by Zoran's management.
This could have a material effect on Zoran's operating results and financial position.


Zoran
maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of its customers to make required payments. If the financial
condition of its customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.


Zoran
holds minority interests in private companies having operations or technology in areas within its strategic focus. As of December 31, 2002, these investments
totaled $1.2 million. Zoran records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value. Zoran assesses the value of this investment principally by
using information acquired from the investee, including historical and projected financial performance and recent funding events. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results
of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment's current carrying value thereby possibly
requiring an impairment charge in the future. In 2002, Zoran recorded non-cash investment impairment charges of $2.4 million in conjunction with investments in private companies.


Zoran
assesses the impairment of long-lived assets, identifiable intangibles and related goodwill annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets. Factors, which could trigger an impairment review, include significant negative
industry or economic trends, exiting an activity in conjunction with a restructuring of operations, current, historical or projected losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with an asset
or a significant decline in Zoran's market capitalization for an extended period of time, relative to net book value. Impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and
future cash flows. These estimates include assumptions about future conditions such as future revenues, gross margins, operating expenses, the fair values of certain assets based on appraisals, and
industry trends. Actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by Zoran's management. This could have a material effect on Zoran's operating results and financial
position.


Zoran
follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequence
of temporary 

differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. In the event actual results differ from these expectations, then the resulting impact to
income would be assessed in the period such determination was made. 

Results of OperationsQuarter Ended March 31, 2003 Compared to Quarter Ended March 31, 2002  

        Revenues.
    Total revenues increased by 21.7% to $37.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 from
$31.1 million for the same period in 2002. Product sales increased by 27.5% to $37.1 million from $29.1 million for first quarter of 2002. The increase in product sales was
primarily driven by increased sales in Zoran's digital camera and DVD product lines of $5.0 million and $2.5 million, respectively. The increased sales for both product lines were due to
increased unit shipments. DVD products continued to account for the majority of Zoran's total product sales, representing approximately 78% of the total for the quarter. Zoran expects DVD sales to
continue to comprise the majority of its product sales for the balance of 2003. Software, licensing and development revenues decreased by 62.9% to $736,000 for the first quarter of 2003, compared to
$2.0 million for the first quarter of 2002. The decrease reflected the fact that Zoran did not enter into any new licensing agreements during the quarter ended March 31, 2003. This
decline is not necessarily indicative of a developing trend as revenue from licensing activities tends to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. 

        Product Gross Margin.
    Product gross margin decreased to 28.0% for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 from 35.3% for the
same period in 2002. The decrease was due to continued erosion of the average selling prices for Zoran's older multi-chip DVD solutions. Zoran anticipates that its product gross margin
will improve over the balance of 2003 as it has substantially depleted the inventory of these older products and transitioned most of its customer base to its newer DVD products that do not require
its DVD CPU companion chips which, historically, were sold at low margins. 

        Research and Development.
    Research and development ("R&D") expenses decreased by 18.9% to $4.5 million for the quarter
ended March 31, 2003 from $5.5 million for the same period in 2002. The reduction was due to development grants of $1.5 million related to R&D expenditures in previous periods
that were received and recorded as offsets to R&D expense during the quarter ended March 31, 2003. R&D expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenues from 17.8% for the first quarter of
2002 to 11.8% for the first quarter of 2003 with approximately half of the percentage decrease due to increased revenues and the other half resulting from the grant offset. Zoran expects that R&D
expense will increase over the balance of 2003. 

        Selling, General and Administrative.
    Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses increased by 20.9% to
$6.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 from $5.7 million for the same period in 2002. The increase was due to increased sales and marketing expenses to support planned
revenue growth in the Asia Pacific markets. SG&A expenses were 18.3% of total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2003, compared to 18.5% for the same period in 2002. Zoran
anticipates that SG&A expenses will continue to increase for the remainder of 2003 as it continues to expand its presence in the Asia Pacific region. 

        Amortization of Intangibles Assets.
    During the quarter ended March 31, 2003, Zoran incurred charges of $953,000
related to the amortization of intangible assets compared to $2.4 million for the same period in 2002. The reduction was due to the full amortization of the completed technology acquired as
part of the Nogatech Inc. acquisition by the end of 2002. 

        Interest Income.
    Interest income decreased by $464,000 to $1.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2003
compared with $2.1 million for the same period in 2002. The reduction was due to a decline in market interest rates. 

        Other Income (Loss), Net.
    Other loss decreased by 96.3% to 22,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 compared with
$598,000 for the same period in 2002. The reduction was primarily the result of a non-cash loss of $696,000 realized in the first quarter of 2002, upon the exchange of shares of MGI
Software Inc. ("MGI") common stock held by Zoran for shares of Roxio Inc. ("Roxio") common stock in conjunction with Roxio's acquisition of MGI. 

        Provision for Income Taxes.
    Excluding charges related to the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles, Zoran's
estimated effective tax rate was 10% for the first quarter of 2003, consistent with the effective tax rate for first quarter of 2002. Zoran has booked a tax rate commensurate with the jurisdictional
distribution of profits between the U.S. and Israel and the underlying tax positions as a result of the approved enterprise status in Israel. Zoran anticipates utilizing the 10% tax rate for the
foreseeable future. 

Results of OperationsYear Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001  

        Revenues.
    Total revenues increased by 38.4% to $149.1 million in 2002 from $107.7 million in 2001. Product
sales increased by 41.3% to $141.3 million in 2002 from $100.0 million in 2001. The increase in product sales resulted primarily from a $38.9 million increase in sales of DVD
products and a $7.7 million increase in sales of filmless digital camera products. The increased product sales for both product lines were due to increased unit shipments. Offsetting these
increases somewhat was a $6.0 million decrease in sales of PC video products due to lower unit shipments. Software, licensing and development revenues increased slightly to $7.8 million
in 2002 from $7.7 million in 2001. 

        Product Gross Margin
    Product gross margin increased to 38.5% in 2002 compared to 35.3% in 2001. The increase was due to
margin improvements in Zoran's DVD product line resulting from a shift in product mix to a higher percentage of newer, more cost effective DVD products that are not required to be sold in combination
with DVD CPU companion chips which, historically, were sold at low margins. 

        Research and Development.
    Research and development ("R&D") expenses decreased by 4.9% to $22.1 million in 2002 from
$23.2 million in 2001. Gross R&D expenses decreased primarily as a result of the timing of major project expenses such as tape-outs. R&D expenses in 2002 and 2001 did not include
any reimbursements from the Chief Scientist. R&D expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenues to 14.8% in 2002, compared to 21.5% in 2001 due to the increase in revenue. Zoran anticipates
gross R&D expenses to increase in 2003, as it remains committed to enhancing its technology and development capabilities. 

        Selling, General and Administrative.
    Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses increased by 16.5% to
$24.9 million in 2002 from $21.3 million in 2001. The increase was primarily due to $2.1 million of increased marketing and application expenses to support planned revenue growth
in Zoran's Asia Pacific markets and $1.5 million of increased product marketing expenses related to Zoran's digital camera products. Zoran expects SG&A expenses to increase in 2003 as it
continues to augment its customer and application support in the Asia Pacific region. 

        Amortization of Intangible Assets.
    During 2002, Zoran recorded $7.6 million and $567,000 in charges related to the
amortization of intangible assets associated with its acquisitions of Nogatech and PixelCam, respectively. During 2001, Zoran recorded $8.6 million and $567,000 in such charges for Nogatech and
PixelCam, respectively. 

Amortization of Goodwill and Write-off of Acquired In-process Research and Development.
 Based on the adoption of
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statements Nos. 141 and 142, "Business Combinations" and "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 141" and "SFAS 142"), Zoran did not
record charges for the amortization of goodwill during 2002. For 2001, Zoran recorded $33.5 million in goodwill amortization associated with its acquisitions of PixelCam and Nogatech in 2000.
SFAS 142 changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an 

impairment-only
approach. Under SFAS 142, goodwill will be tested annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired. During 2002, Zoran
conducted its annual impairment assessment based on its structure as a single reporting unit and determined that no impairment exists. 

        The
in-process research and development project acquired from Nogatech relates to MPEG 4 technology to be used in video streaming applications. Zoran's marketing plan at the
time of the acquisition indicated that the market that it serves would demand products incorporating this technology beginning in the 2002 to 2003 timeframe. Zoran now believes that its target market
will not require this technology until 2004 due to market-related pricing considerations. The delay in the project will shift projected cash flows out by approximately one to two years. Zoran
estimates that this project will take approximately one year to complete and will cost approximately $1 million. Completion of this project remains a significant risk to Zoran due to the
remaining effort to achieve technical feasibility, rapidly changing customer markets and significant competitive threats from other companies. Failure to
bring related products to market in a timely manner could adversely impact Zoran's future sales and profitability. Additionally, the value of the intangible assets acquired may become impaired. 

        Interest Income.
    Interest income decreased by $2.8 million to $7.1 million in 2002 compared with
$9.9 million in 2001. The reduction was due to a decline in market interest rates. 

        Other Income (Loss).
    In 2002, Zoran incurred other losses of $6.6 million primarily associated with
non-cash impairment charges of $6.0 million and the conversion of equity securities in conjunction with the acquisition of an investee of $696,000. In 2001, Zoran recorded other
income of $151,000 primarily associated with foreign exchange gains net of losses. During 2002, Zoran recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $3.6 million associated with
marketable equity securities that were considered to be other than temporarily impaired. In determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired, Zoran considers, among other things,
the duration and extent to which the market value has declined relative to Zoran's cost basis, the economic factors influencing the markets, the relative performance of the investee and its
near-term prospects. There were no such impairment charges for marketable equity securities in 2001. Also in 2002, Zoran recorded a non-cash impairment charge of
$2.4 million associated with non-marketable securities. Zoran reviews its non-marketable investments for impairment when circumstances or events indicate that the
carrying value of the investments may not be recoverable. When the fair value of a non-marketable investment declines below its cost basis, Zoran considers all available evidence to
evaluate whether a decline in value has occurred. Among other things, Zoran considers the historical and projected financial performance and recent funding events which are ascertained from the
investee. There were no such impairment charges in 2001. The non-cash loss of $696,000 was associated with the acquisition by Roxio, Inc. of MGI Software Inc. As of the date
of the acquisition, Zoran held approximately 373,000 shares of MGI common stock. Upon consummation of the acquisition, Zoran's MGI common stock was exchanged for 18,843 shares of Roxio common stock.
In connection with the exchange, Zoran recorded a realized loss of $696,000 and established a new cost basis of its Roxio common stock equal to its fair value on the date of the exchange. 

        Provision for Income Taxes.
    Excluding charges related to the amortization of goodwill and the write-off of
acquired in-process research and development, Zoran's estimated effective tax rate decreased to 10% for 2002 compared with 15% in 2001. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

        As of March 31, 2003, Zoran had $27.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, $109.4 million of short-term investments and
$165.3 million of working capital. In addition, Zoran had $72.7 million of long-term investments in marketable securities. 

        Zoran's
operating activities used cash of $2.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2003, primarily due to Zoran's net income of $193,000 adjusted for the cash
impact associated with an increase of $11.9 million in accounts receivable. Partially offsetting the increase in accounts receivable was the cash impact of a $5.0 million decrease in
inventory and a $4.3 million increase in accounts payable. The decrease in inventory was primarily associated with a reduction in DVD inventory. The increase in accounts payable was due to
normal timing differences in Zoran's payment patterns. 

        Cash
used in investing activities was $340,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2003, principally reflecting the purchases of capital expenditures for property and
equipment. 

        Cash
used by financing activities was $1.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2003, and principally reflected installment payments on core technology. 

        As
of March 31, 2003 and 2002, Zoran did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured
finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Accordingly, Zoran is not
exposed to the type of financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. 

        Zoran
believes that its current balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and anticipated cash flow from operations, will satisfy its anticipated working
capital and capital expenditure requirements at least through the next 12 months. Nonetheless, Zoran's future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned and will depend on
many factors including, but not limited to the following: 


the
levels at which Zoran maintains inventory and accounts receivable;


the
market acceptance of Zoran's products;


the
levels of promotion and advertising required to launch Zoran's new products or to enter markets and attain a competitive position in the marketplace;


Zoran's
business, product, capital expenditure and research and development plans and technology roadmap;


volume
pricing concessions;


capital
improvements to new and existing facilities;


technological
advances;


the
response of competitors to Zoran's products; and


Zoran's
relationships with Zoran's suppliers and customers. 

        In
addition, Zoran may require an increase in the level of working capital to accommodate planned growth, hiring and infrastructure needs. Additional capital may also be required for
consummation of any acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies. 

        To
the extent that its existing resources and cash generated from operations are insufficient to fund its future activities, Zoran may need to raise additional funds through public or
private financings or borrowings. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities, these securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to holders of common
stock, and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on Zoran's operations. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to Zoran's
stockholders. Zoran cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to it, if at all. If it is unable to obtain this additional financing, Zoran may be
required to reduce the scope of its planned product development and sales and marketing efforts, which could harm its business, financial condition and operating results.
