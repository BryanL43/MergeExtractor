                                 [SYNCOR LOGO]

                                                                   July   , 2002
Dear Stockholder:

     We cordially invite you to attend a special meeting of stockholders of
Syncor International Corporation to be held on August [  ], 2002, at 1:00 p.m.,
California time, at the Warner Center Hilton Hotel, 6360 Canoga Avenue in
Woodland Hills, California.

     At the special meeting, you will have a chance to vote on the merger of
Syncor with a wholly owned subsidiary of Cardinal Health, Inc., a leading
provider of products and services supporting the health care industry. The
Syncor board of directors and management believe that the combination of
Syncor's operations with Cardinal Health's operations will create a stronger,
more competitive company with a continued commitment to growth.

     The Syncor board of directors has determined that the merger agreement and
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger
transaction with Cardinal Health, are advisable and fair to and in the best
interests of the Syncor stockholders and has approved the merger agreement and
the merger. THE SYNCOR BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE
"FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AT THE SPECIAL MEETING.

     If the merger is completed, Syncor will become a wholly owned subsidiary of
Cardinal Health, and each of your shares of Syncor common stock will be
converted into the right to receive 0.52 of a Cardinal Health common share.
Based on the number of shares of Syncor common stock outstanding as of the
record date for the special meeting, we estimate that, upon completion of the
merger, Cardinal Health will issue approximately [     ] Cardinal Health common
shares. Cardinal Health common shares are traded under the symbol "CAH" on the
New York Stock Exchange, Inc. and shares of Syncor common stock are traded under
the symbol "SCOR" on The Nasdaq National Market. On July 16, 2002, the closing
price of Cardinal Health common shares on the New York Stock Exchange composite
tape was $52.59 and the closing price of Syncor common stock as reported on The
Nasdaq National Market was $26.87, but you should obtain current prices for
Syncor common stock and the Cardinal Health common shares.

     The accompanying notice of meeting and proxy statement/prospectus explain
the proposed merger in greater detail and provide specific information
concerning the special meeting to be held in connection with the approval of the
merger agreement. Please read these materials carefully. YOU SHOULD ALSO
CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISK FACTORS RELATING TO THE PROPOSED MERGER DESCRIBED
BEGINNING ON PAGE 21.

     Your vote is very important. To be certain that your shares of Syncor
common stock are voted at the special meeting, please sign, date and return the
enclosed proxy card as soon as possible, whether or not you plan to attend the
special meeting in person. You also can vote your shares of Syncor common stock
through the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions on the
accompanying proxy card.

Cordially,

MONTY FU                                  ROBERT G. FUNARI
Chairman of the Board                     President and Chief Executive Officer

mailed to stockholders on or about July [  ], 2002.

                           FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This proxy statement/prospectus (including information included or incorporated
by reference) contains a number of forward-looking statements with respect to
the financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future
performance and businesses of each of Cardinal Health and Syncor, as well as
certain information relating to the proposed merger, including, among others:

     (1)  statements relating to the synergies and cost savings and
          accretion/dilution to reported earnings estimated to result from the
          proposed merger;

     (2)  statements relating to revenues estimated to result from the proposed
          merger;

     (3)  statements relating to integration costs estimated to be incurred in
          connection with the proposed merger; and

     (4)  statements preceded by, followed by or that include the terms
          "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates" or similar words or
          expressions.

These forward-looking statements involve various risks and uncertainties. Actual
results may differ materially from those contemplated, projected or implied by
these forward-looking statements due to, among others, the following factors and
events (the order of which does not necessarily reflect their relative
significance):

     - costs or difficulties related to the integration of the businesses of
       Cardinal Health and Syncor, or other acquired businesses, are greater
       than expected;

     - expected or anticipated synergies and cost savings from the proposed
       merger are not fully realized or are not realized within the expected
       time frame, or additional or unexpected costs are incurred;

     - dependence on key personnel to manage the integration of Cardinal Health
       and Syncor and the ongoing operation of Cardinal Health and Syncor after
       the proposed merger;

     - the loss of key customers or suppliers;

     - technological changes are more difficult and/or more expensive than
       anticipated;

     - revenues following the proposed merger are lower than expected;

     - increased competitive pressures in the industries or markets in which
       Cardinal Health and Syncor operate;

     - changes in general economic conditions or in political or competitive
       forces;

     - changes in the securities markets;

     - changes in the regulatory environment;

     - difficulties and/or delays in disposing of certain operations of Syncor
       that are contemplated to be sold to third parties;

     - difficulties and delays in obtaining regulatory approval of the proposed
       merger or other future transactions under relevant laws and regulations
       (including, among others, antitrust and competition laws), including
       those of nations other than the United States;

     - the risk that our analyses of these risks and forces could be incorrect
       and/or that the strategies developed to address them could be
       unsuccessful; and

     - the general risks that occur in the day-to-day businesses of Syncor and
       Cardinal Health, including those discussed in Syncor's and Cardinal
       Health's Annual Reports on Form 10-K (including any amendments),
       Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q (including any amendments), and exhibits
       to those reports.

                                        ii

uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed,

                             ---------------------

                   NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

                               AUGUST [   ], 2002

To the Stockholders of Syncor:

     A special meeting of stockholders of Syncor International Corporation will
be held on August [  ], 2002, at 1:00 p.m., California time, at the Warner
Center Hilton Hotel, 6360 Canoga Avenue in Woodland Hills, California. The
purposes of the special meeting are to:

          1.  Vote on a proposal to approve the Agreement and Plan of Merger,
     dated as of June 14, 2002, among Cardinal Health, Inc., Mudhen Merger
     Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Cardinal Health, and Syncor, pursuant
     to which, among other things, Mudhen Merger Corp. will merge with and into
     Syncor upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger
     agreement, as more fully described in the proxy statement/prospectus that
     accompanies this notice. If the merger agreement is approved and the merger
     and the related transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are
     consummated, each share of Syncor common stock will be converted into the
     right to receive 0.52 of a Cardinal Health common share.

          2.  Adjourn the special meeting, if necessary, to permit further
     solicitation of proxies in the event there are not sufficient votes at the
     time of the special meeting to approve the merger agreement proposal.

          3.  Act on any other matters that may properly come before the special
     meeting.

     Your board of directors has fixed the close of business on July [  ], 2002,
as the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to
vote at the special meeting. The merger agreement proposal requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Syncor common stock entitled to vote on the merger agreement proposal.
Stockholders owning approximately [     ]% of the outstanding shares of Syncor
common stock as of the record date already have agreed in writing to vote in
favor of the approval of the merger agreement proposal.

     You are cordially invited to attend the special meeting. Whether or not you
plan on attending the special meeting, please vote by signing, dating and
returning the enclosed proxy card or submitting a proxy through the Internet or
by telephone. Completing a proxy now will not prevent you from being able to
vote at the special meeting by attending in person and casting a vote. However,
if you do not return the proxy or vote in person at the special meeting, the
effect will be the same as a vote against the merger agreement proposal.

                                          By Order of the Board of Directors

                                          EDWIN A. BURGOS

             QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CARDINAL HEALTH/SYNCOR
                               MERGER TRANSACTION

     We intend the following questions and answers to provide brief answers to
frequently asked questions concerning the proposed merger. These questions and
answers do not, and are not intended to, address all the questions that may be
important to Syncor stockholders. You should read the summary and the remainder
of this document and all of the annexes carefully.

Q:     WHY ARE CARDINAL HEALTH AND SYNCOR MERGING?

A:     Syncor has an attractive position in the nuclear pharmacy business. In
addition:

- -  Syncor provides distribution for complex pharmaceutical products. We expect
   the demand for these types of distribution abilities to grow over the next
   few years. These distribution abilities include, but are not limited to,
   specialized handling, rapid response to critical care and low error rates.
   This will add to the significant capabilities Cardinal Health has in this
   area.

- -  Syncor also has superior time-critical logistics capabilities and
   strategically located facilities.

- -  Syncor adds to Cardinal Health's strategy of increasing the breadth of
   products and services offered to its customers.

After the completion of the merger, Syncor should be able to benefit from
Cardinal Health's extensive relationships with manufacturers and group
purchasing organizations, which we refer to as GPOs. Cardinal Health's business
segments offer increased visibility into the pharmaceutical industry at the
product development stage. This connectivity into the pharmaceutical industry
will increase Syncor's access and visibility to product introductions that could
permit Syncor to leverage Cardinal Health's pharmacy network. See "The
Merger -- Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Syncor Board of
Directors" and "Forward-Looking Statements."

Q:     WHAT HAPPENS TO MY SHARES OF SYNCOR COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER?

A:     You will receive 0.52 of a Cardinal Health common share for each share of
Syncor common stock you own. You also will receive cash in lieu of any
fractional Cardinal Health common shares.

For example, a holder of 110 shares of Syncor common stock will receive 57
Cardinal Health common shares, plus a cash payment with respect to 0.20 of a
Cardinal Health common share.
The Cardinal Health common shares you receive in the merger will be listed on
the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the exchange on which Cardinal Health common
shares currently trade.

Q:     WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER?

A:     We cannot complete the merger, unless, among other things, Syncor
stockholders vote to approve the merger agreement. Syncor is holding a special
meeting at which you are entitled to vote on the merger agreement. You may
choose one of the following ways to cast your vote:

- -  by completing the accompanying proxy card and returning it in the enclosed
   postage-paid envelope;

- -  through the Internet or by telephone, as outlined on the accompanying proxy
   card; or

- -  by appearing and voting in person at the special meeting.

If the merger agreement is approved by Syncor stockholders and the other
conditions to the proposed merger are satisfied, you will receive additional
information with respect to your shares of Syncor common stock.

Q:     ARE THERE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MERGER THAT I SHOULD CONSIDER IN
DECIDING HOW TO VOTE?

A:     Yes. There are risks associated with all business combinations, including
the proposed merger. In particular, you should be aware that the number of
Cardinal Health common shares you will receive in return for each share of
Syncor common stock you own is fixed and will not change as the market prices of
shares of Syncor common stock and Cardinal Health common shares fluctuate.
Accordingly, the value of Cardinal Health common shares that you will receive in
return for your shares of Syncor common stock may be either less than or more
than the current market price of the corresponding number of Cardinal Health
common shares. The proposed merger also could be delayed, depending upon how
long it takes to satisfy all of the conditions to

the merger. In addition, there are risks that we will not realize the synergies
and cost savings we expect to obtain from the proposed merger to the extent
that, or as promptly as, we currently anticipate. There also are a number of
other risks that are discussed and incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement/prospectus. YOU SHOULD REVIEW THE SECTION OF THIS PROXY STATEMENT/
PROSPECTUS ENTITLED "RISK FACTORS" WITH PARTICULAR CARE.

Q:     WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO COMPLETE THE PROPOSED MERGER?

A:     We expect to complete the proposed merger as quickly as possible once all
the conditions to the merger, including obtaining the approval of Syncor
stockholders at the special meeting and the expiration of the waiting period
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, are
fulfilled. Fulfilling some of these conditions is not entirely within our
control. We currently expect to complete the proposed merger late this year.

Q:     HOW DO I VOTE MY SHARES OF SYNCOR COMMON STOCK IF MY SHARES OF SYNCOR
COMMON STOCK ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME"?

A:     You should contact your broker. Your broker can give you directions on
how to vote your shares of Syncor common stock. Your broker cannot vote your
shares of Syncor common stock unless he or she receives appropriate instructions
from you.

Q:     MAY I CHANGE MY VOTE EVEN AFTER SUBMITTING A PROXY?

A:     Yes. If you are the record owner of your shares of Syncor common stock
and you want to change your vote, you may do so at any time before the special
meeting by sending to the Secretary of Syncor a written notice saying that you
are revoking your proxy or by submitting a later-dated proxy by mail or
telephone or through the Internet with your new vote; alternatively, you can
attend the special meeting in person and vote your shares of Syncor common stock
yourself at the special meeting. If you own your shares of Syncor common stock
in street name, you should contact your broker regarding the procedures for
changing your vote.

Q:     WILL SYNCOR STOCKHOLDERS HAVE TO PAY ADDITIONAL TAX BECAUSE OF THE
MERGER?

A:     We expect that Syncor stockholders generally will not recognize gain or
loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of exchanging their shares
of Syncor common stock for Cardinal Health common shares, other than to the
extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares. The holding period of
Cardinal Health common shares received by Syncor stockholders in the merger
generally will include the holding period of the shares of Syncor common stock
exchanged in the merger. See "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences."

Nevertheless, the tax consequences to you of the merger will depend on your
individual circumstances and may differ from those explained here. You should
consult with your own tax advisor to ascertain the tax consequences that the
merger will have for you.

Q:     AM I ENTITLED TO EXERCISE ANY DISSENTERS' OR APPRAISAL RIGHTS IN
CONNECTION WITH THE PROPOSED MERGER?

A:     Under Delaware law, Syncor stockholders are not entitled to dissenters'
or appraisal rights in connection with the proposed merger.

Q:     HOW DO THE RIGHTS OF CARDINAL HEALTH SHAREHOLDERS COMPARE TO THOSE OF
SYNCOR STOCKHOLDERS?

A:     The rights of Cardinal Health shareholders are governed by Ohio law and
by Cardinal Health's articles of incorporation and code of regulations, while
the rights of Syncor stockholders are governed by Delaware law and Syncor's
certificate of incorporation and by-laws. For a summary of significant
differences between the rights of Cardinal Health shareholders and Syncor
stockholders, see "Comparison of Shareholder/ Stockholder Rights."

Q:     SHOULD I SEND IN MY SYNCOR STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW?

A:     No. After the merger is completed, we will send you written instructions,
including a letter of transmittal, that explain how to exchange your Syncor
stock certificates for stock certificates representing Cardinal Health common
shares. Please do not send in any Syncor stock certificates until you receive
these written instructions and the letter of transmittal.

Q:     WILL DIVIDENDS BE PAID ON CARDINAL HEALTH COMMON SHARES AFTER THE MERGER?

A:     Cardinal Health currently expects that, after the merger is completed,
Cardinal Health will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends. Cardinal Health's
current quarterly dividend is $0.025 per Cardinal Health common share. The
Cardinal Health board of directors, however, has discretion to decide upon the
timing and amount of any future dividends. Whether or not Cardinal Health will
pay dividends (and, if so, how much the dividends will be) will depend on
Cardinal Health's future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and
other factors. See "Comparative Market Price and Dividend Data" and "Comparison
of Shareholder/Stockholder Rights -- Dividends."

Q:     IF I HAVE MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROPOSED MERGER, WHERE CAN I FIND
ANSWERS?

A:     In addition to reading this proxy statement/prospectus, its annexes and
the documents we have incorporated in this proxy statement/ prospectus by
reference, you can find more information about the proposed merger in Cardinal
Health's and Syncor's public filings with the SEC, the New York Stock Exchange
and The Nasdaq National Market. See "Where You Can Find More Information." If
you require assistance in changing or revoking a proxy or if you have any other

THE COMPANIES (PAGE 62)

SYNCOR INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION
6464 Canoga Avenue
Woodland Hills, California 91367-2407
(818) 737-4000

     Syncor is a leading provider of high-technology health care services
concentrating on nuclear pharmacy services, medical imaging, niche manufacturing
and radiotherapy. In the nuclear pharmacy services business, Syncor compounds
and dispenses radiopharmaceuticals for diagnostic and therapeutic use by nuclear
medicine departments in hospitals and outpatient clinics. Syncor distributes
these time-critical pharmaceuticals to more than 7,000 U.S.-based customers
through an integrated network of 130 domestic and 19 international nuclear
pharmacies. Syncor also owns and operates 70 domestic and 19 international
medical imaging facilities. Domestic medical imaging operations are conducted by
Syncor's wholly owned subsidiary, Comprehensive Medical Imaging, Inc., which we
refer to as CMI. Syncor announced, on June 14, 2002, that it is exiting the
imaging business and is entertaining offers for CMI, which is the third largest
provider of fixed-site outpatient imaging services in the United States. This
transaction may occur before or after completion of the proposed merger.
However, no assurances can be given that any transaction will occur or that the
transaction will occur under terms acceptable to Syncor or Cardinal Health. As
previously disclosed, in the quarter ending June 30, 2002, Syncor will record an
after-tax charge in the range of $22 to $24 million related to its decision to
divest CMI, the reorganization of its international operations announced earlier
in 2002, and other related operating charges. This charge, which is unrelated to
the proposed merger with Cardinal Health, relates to facility closings, employee
termination costs and the write-down of assets, including additional provisions
for allowance for uncollectible accounts and contractual allowances, as well as
corporate charges related to the reorganization of Syncor's information
technology division and the departure of former Syncor executives. Syncor also
owns or operates nine domestic and two international production facilities for
positron emission tomography radiopharmaceuticals, which we refer to as PET, and
is a party to a series of agreements to make PET technology more accessible to
health care providers and patients nationwide. Syncor is headquartered in
Woodland Hills, California, employs approximately 4,760 people and has annual
revenues from continuing operations of approximately $600 million.

CARDINAL HEALTH, INC.
7000 Cardinal Place
Dublin, Ohio 43017
(614) 757-5000

     Cardinal Health is a leading provider of products and services supporting
the health care industry. Cardinal Health offers a broad spectrum of products
and services to both upstream customers, including pharmaceutical, biotech,
medical/ surgical and lab manufacturers, and downstream customers, including
pharmacies and hospitals, physician offices and other sites of care, through
four primary business units:

- - pharmaceutical distribution and provider services;

- - automation and information services;

- - medical-surgical products and services; and

- - pharmaceutical technologies and services.

Headquartered in Dublin, Ohio, Cardinal Health employs more than 49,000 people
on five continents, with annual revenues exceeding $40 billion.

MUDHEN MERGER CORP.
7000 Cardinal Place
Dublin, Ohio 43017
(614) 757-5000

     Mudhen Merger Corp. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cardinal Health formed
for the purpose of effecting the proposed merger.

THE SPECIAL MEETING (PAGE 23)

     The special meeting will be held on August [  ], 2002 at 1:00 p.m.,
California time, at the Warner Center Hilton Hotel, 6360 Canoga Avenue in
Woodland Hills, California. At the special meeting, you will be asked to approve
the merger agreement and, thus, the merger.

RECORD DATE; VOTE REQUIRED (PAGES 23 AND 24)

     You can vote at the special meeting if you owned shares of Syncor common
stock at the close of business on the record date of July [  ], 2002. On the
record date, there were approximately [  ] shares of Syncor common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote. You can cast one vote for each share of Syncor
common stock you then owned. In order to approve the merger agreement, the
holders of a majority of all outstanding shares of Syncor common stock entitled
to vote with respect to the merger agreement must vote in favor of the merger
agreement.

     Two of Syncor's directors, who, together, beneficially own approximately
[  ] % of the outstanding shares of Syncor common stock as of the record date
have already agreed to vote in favor of the merger agreement. See "-- Support/
Voting Agreements." As of the record date, Syncor directors and executive
officers and their affiliates held, in the aggregate, shares of Syncor common
stock representing approximately [  ] % of all outstanding shares of Syncor
common stock eligible to vote at the special meeting. Each of these Syncor
directors and officers is expected to vote the outstanding shares of Syncor
common stock beneficially owned by him or her in favor of the merger agreement.
As of the record date, Cardinal Health's directors and executive officers and
their affiliates did not hold any shares of Syncor common stock.

OUR REASONS FOR THE MERGER (PAGE 29)

     The board of directors of Syncor considered a number of factors prior to
voting to recommend approval of the merger agreement to Syncor stockholders. A
discussion of the factors considered by the Syncor board of directors is
included under "The Merger -- Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the
Syncor Board of Directors -- Considerations and Recommendation of the Syncor
Board of Directors." A discussion of the factors considered by the Cardinal
Health board of directors is included under "The Merger -- Reasons for the
Merger; Recommendation of the Syncor Board of Directors -- Considerations of the
Cardinal Health Board of Directors."

THE MERGER (PAGE 26)

     The merger agreement is included as Annex A to this proxy
statement/prospectus. Please read the merger agreement as it is the legal
document that governs the proposed merger.

 GENERAL

     We are proposing that Syncor merge with Mudhen Merger Corp., a wholly owned
subsidiary of Cardinal Health, with the result that, after the merger, Syncor
will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Cardinal Health. After the merger,
Syncor stockholders will be Cardinal Health shareholders together with the
existing Cardinal Health shareholders.

  MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OF SHARES (PAGE 43)

     When we complete the proposed merger, your shares of Syncor common stock
will be exchanged for Cardinal Health common shares. Each share of Syncor common
stock automatically will be converted into the right to receive 0.52 of a
Cardinal Health common share. The total number of Cardinal Health common shares
you will receive will, therefore, be equal to the number of shares of Syncor
common stock you own multiplied by 0.52 with cash being paid in place of any
fractional shares.

     For example, a holder of 110 shares of Syncor common stock will receive 57
Cardinal Health common shares, plus a cash payment with respect to 0.20 of a
Cardinal Health common share.

     Because the number of Cardinal Health common shares that you will receive
in the merger is determined by the fixed exchange ratio of 0.52, the value of
the Cardinal Health common shares you will receive in the merger will fluctuate
as the price of Cardinal Health common shares changes.

  SYNCOR STOCK OPTIONS (PAGE 43)

     Other than the options granted by Syncor between June 14, 2002 and
completion of the merger, all outstanding options to acquire shares of Syncor
common stock granted under Syncor's equity plans will vest upon Syncor
stockholder approval of the merger agreement. Upon completion of the merger, all
outstanding vested options to acquire shares of Syncor common stock granted
under Syncor's equity incentive plans will be converted into a fully-vested
option to purchase Cardinal Health common shares and each outstanding unvested
option to acquire shares of Syncor common stock granted under Syncor's equity
incentive plans will be converted into an option to purchase Cardinal Health
common shares, which Cardinal Health option shall vest pursuant to the terms of
the Syncor option as in effect at the time of the merger. The number of Cardinal
Health common shares subject to the converted option will equal the number of
shares of Syncor common stock subject to the Syncor option immediately prior to
completion of the merger multiplied by the exchange ratio. The exercise price
per share of the option will equal the per share exercise price of the Syncor
option immediately prior to the effective time of the merger divided by 0.52,
the exchange ratio. The conversion of Syncor options will be subject to
customary rounding adjustments. After the merger, the converted options will
continue to be governed by the terms of Syncor's stock option plans as in effect
at the time of the merger.

  MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS AFTER THE MERGER

     After the merger, the Cardinal Health board of directors will continue to
manage the business of Cardinal Health, which then will include the business of
Syncor as a wholly owned subsidiary. In addition, much of Syncor's current
management is expected to remain in place. Over time, following completion of
the merger, Syncor's operations will be combined with Cardinal Health's
operations. After completion of the merger, Syncor will be part of the
Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services division of Cardinal Health.

  SYNCOR BOARD OF DIRECTORS' RECOMMENDATION TO STOCKHOLDERS (PAGE 29)

     The Syncor board of directors believes that the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, are
advisable and fair to you and in your best interests, and it unanimously
recommends that you vote "FOR" approval of the merger agreement.

  OPINION OF SYNCOR'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR (PAGE 34)

     In connection with the merger, the Syncor board of directors received a
written opinion from Salomon Smith Barney Inc., Syncor's financial advisor, as
to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio provided
for in the merger. The full text of Salomon Smith Barney's written opinion dated
June 14, 2002 is included as Annex B to this proxy statement/prospectus. We
encourage you to read this opinion carefully in its entirety for a description
of the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations
on the review undertaken. SALOMON SMITH BARNEY'S OPINION IS ADDRESSED TO THE
SYNCOR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION TO ANY
STOCKHOLDER WITH RESPECT TO ANY MATTERS RELATING TO THE PROPOSED MERGER.

  CONDITIONS TO COMPLETION OF THE MERGER (PAGE 53)

     The completion of the merger depends on a number of conditions being met.
In addition to customary conditions relating to our compliance with the merger
agreement and representations and warranties we make under the merger agreement,
these conditions include the following:

  - approval of the merger agreement by the holders of a majority of the
    outstanding shares of Syncor common stock;

  - receipt of all antitrust and other requisite governmental approvals;

  - approval of Cardinal Health common shares to be issued in the merger for
    listing on the New York Stock Exchange;

  - receipt of an opinion from Syncor's legal counsel to the effect that, for
    U.S. federal income tax purposes, the merger will constitute a
    "reorganization" (within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
    Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code) and the
    exchange of shares of Syncor common stock for Cardinal Health common shares
    generally will not cause Syncor stockholders to recognize any gain or loss
    other than in connection with any cash received in lieu of fractional
    Cardinal Health common shares;

  - absence of any provision of any applicable law or any judgment, injunction,
    order or decree of a governmental authority prohibiting or enjoining the
    completion of the merger or the transactions contemplated by the merger
    agreement or limiting the ownership or operation by Cardinal Health, Syncor
    or any of their respective subsidiaries of any material portion of the
    businesses or assets of Cardinal Health or Syncor;

  - absence of any pending action by any governmental authority (1) challenging
    or seeking to restrain or prohibit the completion of the merger or any of
    the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (2) seeking to
    prohibit or limit in any material respect the ownership or operation by
    Cardinal Health, Syncor or any of their respective subsidiaries to dispose
    of, or to compel Cardinal Health, Syncor or any of their respective
    subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate, any material portion of the
    businesses or assets of Cardinal Health, Syncor or any of their respective
    subsidiaries, as a result of the merger or any of the other transactions
    contemplated by the merger agreement, or (3) seeking to impose limitations
    on the ability of Cardinal Health to acquire or hold, or exercise full
    rights of ownership of, any shares of the capital stock of Syncor as the
    surviving corporation, including the right to vote capital stock of the
    surviving corporation on all matters properly presented to the stockholders
    of the surviving corporation; and

  - absence of any event that has had or is likely to have a material adverse
    effect (as defined in the merger agreement) on Cardinal Health or Syncor.

Syncor and Cardinal Health may each waive any condition intended for its benefit
other than the need to obtain stockholder approval and any other condition
required as a matter of law.

  TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT (PAGE 56)

     We can agree at any time to terminate the merger agreement without
completing the merger, even if Syncor stockholders have approved the merger
agreement. Also, the merger agreement can be terminated without the consent of
the other party in various circumstances, including the following:

  - by either Cardinal Health or Syncor if there is any law or regulation that
    makes completion of the merger illegal or otherwise prohibited, or if any
    judgment, injunction, order or decree of a court or other competent
    governmental authority enjoining Cardinal Health or Syncor from completing
    the merger has been entered and that judgment, injunction, order or decree
    has become final and nonappealable;

  - by either Cardinal Health or Syncor if the merger has not been completed
    before December 31, 2002, provided, however, that, in the event that we have
    not received all requisite antitrust and governmental approvals on or prior
    to December 31, 2002, this date will be extended to the earlier of the date
    that is ten business days after such approvals are received or April 30,
    2003;

  - by either Cardinal Health or Syncor if the other party breaches the merger
    agreement in a way that would entitle the party seeking to terminate the
    agreement to not complete the merger, and the breaching party does not
    correct the breach prior to the earlier of (1) 20 business days after the
    giving of notice of the breach by the non-breaching party and (2) December
    31, 2002 (as long as the party seeking to terminate has not itself
    materially breached the merger agreement);

  - by Cardinal Health or Syncor if, at the special meeting (including any
    adjournment or postponement of the special meeting), the requisite vote of
    Syncor stockholders to ap-

prove the merger agreement will not have been obtained; and

  - by Cardinal Health (1) if the Syncor board of directors withdraws, modifies
    or changes its recommendation in favor of the merger in a manner adverse to
    Cardinal Health, or (2) if the Syncor board of directors will have refused
    to affirm its recommendation within 20 business days of any written request
    from Cardinal Health.

  TERMINATION FEES (PAGE 57)

     If the merger agreement is terminated pursuant to the termination right
described in one of the last two bullet points under "-- Termination of the
Merger Agreement" above, then Syncor will, within three business days following
any such termination by Cardinal Health, or, in the case of a termination by
Syncor, concurrently with the termination, pay to Cardinal Health up to
$4,000,000 in reimbursement for Cardinal Health's actual and documented
reasonable merger-related costs.

     If the merger agreement is terminated pursuant to

     (1) the termination right described in one of the last two bullet points
     under "-- Termination of the Merger Agreement" above and at any time prior
     to that termination a bona fide proposal regarding a competing transaction
     (as defined under "The Merger Agreement -- No Solicitation" on page 52)
     with respect to Syncor will not have been made to Syncor, nor will there
     have been any public disclosure of any bona fide proposal or expression of
     interest by a third party regarding a competing transaction, or

     (2) a mutually agreed-upon termination or pursuant to the termination right
     described in the second bullet point under "-- Termination of the Merger
     Agreement" above and at any time prior to that termination a bona fide
     proposal regarding a competing transaction with respect to Syncor will have
     been made to Syncor, or any bona fide proposal or expression of interest by
     a third party regarding a competing transaction will have been publicly
     disclosed

and, in the case of clause (1) or (2) above, within six months after the date of
that termination Syncor enters into a letter of intent, agreement-in-principle,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement with respect to, or publicly
announces, a business combination (as defined under "The Merger
Agreement -- Effect of Termination" on page 57) or completes a business
combination, then Syncor will, upon completion of the business combination, pay
to Cardinal Health $24,125,000 (less amounts paid in reimbursement of
merger-related costs).

If the merger agreement is terminated pursuant to the termination right
described in one of the last two bullet points under "-- Termination of the
Merger Agreement" above and at any time prior to such termination a bona fide
proposal regarding a competing transaction with respect to Syncor will have been
made to Syncor, or any bona fide proposal or expression of interest by a third
party regarding a competing transaction will have been publicly disclosed, then
Syncor will, in the case of a termination by Cardinal Health, within three
business days following the termination or, in the case of a termination by
Syncor, concurrently with the termination, pay to Cardinal Health $12,062,500
(less amounts paid in reimbursement of merger-related costs). Furthermore, if,
within 12 months after the date of the termination, Syncor enters into a letter
of intent, agreement-in-principle, acquisition agreement or other similar
agreement with respect to, or publicly announces, a business combination or
consummates a business combination, then Syncor will, upon the completion of the
business combination, pay to Cardinal Health an additional termination fee in an
amount equal to $12,062,500.

Except as stated above, we will each pay our own fees and expenses related to
the proposed merger.

  WAIVER AND AMENDMENT (PAGE 58)

     We may jointly amend the merger agreement, and each of us may waive our
right to require the other party to adhere to the terms and conditions of the
merger agreement, to the extent legally permissible. However, we may amend the
merger agreement after Syncor stockholders approve the merger agreement only if
the amendment does not require the further approval of Syncor stockholders under
applicable law or if Syncor stockholders approve the amendment.

SUPPORT/VOTING AGREEMENTS (PAGE 59)

     In connection with the merger, Cardinal Health has entered into
support/voting agreements with Monty Fu, Chairman of the Board of Syncor, and
Robert G. Funari, President, Chief Executive Officer and a director of Syncor.
As of the record date, these directors of Syncor beneficially owned
approximately [  ] million shares of Syncor common stock, representing
approximately [  ]% of the outstanding shares of Syncor common stock. Of this
amount, [  ]% were unexercised Syncor options. Pursuant to the support/voting
agreements, each of these directors has agreed to vote all of his shares of
Syncor common stock in favor of the merger agreement at the special meeting, but
the directors are not required to exercise their Syncor options.

INTERESTS OF SYNCOR'S DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE MERGER THAT ARE
DIFFERENT FROM YOUR INTERESTS (PAGE 39)

     Certain of Syncor's executive officers and directors may be deemed to have
interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the
interests of Syncor stockholders generally. These additional interests of Syncor
directors and executive officers are described under "The Merger -- Interests of
Syncor's Directors and Officers in the Merger."

     The Syncor board of directors was aware of these additional interests, and
considered them when it approved the merger agreement and recommended that
Syncor stockholders approve the merger agreement.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS (PAGE 41)

     Under Delaware law, Syncor stockholders are not entitled to any appraisal
or dissenters' rights in connection with the merger.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES (PAGE 60)

     We have structured the merger so that it is anticipated that the merger
will be a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The parties to
the merger agreement will not be obligated to complete the merger unless Syncor
receives a legal opinion to that effect. If the merger is a reorganization,
Syncor stockholders will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes in the merger (except for gain or loss recognized because of cash
received instead of fractional Cardinal Health common shares).

     THIS TAX TREATMENT MAY NOT APPLY TO ALL SYNCOR STOCKHOLDERS. DETERMINING
THE ACTUAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO YOU MAY BE COMPLICATED. THE TAX
CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO YOU WILL DEPEND ON YOUR SPECIFIC SITUATION AND ON
VARIABLES NOT WITHIN OUR CONTROL. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR FOR A
FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO YOU.

SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE RIGHTS OF SYNCOR STOCKHOLDERS AND CARDINAL HEALTH
SHAREHOLDERS (PAGE 68)

     The rights of Syncor stockholders currently are governed by the Delaware
General Corporation Law, which we refer to as the DGCL, and Syncor's articles of
incorporation and by-laws. The rights of Cardinal Health shareholders are
governed by the Ohio General Corporation Law, which we refer to as the OGCL, and
Cardinal Health's articles of incorporation and code of regulations. Upon our
completing the merger, Syncor stockholders will become Cardinal Health
shareholders and their rights will be governed by the OGCL and by Cardinal
Health's articles of incorporation and code of regulations. Neither Cardinal
Health's articles of incorporation nor its code of regulations will be affected
by the merger.

REGULATORY APPROVALS (PAGE 41)

     Under the HSR Act, and the applicable rules of the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission, which we refer to as the FTC, we may not complete the merger, unless
we make certain filings with the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of
Justice, which we refer to as the Antitrust Division, and the FTC and certain
waiting periods expire or are earlier terminated. Syncor and Cardinal Health
have submitted the required filings to the Antitrust Division and the FTC, and
the applicable waiting period for these filings is scheduled to expire at 11:59
p.m. on July 31, 2002.

     However, prior to that time, the Antitrust Division or the FTC may extend
the waiting period by requesting additional information or documentary material
relevant to the merger from

Cardinal Health or Syncor. If this request is made, the waiting period will be
extended until 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the 30th day after substantial
compliance by Cardinal Health and Syncor with the request. Thereafter, the
waiting period can be extended only by court order or by agreement of the
parties to the merger agreement.

     We also will make the appropriate antitrust filings with the relevant
authorities in Brazil.

     Cardinal Health will file an application for approval of Cardinal Health
common shares to be issued in connection with the proposed merger for listing on
the New York Stock Exchange.

     In connection with the proposed merger, Cardinal Health may be required to
give notifications to and/or receive consents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, state nuclear regulatory
agencies, state boards of pharmacy and other governmental agencies under
numerous licenses and permits held by Syncor and its subsidiaries. Although we
do not expect that obtaining any required consents from these agencies will
prevent us from completing the merger, we cannot be certain that we will obtain
all required regulatory clearances.

     Other than as we describe in this proxy statement/prospectus, the merger
does not require the approval or clearance of any U.S. federal or state or
foreign agency. We will, however, be required to make certain filings with U.S.
federal and state governmental authorities to complete the merger.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS (INSIDE COVER)

     We each have made forward-looking statements in this proxy
statement/prospectus (and in documents to which we refer you in this proxy

company after the merger and could cause those results or that performance to
differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. See
"Forward-Looking Statements" on the inside cover of this proxy
statement/prospectus.

(1) Net earnings per share of Syncor common stock have been adjusted to
    retroactively reflect all stock splits through March 31, 2002.

(2) In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which we refer to as
    the FASB, issued Statement of Accounting Standards, which we refer to as
    SFAS, No. 141 "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142 "Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141 requires that the purchase method of
    accounting be used for all business combinations completed after June 30,
    2001, clarifies the recognition of intangible assets separately from
    goodwill and requires that unallocated negative goodwill be written off
    immediately as an extraordinary gain. SFAS No. 142, which was effective for
    fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, requires that ratable
    amortization of goodwill be replaced with periodic tests of goodwill
    impairment and that intangible assets, other than goodwill, which have
    determinable useful lives, be amortized over their useful lives. Syncor has
    adopted these accounting standards effective January 1, 2002, and is still
    analyzing any possible impairment of goodwill. There were no adjustments to
    identifiable intangible assets' useful lives or recorded balances as a
    result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142.

    The following table displays Syncor's net earnings and per share amounts for
    fiscal years 1999, 2000 and 2001 as adjusted for amortization of intangible
    assets and goodwill.

(1) Total revenue from discontinued operations for 1997 includes $0.4 of
    revenues generated by Syncor's interest in a joint venture for the
    production of positron emission tomography isotopes which was excluded from
    reported total revenues for 1997 as it was characterized as a discontinued
    operation, net of taxes.

(2) Net earnings per share of Syncor common stock have been adjusted to
    retroactively reflect all stock dividends and stock splits through March 31,
    2002.

(3) In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which we refer to as

(1) Amounts reflect business combinations and the impact of merger-related costs
    and other special charges in all periods presented. See Note 2 of "Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements" incorporated by reference to Cardinal
    Health's 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 for a further
    discussion of merger-related costs and other special charges affecting
    fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999. Fiscal year 1998 amounts reflect the impact of
    merger-related charges and other special charges of $57.8 million ($19.5
    million, net of tax). Fiscal year 1997 amounts reflect the impact of
    merger-related charges of $50.9 million ($36.6 million, net of tax). See
    Note 5 of "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements"
    incorporated by reference to Cardinal Health's Form 10-Q for the nine months
    ended March 31, 2002 for further discussion of merger-related costs and
    other special charges affecting the nine months ended March 31, 2002 and
    2001.

(2) Amounts above do not reflect the impact of pro forma adjustments related to
    Automatic Liquid Packaging, Inc. ("ALP") taxes (see Notes 1 and 2 of "Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements" incorporated by reference to Cardinal
    Health's 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001). For the fiscal years
    ended June 30, 1999 and 1998, the pro forma adjustment for ALP taxes would
    have reduced net earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting
    principle by $9.3 million and $4.6 million, respectively. The pro forma
    adjustment would have decreased diluted earnings per Cardinal Health common
    share before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle by $0.02 to
    $1.10 for fiscal year 1999 and by $0.01 to $1.06 for fiscal year 1998.

(3) Net earnings per Cardinal Health common share before cumulative effect of
    change in accounting principle and cash dividends per Cardinal Health common
    share have been adjusted to retroactively reflect all stock dividends and
    stock splits through March 31, 2002.

(4) Cash dividends per Cardinal Health common share exclude dividends paid by
    all entities with which Cardinal Health has merged.

(5) In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets," which revises the accounting for purchased goodwill and other
    intangible assets. SFAS No. 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2001, with earlier adoption permitted. Cardinal Health
    elected to adopt SFAS No. 142 beginning with the first quarter of fiscal
    year 2002. Under SFAS No. 142, purchased goodwill and intangible assets with
    indefinite lives are no longer amortized, but, instead, tested for
    impairment at least annually. Accordingly, Cardinal Health has ceased
    amortization of all goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives as
    of July 1, 2001. Intangible assets with finite lives, primarily patents and
    trademarks, will continue to be amortized over their useful lives.

   SFAS No. 142 requires a two-step impairment test for goodwill. The first step
   is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit's assets to the fair
   value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value,
   then the second step is required to be completed, which involves the fair
   value of the reporting unit being allocated to each asset and liability with
   the excess being implied goodwill. The impairment loss is the amount by which
   the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. Cardinal Health was
   required to complete a "transitional" impairment test for goodwill as of the
   beginning of the fiscal year in which SFAS No. 142 is adopted. This
   transitional impairment test required that Cardinal Health complete step one
   of the goodwill impairment test within six months from the date of initial
   adoption, or December 31, 2001. Cardinal Health completed the transitional
   impairment test and did not incur any impairment charges.

   The following table displays Cardinal Health's net earnings and per share
   amounts for fiscal years 1999, 2000 and 2001 as adjusted for amortization of
   intangible assets and goodwill.

                    COMPARATIVE PER COMMON SHARE INFORMATION

     We have set forth below information concerning earnings, cash dividends
declared and book value per share data for Cardinal Health on an historical and
a pro forma combined basis and for Syncor on an historical basis adjusted for
discontinued operations (see Note 1 below) and a pro forma combined basis
adjusted for discontinued operations, and on a per share equivalent pro forma
basis, in each case adjusted for discontinued operations for Syncor. Book value
per share for the pro forma combined presentation is based upon outstanding
Cardinal Health common shares, adjusted to include the estimated number of
Cardinal Health common shares to be issued in the merger for outstanding shares
of Syncor common stock at the time the merger is completed. The per share
equivalent pro forma combined data for shares of Syncor common stock is based on
the conversion of each Syncor common share into 0.52 of a Cardinal Health common
share using the negotiated exchange ratio. See "The Merger
Agreement -- Conversion of Securities." You should read the information set
forth below in conjunction with the respective audited and unaudited financial
statements of Cardinal Health and Syncor incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement/prospectus. See "Where You Can Find More Information" on page 87.

(1) Syncor's historical net earnings per share of Syncor common stock from
    continuing operations at or for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, and
    at or for the nine months ended March 31, 2002, exclude the discontinued
    operations related to Syncor's planned sale of CMI, closure or sale of
    certain international locations and closure of Syncor's brachytherapy seeds
    production facilities announced by Syncor on June 14, 2002.

(2) Cardinal Health's historical net earnings per Cardinal Health common share
    before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, Cardinal
    Health's and Syncor's Pro Forma Combined net earnings per common share from
    continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting
    principle and the Equivalent Pro Forma Combined net earnings per common
    share from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in
    accounting principle reflect the effect of merger-related costs and other
    special charges. Amounts include the effect of merger-related costs and
    other special charges recorded by Cardinal Health in the fiscal year ended
    June 30, 2001 and the nine-month period ended March 31, 2002. See Note 2 of
    "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" incorporated by reference to
    Cardinal Health's Form 10-K for fiscal year 2001 for a further discussion of
    merger-related costs and other special charges affecting fiscal year 2001.
    See Note 5 of "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements"
    incorporated by reference to Cardinal Health's Form 10-Q for the nine months
    ended March 31, 2002 for further discussion of the merger-related costs and
    other special charges affecting the nine months ended March 31, 2002.

(3) The Pro Forma Combined and the Equivalent Pro Forma Combined information
    (excluding the book value per share information) presents the combination of
    Cardinal Health for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 with Syncor for the
    fiscal year ending December 31, 2001. In addition, the financial information
    of Cardinal Health for the nine months ended March 31, 2002 is combined with
    that of Syncor for the nine months ended March 31, 2002. The book value per
    share information as of June 30, 2001 is calculated based on the Cardinal
    Health balance sheet as of June 30, 2001 and the Syncor balance sheet as of
    December 31, 2001. The book value per share information as of March 31, 2002
    is calculated based on the Cardinal Health and Syncor balance sheets as of
    March 31, 2002.

(4) Amount does not reflect the pro forma effect of future merger-related
    expenses. In connection with the merger, Cardinal Health and Syncor expect
    to incur investment banking, legal, accounting and other merger-related
    costs and fees. Additionally, Cardinal Health and Syncor expect to incur
    other merger-related costs associated with the integration of the companies
    and institution of efficiencies anticipated as a result of the merger. The
    merger-related expenses will be charged to operating expense in the period
    in which the merger is completed, or in subsequent periods when incurred.
    Since the merger has not yet been completed and transition plans currently
    are being developed, the merger-related expenses cannot be reasonably
    estimated at this time.

(5) Pro Forma Combined cash dividends declared per Cardinal Health common share
    represent the historical dividends of Cardinal Health for all periods
    presented and exclude all dividends paid by Syncor and all entities with
    which Cardinal Health has merged. Cardinal Health's and Syncor's Pro Forma
    Combined cash dividends declared per common share have been adjusted to give
    retroactive effect to all stock dividends and stock splits through March 31,
    2002.

                   COMPARATIVE MARKET PRICE AND DIVIDEND DATA

     On the table below, we present the range of the reported high and low
closing per share sale prices of Cardinal Health common shares (as shown on the
New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape) and shares of Syncor common stock (as
reported on The Nasdaq National Market), as well as the per share dividends paid
on those shares, for the calendar quarters indicated. We have adjusted the share
price information in the table to reflect retroactively all applicable stock

     We encourage you to obtain current market quotations for Cardinal Health
common shares and Syncor common stock.

     Cardinal Health will file an application to list Cardinal Health common
shares that Syncor stockholders will receive in the merger on the New York Stock
Exchange.

     On May 13, 2002, the Cardinal Health board of directors declared a dividend
on Cardinal Health common shares of $0.025 per share, payable on July 15, 2002,
to holders of record on July 1, 2002. Cardinal Health anticipates that it will
continue to pay quarterly cash dividends. The Cardinal Health board of
directors, however, has discretion to decide upon the timing and amount of any
future dividends, and whether or not Cardinal Health will pay dividends (and, if
so, how much the dividends will be) will depend on Cardinal Health's future
earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     In considering whether to vote in favor of the merger agreement with
Cardinal Health, you should consider all of the information we have included in
this proxy statement/prospectus and its annexes and all of the information
included in the documents incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement/prospectus. In addition, you should pay particular attention to the
following risk factors related to the merger. These factors are important, and
we have not been able to quantify their potential effects on the combined
company. These factors are in addition to the risks faced by Cardinal Health and
Syncor in their day-to-day business operations and are not presented in order of
magnitude or importance.

THE MARKET VALUE OF CARDINAL HEALTH COMMON SHARES WILL VARY.

     The exchange ratio is a fixed ratio that will not be adjusted as a result
of any increase or decrease in the price of either Cardinal Health common shares
or Syncor common stock. The price of Cardinal Health common shares at the time
the merger is completed may be higher or lower than the price on the date of
this proxy statement/prospectus or on the date of the special meeting. Changes
in the business, operations or prospects of Cardinal Health or Syncor, market
assessments of the likelihood that the proposed merger will be completed,
regulatory considerations, general market and economic conditions or other
factors may affect the prices of Cardinal Health common shares, Syncor common
stock or both. Most of these factors are beyond our control. Since the proposed
merger will be completed only after all the conditions to the merger are
satisfied or waived, including the holding of the special meeting, there is no
way to be sure that the price of Cardinal Health common shares on the date of
the special meeting (or on any other date) will be indicative of the price at
the time the merger is completed. You should obtain current market quotations
for both Cardinal Health common shares and Syncor common stock.

UNCERTAINTIES EXIST IN INTEGRATING OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS.

     In deciding that the proposed merger is in the best interests of Syncor and
its stockholders, the Syncor board of directors considered the potential
complementary effects of combining Cardinal Health's and Syncor's assets,
personnel and operational expertise. Integrating businesses, however, involves a
number of special risks, including:

     - the possibility that management may be distracted from regular business
       concerns by the need to integrate operations,

     - unforeseen difficulties in integrating operations and systems,

     - customer and supplier reactions to proposed changes,

     - problems or difficulties in assimilating and retaining the employees of
       the acquired company,

     - challenges in retaining customers and suppliers, and

     - potential adverse short-term or long-term effects on operating results.

     Additionally, Syncor announced, on June 14, 2002, that it is exiting the
imaging business and is entertaining offers for its Comprehensive Medical
Imaging division. This transaction may occur before or after the completion of
the merger. However, no assurances can be given that any transaction will occur
or that the transaction will occur under terms acceptable to Syncor or Cardinal
Health.

THERE ARE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CARDINAL HEALTH'S ACQUISITION STRATEGY.

     An important element of Cardinal Health's growth strategy is to pursue
strategic acquisitions that either expand or complement its business, and
Cardinal Health routinely and on an ongoing basis reviews acquisition
opportunities. Acquisitions involve a number of special risks, including the
risks pertaining to integrating acquired businesses as noted under
"-- Uncertainties exist in integrating our business operations" and under "-- We
may fail to achieve the benefits anticipated in the merger." In addition,
Cardinal Health may incur debt to finance future acquisitions, and Cardinal
Health may issue securities in connection with future

acquisitions that may dilute the holdings of current and future Cardinal Health
shareholders. If Cardinal Health is unable to successfully complete and
integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, Cardinal Health's growth
strategy may be impaired.

WE MAY FAIL TO ACHIEVE THE BENEFITS ANTICIPATED IN THE MERGER.

     We believe that significant business opportunities and cost savings are
achievable as a result of the merger. Our estimates of cost savings are based
upon many assumptions, including future sales levels and other operating
results, the availability of funds for capital expenditures, the timing of
certain events, as well as general industry and business conditions and other
matters, many of which are beyond the control of the combined company. Our
estimates also are based on a management consensus as to what levels of sales
and similar efficiencies should be achievable by an entity the size of the
combined company. Our estimates of potential cost savings and revenue
enhancements are forward-looking statements that are inherently uncertain. The
combined company's actual cost savings and revenue enhancements, if any, could
differ from those projected, and those differences could be material. Therefore,
you should not rely on our estimates as predictors of actual cost savings and
revenue enhancements. We cannot assure you that unforeseen costs and expenses or
other factors (whether arising in connection with the integration of the
Cardinal Health's and Syncor's operations or otherwise) will not offset the
estimated cost savings and revenue enhancements or other components of the
combined company's plan or result in delays in the realization of certain
projected cost savings. See "Forward-Looking Statements."

ANTITRUST AND COMPETITION AUTHORITIES IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS MAY ATTEMPT TO
DELAY OR PREVENT THE MERGER OR MAY REQUIRE DIVESTITURES.

     Syncor and Cardinal Health conduct operations in a number of jurisdictions
where antitrust filings or approvals may be required in connection with the
merger. We have made or will make antitrust filings with the relevant
authorities in the United States and Brazil. We believe that the necessary
regulatory approvals will be obtained or that no government action will be
taken. Nevertheless, we cannot provide any assurance that the necessary
approvals will be obtained or that there will not be any adverse consequences to
our respective businesses resulting from the failure to obtain these regulatory
approvals or from conditions that could be imposed in connection with obtaining
these approvals, including divestitures or other operating restrictions on our
businesses. See "The Merger Agreement -- HSR Act Filings; Reasonable Efforts;
Notification."

                              THE SPECIAL MEETING

     The Syncor board of directors is soliciting proxies from Syncor
stockholders for use at the special meeting and at any adjournments or
postponements of the special meeting. This proxy statement/prospectus, together
with the form of proxy, is being mailed to Syncor stockholders on or about July
[  ], 2002.

TIME AND PLACE OF THE MEETING

    The time and place of the special meeting is:

    [     ], August [  ], 2002
    1:00 p.m., California time
    Warner Center Hilton Hotel
    6360 Canoga Avenue
    Woodland Hills, California

MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED AT THE SPECIAL MEETING

     The special meeting will be held to:

          (1) Vote on a proposal to approve the merger agreement. The merger
     agreement is included as Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus. The
     merger agreement provides for the merger of Mudhen Merger Corp. with and
     into Syncor, with Syncor, as the surviving corporation in the merger,
     becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Cardinal Health.

          (2) Adjourn the special meeting, if necessary, to permit further
     solicitation of proxies in the event there are not sufficient votes at the
     time of the special meeting to approve the merger agreement proposal.

          (3) Act on any other matters that may properly come before the special
     meeting.

RECORD DATE

     The Syncor board of directors has established July [  ], 2002, as the
record date for the special meeting. Only holders of record of shares of Syncor
common stock on the record date are entitled to attend and vote at the special
meeting or at any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting.

     As of the close of business on the record date, there were approximately
[          ] shares of Syncor common stock outstanding and entitled to vote for
purposes of the general vote at the special meeting.

SHARE OWNERSHIP

     Syncor.  On the record date, all Syncor directors, executive officers and
their affiliates, as a group, beneficially owned a total of [     ] outstanding
shares of Syncor common stock, representing approximately [  ]% of the voting
power at the special meeting. Each of these Syncor directors and officers is
expected to vote the outstanding shares of Syncor common stock beneficially
owned by him or her in favor of the merger agreement. Monty Fu, Chairman of the
Board of Syncor, and Robert G. Funari, President and Chief Executive Officer of
Syncor, who, together, beneficially own approximately [  ]% of the outstanding
shares on the record date, have executed support/voting agreements with Cardinal
Health agreeing to vote in favor of the merger agreement.

     Cardinal Health.  At the record date, Cardinal Health and its subsidiaries
beneficially owned no shares of Syncor common stock. At the same date, all of
Cardinal Health's directors, executive officers and their affiliates as a group
did not hold any shares of Syncor common stock.

QUORUM

     A quorum for the general vote, consisting of the holders of a majority of
the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of Syncor common stock at
the record date, must be present in person or represented by proxy for the
transaction of business at the special meeting. Shares of Syncor common stock
held by

brokers or nominees as to which instructions have not been received from the
beneficial owners or persons entitled to vote and for which the broker or
nominee does not have discretionary power to vote on a particular matter are
referred to as "broker non-votes." These broker non-votes and shares of Syncor
common stock represented by proxies that reflect abstentions will be treated as
shares of Syncor common stock that are present and entitled to vote for purposes
of determining the presence of a quorum.

VOTE REQUIRED

     Approval of the merger agreement at the special meeting requires the
affirmative vote of holders representing a majority of the voting power of the
issued and outstanding shares of Syncor common stock. Each Syncor stockholder
will have one vote for each share of Syncor common stock held on the record
date.

     Because approval of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of a
specified percentage of outstanding shares of Syncor common stock, abstaining,
not voting on the proposal, or failing to instruct your broker on how to vote
shares of Syncor common stock held for you by the broker, will have the same
effect as voting against the merger agreement.

     Approval of the adjournment proposal at the special meeting requires the
affirmative vote of holders representing a majority the voting power of the
issued and outstanding shares of Syncor common stock present, in person or by
proxy, at the special meeting.

     You may vote your shares of Syncor common stock in one of the following
ways:

          (1) by completing and returning the accompanying proxy card;

          (2) through the Internet or by telephone, as outlined on the
     accompanying proxy card; or

          (3) by appearing and voting in person at the special meeting.

     Two of Syncor's directors already have agreed to vote in favor of the
merger agreement at the special meeting. As of the record date, July [  ], 2002,
they beneficially owned approximately [     ]% of the outstanding shares of
Syncor common stock.

VOTING AND REVOCATION OF PROXIES

     All shares of Syncor common stock represented at the special meeting by a
properly executed proxy will be voted in accordance with the instructions
indicated on the proxy, unless the proxy is revoked before a vote is taken. If
you sign and return a proxy without voting instructions, and do not revoke the
proxy, the proxy will be voted "FOR" the merger agreement proposal, "FOR" the
adjournment proposal, and in the discretion of the named proxies on any other
matters that may properly come before the special meeting.

     You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted. A proxy may be
revoked prior to the vote at the special meeting in any of the following ways:

          (1) by submitting a written revocation to the Secretary of Syncor at
     6464 Canoga Avenue, Woodland Hills, California 91367-2407 (which must be
     received by the Secretary of Syncor prior to the special meeting);

          (2) by submitting a later-dated proxy by mail or telephone or through
     the Internet (which must be received by the Secretary of Syncor prior to
     the special meeting); or

          (3) by voting in person at the special meeting.

     However, simply attending the special meeting (without voting) will not
revoke a proxy.

     If you do not hold your shares of Syncor common stock in your own name, you
may revoke a previously given proxy by following the revocation instructions
provided by the bank, broker or other person who is the registered owner of your
shares of Syncor common stock.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

     Syncor will bear the costs of soliciting proxies to vote on the merger
agreement at the special meeting, and Cardinal Health and Syncor each will pay
their own expenses incurred in connection with the cost of filing, printing and
distributing this proxy statement/prospectus. MacKenzie Partners, Inc. has been
retained by Syncor and Cardinal Health to assist in the solicitation of proxies
for the special meeting and will receive a fee of up to $10,000, plus reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses.

     In addition to solicitation by mail, directors, officers and employees of
Syncor and its subsidiaries may solicit proxies from Syncor stockholders, either
personally, through the Internet or by telephone or other form of communication.
None of the foregoing persons who solicit proxies will be separately compensated
for these services. Except as described above, Syncor does not anticipate that
any other persons will be specifically engaged to solicit proxies or that
special compensation will be paid for that purpose, but Syncor reserves the
right to do so should it conclude that these efforts are necessary or advisable.
Nominees, fiduciaries and other custodians will be requested to forward
soliciting materials to beneficial owners of Syncor common stock and will be
reimbursed for their reasonable expenses incurred in sending proxy material to
beneficial owners of Syncor common stock.

                                   THE MERGER

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     Beginning in spring 2001, Monty Fu, Chairman, and Robert G. Funari,
President and Chief Executive Officer, of Syncor, periodically reviewed with
Syncor's senior management and the Syncor board of directors the changing
landscape of the radiopharmaceutical distribution and medical imaging businesses
and the effect on Syncor's strategic outlook.

     As part of its strategy, Cardinal Health continually maintains a variety of
contacts with potential candidates for combination within the drug distribution
industry and other segments of the health services and health care industry
generally.

     In May 2001, Robert D. Walter, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
Cardinal Health, contacted Mr. Funari to arrange a meeting in Cleveland, Ohio to
discuss developments in the radiopharmacy industry, and, in broad terms,
Cardinal Health's and Syncor's respective business plans. Following this
meeting, Cardinal Health and Syncor executed a mutual confidentiality agreement
in anticipation of further discussions to pursue the matters raised at the first
meeting. Various meetings and telephone conversations occurred between June and
August 2001 involving Cardinal Health's and Syncor's senior management during
which they discussed industry trends and the respective future strategies of
each company. At later meetings, Cardinal Health and Syncor began to generally
explore the possibility of Syncor and Cardinal Health pursuing a business
combination and the benefits that might be realized by combining their
operations.

     During this period, Mr. Funari was approached on an unsolicited basis by
another company in the health care industry. A number of meetings and telephone
conversations followed leading to preliminary exploration of the possibility of
a business combination involving Syncor and the other party. In connection with
these discussions, on August 8, 2001, Syncor entered into a confidentiality
agreement with the other party. Discussions continued throughout August and
early September 2001 regarding a potential transaction between Syncor and the
other party and potential benefits that could result from such combination.
Although preliminary views on valuation were exchanged, in the middle of
September 2001, the other party informed Syncor that it was no longer interested
in continuing discussions with respect to a business combination.

     During August and September 2001, at the request of Syncor's senior
management and the Syncor board of directors, Syncor's financial advisor,
Salomon Smith Barney, contacted on behalf of Syncor several industry
participants on an informal basis to gauge their interest in a possible business
combination with Syncor. No indications of interest were received at that time
from the parties contacted.

     Beginning in July 2001, Syncor's senior management met regularly with the
Syncor board of directors, in person or telephonically, regarding the status of
the discussions with Cardinal Health and the other party and the possible
advantages and disadvantages of pursuing a transaction with either Cardinal
Health or the other party, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of
remaining an independent company. At a meeting of the Syncor board of directors
in Chicago on August 20-21, 2001, the Syncor board of directors created an
ad-hoc advisory committee of independent directors to assist Syncor's management
in its consideration of these potential combinations and requested that Syncor's
management regularly consult with the members of this ad-hoc committee of
independent directors. Regular telephonic meetings of the board of directors and
the ad-hoc committee of independent directors continued from August through
early November 2001.

     During late August through October 2001, Cardinal Health's and Syncor's
senior management and their respective legal and financial advisors continued
discussions regarding a potential business combination, and Cardinal Health
conducted detailed financial, operational and legal due diligence on Syncor.
Cardinal Health and Syncor began to discuss the possible terms of a business
combination and exchanged preliminary views regarding valuation of each of them
in the context of such a transaction. Cardinal Health's and Syncor's discussions
focused on possible exchange ratios of Syncor common stock for Cardinal Health
common shares in a potential combination in the range of 0.57 to 0.62 subject
to, among other things, satisfactory completion of due diligence, negotiation of
definitive documents and related matters.

     In late October 2001, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, outside counsel to
Cardinal Health, provided Syncor and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP,
Syncor's legal advisors, with a draft merger agreement relating to a possible
business combination. Syncor and its legal advisors provided comments on the
draft agreement in early November 2001.

     On November 4, 2001, Mr. Walter called Mr. Funari and informed him that, at
that time, Cardinal Health was not interested in pursuing a possible business
combination with Syncor on the terms discussed. Syncor then requested that
Cardinal Health return or destroy all Syncor confidential information provided
to Cardinal Health pursuant to their confidentiality agreement.

     After the termination of these discussions, Syncor's senior management and
the Syncor board of directors determined to explore the possible disposition of
Syncor's medical imaging business, CMI, as part of Syncor's decision to focus
its future operations on its core nuclear pharmaceutical and complex
pharmaceutical distribution businesses. Salomon Smith Barney was engaged to
assist Syncor in this process. Various interested parties were invited to
undertake a due diligence review of the medical imaging business. A number of
parties participated in this process that continued through, and was publicly
disclosed at the time of, the announcement of the transaction between Cardinal
Health and Syncor. This process is continuing as of the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus.

     In early April 2002, Mr. Walter contacted Messrs. Fu and Funari on an
unsolicited basis expressing interest in beginning new discussions relating to a
possible strategic business combination between Cardinal Health and Syncor.
During April 2002, senior management of Cardinal Health, Syncor and Syncor's
financial advisor held several meetings and telephone calls during which the
possible terms of a transaction were explored.

     During April, May and early June 2002, Syncor's senior management regularly
met telephonically with the ad-hoc committee of independent directors to update
them on the status of the discussions with Cardinal Health and the sale process
for CMI.

     During various meetings and telephone conversations in early May 2002,
Cardinal Health and Syncor exchanged views on preliminary valuation in
connection with a possible transaction that Cardinal Health and Syncor agreed
would be structured as a tax-free stock-for-stock merger whereby each share of
Syncor common stock would be exchanged for a defined fraction of a Cardinal
Health common share. Through the middle of May 2002, Cardinal Health and Syncor
held further discussions regarding the proposed exchange ratio for the
combination, and, subject to, among other things, satisfactory completion of due
diligence, board of directors approval and satisfactory negotiation of other
terms of a transaction and definitive agreements, Cardinal Health and Syncor
decided to pursue negotiations on the basis of an approximate exchange ratio
that might be acceptable to both of them. At a May 16, 2002 meeting of the
ad-hoc committee of independent directors, the committee members were updated as
to the discussions at that time. In addition, during this and other meetings of
the ad-hoc committee of independent directors, the committee discussed with
Syncor's senior management and financial advisor the merits of the proposed
combination with Cardinal Health compared to other strategic alternatives
available to Syncor, including the risks and uncertainties associated with
Syncor remaining as an independent company.

     Beginning the week of May 20, 2002, extensive financial, operational and
legal due diligence on Syncor was conducted by Cardinal Health. This due
diligence continued until the execution of the definitive merger agreement on
June 14, 2002. In addition, on June 3-4, 2002, Syncor's senior management and
financial advisor conducted financial and operational due diligence on Cardinal
Health at meetings in Dublin, Ohio.

     Toward the end of May 2002, Wachtell, Lipton, on behalf of Cardinal Health,
circulated a draft merger agreement as well as draft support/voting agreement
relating to the proposed combination. Until the execution of the definitive
documentation on June 14, 2002, Cardinal Health and Syncor and their respective
legal advisors negotiated the terms of this draft merger agreement, as well as
the draft support/voting agreement and the identity of Syncor stockholders that
would sign the support/voting agreement. Wachtell, Lipton also provided a draft
stock option agreement pursuant to which Syncor would grant to Cardinal Health
an option to acquire up to 19.9% of Syncor's common stock, but, during the
negotiations on the definitive merger

agreement, Cardinal Health agreed to withdraw its request for the stock option
agreement. The ad-hoc committee of independent directors of Syncor held several
meetings to discuss, and the Syncor board of directors was regularly updated as
to, the status of the negotiations on the definitive agreement and the principal
outstanding issues between Cardinal Health and Syncor, and provided Syncor's
senior management with their views on these matters. The negotiations between
Cardinal Health and Syncor focused on, among other things, the transaction
closing conditions and Syncor's ability to adequately consider a competing
proposal that might arise after the announcement of the transaction with
Cardinal Health. The board of directors and the committee of independent
directors of Syncor expressed their views that it was imperative, particularly
in light of the terms of the proposed combination with Cardinal Health, that the
definitive merger agreement not include terms that effectively preclude, from a
legal, procedural or financial perspective, the possibility of a viable superior
proposal being made for Syncor.

     On June 11, 2002, a special meeting of the Syncor board of directors was
held in Chicago. At this meeting, representatives of Skadden, Arps discussed in
detail fiduciary and other legal considerations that the directors should
consider in their deliberations regarding the proposed combination. In addition,
representatives of Skadden, Arps presented a detailed review of the terms of the
draft merger agreement, support/voting agreement and other documentation that
had been negotiated by Cardinal Health and Syncor, and identified the remaining
open items in connection with these negotiations. Salomon Smith Barney reviewed
with the Syncor board of directors financial aspects of the proposed
combination, including a financial overview of each of Syncor and Cardinal
Health, and Syncor's management's view as to strategic considerations in
connection with the proposed combination. The Syncor board of directors also
discussed with Syncor's senior management and Salomon Smith Barney strategic
alternatives to the proposed combination, including the potential risks of
Syncor remaining an independent company. In addition, the Syncor board of
directors discussed three different stand-alone scenarios for Syncor prepared by
Syncor's management and reviewed by Salomon Smith Barney showing varying levels
of projected financial performance of Syncor based on various assumptions as to
developments in Syncor's business over the next three years. Salomon Smith
Barney discussed the effect that these scenarios would have on its financial
analysis and indicated that the case that Syncor's management had advised
Salomon Smith Barney was the most likely scenario would be used for purposes of
its financial analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
proposed exchange ratio. The Syncor board of directors also reviewed
management's estimate of the potential synergies that could be realized in the
proposed transaction. In addition, they discussed the risks and status of the
process for the sale of CMI. Changes in market conditions and Syncor's industry
and businesses and prospects since the Syncor board of directors last considered
a possible combination with Cardinal Health in late October 2001 also were
discussed. At this meeting, Syncor's senior management reported to the Syncor
board of directors on the results of its due diligence review of Cardinal
Health.

     At the regular quarterly meeting of the Cardinal Health board of directors
held in May 2002, the Cardinal Health board of directors was apprised by
management and Cardinal Health's counsel as to the status of discussions between
Cardinal Health and Syncor to date and Cardinal Health's management presented
its rationale for a business combination involving Syncor. No action with
respect to any potential transaction was taken at the meeting. On June 13, 2002,
a special telephonic meeting of the Cardinal Health board of directors was held
at which the potential business combination with Syncor was considered and
approved.

     Commencing the night of June 13, 2002 and continuing in the early morning
of June 14, 2002, the Syncor board of directors met telephonically and received
an update from Syncor's senior management and financial and legal advisors as to
developments since the last Syncor board of directors meeting. Representatives
of Skadden, Arps reviewed the outcome of negotiations on the remaining issues in
the draft merger agreement, support/voting agreement and other definitive
documentation. Salomon Smith Barney reviewed its financial analysis of the
exchange ratio provided for in the merger agreement and rendered to the Syncor
board of directors its oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion
dated June 14, 2002, to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based
on and subject to the matters described in its opinion, the exchange ratio was
fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of Syncor common stock. The
Syncor board of directors also discussed unsolicited calls to Syncor's
management from an investment banking firm suggesting that other

parties in the industry might be interested in a transaction with Syncor. The
Syncor board of directors was advised by Syncor's management that the investment
banking firm reported that none of the four companies it had spoken with
expressed a definitive interest in pursuing a possible business combination with
Syncor at that time. After deliberations, the Syncor board of directors
unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, are advisable and
fair to and in the best interests of Syncor and Syncor stockholders and would be
consistent with, and in furtherance of, the long-term business strategies and
goals of Syncor. The Syncor board of directors unanimously approved the merger
agreement and resolved to recommend to Syncor stockholders approval of the
merger agreement.

     On the morning of June 14, 2002, Cardinal Health and Syncor executed the
definitive merger agreement and issued a joint press release announcing the
proposed merger.

REASONS FOR THE MERGER; RECOMMENDATION OF THE SYNCOR BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     Considerations and Recommendation of the Syncor Board of Directors.  The
Syncor board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and
determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, including the merger, are advisable and fair to and in the
best interests of Syncor and its stockholders and would be consistent with, and
in furtherance of, the long-term business strategies and goals of Syncor. The
decision of the Syncor board of directors to enter into the merger agreement and
to recommend that Syncor stockholders approve the merger agreement was the
result of careful consideration by the Syncor board of directors of numerous
factors, including, without limitation, the following:

     - the value to Syncor stockholders of the proposed merger with Cardinal
       Health, including the fairness to Syncor stockholders of the financial
       terms of the proposed merger with Cardinal Health; and

     - the terms of the merger agreement and other details of the proposed
       merger with Cardinal Health.

     The deliberations of the Syncor board of directors included consideration
of the following positive factors:

     - the exchange ratio (based on the closing price per Cardinal Health common
       share on June 13, 2002, the last trading day before announcement of the
       proposed merger) implied a value of $32.42 per share of Syncor common
       stock, representing a premium of approximately 14.9% over the closing
       price per share of Syncor common stock on June 13, 2002, the last trading
       day immediately preceding the announcement of the transaction, and a
       premium of approximately 5.0% over the average closing price per share of
       Syncor common stock for the four weeks prior to June 14, 2002;

     - the substantially larger public float and trading volume of Cardinal
       Health common shares (which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange)
       compared to the public float and trading volume of shares of Syncor
       common stock (which are quoted on The Nasdaq National Market) will
       provide Syncor stockholders the opportunity to gain greater liquidity in
       their investment;

     - because the exchange ratio is fixed, Syncor stockholders will benefit
       from any increase in the trading price of Cardinal Health common shares
       between the announcement of the merger and the closing of the merger;

     - assuming continuation of historical dividend practices following
       completion of the merger, Syncor stockholders, as Cardinal Health
       shareholders, will receive dividends on their Cardinal Health common
       shares as compared to shares of Syncor common stock on which dividends
       have never been paid;

     - the financial presentation of Syncor's financial advisor, Salomon Smith
       Barney, including its opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point
       of view and as of the date of the opinion, of the exchange ratio provided
       for in the merger, as more fully described under "-- Opinion of Syncor's
       Financial Advisor;"

     - the strategic and operational risks associated with Syncor remaining
       independent, and the risks of not being able to achieve management's
       financial goals on a stand-alone basis, especially in light of recent
       volatility in financial markets and uncertainties in the U.S. and world
       economies, which risks include:

        - risks associated with CMI and the outcome of any attempted sale of
          CMI,

        - risks associated with Syncor's contract with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.
          relating to the distribution of Cardiolite(R), which contract is due
          to expire on December 31, 2003, including the risk of non-renewal or
          renewal on less favorable economic terms,

        - risks associated with the restructuring of Syncor's international
          operations,

        - risks inherent in Syncor's growth strategies, including uncertainties
          as to Syncor's complex pharmaceutical initiatives, and

        - risks associated with increased competition in the radiopharmacy
          business;

     - the consideration of the three alternative stand-alone scenarios for
       Syncor prepared by Syncor's management and reviewed by Salomon Smith
       Barney showing varying levels of projected financial performance of
       Syncor based on various assumptions as to the developments in its
       business over the next three years, with the Syncor board of directors
       noting the significant adverse impact on Syncor's future financial
       performance in the event that the risks inherent in the least favorable
       case were realized;

     - the fact that Syncor had reviewed its strategic options and, in
       connection therewith, it or its representatives or others had preliminary
       contacts or informal discussions with a number of parties to gauge their
       potential interest in a strategic transaction with Syncor. In light of
       these contacts and discussions, the Syncor board of directors did not
       believe that it was likely that another party would make an offer to
       engage in a transaction with Syncor that would be more favorable to
       Syncor and its stockholders than the merger;

     - the opportunity for Syncor stockholders to participate, as Cardinal
       Health shareholders, in a significantly larger and more diversified
       company that is one of the leading providers of products and services
       supporting the health care industry with annualized revenues of more than
       $40 billion;

     - the financial strength of Cardinal Health and its subsidiaries should
       permit Syncor's businesses to obtain lower cost funding through the
       capital markets relative to Syncor on a stand-alone basis;

     - the merger will provide Syncor with access to significantly greater
       financial and operational resources than Syncor would have on a
       stand-alone basis, thereby enabling Syncor to fund its business
       development efforts at lower cost;

     - the post-merger combined businesses of Cardinal Health and Syncor would
       provide greater opportunity for the development and commercial
       exploitation of Syncor's service capabilities by utilizing Cardinal
       Health's broader geographic scope and client base;

     - the potential operational benefits afforded by the transaction,
       including:

        - expanded growth opportunities resulting from increased financial
          resources,

        - cross-selling opportunities utilizing Cardinal Health's expanded
          distribution channels and complementary product offerings, and

        - expected savings in areas such as general and administrative expenses;

     - the proven capability of each of Cardinal Health's and Syncor's
       management team to deliver stockholder value, integrate businesses and
       successfully execute strategies;

     - the merger agreement provisions permitting Syncor to provide confidential
       due diligence information to, and engage in discussions with, a third
       party that delivers an unsolicited competing offer to engage in a
       strategic transaction, provided that the Syncor board of directors
       believes in good faith as

       determined by a majority vote, based upon the advice of its outside legal
       counsel, that failing to take this action would reasonably be expected to
       constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law and
       believes in good faith, after consulting with a nationally recognized
       investment banking firm and Syncor's outside legal counsel, that the
       proposal would reasonably be expected to result in a transaction that, if
       consummated, would be more favorable to Syncor stockholders from a
       financial point of view than the merger;

     - the right of the Syncor board of directors to withdraw, modify or change
       the Syncor board of directors' recommendation with respect to the merger
       if the Syncor board of directors believes in good faith, based upon the
       advice of outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would
       reasonably be expected to cause a failure to comply with its fiduciary
       duties under applicable law with the consequences set forth in the merger
       agreement;

     - the ability to complete the merger within a reasonable period of time,
       including likelihood of receiving necessary regulatory approvals in light
       of the commitments made by Cardinal Health pursuant to the terms of the
       merger agreement in seeking these approvals;

     - the structure of the transaction and the terms of the merger agreement,
       including the fact that the merger is intended to qualify as a
       "reorganization" (within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code) and
       is, therefore, not expected to be taxable to Syncor stockholders (other
       than with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional Cardinal Health
       common shares);

     - the non-financial terms of the transaction, including the fact that
       Syncor is expected to retain its corporate identity and the anticipated
       role of Syncor's management in the combined radiopharmacy business of
       Cardinal Health following the merger; and

     - the existence of change in control agreements in favor of certain of
       Syncor's employees that provide payments to those employees in the event
       those employees' employment is terminated under certain circumstances
       following a change in control of Syncor.

     The Syncor board of directors also identified and considered the following
potentially negative factors in its deliberations:

     - because the exchange ratio is fixed, Syncor stockholders will be
       adversely affected by any decrease in the sale price of Cardinal Health
       common shares between the announcement of the transaction and the
       completion of the merger, which would not have been the case had the
       consideration been based on a fixed value (that is, a fixed dollar amount
       of value per share in all cases); and Syncor is not permitted to
       terminate the merger agreement solely because of changes in the market
       price of Cardinal Health common shares;

     - the fact that the implied value of the exchange ratio represented a
       premium over the closing price per share of Syncor common stock that was
       less than the premiums paid in some comparable public company
       transactions, including those in the health care industry;

     - the possible disruption to Syncor's business that may result from the
       announcement of the transaction and the resulting distraction of Syncor's
       management's attention.

     - the difficulty inherent in integrating diverse businesses and the risk
       that the cost efficiencies, synergies and other benefits expected to be
       obtained in the transaction might not be fully realized;

     - the terms of the merger agreement regarding the operation of Syncor's
       business during the period between the signing of the agreement and the
       completion of the merger;

     - the up to $24.125 million termination fee to be paid to Cardinal Health
       if the merger agreement is terminated under circumstances specified in
       the merger agreement (see "The Merger Agreement -- Effect of
       Termination");

     - the fact that if a third party makes a more favorable competing offer for
       Syncor, Syncor will not be able to terminate the merger agreement prior
       to the time at which the Syncor stockholders vote on the merger agreement
       (see "The Merger Agreement -- Termination");

     - the risk that the merger might not be completed and the effect of the
       resulting public announcement of termination of the merger agreement on:

        - the market price of Syncor common stock,

        - Syncor's operating results, particularly in light of the costs
          incurred in connection with the transaction, including the potential
          requirement to make a termination payment, and

        - Syncor's ability to attract and retain key personnel; and

     - the possibility of significant costs and delays resulting from seeking
       regulatory approvals necessary for completion of the proposed merger and
       the possibility of nonconsummation of the proposed merger if these
       approvals are not obtained.

     In its consideration of the proposed merger, the Syncor board of directors
also reviewed information relating to Cardinal Health and Syncor and the
proposed merger, including:

     - historical information concerning Cardinal Health's and Syncor's
       respective businesses, financial performance and condition, operations,
       technology, management and competitive position;

     - Syncor's management's views as to the financial condition, results of
       operations and businesses and prospects of Cardinal Health and Syncor
       before and after giving effect to the merger;

     - then-current financial market conditions and historical market prices,
       volatility and trading information with respect to Cardinal Health common
       shares and shares of Syncor common stock; and

     - discussions with Syncor's senior management and financial advisors as to
       the result of their business and financial due diligence review of
       Cardinal Health.

     Although the foregoing discussion sets forth all of the material factors
considered by the Syncor board of directors in reaching the Syncor board of
directors' recommendation, it may not include all of the factors considered by
the Syncor board of directors, and each director may have considered different
factors. In view of the variety of factors and the amount of information
considered, the Syncor board of directors did not find it practicable to, and
did not, make specific assessments of, quantify or otherwise assign relative
weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its recommendation. The
recommendation was made after consideration of all of the factors as a whole.

     THE SYNCOR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE MERGER AGREEMENT
AND DETERMINED THAT THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY
THE MERGER AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE MERGER, ARE ADVISABLE AND FAIR TO AND IN THE
BEST INTERESTS OF SYNCOR AND SYNCOR STOCKHOLDERS AND WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH,
AND IN FURTHERANCE OF, THE LONG-TERM BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND GOALS OF SYNCOR.
ACCORDINGLY, THE SYNCOR BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE
SYNCOR STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

     In considering the recommendation of the Syncor board of directors with
respect to the merger agreement, you should be aware that certain of Syncor's
directors and officers have arrangements that cause them to have interests in
the transaction that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of
Syncor stockholders generally. See "The Merger -- Interests of Syncor's
Directors and Officers in the Merger."

     Considerations of the Cardinal Health Board of Directors.  In the course of
reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, the Cardinal Health
board of directors consulted with Cardinal Health's legal advisors as well as
with

Cardinal Health's management and received the advice of Cardinal Health's
financial advisors as provided to Cardinal Health's management, and considered a
number of factors, including among others:

     - management's expectation that the merger will be accretive to earnings
       and cash flow of the combined company, as compared to Cardinal Health's
       stand-alone earnings and cash flow expectations, without giving effect to
       any potential synergies;

     - the strategic and cultural fit between Cardinal Health and Syncor;

     - the opportunity to gain an attractive presence in the high-growth nuclear
       pharmacy business;

     - the potential for strategic synergies and cost savings across the various
       businesses of the combined company;

     - the opportunity to reduce marginal operating costs for the combined
       company below levels that either Cardinal Health or Syncor could achieve
       independently, enabling it to share these savings in the form of greater
       value and enhanced services to its customers, while maintaining an
       acceptable level of profitability;

     - the opportunity to build more effective pharmaceutical purchasing
       alliances with a larger customer base through Cardinal Health's
       e-procurement platform, making the combined company a more attractive
       trading partner to pharmaceutical manufacturers and enabling it to
       negotiate more favorable merchandising programs and price discounts on
       behalf of its customers;

     - the complementary nature of Cardinal Health's broader service offerings
       (such as pharmacy automation, pharmacy management, specialty packaging,
       health care information software and health care cost-management
       services) and Syncor's radiopharmaceutical product offerings, enabling
       the combined company to offer a broader choice to its customers and
       accelerating the number of meaningful opportunities to cross-sell
       products and services;

     - the time and resources required to complete the merger, with the
       completion of the merger being subject to certain conditions (see "The
       Merger Agreement -- Conditions to the Obligations of Each
       Party; -- Conditions to the Obligations of Syncor; -- Conditions to the
       Obligations of Cardinal Health and Mudhen Merger Corp.) and the time and
       resources necessary to integrate Syncor's operations with Cardinal
       Health's operations;

     - the fact that all of the conditions to the merger may not be satisfied
       until the first calendar quarter of 2003;

     - potential difficulties inherent in integrating two geographically diverse
       businesses and the risk that the benefits expected to be obtained in the
       merger might not be fully realized;

     - the addition of Syncor's seasoned senior leadership team that should
       provide additional management depth to the combined company; and

     - the cost associated with retaining Syncor's management team and
       possibility that Cardinal Health may be unable to retain these
       individuals.

     The Cardinal Health board of directors also considered Syncor's anticipated
divestiture of CMI and found this plan to be consistent with Cardinal Health's
strategic direction, although there can be no assurances that any such
transaction will occur. The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by
the Cardinal Health board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive. In view
of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of
the merger, the Cardinal Health board of directors did not find it practicable
to, and did not, quantify or otherwise attempt to assign relative weights to the
specific factors considered in reaching its determinations. In addition,
individual Cardinal Health directors may have given differing weights to
different factors. The Cardinal Health board of directors considered all these
factors as a whole, and overall considered them to be favorable to and to
support its determination to approve the merger agreement, including the merger.

OPINION OF SYNCOR'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     Syncor retained Salomon Smith Barney to act as its financial advisor in
connection with the proposed merger. In connection with this engagement, Syncor
requested that Salomon Smith Barney evaluate the fairness, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of Syncor common stock of the exchange ratio
provided for in the merger. On June 14, 2002, at a meeting of the Syncor board
of directors held to evaluate the proposed merger, Salomon Smith Barney
delivered to the Syncor board of directors an oral opinion, which opinion was
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated the same date, to the effect
that, as of that date and based on and subject to the matters described in its
opinion, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of Syncor common stock.

     In arriving at its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney:

     - reviewed the merger agreement and related documents;

     - held discussions with Syncor's senior officers, directors and other
       representatives and advisors and with Cardinal Health's senior officers
       and other representatives and advisors concerning Syncor's and Cardinal
       Health's businesses, operations and prospects;

     - examined publicly available business and financial information relating
       to Syncor and Cardinal Health;

     - examined financial forecasts and other information and data for Syncor
       and publicly available financial forecasts and other information and data
       for Cardinal Health which were provided to or otherwise discussed with
       Salomon Smith Barney by Syncor's and Cardinal Health's managements,
       including information relating to the potential strategic implications
       and operational benefits anticipated by Syncor's management to result
       from the merger;

     - reviewed the financial terms of the merger as described in the merger
       agreement in relation to, among other things, current and historical
       market prices and trading volumes of Syncor common stock and Cardinal
       Health common shares, the historical and projected earnings and other
       operating data of Syncor and Cardinal Health, and the capitalization and
       financial condition of Syncor and Cardinal Health;

     - considered, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of
       other transactions effected that it considered relevant in evaluating the
       merger;

     - analyzed financial, stock market and other publicly available information
       relating to the businesses of other companies whose operations it
       considered relevant in evaluating those of Syncor and Cardinal Health;

     - evaluated the potential pro forma financial impact of the merger on
       Cardinal Health; and

     - conducted other analyses and examinations and considered other financial,
       economic and market criteria as it deemed appropriate in arriving at its
       opinion.

     In rendering its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney assumed and relied, without
independent verification, on the accuracy and completeness of all financial and
other information and data publicly available or furnished to or otherwise
reviewed by or discussed with it. With respect to financial forecasts and other
information and data relating to Syncor provided to or otherwise discussed with
Salomon Smith Barney and used in its analysis, Syncor's management advised
Salomon Smith Barney that the forecasts and other information and data were
reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates
and judgments of Syncor's management as to the future financial performance of
Syncor. With respect to the publicly available financial forecasts and other
information and data relating to Cardinal Health provided to or otherwise
discussed with Salomon Smith Barney and used in its analysis, Cardinal Health's
management advised Salomon Smith Barney that the forecasts and other information
and data represented reasonable estimates as to the future financial performance
of Cardinal Health.

     Salomon Smith Barney assumed, with Syncor's consent, that the merger will
be completed in accordance with its terms without waiver, modification or
amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and

that, in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or third-party
approvals and consents for the merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or
condition will be imposed other than as specified in the merger agreement and
related documents. Salomon Smith Barney also assumed, with Syncor's consent,
that the merger will be treated as a tax-free reorganization for federal income
tax purposes. Salomon Smith Barney's opinion relates to the relative values of
Syncor and Cardinal Health. Salomon Smith Barney did not express any opinion as
to what the value of Cardinal Health common shares actually will be when issued
in the merger or the prices at which Cardinal Health common shares will trade or
otherwise be transferable at any time. Salomon Smith Barney did not make and was
not provided with an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or
liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of Syncor or Cardinal Health, and Salomon
Smith Barney did not make any physical inspection of the properties or assets of
Syncor or Cardinal Health.

     In connection with its engagement, and at Syncor's request, Salomon Smith
Barney held preliminary discussions with selected third parties regarding the
acquisition of Syncor. Salomon Smith Barney's opinion does not address the
relative merits of the merger as compared to any alternative business strategies
that might exist for Syncor or the effect of any other transaction in which
Syncor might engage. Salomon Smith Barney's opinion was necessarily based on
information available, and financial, stock market and other conditions and
circumstances existing and disclosed to Salomon Smith Barney, as of the date of
its opinion. Although Salomon Smith Barney evaluated the exchange ratio from a
financial point of view, Salomon Smith Barney was not asked to and did not
recommend the specific consideration payable in the merger, which was determined
through negotiations between Syncor and Cardinal Health. Syncor imposed no other
instructions or limitations on Salomon Smith Barney with respect to the
investigations made or procedures followed by Salomon Smith Barney in rendering
its opinion.

     THE FULL TEXT OF SALOMON SMITH BARNEY'S WRITTEN OPINION DATED JUNE 14,
2002, WHICH DESCRIBES THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE, MATTERS CONSIDERED AND LIMITATIONS
ON THE REVIEW UNDERTAKEN, IS INCLUDED AS ANNEX B TO THIS PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS AND IS INCORPORATED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS BY
REFERENCE. SALOMON SMITH BARNEY'S OPINION IS DIRECTED TO THE SYNCOR BOARD OF
DIRECTORS AND RELATES ONLY TO THE FAIRNESS OF THE EXCHANGE RATIO FROM A
FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW, DOES NOT ADDRESS ANY OTHER ASPECT OF THE MERGER OR ANY
RELATED TRANSACTION AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION TO ANY SYNCOR
STOCKHOLDER WITH RESPECT TO ANY MATTERS RELATING TO THE PROPOSED MERGER.

     In preparing its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney performed a variety of
financial and comparative analyses, including those described below. The summary
of these analyses is not a complete description of the analyses underlying
Salomon Smith Barney's opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a
complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most
appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of
those methods to the particular circumstances, and, therefore, a fairness
opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description. Accordingly, Salomon
Smith Barney believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that
selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on information
presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the
narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete
view of the processes underlying its analyses and opinion.

     In its analyses, Salomon Smith Barney considered industry performance,
general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters
existing as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond the control of
Syncor and Cardinal Health. No company, business or transaction used in those
analyses as a comparison is identical to Syncor, Cardinal Health or the proposed
merger, and an evaluation of those analyses is not entirely mathematical.
Rather, the analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning
financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the
acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies or business
segments analyzed.

     The estimates contained in Salomon Smith Barney's analyses and the
valuation ranges resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily
indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may
be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by its analyses. In
addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses or securities do not
necessarily purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at

which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, Salomon Smith
Barney's analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial
uncertainty.

     Salomon Smith Barney's opinion and analyses were only one of many factors
considered by the Syncor board of directors in its evaluation of the merger, and
should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Syncor board of
directors or Syncor's management with respect to the exchange ratio or the
proposed merger.

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by
Salomon Smith Barney in connection with the rendering of its opinion dated June
14, 2002. THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES SUMMARIZED BELOW INCLUDE INFORMATION PRESENTED
IN TABULAR FORMAT. IN ORDER TO FULLY UNDERSTAND SALOMON SMITH BARNEY'S FINANCIAL
ANALYSES, THE TABLES MUST BE READ TOGETHER WITH THE TEXT OF EACH SUMMARY. THE
TABLES ALONE DO NOT CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES.
CONSIDERING THE DATA IN THE TABLES BELOW WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE FULL NARRATIVE
DESCRIPTION OF THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES, INCLUDING THE METHODOLOGIES AND
ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE ANALYSES, COULD CREATE A MISLEADING OR INCOMPLETE
VIEW OF SALOMON SMITH BARNEY'S FINANCIAL ANALYSES. Internal estimates of
Syncor's management used in the analyses described below exclude Syncor's wholly
owned subsidiary, CMI, which Syncor has publicly announced it intends to sell,
and assumes that the after-tax net proceeds of that sale will be used, together
with cash on hand, to repay Syncor's total debt outstanding as of March 31,
2002.

     Selected Companies Analysis.  Salomon Smith Barney compared financial,
operating and stock market data of Syncor to corresponding financial, operating
and stock market data of Cardinal Health and the following six publicly traded
companies in the broad-based distributors and medical/surgical distributors
sectors of the health care industry:

       BROAD-BASED DISTRIBUTORS              MEDICAL/SURGICAL DISTRIBUTORS
       ------------------------              -----------------------------

- - AmeriSourceBergen Corporation         - Fisher Scientific International Inc.
- - D&K Healthcare Resource, Inc.         - Henry Schein, Inc.
- - McKesson Corporation                  - Owens & Minor, Inc.

     Salomon Smith Barney also compared financial, operating and stock market
data of the three publicly traded companies listed above in the broad-based
distributors sector to corresponding financial, operating and stock market data
of Cardinal Health. The selected companies that were reviewed distinctly for
Syncor are referred to as the Syncor selected companies and the selected
companies that were reviewed distinctly for Cardinal Health are referred to as
the Cardinal Health selected companies.

     Salomon Smith Barney reviewed firm values, calculated as equity value, plus
debt, minority interest and preferred stock, less cash and cash equivalents, as
a multiple of latest 12 months' and estimated calendar year 2002 revenue and as
a multiple of latest 12 months' and estimated calendar years 2002 and 2003
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, commonly known
as EBITDA. Salomon Smith Barney reviewed equity values as a multiple of Syncor's
latest 12 months' and estimated calendar years 2002 and 2003 net income.
Estimated financial data for Syncor were based on internal estimates of Syncor's
management and estimated financial data for Cardinal Health were based on
publicly available research analysts' estimates and discussions with Cardinal
Health's management. Estimated financial data for the selected companies were
based on publicly available research analysts' estimates. All multiples were
based on per share closing stock prices on June 12, 2002. Salomon Smith Barney
applied a range of selected multiples derived from the financial data described
above for the Syncor selected companies to corresponding financial data of
Syncor, and applied a range of selected multiples derived from the Cardinal
Health selected companies to corresponding financial data of Cardinal Health, in
order to derive implied equity reference ranges for Syncor and Cardinal Health.
This analysis indicated the following implied per share equity reference range
for Syncor, as compared to the per share equity value of Syncor implied by the
exchange ratio provided for in the merger based on the per share closing price
of Cardinal Health common shares on June 12, 2002:

        IMPLIED PER SHARE EQUITY                PER SHARE EQUITY VALUE FOR SYNCOR
       REFERENCE RANGE FOR SYNCOR                   IMPLIED BY EXCHANGE RATIO
       --------------------------               ---------------------------------

             $27.00 - $35.00                                 $32.24

     This analysis also indicated an implied per share equity reference range
for Cardinal Health of approximately $58.00 to $65.00, as compared to the per
share closing price of Cardinal Health common shares on June 12, 2002 of $62.00.
The implied per share equity reference ranges for Syncor and Cardinal Health
were then used to calculate an implied exchange ratio range of approximately
0.415x to 0.603x, as compared to the exchange ratio in the merger of 0.52x.

     Discounted Share Price Analysis.  Salomon Smith Barney reviewed Syncor's
and Cardinal Health's calendar year estimated 2005 earnings per share, commonly
referred to as EPS, and derived implied hypothetical future share prices for
Syncor and Cardinal Health by applying to their calendar year estimated 2005 EPS
one-year forward EPS multiples ranging from 16.5x to 22.0x in the case of Syncor
and 20.0x to 23.5x in the case of Cardinal Health. Estimated financial data for
Syncor were based on internal estimates of Syncor's management and estimated
financial data for Cardinal Health were based on publicly available research
analysts' estimates and discussions with Cardinal Health's management. These
hypothetical future share prices then were discounted to present value using
discount rates based on Syncor's and Cardinal Health's cost of equity. This
analysis indicated the following implied per share equity reference range for
Syncor, as compared to the per share equity value of Syncor implied by the
exchange ratio provided for in the merger based on the per share closing price
of Cardinal Health common shares on June 12, 2002:

        IMPLIED PER SHARE EQUITY                PER SHARE EQUITY VALUE FOR SYNCOR
       REFERENCE RANGE FOR SYNCOR                   IMPLIED BY EXCHANGE RATIO
       --------------------------               ---------------------------------

             $31.25 - $43.50                                 $32.24

     This analysis also indicated an implied per share equity reference range
for Cardinal Health of approximately $73.25 to $88.50, as compared to the per
share closing price of Cardinal Health common shares on June 12, 2002 of $62.00.
The implied per share equity reference ranges for Syncor and Cardinal Health
were then used to calculate an implied exchange ratio range of approximately
0.353x to 0.594x, as compared to the exchange ratio in the merger of 0.52x.

     Precedent Transactions Analysis.  Salomon Smith Barney reviewed the
aggregate transaction values and implied transaction multiples in the following
eight selected merger and acquisition transactions in the health care industry
completed since July 1992:

            ACQUIROR                             TARGET
            --------                             ------

- - AmeriSource Health Corporation  - Bergen Brunswig Corporation
- - Cardinal Health, Inc.           - Bindley Western Industries, Inc.
- - AmeriSource Health Corporation  - C.D. Smith Healthcare, Inc.
- - AmeriSource Health Corporation  - Walker Drug Company
- - McKesson Corporation            - FoxMeyer Corporation
- - Cardinal Health, Inc.           - Medicine Shoppe International, Inc.
- - Cardinal Distribution, Inc.     - Whitmire Distribution Corp.
- - Bergen Brunswig Corporation     - Durr-Fillauer Medical, Inc.

     Salomon Smith Barney compared firm values in the selected transactions as
multiples of latest 12 months' revenue and EBITDA. Salomon Smith Barney compared
equity values in the selected transactions as a multiple of latest 12 months'
and one-year forward net income. Estimated financial data for Syncor were based
on internal estimates of Syncor's management. All multiples for the selected
transactions were based on publicly available information at the time of
announcement of the relevant selected transaction. Salomon Smith Barney applied
a range of selected multiples derived from the financial data described above
for the selected transactions to corresponding financial data of Syncor in order
to derive the following implied per share equity reference range for Syncor, as
compared to the per share equity value of Syncor implied by the

exchange ratio provided for in the merger based on the per share closing price
of Cardinal Health common shares on June 12, 2002:

        IMPLIED PER SHARE EQUITY                PER SHARE EQUITY VALUE FOR SYNCOR
       REFERENCE RANGE FOR SYNCOR                   IMPLIED BY EXCHANGE RATIO
       --------------------------               ---------------------------------

             $30.00 - $39.00                                 $32.24

     The implied per share equity reference range for Syncor was then used,
together with the implied per share equity reference range derived for Cardinal
Health from the selected companies analysis described above, to calculate an
implied exchange ratio range of approximately 0.462x to 0.672x, as compared to
the exchange ratio in the merger of 0.52x.

     Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.  Salomon Smith Barney calculated the
estimated present value of the stand-alone, unlevered, after-tax free cash flows
that Syncor could produce for the third and fourth calendar quarters of 2002 and
for calendar years 2003 to 2005. Salomon Smith Barney also calculated the
estimated present value of the stand-alone, unlevered, after-tax free cash flows
that Cardinal Health could produce for fiscal years 2003 to 2006. Estimated
financial data for Syncor were based on internal estimates of Syncor's
management and estimated financial data for Cardinal Health were based on
publicly available research analysts' estimates and discussions with Cardinal
Health's management. Salomon Smith Barney calculated a range of estimated
terminal values for Syncor and Cardinal Health by applying, in the case of
Syncor, a range of terminal EBITDA multiples of 7.4x to 10.4x to Syncor's
calendar year 2005 estimated EBITDA and, in the case of Cardinal Health, a range
of terminal EBITDA multiples of 11.5x to 12.5x to Cardinal Health's fiscal year
2006 estimated EBITDA. The estimated free cash flows and terminal values for
each of Syncor and Cardinal Health then were discounted to present value using
discount rates ranging from 8.0% to 11.0% in the case of Syncor and 8.5% to 9.5%
in the case of Cardinal Health. This analysis indicated the following implied
per share equity reference range for Syncor, as compared to the per share equity
value of Syncor implied by the exchange ratio provided for in the merger based
on the per share closing price of Cardinal Health common shares on June 12,
2002:

        IMPLIED PER SHARE EQUITY                PER SHARE EQUITY VALUE FOR SYNCOR
       REFERENCE RANGE FOR SYNCOR                   IMPLIED BY EXCHANGE RATIO
       --------------------------               ---------------------------------

             $32.00 - $45.25                                 $32.24

     This analysis also indicated an implied per share equity reference range
for Cardinal Health of between $82.75 to $92.00, as compared to the per share
closing price of Cardinal Health common shares on June 12, 2002 of $62.00. The
implied per share equity reference ranges for Syncor and Cardinal Health were
then used to calculate an implied exchange ratio range of approximately 0.348x
to 0.547x, as compared to the exchange ratio in the merger of 0.52x.

     Other Factors.  In the course of preparing its opinion, Salomon Smith
Barney also reviewed and considered other information and data, including:

     - trading characteristics and stock price performance of Syncor common
       stock, Cardinal Health common shares and the common stock of selected
       companies in the health care industry, including the volume of Syncor
       common stock traded at various stock prices and a comparison of price to
       earnings growth and forward year price to earnings multiples;

     - implied multiples for Syncor common stock both on a stand-alone basis and
       in the merger based on various operational and financial metrics;

     - historical daily ratios of shares of Syncor common stock to Cardinal
       Health common shares over various periods prior to June 12, 2002;

     - the potential pro forma effect of the merger on Cardinal Health's
       earnings per common share, without taking into account potential cost
       savings or other synergies from the merger, for the latest 12 months and
       as estimated for fiscal years 2002 through 2004;

     - publicly available research analysts' reports for Cardinal Health common
       shares; and

     - premiums paid one day and four weeks prior to public announcement of
       selected precedent transactions since 1994 and the market value of the
       target companies involved in those transactions as a percentage of the
       acquiror's market value.

MISCELLANEOUS

     Under the terms of its engagement, Syncor has agreed to pay Salomon Smith
Barney for its financial advisory services upon completion of the merger an
aggregate fee based on a percentage of the total consideration, including
liabilities assumed, payable in the merger, which fee is estimated to be
approximately $5.6 million. Syncor also has agreed to reimburse Salomon Smith
Barney for reasonable travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
Salomon Smith Barney in performing its services, including the reasonable fees
and expenses of its legal counsel, and to indemnify Salomon Smith Barney and
related persons against liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S.
federal securities laws, arising out of its engagement.

     Salomon Smith Barney and its affiliates in the past have provided, and
currently are providing, services to Syncor unrelated to the proposed merger,
for which services Salomon Smith Barney and its affiliates have received, and
expect to receive, compensation. Salomon Smith Barney and its affiliates also in
the past have provided, and may in the future provide, services to Cardinal
Health unrelated to the proposed merger, for which services Salomon Smith Barney
and its affiliates have received, and may receive, compensation. In the ordinary
course of business, Salomon Smith Barney and its affiliates may actively trade
or hold the securities of Syncor and Cardinal Health for their own account or
for the account of customers, and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or
short position in those securities. In addition, Salomon Smith Barney and its
affiliates, including Citigroup Inc. and its affiliates, may maintain
relationships with Syncor, Cardinal Health and their affiliates.

     Salomon Smith Barney is an internationally recognized investment banking
firm, and was selected by Syncor based on its reputation, experience and
familiarity with Syncor and its business. Salomon Smith Barney regularly engages
in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers
and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and
valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes.

INTERESTS OF SYNCOR'S DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS IN THE MERGER

     Certain members of the Syncor board of directors and certain of Syncor's
executive officers may be deemed to have interests in the merger that are
different from, or are in addition to, the interests of Syncor stockholders
generally. The Syncor board of directors was aware of these interests and
considered them, among other matters, in approving the merger agreement.

     Severance Arrangements.  On August 24, 2001, Syncor entered into severance
agreements with each of the following executive officers: Monty Fu, Robert G.
Funari, Rodney E. Boone, Jack L. Coffey, Sheila H. Coop, William P. Forster and
Lewis W. Terry. If the executive's employment under these severance agreements
is terminated by Syncor without "cause" or by the executive for "good reason"
within 24 months following a "change in control," the executive will be entitled
to receive a cash payment equal to a stated multiplier times (1) the executive's
annual salary plus (2) the greater of the executive's average annual bonus for
the past three years and the executive's target bonus for the year in which
employment terminates. The relevant multiplier is three for Messrs. Fu and
Funari, 2.25 for Mr. Boone, and two for Ms. Coop and each of Messrs. Coffey,
Forster and Terry. In addition, Syncor will pay the executive a lump-sum payment
equal to the incremental pension benefit the executive would have earned if the
executive had remained employed for a period of years equal to the applicable
multiplier and, if applicable, the amount necessary to offset the effect of any
"golden parachute" excise tax. The completion of the merger will constitute a
"change in control" for purposes of the severance agreements. The severance
agreements also provide for continuation of medical and other benefits for a
period of years corresponding to each executive's multiplier.

     In addition, on August 24, 2001, Syncor entered into severance agreements
with John S. Baumann and Haig Bagerdjian on identical terms to those described
in the immediately preceding paragraph. The relevant multiplier is 2.25 for Mr.
Bagerdjian and two for Mr. Baumann. Pursuant to the Severance and Release

Agreements by and between Syncor and Mr. Bagerdjian, dated January 31, 2002, and
Mr. Baumann, dated May 10, 2002, any termination of employment by either
executive following a "change in control" (including the merger) will be deemed
to be for "good reason," entitling the executive to his benefits under his
August 24, 2001 severance agreement.

     If the employment of Messrs. Fu, Funari, Boone, Coffey, Forster, Terry,
Bagerdjian, Baumann or Ms. Coop is terminated following the merger under
circumstances entitling the executive to benefits under the severance
agreements, the approximate amount of cash severance and retirement payment
benefits that would be paid under the severance agreements to these executive
officers, in the aggregate, is not expected to exceed $12 million, based on
currently available information, although the cost to the combined company of
making these payments would be higher.

     On April 1, 2002, Syncor entered into a Severance and Release Agreement
with Mr. David L. Ward, Executive Vice President of Syncor and President and
Chief Executive Officer of CMI. Syncor entered into the severance and release
agreement with Mr. Ward in order to induce him to remain as President and Chief
Executive Officer of CMI until January 1, 2003, unless Syncor and Mr. Ward agree
to an alternate date. In addition, if CMI is sold to a third party prior to that
time, Mr. Ward's active employment will be terminated on the completion of the
sale. Under the severance and release agreement, Mr. Ward will continue to
receive his annual base salary of $285,000 until the end of his active
employment period, and for a period of 27 months thereafter. Following the
termination of his active employment, he will be entitled to receive a bonus
payment of $240,469, plus an additional bonus payment of $500,000 if the Syncor
board of directors determines that Mr. Ward has acted in the best interest of
Syncor throughout his active employment.

     Equity-Based Awards.  Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding
option to acquire shares of Syncor common stock under Syncor's equity plans will
be converted into an option to acquire Cardinal Health common shares as provided
in the merger agreement. See "The Merger Agreement -- Conversion of Securities."
Syncor options held by Syncor's executive officers and directors under the
various equity plans sponsored by Syncor that were granted prior to the date of
the merger agreement will vest upon Syncor stockholder approval of the merger
agreement. The aggregate number of unvested Syncor options to acquire shares of
Syncor common stock held by Messrs. Fu, Funari, Boone, Coffey, Forster, Terry,
Ward, Bagerdjian, Baumann and Ms. Coop is 963,994. The aggregate number of
unvested Syncor options to acquire shares of Syncor common stock held by
Syncor's non-employee directors is 72,470. In addition, on June 13, 2002, the
compensation committee and the Syncor board of directors approved an amendment
to Syncor's Executive Long-Term Performance Equity Plan to remove any
limitations on acceleration of vesting of Syncor options upon a change in
control (including the merger) to the extent these limitations on acceleration
relate to "golden parachute" excise tax rules.

     Indemnification; Insurance.  Each of Syncor's non-employee directors and
executive officers is party to an indemnity agreement with Syncor, the form of
which was approved by Syncor stockholders on June 20, 1995. The indemnity
agreements provide the relevant director or executive officers with
indemnification for the duties performed for Syncor or its subsidiaries and
affiliates. In the merger agreement, Cardinal Health has agreed to cause Syncor,
as the surviving corporation, to honor these indemnity agreements following the
completion of the merger. In addition, Cardinal Health has agreed to cause
Syncor, as the surviving corporation, to indemnify all of Syncor's current and
former directors and officers for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
completion of the merger to the extent the indemnification is provided under
Syncor's certificate of incorporation and by-laws, in each case, as amended and
restated. For six years after completion of the merger, Cardinal Health has
agreed to provide directors' and officers' liability insurance covering acts or
omissions of Syncor's officers and directors occurring at or prior to the
closing of the merger, with substantially the same coverage, terms and
conditions as currently provided (subject to a cap on annual premiums for the
insurance equal to 200% of the amount disclosed to Cardinal Health).

     Other Arrangements.  In January 1999, Syncor entered into a split dollar
arrangement with Monty Fu and a trust for the benefit of Mr. Fu's children, by
which Mr. Fu relinquished all his then-current and future interests in Syncor's
Deferred Compensation Plan in exchange for Syncor's agreement to pay the
premiums on a life insurance policy insuring Mr. Fu and his wife and owned by
the trust. The split dollar arrangement

provides that, upon a change in control of Syncor (including the merger), the
trust can elect: (1) to terminate the split dollar arrangement, in which case
the trust would not be obligated to repay the $1,639,985 in premiums paid to
date by Syncor, or (2) to accelerate Syncor's payment obligations, in which case
Syncor immediately would pay the remaining $1,226,473 in premiums to the
insurance company. In the absence of an election by the trust, the split dollar
arrangement will continue without modification. If the trust elects the second
option, in January 2015, the trust still would be required to repay Syncor
$2,866,458 representing the total amount of premiums paid by Syncor.

     In recognition of the extraordinary work and effort required in connection
with their service on the ad-hoc committee of independent directors, on October
8, 2001, the Syncor board of directors authorized additional payments of $15,000
each to Dr. Steven B. Gerber and Messrs. George S. Oki and Arnold E. Spangler,
as members of the ad-hoc committee of independent directors and $25,000 to Mr.
Bernard Puckett, chairman of the ad-hoc committee of independent directors.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE TRANSACTIONS

     The merger will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Under this
method, the total consideration paid, including expenses, in the merger will be
allocated among Syncor's consolidated assets and liabilities based on their fair
values, and any excess of the purchase price over the estimated net fair value
would be recorded as goodwill by Cardinal Health. Syncor's operating results
will be consolidated with Cardinal Health's operating results beginning on the
date that the merger is effective.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Under Delaware law, Syncor stockholders are not entitled to appraisal
rights in connection with the merger.

REGULATORY APPROVALS

     Under the HSR Act and the FTC's rules, the merger may not be completed,
unless certain filings have been submitted to the Antitrust Division and the FTC
and the applicable waiting period has expired or been earlier terminated by the
Antitrust Division and the FTC. Syncor and Cardinal Health submitted the
required filings to the Antitrust Division and the FTC, and the applicable
waiting period will expire at 11:59 p.m. on July 31, 2002.

     However, prior to that time, the Antitrust Division or the FTC may extend
the waiting period by requesting additional information or documentary material
relevant to the merger from Cardinal Health or Syncor. If a request is made, the
waiting period will be extended until 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the
30th day after substantial compliance by Cardinal Health and Syncor with the
request. Thereafter, the waiting period can be extended only by court order or
by agreement of the parties to the merger agreement.

     The Antitrust Division and the FTC frequently scrutinize the legality under
the antitrust laws of transactions such as the merger. At any time before or
after the completion of the merger, the Antitrust Division or the FTC could take
action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public
interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking
the divestiture of substantial assets of Syncor or Cardinal Health. Private
parties and state attorneys general also may bring legal action under U.S.
federal or state antitrust laws under some circumstances. Based upon an
examination of information available relating to the businesses in which Syncor
and Cardinal Health are engaged, Syncor and Cardinal Health believe that the
completion of the merger will not violate the antitrust laws. There can be no
assurance, however, that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not
be made, or, if such a challenge is made, what the result will be. See "Risk
Factors -- Antitrust and competition authorities in various jurisdictions may
attempt to delay or prevent the merger or may require divestitures."

     Syncor and Cardinal Health conduct operations in a number of other
jurisdictions where regulatory filings or approvals may be required in
connection with the merger. Notification will be made with the applicable

Brazilian regulatory agency. No waiting periods or approvals are required prior
to completion of the merger under Brazilian law.

     Cardinal Health will file an application for approval of Cardinal Health
common shares to be issued in the merger for listing on the New York Stock
Exchange.

     In connection with the merger, Cardinal Health may be required to give
notifications to and/or receive consents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, state nuclear regulatory
agencies, state boards of pharmacy and other governmental agencies under
numerous licenses and permits held by Syncor and its subsidiaries. Although we
do not expect that obtaining any required consents from these agencies will
prevent us from completing the merger, we cannot be certain that we will obtain
all required regulatory clearances.

     Other than as described in this proxy statement/prospectus, Cardinal Health
and Syncor believe that the merger does not require the approval of any U.S.
federal or state or foreign agency. We will, however, be required to make
certain filings with U.S. federal and state governmental authorities to complete
the merger.

FEDERAL SECURITIES LAW CONSEQUENCES

     All Cardinal Health common shares issued in connection with the merger will
be freely transferable, except that any Cardinal Health common shares received
in the merger by persons that are deemed to be affiliates (as the term is
defined under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which we refer to as the
Securities Act) of Cardinal Health or Syncor prior to the merger may be sold by
them only in transactions permitted by the resale provisions of Rule 145 under
the Securities Act, or Rule 144 under the Securities Act with respect to persons
that are or become affiliates of Cardinal Health, or as otherwise permitted
under the Securities Act. Persons that may be deemed to be affiliates of
Cardinal Health or Syncor generally include individuals or entities that
control, are controlled by or are under common control with, Cardinal Health or
Syncor, as the case may be, and generally include the executive officers and
directors of the companies as well as their principal stockholders.

     Affiliates of Syncor may not sell their Cardinal Health common shares
acquired in connection with the merger, except pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act covering the Cardinal Health
common shares or in compliance with Rule 145 under the Securities Act (or Rule
144, for affiliates of Syncor that become affiliates of Cardinal Health) or
another applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act. In general, Rule 145 provides that, for one year following
completion of the merger, an affiliate (together with certain related persons)
would be entitled to sell Cardinal Health common shares acquired in connection
with the merger only through unsolicited "broker transactions" or in
transactions directly with a "market maker" (as these terms are defined in Rule
144). Additionally, the number of Cardinal Health common shares to be sold by an
affiliate (together with certain related persons and certain persons acting in
concert) within any three-month period for purposes of Rule 145 may not exceed
the greater of 1% of outstanding Cardinal Health common shares or the average
weekly trading volume of Cardinal Health common shares during the four calendar
weeks preceding the sale. Rule 145 will remain available to affiliates if
Cardinal Health remains current with its informational filings with the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which we refer to as the
Exchange Act. One year after the merger, an affiliate will be able to sell its
Cardinal Health common shares without being subject to the manner of sale or
volume limitations, provided that Cardinal Health is current with its
informational filings under the Exchange Act and the affiliate is not then an
affiliate of Cardinal Health. Two years after the effective time of the merger,
an affiliate will be able to sell its Cardinal Health common shares without any
restrictions so long as the affiliate had not been an affiliate of Cardinal
Health for at least three months prior to the date of the sale.

     Under the letters to be entered into with the affiliates of Syncor,
Cardinal Health will agree that, for so long as any affiliate agreeing to an
affiliate letter holds any Cardinal Health common shares as to which the
affiliate is subject to the limitations of Rule 145, Cardinal Health will use
its reasonable efforts to file all reports required to be filed by it pursuant
to the Exchange Act so as to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c) of Rule
144 that there be available current public information with respect to Cardinal
Health, and to that extent to make available to the affiliate the exemption
afforded by Rule 145 with respect to the sale, transfer or other disposition of
Cardinal Health common shares.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The following is a summary of material provisions of the merger agreement,
a copy of which is included as Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus. This
summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, which
is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus.

THE MERGER

     The merger agreement provides that, at the effective time of the merger and
subject to the requisite approval of Syncor stockholders and the satisfaction or
waiver of other conditions to the merger, Mudhen Merger Corp. will be merged
with and into Syncor, with the result that Syncor, as the surviving corporation,
will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Cardinal Health. See "-- Conditions to the
Obligations of Syncor;  -- Conditions to the Obligations of Cardinal Health and
Mudhen Merger Corp." The merger will become effective upon the filing of a duly
executed certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such
later time as agreed upon by Cardinal Health and Syncor and specified in the
certificate of merger. This filing will be made as promptly as possible
following the closing of the merger, which will occur as soon as practicable
(but in any event within three business days) following the date upon which all
conditions set forth in the merger agreement have been satisfied or waived, or
such other time or date as agreed to by the parties to the merger agreement.

CHARTER, BY-LAWS, DIRECTORS, AND OFFICERS

     The surviving corporation's certificate of incorporation, as in effect
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, will be amended as of the
effective time of the merger so as to contain only the provisions contained
immediately prior thereto in Mudhen Merger Corp.'s certificate of incorporation
(except for Article I of Mudhen Merger Corp.'s certificate of incorporation,
which will continue to read "The name of the corporation is 'SYNCOR
INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION') and Mudhen Merger Corp.'s by-laws in effect
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be the surviving
corporation's by-laws, in each case until amended in accordance with the DGCL.
From and after the effective time of the merger, Syncor officers will be the
officers of the surviving corporation and Mudhen Merger Corp.'s directors will
be the directors of the surviving corporation, in each case, until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified. On or prior to the closing
date of the merger, Syncor will deliver to Cardinal Health evidence satisfactory
to Cardinal Health of the resignations of Syncor directors, the Syncor
resignations to be effective as of the effective time of the merger.

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

     At the effective time of the merger, each share of Syncor common stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger
will be converted into the right to receive 0.52, the exchange ratio, of a
Cardinal Health common share. Each share of Syncor capital stock held in the
treasury of Syncor will be cancelled and retired and no payment will be made in
respect of these shares of Syncor capital stock. No certificates for fractional
Cardinal Health common shares will be issued in the merger, and these fractional
share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or have any rights of
a Cardinal Health shareholder. To the extent that an outstanding share of Syncor
common stock would otherwise have become a fractional Cardinal Health common
share, the holder will be entitled to receive a cash payment therefor in an
amount equal to the stockholder's proportionate interest in the net proceeds
from the sale in the open market of the aggregate fractional Cardinal Health
common shares, less commissions, stock transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket
transaction costs incurred in connection with the sale.

     Prior to the effective time of the merger, Cardinal Health and Syncor will
take all necessary actions to cause each unexpired and unexercised outstanding
option granted or issued under Syncor's stock option or equity-incentive plans
to be automatically converted at the effective time of the merger into a
fully-vested option to purchase that number of Cardinal Health common shares
equal to the number of shares of Syncor common stock subject to the Syncor
option immediately prior to the effective time of the merger multiplied by the
exchange ratio (and rounded to the nearest share), with an exercise price per
share equal to the exercise

price per share of the Syncor option divided by the exchange ratio (and rounded
to the nearest whole cent), and with other terms and conditions that are the
same as the terms and conditions of the Syncor option immediately before the
effective time of the merger. Adjustments may be made, as necessary, to preserve
the tax treatment of incentive stock options. Syncor options granted by Syncor
between June 14, 2002, and the completion of the merger will not vest and will
be converted into unvested options to purchase Cardinal Health common shares as
described above. These Cardinal Health options will vest pursuant to the terms
of the Syncor options as in effect at the time of the merger.

     Each share of Mudhen Merger Corp. common stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be converted into one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
surviving corporation, such that those newly issued shares thereafter will
constitute all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Syncor as the
surviving corporation.

EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

     As soon as practicable after the effective time of the merger, a notice of
merger and a letter of transmittal will be mailed to each holder of record of a
Syncor stock certificate that immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger represented outstanding shares of Syncor common stock whose shares were
converted into the right to receive Cardinal Health common shares. The
transmittal letter will be accompanied by instructions specifying other details
of the exchange, and it must be used in forwarding Syncor stock certificates for
surrender in exchange for Cardinal Health share certificates to which a Syncor
stockholder prior to the effective time of the merger has become entitled and,
if applicable, cash in lieu of any fractional Cardinal Health common share.
After receipt of the transmittal letter, each holder of Syncor stock
certificates should surrender the Syncor stock certificates to EquiServe Trust
Company or another financial institution as may be designated by Cardinal Health
as the exchange agent for the merger, pursuant to and in accordance with the
instructions accompanying the letter of transmittal, and each Syncor stockholder
will receive in exchange therefor a certificate evidencing the whole number of
Cardinal Health common shares to which that Syncor stockholder is entitled and a
check representing the amount of cash payable in lieu of any fractional Cardinal
Health common share and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, which that
Syncor stockholder has the right to receive pursuant to the merger agreement,
after giving effect to any required withholding tax.

     After the effective time of the merger, each Syncor stock certificate,
until so surrendered and exchanged, will be deemed, for all purposes, to
represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, a certificate representing
Cardinal Health common shares and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and
unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, as provided above. The holder of
such Syncor stock certificates will not be entitled to receive any dividends or
other distributions declared or made by Cardinal Health having a record date
after the effective time of the merger until the Syncor stock certificates are
surrendered. Subject to applicable law, upon surrender of Syncor stock
certificates, the dividends and distributions, if any, will be paid without
interest and less the amount of any withholding taxes that may be required
thereon.

     Syncor stock certificates surrendered for exchange by any person who is an
"affiliate" of Syncor for purposes of Rule 145(c) will not be exchanged until
Cardinal Health has received an executed "affiliate letter" from that person as
prescribed under the merger agreement.

     Each of Cardinal Health, Mudhen Merger Corp. and Syncor have agreed to:

     -  make or cause to be made the filings required of that party to the
        merger agreement or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates under the HSR
        Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger
        agreement as promptly as practicable, and in any event, the initial
        filing with respect to the merger agreement will be made within ten
        business days after the date of the merger agreement;

     -  comply at the earliest practicable date with any request under the HSR
        Act for additional information, documents, or other materials received

        the Antitrust Division or the FTC or any other governmental authority in
        respect of those filings or those transactions; and

     -  act in good faith and reasonably cooperate with the other party in
        connection with any filing (including, with respect to the party making
        a filing, providing copies of all documents to the non-filing party and
        its advisors reasonably prior to filing, and, if requested, to accept
        all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection
        with the filing) and in connection with resolving any investigation or
        other inquiry of any agency or other governmental authority under any
        antitrust laws with respect to any filing or any transaction.

To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, each party to the merger
agreement has agreed to use all reasonable best efforts to furnish to the other
party all information required for any application or other filing to be made
pursuant to any applicable law in connection with the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Each party to the merger
agreement will give the other parties to the merger agreement reasonable prior
notice of any communication with, and any proposed understanding, undertaking,
or agreement with, any governmental authority regarding any filings or any
transaction. None of the parties to the merger agreement will independently
participate in any meeting, or engage in any substantive conversation, with any
governmental authority in respect of any filings, investigation, or other
inquiry without giving the other parties to the merger agreement prior notice of
the meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by such governmental
authority, the opportunity to attend and/or participate. The parties to the
merger agreement will consult and cooperate with one another, in connection with
any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party to the merger
agreement in connection with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or
other antitrust laws.

     Each of Cardinal Health and Syncor has agreed to use its reasonable best
efforts to resolve any objections as may be asserted by any governmental
authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the
Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other U.S. federal or state or
foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative or
judicial doctrines or other laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of
trade (collectively, antitrust laws). Each of Cardinal Health and Syncor have
agreed that, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by the merger agreement as inconsistent with or violative of
antitrust laws, it will (by negotiation, litigation or otherwise) cooperate and
use its reasonable best efforts vigorously to contest and resist any such action
or proceeding, including any legislative, administrative or judicial action, and
to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or

overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, delays
or restricts completion of the merger or any other transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement, including by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of
administrative and judicial appeal and all available legislative action, unless,
by mutual agreement, Cardinal Health and Syncor decide that litigation is not in
their respective best interests. Each of Cardinal Health and Syncor has agreed
to use its reasonable best efforts to take action as may be required to cause
the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other antitrust laws
as promptly as possible after the execution of the merger agreement.

     Each of the parties to the merger agreement has agreed to use reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to
be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties to the merger
agreement in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to complete and
make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including

     -  the obtaining of all other necessary actions or nonactions, waivers,
        consents, licenses, permits, authorizations, orders and approvals from
        governmental authorities and the making of all other necessary
        registrations and filings (including other filings with governmental
        authorities, if any),

     -  the obtaining of all consents, approvals or waivers from third parties
        related to or required in connection with the merger that are necessary
        to complete the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger
        agreement or required to prevent a material adverse effect on Cardinal
        Health or Syncor from occurring prior to or after the effective time of
        the merger,

     -  the preparation of the proxy statement and the registration statement,

     -  the execution and delivery of any additional instruments reasonably
        necessary to complete the transactions contemplated by, and to fully
        carry out the purposes of, the merger agreement, and

     -  the providing of all such information concerning that party, its
        subsidiaries, its affiliates and its subsidiaries' and affiliates'
        officers, directors, employees and partners as may be reasonably
        requested in connection with any of the matters set forth in this
        paragraph and the two preceding paragraphs.

     Cardinal Health and its subsidiaries have agreed, and, at the request of
Cardinal Health, Syncor and its subsidiaries will agree, to hold separate
(including by trust or otherwise) or to divest, dispose of, discontinue or
assign, all of which we refer to, collectively, as divestiture limitations, any
of their respective businesses, subsidiaries or assets, or to take or agree to
take any action with respect to (including, without limitation, to license or
sub-license or to renegotiate, in each case, on commercially reasonable terms
any arrangement or agreement regarding), or agree to any limitation on, any of
their respective businesses, subsidiaries or assets (or any interest in the
foregoing), which we refer to collectively as, limitations; provided that any
limitation is conditioned upon the completion of the merger and the failure of
the limitation, when taken together with any other limitations, to have, in the
aggregate, a "regulatory material adverse effect" (as defined below) on Cardinal
Health or a regulatory material adverse effect on Syncor. Syncor agrees and
acknowledges that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph,
neither Syncor nor any of its subsidiaries will, without Cardinal Health's prior
written consent, agree to any limitations or make or agree to make any cash
payments to any suppliers or customers of Cardinal Health or Syncor (or their
respective subsidiaries) in connection with its obligations under this
paragraph. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the merger agreement,
Cardinal Health and its subsidiaries are not required to agree to any
limitations (including making cash payments to suppliers or customers) with
respect to Cardinal Health and any of its subsidiaries and/or Syncor and any of
its subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected, in the aggregate, to have a
regulatory material adverse effect on Cardinal Health or a regulatory material
adverse effect on Syncor. For purposes of the merger agreement, the parties have
agreed that a "regulatory material adverse effect" will be deemed to have
occurred if there are limitations that deprive Cardinal Health of the ownership
or operation of, or the economic benefits (including the making of cash
payments) of owning or operating, assets, subsidiaries or businesses of Cardinal
Health and any of its subsidiaries and/or Syncor and any of its subsidiaries
that generated, in the aggregate, 2001 calendar year revenues equal to 8.25% or
more of the total 2001 calendar

year revenues of Syncor and its subsidiaries. Cardinal Health and Syncor further
agreed that Cardinal Health will not be required to agree to (1) divestiture
limitations that would deprive Cardinal Health of the ownership or operation of,
or the economic benefits of the owning or operating, assets or businesses that
generated, in the aggregate, 2001 calendar year revenues equal to or greater
than $58 million, or (2) any non-divestiture limitations the economic impact of
which, in the aggregate, would exceed $8 million.

TAX TREATMENT

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, Syncor and Cardinal Health are required
to use all reasonable best efforts to cause the merger to constitute a
"reorganization" (within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code) and to
cooperate with each other and provide documentation, information and materials
that are reasonably necessary, proper and advisable, including in obtaining an
opinion from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, counsel to Syncor to whom
Cardinal Health and Syncor will deliver representation letters to be relied upon
in rendering its opinion. See "-- Conditions to the Obligations of Each Party."

PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS

     Unless otherwise required by applicable law, the New York Stock Exchange or
The Nasdaq National Market (and, in that event, only if time does not permit),
Cardinal Health and Syncor will consult with each other before issuing any press
release with respect to the merger and will not issue any such press release
prior to consultation.

CONVEYANCE TAXES

     Cardinal Health, Mudhen Merger Corp. and Syncor have agreed to cooperate in
the preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding taxes or fees that become payable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and that
are required or permitted to be filed on or before the effective time of the
merger. All conveyance taxes are to be paid by the party bearing legal
responsibility for payment.

PREPARATION OF REGISTRATION STATEMENT

     Cardinal Health and Syncor have agreed to use all reasonable efforts to
prepare the proxy statement for filing with the SEC at the earliest practicable
time. The special meeting will be called for the earliest practicable date as
determined by Syncor in consultation with Cardinal Health. Cardinal Health will
prepare and file the registration statement with the SEC as soon as is
reasonably practicable following clearance of the proxy statement by the SEC,
and will use reasonable best efforts to have the registration statement declared
effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable and to maintain the
effectiveness of the registration statement through the effective time of the
merger. Syncor and Cardinal Health will use reasonable best efforts to clear the
proxy statement with the Staff of the SEC and to take other reasonable actions
under applicable state security laws. No filing of, or amendment or supplement
to, the registration statement or the proxy statement will be made by Cardinal
Health or Syncor without providing the other party with a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment thereon. Cardinal Health will advise Syncor, promptly
after it receives notice of the time when the registration statement becomes
effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any
stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Cardinal Health common
shares issuable in connection with the merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the proxy statement or
the registration statement or comments on the proxy statement or the
registration statement and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for
additional information.

     Syncor has agreed to promptly furnish Cardinal Health with all information
concerning it as may be required for inclusion in the proxy statement and the
registration statement, and to cooperate with Cardinal Health's preparation of
the proxy statement and the registration statement in a timely fashion, and to
use reasonable best efforts to assist Cardinal Health in having the registration
statement declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable consistent
with the timing for the special meeting as determined in consultation with
Cardinal Health. If, at any time prior to the effective time of the merger,
either party to the

merger agreement obtains knowledge of any information pertaining to that party
that would require any amendment or supplement to the registration statement or
the proxy statement, the party to the merger agreement will so advise the other
party and promptly furnish the other party with all information as required for
the amendment or supplement, and will promptly amend or supplement the
registration statement and/or proxy statement. Syncor will use reasonable best
efforts to cooperate with Cardinal Health in the preparation and filing of the
proxy statement, and, consistent with the timing for the special meeting, use
all reasonable efforts to mail the proxy statement at the earliest practicable
date to Syncor stockholders, which will include all information required under
applicable law to be furnished to Syncor stockholders in connection with the
merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and will
include the Syncor board of directors' recommendation to the extent not
previously withdrawn.

CONDUCT OF CARDINAL HEALTH'S OPERATIONS

     The merger agreement obligates Cardinal Health to conduct its operations in
the ordinary course until the effective time of the merger, except as expressly
contemplated by the merger agreement or as required by applicable law, and
obligates Cardinal Health and its subsidiaries to use their respective
reasonable best efforts to preserve their respective business organizations;
provided that Cardinal Health and its subsidiaries may take any action or omit
to take any action, to the extent permitted by the merger agreement, whether or
not the action or omission would be considered taken in the ordinary course.
Cardinal Health has agreed that it will not, and it will not permit its
subsidiaries to:

     - amend or propose to amend Cardinal Health's articles of incorporation, as
       amended and restated, to provide for the issuance of additional classes
       of Cardinal Health capital stock having superior rights to Cardinal
       Health common shares;

     - make any acquisition of securities, assets or businesses primarily
       involved in the industries in which Syncor operates or that supply the
       radiopharmacy businesses in which Syncor operates (whether by merger,
       consolidation, purchase or otherwise) that would reasonably be expected
       to cause a meaningful delay or impediment to the completion of the
       transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or might reasonably be
       expected to have a material adverse effect on Cardinal Health; or

     - agree, in writing or otherwise, to propose or take any of the foregoing
       actions.

INDEMNIFICATION; DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INSURANCE

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, Cardinal Health has agreed that, from and
after the effective time of the merger, Cardinal Health will cause the surviving
corporation to indemnify and hold harmless the present and former Syncor
officers and directors in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the effective time of the merger to the extent provided under Syncor's
certificate of incorporation or the by-laws or the indemnification agreements
between Syncor and Syncor's directors. In the merger agreement, Cardinal Health
also has agreed that it will or will cause the surviving corporation to obtain
and maintain in effect, for a period of six years after the effective time of
the merger, policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance up to a
certain agreed maximum insurance premium at no cost to the beneficiaries of the
insurance policies with respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the effective time of the merger, with substantially the same terms and
conditions as existing policies. Cardinal Health has also agreed to advance any
costs or expenses as incurred by present and former Syncor's officers and
directors to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. In addition, from
and after the effective time of the merger, Syncor officers or officers of its
subsidiaries who become Cardinal Health officers or officers of its subsidiaries
will be entitled to the same indemnity rights and protections as those afforded
to similarly situated Cardinal Health officers or officers of its subsidiaries.
Under this section of the merger agreement, Cardinal Health has agreed to
provide certain third-party beneficiary rights to the present and former Syncor
officers and directors.

MUDHEN MERGER CORP.

     Prior to the effective time of the merger, Mudhen Merger Corp. has agreed
not to conduct any business or make any investments other than as specifically
contemplated by the merger agreement and not to have any

assets (other than a de minimis amount of cash paid to Mudhen Merger Corp. for
the issuance of Mudhen Merger Corp. common stock to Cardinal Health) or any
material liabilities.

NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING

     Cardinal Health has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to cause
Cardinal Health common shares issuable pursuant to the merger or upon the
exercise of options to purchase Cardinal Health common shares that were
exchanged for options to purchase shares of Syncor common stock pursuant to the
merger agreement to be approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the effective time of the
merger.

EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

     With respect to employee benefit matters, the merger agreement provides
that Cardinal Health will use its reasonable best efforts to make Syncor
employees eligible to participate in Cardinal Health's employee benefit plans
not later than July 1, 2003. From the effective time of the merger until July 1,
2003, Cardinal Health will provide Syncor employees who remain employees of
Cardinal Health or Syncor with employee benefits (other than plans providing for
equity or equity-based compensation) that are not, in the aggregate, materially
less favorable than those provided to the Syncor employees prior to the merger.
Syncor employees who remain employees of Cardinal Health or Syncor will be
entitled to participate in Cardinal Health's equity and equity-based incentive
plans in accordance with their terms. Cardinal Health will give the Syncor
employees credit for service with Syncor under Cardinal Health's benefit plans
as described in the merger agreement. These provisions of the merger agreement
do not apply to Syncor employees covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Syncor agreed to take all actions necessary to terminate all open offering
periods under the Syncor International Corporation Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
which we refer to as the Syncor ESPP, as of a date no later than the end of its
last regularly occurring payroll period prior to the contemplated effective time
and to terminate the Syncor ESPP as of a date no later than immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger.

THE SPECIAL MEETING

     Syncor has agreed, subject to applicable law, to take all actions necessary
to convene and hold the special meeting, on the earliest practicable date
determined in consultation with Cardinal Health, to consider and vote upon
approval of the merger agreement. Syncor has agreed to take all lawful actions
to solicit the approval of the merger agreement by Syncor stockholders, has
agreed to recommend, through the Syncor board of directors, approval of the
merger agreement, and, except as permitted by the merger agreement, not to
withdraw, amend or modify the Syncor board of directors' recommendation in a
manner adverse to Cardinal Health. The merger agreement allows the Syncor board
of directors not to recommend that Syncor stockholders approve or withdraw or
modify the Syncor board of directors' recommendation adversely to Cardinal
Health if the Syncor board of directors believes in good faith, based upon the
advice of outside legal counsel, that the failure to withhold, withdraw or
modify its recommendation would reasonably be expected to cause a failure to
comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. Notwithstanding any
change in the Syncor board of directors' recommendation, Cardinal Health will
have the option, exercisable within 20 days of notice of the change, to
terminate the merger agreement pursuant to the provision described in clause (4)
under "-- Termination." See "-- Termination." Syncor is required to ensure that
the special meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that
all proxies solicited in connection with the special meeting are solicited, in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable law. Syncor has agreed
that its obligation to call, give notice of, convene and hold the special
meeting, as required by this paragraph, will not be affected by the withholding,
withdrawal or modification of the Syncor board of directors' recommendation nor
by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure, or communication to
Syncor of any "superior proposal" as set forth under "-- No Solicitation."

CONDUCT OF SYNCOR'S OPERATIONS

     The merger agreement obligates Syncor to conduct its operations in the
ordinary course and to use reasonable best efforts to maintain and preserve its
business organization and its material rights and franchises and to retain the
services of its officers and key employees and maintain relationships with
customers, suppliers, lessees, licensees and other third parties, and to
maintain all of its operating assets in their current condition (normal wear and
tear excepted), to the end that their goodwill and ongoing business will not be
impaired in any material respect. During the period from the date of the merger
agreement to the effective time of the merger or date of termination of the
merger agreement, Syncor has agreed that it will not, unless expressly
contemplated by the merger agreement, including Syncor's disclosure schedule, or
unless contrary to applicable laws, without the prior written consent of
Cardinal Health:

     - do or effect any of the following actions with respect to its securities:

      - adjust, split, combine or reclassify Syncor capital stock,

      - make, declare or pay any dividend or distribution on, or, directly or
        indirectly, redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire, any shares of Syncor
        capital stock or any securities or obligations convertible into or
        exchangeable for any shares of Syncor capital stock (other than (1)
        dividends or distributions from its direct or indirect wholly owned
        subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business or (2) dividends or
        distributions from a subsidiary that is partially owned by Syncor or any
        of its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business; provided that
        Syncor or any of its subsidiaries receives or is to receive its
        proportionate share thereof),

      - grant any person any right or option to acquire any shares of Syncor
        capital stock, except, after the date of the merger agreement, for the
        grant of Syncor options to purchase up to 100,000 shares of Syncor

Additionally, pursuant to the merger agreement, Syncor has agreed to consult
with Cardinal Health prior to making publicly available its financial results or
filing certain documents with the SEC after the date of the merger agreement.

NO SOLICITATION

     During the term of the merger agreement, Syncor has agreed that it will
not, and will not authorize and will use best efforts not to permit any of its
subsidiaries or any of its or its subsidiaries' directors, officers, employees,
agents or representatives, directly or indirectly, to solicit, initiate,
encourage or facilitate, or furnish or disclose nonpublic information in
furtherance of, any inquiries or the making of any proposal with respect to any
recapitalization, merger, consolidation or other business combination involving
Syncor, or acquisition of any capital stock (other than upon exercise of Syncor
options that are outstanding as of the date of the merger agreement) or a
material amount of the assets (other than transactions with customers in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice or the disposition of
all or part of the business or operations of CMI), of Syncor and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions, or any combination of the foregoing, which we refer to as a
competing transaction, or negotiate, explore or otherwise engage in discussions
with any person (other than Cardinal Health, Mudhen Merger Corp. or their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives) with
respect to any competing transaction or enter into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to complete the merger
or any other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; provided that,
at any time prior to the approval of the merger agreement by Syncor
stockholders, Syncor may furnish information to, and negotiate or otherwise
engage in discussions with, any person that delivers a written proposal for a
competing transaction that was not solicited or encouraged after the date of the
merger agreement if and so long as the Syncor board of directors believes in
good faith by a majority vote, based upon the advice of its outside legal
counsel, that failing to take the action would reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law and believes in
good faith, after consulting with a nationally recognized investment banking
firm and Syncor's outside legal counsel, that the proposal would reasonably be
expected to result in a transaction that, if consummated, would be more
favorable to Syncor stockholders from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (including any adjustment to
the terms and conditions proposed by Cardinal Health in response to the
competing transaction), which the merger agreement refers to as a superior
proposal; provided, further, that, prior to furnishing any information to such
person, Syncor will enter into a confidentiality agreement that is no less
restrictive, in any material respect, than the confidentiality agreement between
Cardinal Health and Syncor, dated July 9, 2001, as amended on August 29, 2001
and September 5, 2001.

     Syncor has agreed that it will immediately cease all existing activities,
discussions and negotiations with any persons conducted to the date of the
merger agreement with respect to any proposal for a competing transaction and
request the return of all confidential information regarding Syncor provided to
any of these persons prior to the date of the merger agreement pursuant to the
terms of any confidentiality agreements or otherwise.

     In the event that, after the date of the merger agreement and prior to it
being approved by the Syncor stockholders, the Syncor board of directors
receives a superior proposal that was not solicited or encouraged and believes
in good faith based upon the advice of Syncor's outside legal counsel that
failure to take the action would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach
of the fiduciary duties of the Syncor board of directors under applicable law,
the Syncor board of directors may withdraw, modify or change, in a manner
adverse to Cardinal Health, the Syncor board of directors' recommendation and/or
comply with Rule 14e-2

under the Exchange Act with respect to a competing transaction, provided that
Syncor gives Cardinal Health three business days' prior written notice of its
intention to do so (provided that the foregoing will in no way limit or
otherwise affect Cardinal Health's right to terminate the merger agreement in
accordance with the provisions described under "-- Termination"). Any
withdrawal, modification or change of the Syncor board of directors'
recommendation will not change the approval of the Syncor board of directors for
purposes of causing any state takeover statute or other state law to be
inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including
the merger or the support/voting agreements, or change the obligation of Syncor
to present the merger agreement for approval at the duly called special meeting
on the earliest practicable date determined in consultation with Cardinal
Health.

     From and after the execution of the merger agreement, Syncor will promptly
advise Cardinal Health in writing of the receipt, directly or indirectly, of any
inquiries or proposals or the participation by or on behalf of Syncor in any
discussions or negotiations, relating to a competing transaction (including, in
each case, the specific terms and status of the competing transaction and the
identity of the other person or persons involved) and promptly furnish to
Cardinal Health a copy of any written proposal in addition to any information
provided to or by any third party relating to the written proposal. All
information provided to Cardinal Health under this section of the merger
agreement will be kept confidential by Cardinal Health in accordance with the
terms of the confidentiality agreement between Cardinal Health and Syncor.

     In addition, Syncor has agreed to promptly advise Cardinal Health, in
writing, if the Syncor board of directors makes any determination as to any
unsolicited competing transaction as permitted under the terms of the merger
agreement, as described above. Furthermore, nothing contained in this section of
the merger agreement prohibits Syncor from making disclosure (and the disclosure
in and of itself will not be deemed to be a change in the Syncor board of
directors' recommendation) of the fact that a competing transaction has been
proposed, the identity of the person making the proposal or the material terms
of the proposal in the registration statement or the proxy statement only to the
extent the disclosure of the facts, identity or terms is required under
applicable law and only following prior consultation by Syncor with Cardinal
Health regarding the proposed disclosure.

AFFILIATES OF SYNCOR

     Syncor has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to cause each person that
will be, at the effective time of the merger or was on the date of the merger
agreement, an "affiliate" of Syncor for purposes of Rule 145 to execute and
deliver to Cardinal Health, no less than ten days prior to the date of the
special meeting, a written letter containing the undertakings in the form
attached as an exhibit to the merger agreement. No later than 15 days prior to
that date, Syncor, after consultation with Syncor's outside legal counsel, will
provide Cardinal Health with a letter (reasonably satisfactory to outside legal
counsel to Cardinal Health) specifying all of the individuals or entities that
Syncor believes may be deemed to be affiliates of Syncor. Cardinal Health will
be entitled to place legends on the certificates evidencing any Cardinal Health
common shares to be received by (1) any affiliate of Syncor or (2) any person
Cardinal Health in consultation with Cardinal Health's outside legal counsel
reasonably identifies as being a person that is an affiliate pursuant to the
terms of the merger agreement, and to issue appropriate stop transfer
instructions to the transfer agent for Cardinal Health common shares consistent
with the terms of the letters from the Syncor affiliate, regardless of whether
that person has executed an affiliate letter and regardless of whether that
person's name appears on the letter to be delivered pursuant to this section of
the merger agreement.

CONDITIONS TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF EACH PARTY

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, the respective obligations of Syncor,

       expired or been terminated, and any other approvals

       of any governmental authority will have been obtained, except for those
       approvals (unrelated to antitrust laws) the failure of which to obtain
       would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in the imposition of
       any fine or penalty, except in immaterial amounts;

     - no provision of any applicable law and no judgment, injunction, order or
       decree of a governmental authority will prohibit or enjoin the completion
       of the merger or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or
       limit the ownership or operation by Cardinal Health, Syncor or any of
       their respective subsidiaries of any material portion of the businesses
       or assets of Cardinal Health or Syncor;

     - there will not be pending any action by any governmental authority

      - challenging or seeking to restrain or prohibit the completion of the
        merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger
        agreement,

      - seeking to prohibit or limit in any material respect the ownership or
        operation by Cardinal Health, Syncor or any of their respective
        subsidiaries of, or to compel Cardinal Health, Syncor or any of their
        respective subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate, any material
        portion of the business or assets of Cardinal Health, Syncor or any of
        their respective subsidiaries, as a result of the merger or any of the
        other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, except in the
        case of prohibitions, limitations, dispositions or holdings that would
        not be deemed to constitute a material adverse effect under the
        provisions described under "-- HSR Act Filings; Reasonable Efforts;
        Notification," or

      - seeking to impose limitations on the ability of Cardinal Health to
        acquire or hold, or exercise full rights of ownership of, any shares of
        capital stock of the surviving corporation, including the right to vote
        capital stock of the surviving corporation on all matters properly
        presented to stockholders of the surviving corporation;

     - the SEC will have declared the registration statement effective, and no
       stop order or similar restraining order suspending the effectiveness of
       the registration statement will be in effect and no proceedings for this
       purpose will be pending before or threatened by the SEC or any state
       securities administrator;

     - Cardinal Health common shares to be issued in the merger and upon
       exercise of Cardinal Health exchange options will have been approved for

     - Syncor will have received the opinion of its counsel, Skadden, Arps,
       Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, dated as of the closing date of the merger, to
       the effect that

      - the merger will constitute a "reorganization" (within the meaning of
        Section 368(a) of the Code), and

      - no gain or loss will be recognized by Syncor stockholders upon the
        receipt of Cardinal Health common shares in exchange for shares of
        Syncor common stock pursuant to the merger, except with respect to cash
        received in lieu of fractional share interests in Cardinal Health common
        shares.

CONDITIONS TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF SYNCOR

     The obligations of Syncor to consummate the merger and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are subject to the satisfaction of the
following conditions, unless waived by Syncor:

     - each of the representations and warranties of each of Cardinal Health and
       Mudhen Merger Corp. described under "-- Representations and Warranties"
       will be true and correct in all respects on the date of the merger
       agreement and on and as of the closing date of the merger as though made
       on and as of the closing date, except where the failure of the
       representations and warranties, in the aggregate, to be true and correct
       in all respects would not reasonably be expected to have a material
       adverse effect on Cardinal Health;

     - each of Cardinal Health and Mudhen Merger Corp. will have performed in
       all material respects each obligation and agreement and will have
       complied in all material respects with each covenant to be

       to the effective time of the merger;

     - each of Cardinal Health and Mudhen Merger Corp. will have furnished
       Syncor with a certificate dated the closing date of the merger signed on
       behalf of it by the Chairman, President or any Vice President to the
       effect that the conditions set forth above in the two preceding bullet
       points have been satisfied; and

     - since the date of the merger agreement, except to the extent contemplated
       by the provisions described under "-- Material Adverse Effect," there
       will not have been events or occurrences, individually or in the
       aggregate, that would have a material adverse effect on Cardinal Health.

CONDITIONS TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF CARDINAL HEALTH AND MUDHEN MERGER CORP.

     The obligations of Cardinal Health and Mudhen Merger Corp. to consummate
the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are subject
to the satisfaction of the following conditions unless waived by Cardinal Health
and Mudhen Merger Corp.:

     - each of the representations and warranties of Syncor described under
       "-- Representations and Warranties" will be true and correct in all
       respects on the date of the merger agreement and on and as of the closing
       date of the merger as though made on and as of the closing date, except
       where the failure of the representations and warranties, in the
       aggregate, to be true and correct in all respects would not reasonably be
       expected to have a material adverse effect on Cardinal Health;

     - Syncor will have performed in all material respects each obligation and
       agreement and will have complied in all material respects with each
       covenant to be performed and complied with by it under the merger
       agreement at or prior to the effective time of the merger;

     - Syncor will have furnished Cardinal Health with a certificate dated the

       President or any Vice President to the effect that the conditions set
       forth above in the two preceding bullet points have been satisfied; and

     - since the date of the merger agreement, except to the extent contemplated
       by the provisions described under "-- Material Adverse Effect," there
       will have not been events or occurrences, individually or in the
       aggregate, that would have a material adverse effect on Syncor.

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

     A "material adverse effect" with respect to any party to the merger
agreement will be deemed to occur if there will have been a material adverse
effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of that
party to the merger agreement and that party's subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
except to the extent that such adverse effect results from:

     - changes (1) in prevailing interest rates in the United States or
       financial market conditions in the United States, (2) in general economic
       conditions in the United States, or (3) in GAAP;

     - any developments, changes or consequences relating to or that could arise
       from the actual or prospective renewal of (or failure to renew) Syncor's
       agreement with Dupont Merck Pharmaceutical Company (and Bristol-Myers, as
       successor), dated December 19, 1993, as amended (prior to June 14, 2002),
       which we refer to as the BMS contract, any new terms that may be
       negotiated in any proposed or actual amended or new BMS contract, any
       negotiations with Bristol-Myers (or the substitute counterparty) directly
       relating to the BMS contract or any amendment to the BMS contract, or a
       new BMS contract, in each case, regardless of whether or not
       Bristol-Myers owns the product covered by the BMS contract; or

     - any developments, changes or consequences relating to the process for the
       possible sale of all or a portion of the business of CMI, including the
       failure to sell all or any portion of the CMI business, the level of
       interest of any parties in pursuing a sale or the value or other terms
       for a sale indicated by those

       parties, and the pricing or other terms of any sale, or the effect of any
       accounting charges, adjustments and changes previously disclosed to
       Cardinal Health. For the purposes of the merger agreement, in determining
       whether there has been a material adverse effect on Syncor, any changes
       to or developments regarding the CMI business will be measured solely
       against the actual results of the CMI business for the fiscal year ended
       December 31, 2001.

TERMINATION

     The merger agreement may be terminated and the merger may be abandoned at
any time prior to the effective time of the merger (notwithstanding any approval
of the merger agreement by Syncor stockholders):

          (1) by mutual written consent of Cardinal Health and Syncor;

          (2) by either Cardinal Health or Syncor if there will be any law or
     regulation that makes completion of the merger illegal or otherwise
     prohibited, or if any judgment, injunction, order or decree of a court or
     other competent governmental authority enjoining Cardinal Health or Syncor
     from completing the merger will have been entered and the judgment,
     injunction, order or decree will have become final and nonappealable;
     provided that the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement pursuant
     to this provision of the merger agreement will have used its reasonable
     best efforts to remove the order, decree, ruling or injunction;

          (3) by either Cardinal Health or Syncor if the merger has not been
     completed before December 31, 2002, provided, however, that, in the event
     the condition described in the second bullet point under "-- Conditions to
     the Obligations of Each Party" has not been satisfied on or prior to
     December 31, 2002, this date will be extended to the earlier of the date
     that is ten business days after the date on which the condition described
     in the second bullet point under "-- Conditions to the Obligations of Each
     Party" is satisfied, and April 30, 2003; provided, further, that the right
     to terminate the merger agreement under this provision of the merger
     agreement will not be available to any party to the merger agreement whose
     failure or whose affiliate's failure to perform any material covenant or
     obligation under the merger agreement has been the primary cause of or
     resulted in the failure of the merger to occur on or before that date;

          (4) by Cardinal Health (a) if there has been a withdrawal,
     modification or change in the Syncor board of directors' recommendation in
     a manner adverse to Cardinal Health or (b) if the Syncor board of directors
     refuses to affirm the Syncor board of directors' recommendation within 20
     days of any written request from Cardinal Health;

          (5) by Cardinal Health or Syncor if, at the special meeting, the
     requisite vote of Syncor stockholders to approve the merger agreement was
     not obtained;

          (6) by Cardinal Health if there has been a violation or breach by
     Syncor of any agreement, covenant, representation or warranty contained in
     the merger agreement that has prevented or would prevent the satisfaction
     of the conditions described in the first and second bullet points under
     "-- Conditions to the Obligations of Cardinal Health and Mudhen Merger
     Corp.," at the time of the breach or violation and the breach or violation
     has not been waived by Cardinal Health nor cured by Syncor prior to the
     earlier of (a) 20 business days after the giving of written notice to
     Syncor of the breach and (b) December 31, 2002; or

          (7) by Syncor if there has been a violation or breach by Cardinal
     Health of any agreement, covenant, representation or warranty contained in
     the merger agreement that has prevented or would prevent the satisfaction
     of the conditions set forth in the first and second bullet points under
     "-- Conditions to the Obligations of Syncor," at the time of the breach or
     violation and the breach or violation has not been waived by Syncor nor
     cured by Cardinal Health prior to the earlier of (a) 20 business days after
     the giving of written notice to Cardinal Health of the breach and (b)
     December 31, 2002.

EFFECT OF TERMINATION

     In the event of the termination of the merger agreement pursuant to its
terms, the merger agreement will become void and have no effect, except for the
provisions relating to confidentiality, governing law, jurisdiction and venue,
expenses and effect of termination, without any liability on the part of any
party to the merger agreement or the directors, officers, stockholders or
shareholders. Nothing in the merger agreement relieves any party to the merger
agreement of liability for an intentional and material breach of any provision
of the merger agreement; provided, however, that, if it is judicially determined
that termination of the merger agreement was caused by an intentional and
material breach of the merger agreement, then, in addition to other remedies at
law or equity for breach of the merger agreement, the parties to the merger
agreement have agreed that the party so found to have intentionally breached the
merger agreement will indemnify and hold harmless the other parties to the
merger agreement for their respective out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses of
their counsel, accountants, financial advisors and other experts and advisors,
as well as fees and expenses incident to negotiation, preparation and execution
of the merger agreement and related documentation and the special meeting and
consents, which we refer to as merger-related expenses.

     If the merger agreement is terminated pursuant to the provisions described
in clause (4) or (5) under "-- Termination," then Syncor will, within three
business days following the termination by Cardinal Health, or, in the case of a
termination by Syncor, concurrently with the termination, pay to Cardinal Health
in reimbursement of Cardinal Health's actual and documented merger-related
expenses an amount in cash up to but not in excess of $4,000,000 in the
aggregate.

     If the merger agreement is terminated pursuant to the provisions described
in clause (4) or (5) described under "-- Termination" and at any time prior to
such termination a bona fide proposal regarding a competing transaction with
respect to Syncor has not been made to Syncor, and there has not been any public
disclosure of any bona fide proposal or expression of interest by a third party
regarding a competing transaction, or the merger agreement is terminated
pursuant to clause (1) or (3) under "-- Termination" and at any time prior to
such termination a bona fide proposal regarding a competing transaction with
respect to Syncor has been made to Syncor, or any bona fide proposal or
expression of interest by a third party regarding a competing transaction has
been publicly disclosed and within six months after the date of the termination
Syncor enters into a letter of intent, agreement-in-principle, acquisition
agreement or other similar agreement, or publicly announces, a "business
combination" (as defined below), then Syncor will, upon completion of the
business combination, pay to Cardinal Health a termination fee in an amount
equal to $24,125,000 (less amounts paid in reimbursement of Cardinal Health's
merger-related expenses).

     If the merger agreement is terminated pursuant to the provisions described
in clause (4) or (5) under "-- Termination," and at any time prior to the
termination a bona fide proposal regarding a competing transaction with respect
to Syncor has been made to Syncor, or any bona fide proposal or expression of
interest by a third party regarding a competing transaction has been publicly
disclosed, then Syncor will, in the case of a termination by Cardinal Health,
within three business days following the termination or, in the case of a
termination by Syncor, concurrently with the termination, pay to Cardinal Health
a termination fee in an amount equal to $12,062,500 (less amounts paid in
reimbursement of Cardinal Health's merger-related expenses); and, furthermore,
if within 12 months after the date of the termination Syncor enters into a
letter of intent, agreement-in-principle, acquisition agreement or other similar
agreement with respect to, or publicly announces, a business combination or
consummates a business combination, then Syncor will, upon the completion of
such business combination, pay to Cardinal Health an additional termination fee
in an amount equal to $12,062,500.

     As used in this section, "business combination" means:

     - a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or similar
       transaction involving Syncor as a result of which Syncor stockholders
       prior to the transaction cease to own, in the aggregate, at least 60% of
       the voting securities of the entity surviving or resulting from the
       transaction (or the ultimate parent entity thereof);

     - a sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition of more than 33%
       of the assets of Syncor and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a
       single transaction or a series of related transactions (other than to
       customers in the ordinary course of business or the disposition of all or
       part of the business or operations of CMI); or

     - the acquisition, by a person (other than Cardinal Health or any affiliate
       of Cardinal Health) or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the
       Exchange Act) of "beneficial ownership" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under
       the Exchange Act) of more than 33% of Syncor common stock, whether by
       tender or exchange offer or otherwise.

AMENDMENT

     The merger agreement may be amended by the parties to the merger agreement
at any time before or after approval of the merger agreement by Syncor
stockholders, but, after any approval of the merger agreement by Syncor
stockholders, no amendment will be made that by law requires further approval or
authorization of Syncor stockholders (unless that approval or authorization is
obtained). Any amendment must be made by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties to the merger agreement.

EXTENSION; WAIVER

     At any time prior to the effective time of the merger, Cardinal Health
(with respect to Syncor) and Syncor (with respect to Cardinal Health and Mudhen
Merger Corp.), by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of
directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (1) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of that party to the merger
agreement, (2) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained in the merger agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to the
merger agreement, and (3) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in the merger agreement. Any agreement on the part of a
party to the merger agreement to any extension or waiver will be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of that party to the merger
agreement.

EXPENSES

     Subject to the provisions described under "-- Effect of Termination," all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be paid by the party to
the merger agreement incurring the cost or expense.

SYNCOR RIGHTS AGREEMENT AMENDMENT

     In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, Syncor and
American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as rights agent, executed the First
Amendment to the Rights Agreement, dated as of June 14, 2002, amending the
rights agreement between Syncor and the rights agent, dated as of September 28,
1999, so as to provide that neither Cardinal Health nor Mudhen Merger Corp.
shall be deemed to be an acquiring person (as defined in the rights agreement),
and that no stock acquisition date, triggering event or distribution date (as
such terms are defined in the rights agreement) shall occur by reason of the
execution of the merger agreement, or the completion of the merger or any other
transaction contemplated by the merger agreement. The rights agreement amendment
further provides that the rights agreement and the rights established by the
rights agreement will terminate in all respects immediately prior to the
completion of the merger. The rights agreement amendment further provides that
if, for any reason, the merger agreement is terminated and the merger is
abandoned, then the rights agreement amendment shall be of no further force and
effect and the rights agreement shall remain exactly the same as it existed
immediately prior to execution of the rights agreement amendment. See
"Comparison of Shareholder/Stockholder Rights -- Rights Agreement."

     The foregoing is a summary of the rights agreement amendment. This summary
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the rights agreement amendment,
which is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/ prospectus.

     The merger agreement provides that Syncor cannot further amend the rights
agreement without Cardinal Health's consent.

                         THE SUPPORT/VOTING AGREEMENTS

     Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, Cardinal Health
executed with each of Monty Fu, Chairman of the Board of Syncor, and Robert G.
Funari, President and Chief Executive Officer of Syncor, a support/voting
agreement pursuant to which each of the stockholders agreed that:

     - he will not, and will use reasonable best efforts not to permit any
       controlled affiliate to, contract to sell, sell or otherwise transfer or
       dispose of any shares of Syncor common stock or any interest in the
       shares of Syncor common stock he owns or securities convertible into
       shares of Syncor common stock he owns or any voting rights with respect
       to shares of Syncor common stock he owns, other than (1) pursuant to the
       merger or (2) with Cardinal Health's consent, which consent will not be
       unreasonably withheld, unless the individual or entity to whom shares of
       Syncor common stock have been sold, transferred or disposed agrees in
       writing to be bound by the support/voting agreement as if a party to the
       support/ voting agreement;

     - in his capacity as a Syncor stockholder, he will not, and will use
       reasonable best efforts not to permit any controlled affiliate to,
       directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate, or
       furnish or disclose nonpublic information in furtherance of, any
       inquiries or the making of any proposal with respect to any competing
       transaction, or negotiate, explore or otherwise engage in discussions
       with any person (other than Cardinal Health, Mudhen Merger Corp. or their
       respective directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives)
       with respect to any competing transaction, or enter any agreement,
       arrangement or understanding requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail
       to complete the merger or any other transactions contemplated by the
       merger agreement or to otherwise assist in the effectuation of any
       competing transaction; provided, however, that nothing in his
       support/voting agreement prevents him from taking any action or omitting
       to take action solely as a member of the Syncor board of directors (or a
       committee of the Syncor board of directors) or, at the direction of the
       Syncor board of directors (or a committee of the Syncor board of
       directors), as a Syncor officer or employee;

     - that all of the shares of Syncor common stock beneficially owned by him,
       directly or indirectly, at the record date for the special meeting called
       to consider and vote to approve the merger agreement, will be present in
       person or by proxy and will be voted in favor of the merger agreement,
       and not in favor of any competing transaction; and

     - he will, upon Cardinal Health's request, execute an irrevocable proxy
       appointing Cardinal Health as his attorney and proxy to vote in favor of
       the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. (Cardinal
       Health has not asked for this irrevocable proxy as of the date of this
       proxy statement/ prospectus).

     In consideration of the stockholder's undertakings in his support/voting
agreement, Cardinal Health agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to provide
reasonably promptly to the stockholder and/or his controlled affiliates the
ability under U.S. federal securities laws to sell, pledge, transfer or
otherwise dispose of all or any portion of the Cardinal Health common shares
received by the stockholder as a result of the merger if the restriction results
primarily from the stockholder entering into, or complying with, the terms of
his support/ voting agreement.

     Each of the support/voting agreements may be terminated at the option of
any party to the agreement at any time upon the earliest of (1) termination of
the merger agreement, (2) the effective time of the merger and (3) April 30,
2003. The number of shares of Syncor common stock beneficially held (excluding
Syncor options) by Messrs. Fu and Funari as of the record date were [       ]
shares, and [       ] shares, respectively, which represent approximately
[     ]% of the outstanding shares of Syncor common stock as of that date.

     The foregoing is a summary of the material provisions of, and is qualified
by reference to, the support/ voting agreements of Messrs. Fu and Funari, a form
of which is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this
proxy statement/prospectus forms a part.

                 MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

     The following general discussion summarizes the anticipated material U.S.
federal income tax consequences of the merger to Syncor stockholders that
exchange their shares of Syncor common stock for Cardinal Health common shares
in the merger. This discussion addresses only those Syncor stockholders that
hold their Syncor common stock as a capital asset, and does not address all of
the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to particular
Syncor stockholders in light of their individual circumstances or to Syncor
stockholders that are subject to special rules, such as:

     - financial institutions;

     - mutual funds;

     - tax-exempt organizations;

     - insurance companies;

     - dealers in securities or foreign currencies;

     - traders in securities that elect to apply a mark-to-market method of
       accounting;

     - foreign holders;

     - persons that hold their shares of Syncor common stock as a hedge against
       currency risk or as part of a straddle, constructive sale or conversion
       transaction; or

     - Syncor stockholders that acquired their shares upon the exercise of
       Syncor options or otherwise as compensation.

     The following discussion is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service. It
is based upon the Code, laws, regulations, rulings and decisions in effect as of
the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, all of which are subject to change,
possibly with retroactive effect. Tax consequences under state, local and
foreign laws and U.S. federal laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws, are
not addressed.

     Syncor stockholders are urged to consult their tax advisors as to the
specific tax consequences to them of the merger, including the applicability and
effect of U.S. federal, state and local and foreign income and other tax laws in
their particular circumstances.

     The parties to the merger agreement have structured the merger so that it
is anticipated that the merger will be a reorganization for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. It is a condition to the completion of the merger that Syncor
receive a written opinion from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, counsel
to Syncor, dated the closing date of the merger, to the effect that (1) the
merger will constitute a "reorganization" (within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code) and (2) no gain or loss will be recognized by Syncor stockholders
upon the receipt of Cardinal Health common shares in exchange for shares of
Syncor common stock pursuant to the merger, except with respect to cash received
in lieu of fractional share interests in Cardinal Health common shares. The
opinion will be based on customary assumptions and customary representations
made by, among others, Syncor and Cardinal Health. An opinion of counsel
represents counsel's best legal judgment and is not binding on the Internal
Revenue Service or any court. No ruling has been, or will be, sought from the
Internal Revenue Service as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
merger.

     Assuming the merger qualifies as a "reorganization" (within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code), Syncor stockholders that exchange their Syncor
common stock solely for Cardinal Health common shares in the merger will not
recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except with respect
to cash, if any, they receive in lieu of a fractional Cardinal Health common
share. Each holder's aggregate tax basis in Cardinal Health common shares
received in the merger will be the same as that holder's aggregate tax basis in
Syncor common stock surrendered in the merger, decreased by the amount of any
tax basis allocable to any fractional share interest for which cash is received.
The holding period of Cardinal Health common shares received in the merger by a
holder of Syncor common stock will include the holding period of Syncor common
stock that the holder surrendered in the merger.

     A holder of Syncor common stock that receives cash in lieu of a fractional
Cardinal Health common share will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference
between the amount of cash received and that holder's tax basis in Cardinal
Health common shares that is allocable to the fractional Cardinal Health common
share. That gain or loss generally will constitute capital gain or loss and will
constitute long-term capital gain or loss if the Syncor stockholder has held the
shares for more than 12 months on the date of the merger.

     THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION OF MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES
IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND MAY NOT APPLY TO ALL SYNCOR
STOCKHOLDERS. THE OPINION OF SKADDEN, ARPS, SLATE, MEAGHER & FLOM LLP IS NOT
BINDING ON THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE. BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE TAX
LAWS, AND BECAUSE THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER FOR ANY PARTICULAR SYNCOR
STOCKHOLDER MAY BE AFFECTED BY MATTERS NOT DISCUSSED IN THIS PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS, EACH SYNCOR STOCKHOLDER IS URGED TO CONSULT HIS OWN TAX
ADVISER WITH RESPECT TO THE SYNCOR STOCKHOLDER'S OWN PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES
AND WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THE SYNCOR
STOCKHOLDER, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF U.S. STATE AND LOCAL AND
FOREIGN TAX LAWS, ESTATE TAX LAWS AND PROPOSED CHANGES IN APPLICABLE TAX LAWS.

                                 THE COMPANIES

BUSINESS OF SYNCOR

     Syncor is a provider of specialty services and products used in the
diagnosis, treatment and management of heart disease, cancer and other
disorders, the nation's leading provider of radiopharmacy services, and a
leading provider of outpatient medical imaging services.

     Syncor compounds, dispenses and distributes unit-dose radiopharmaceuticals
made by a number of manufacturers. Syncor also distributes radiopharmaceuticals
in bulk to hospitals and other customers that compound and dispense the product
themselves. Syncor's primary products are cardiology imaging agents used in
diagnosing heart problems. In 2001, sales of Cardiolite(R) represented an
estimated 58% of sales of all cardiac imaging agents in the United States and
41.2% of Syncor's total sales.

     Syncor acts as the primary distributor of Cardiolite(R), as well as a
distributor of Bristol-Myers' other radiopharmaceutical products, under the
terms of a supply and distribution agreement with Bristol-Myers. Under the terms
of the distribution and supply agreement, Syncor has exclusive rights to
distribute Cardiolite(R) within specified geographic areas surrounding most of
its existing U.S. radiopharmacies. Syncor's exclusive rights to distribute
Cardiolite(R) also extend to new radiopharmacies that it may develop or acquire
in geographic areas where Bristol-Myers has no preexisting distribution
arrangement. In other areas, and in areas outside of the specified areas
surrounding its radiopharmacies, Syncor's rights to distribute Cardiolite(R) are
nonexclusive. Its rights to distribute other Bristol-Myers products, including
Thallium, a generic cardiac imaging agent which accounted for 6.3% of its net
sales in 2001, also are nonexclusive. No other product constitutes more than
1.4% of Syncor's net sales.

     Syncor also produces fluorodeoxyglucose, which we refer to as FDG, which
Syncor distributes through its network of radiopharmacies. FDG is the most
commonly used radioisotope in positron emission tomography, which we refer to as
PET, a highly sensitive imaging technology used to diagnose cancer and manage
cancer therapies. When administered intravenously, FDG can reveal how certain
organs and tissues are functioning by measuring glucose metabolism. FDG is
widely used to study organ and tissue functions in neurology, cardiology and
oncology. FDG is produced in cyclotrons and has a half-life of only 110 minutes.
In order to effectively provide PET radiopharmaceuticals, it is essential to
have adequate supplies of FDG in proximity to the radiopharmacy where the PET
radiopharmaceutical is to be compounded and dispensed. To ensure an adequate
supply of FDG, Syncor has built or acquired nine cyclotron facilities in key
areas and has entered into arrangements with several local universities and
other cyclotron owners and operators to supply it with this critical component
of PET radiopharmaceuticals in other areas.

     Syncor produces and distributes Iodine-123 capsules. Iodine-123 is a
radiopharmaceutical used to diagnose and treat thyroid disorders. Syncor
manufactures Iodine-123 capsules at its Golden, Colorado facility. Syncor's
radiopharmacies also distribute Iodine-125 brachytherapy seeds, which are used
to treat prostate cancer. Syncor manufactured its own line of Iodine-125
brachytherapy seeds until February 2002, when it discontinued production of the
seeds. Syncor is currently evaluating whether or not to re-start the manufacture
of seeds.

     Syncor offers more than 50 brand name and generic radiopharmaceuticals.
Syncor is applying strengths developed in the marketing and distribution of
Cardiolite(R) to position itself to become a major provider of PET
radiopharmaceuticals, brachytherapy seeds and other time-sensitive, complex
pharmaceutical products, such as Xigris, where it believes there are other
marketing opportunities. Syncor has a strategic partnership with Eli Lilly and
Company to be their exclusive rapid response provider of Xigris, a biotechnology
compound used to treat severe sepsis, a life-threatening condition if not
treated immediately. In February 2002, Syncor entered into an agreement with
IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation to distribute Zevalin(R), a novel
radioimmunotherapy recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
for the treatment of certain Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas.

     Syncor has other businesses that complement its radiopharmacy services
business. Syncor provides radiology technical staff on a temporary or full-time
basis to hospitals, radiology clinics, nuclear cardiology

clinics and physician offices in over 30 markets nationwide. On August 1, 2001,
Syncor acquired Inovision Radiation Measurements, LLC and its affiliate,
Victoreen, LLC, both of which now operate as Syncor Radiation Management, LLC.
As a result of the acquisition, Syncor now manufactures and supplies radiation
measurement equipment and related accessories used by nuclear medicine
departments, radiopharmacies and other businesses that handle radioactive
materials. On August 31, 2001, Syncor acquired InteCardia, Inc., a provider of
cardiovascular services through the operation of a state-of-the-art cardiac
diagnostic facility that offers outpatient cardiac catheterization, nuclear
cardiology and echocardiography. InteCardia also offers nuclear cardiology
groups with full turnkey services, including the provision of imaging and
cardiac stress equipment and nuclear medicine technologists.

     In 1994, Syncor introduced the SECURE(R) Safety Insert System, which is
designed to eliminate the potential for contamination of lead-lined or tungsten
radiopharmaceutical containers with radioactive material or the blood from used
radiopharmaceutical syringes. With the SECURE(R) Safety Insert System, the risk
of needle sticks also is reduced significantly. Syncor believes that its
patented SECURE(R) Safety Insert System is the only system currently available
that meets new, more stringent Occupational Safety and Health Administration
industry standards that went into effect in July 2001. Syncor also has patent
rights to a family of tungsten radiopharmaceutical delivery systems that Syncor
refers to as the "Pigs." The Pigs are radiopharmaceutical containers that are
smaller and weigh considerably less than traditional containers used to
transport radiopharmaceuticals and set new industry standards for the safe
transport and handling of radiopharmaceuticals, including FDG. Syncor's tungsten
containers also provide enhanced radiation shielding compared to lead-lined
delivery systems typically used by Syncor's competitors, resulting in a
reduction in radiation exposure to Syncor's pharmacy personnel and customers.

     Syncor also licenses to its customers its proprietary Windows-based
SYNtrac(TM), Unit Dose Manager and NucLink(TM) integrated software and hardware
systems to assist them in the management of their nuclear medicine departments
and to facilitate electronic communication with Syncor's radiopharmacies. As of
December 31, 2001, Syncor licensed its software systems to more than 1,600 of
its radiopharmacy customers.

     Syncor's 130 domestic radiopharmacies serve hospitals, medical clinics and
medical imaging centers in 48 states and supplies more than 50% of the United
States for these specialized services. Syncor also owns or operates 19
radiopharmacies in 13 foreign countries and in Puerto Rico. Syncor's
radiopharmacies compound, dispense and distribute patient-specific
radiopharmaceutical prescriptions, or unit doses, used in nuclear diagnostic
imaging procedures. Syncor also distributes radiopharmaceuticals in bulk for
manufacturers.

     Syncor's principal radiopharmacy service customers are:

     - corporate account customers, such as group purchasing organizations, or
       GPOs;

     - local independent hospitals and medical clinics; and

     - community-based, multiple-facility integrated health care networks, which
       we refer to as IHNs.

     Corporate account customers, either GPOs or proprietary multi-hospital
groups, negotiate contracts on behalf of IHNs, independent hospitals, and
clinics. These contracts are multi-year contracts, although certain contracts
have clauses that permit the GPO or multi-hospital group to cancel the contract
if certain conditions occur. Syncor estimates that it has 1,165 customers
committed under a national or regional contract. Sales to members or affiliates
of its corporate account customers were approximately $225 million in 2001,
representing nearly 29% of its net sales, compared to approximately $187
million, or nearly 30% of its net sales in 2000. Syncor's largest corporate
account customers include AmeriNet Inc. and Health Trust Purchasing Group
(formerly Columbia/HCA). In 2001, sales to AmeriNet and Health Trust represented
10% and 6%, respectively, of Syncor's net sales. No other corporate account
customer accounts for as much as 5% of Syncor's net sales.

     Syncor also has customers that are affiliated with GPOs that do not have
contracts with us. Sales to these customers were approximately $191 million in
2001, representing nearly 25% of Syncor's net sales, compared to approximately
$168 million, or 26.8% of Syncor's net sales in 2000. No customers in this sales
category accounted for as much as 5% of Syncor's net sales. Despite the fact
that the majority of IHN's and hospitals

hold membership or are affiliated with a GPO or proprietary multi-hospital
group, some IHN's and local independent hospitals choose not to participate in a
national agreement. Syncor's sales to these customers were approximately $133
million in 2001, representing nearly 17.2% of Syncor's net sales. This compares
to $104 million, representing 16.5% of Syncor's net sales, in 2000. No local
independent hospital or clinic accounted for as much as 5% of Syncor's net
sales.

     Syncor markets and sells its radiopharmacy services and products and
services in the United States directly through a dedicated sales force of more
than 100 national and regional sales and marketing personnel. Syncor's sales and
marketing personnel are responsible for developing and managing personnel
relationships and for communicating the benefits of working with Syncor. To
maintain a highly effective local presence, Syncor's field sales force works
closely with local radiopharmacy managers to ensure that Syncor's customers'
expectations are met on a daily basis. Syncor also has personnel dedicated to
targeting and managing contracts with multi-hospital groups, including GPOs,
proprietary hospital systems, and multi-hospital alliances. In addition, Syncor
has a specialty sales team designed to increase Syncor's sales in new areas
separate from traditional nuclear medicine, such as brachytherapy and PET.

     Syncor also relies indirectly on the sales and marketing efforts by
manufacturers of the radiopharmaceuticals Syncor distributes. For example,
Syncor's sales and marketing force works closely with Bristol-Myers' sales and
marketing personnel to make joint sales calls, prepare marketing and sales
materials, and educate customers regarding the Bristol-Myers products Syncor
distributes.

     Syncor has a nationwide distribution network consisting of a national
distribution center in Toledo, Ohio, and three regional distribution centers.
Syncor's national distribution center maintains a central warehouse of critical
supplies in order to facilitate bulk-purchasing and minimize warehousing and
inventory requirements at its radiopharmacies.

     Syncor also is a leading independent provider of outpatient medical imaging
services. Its 70 outpatient medical imaging centers in the United States are
organized in clusters, located primarily in Arizona, California, Florida and
Texas. Syncor also owns or operates 19 medical imaging centers in five foreign
countries and Puerto Rico. Medical imaging services principally are noninvasive
procedures that generate representations of internal anatomy and convert them to
film or digital media to aid in the detection and diagnosis of diseases and
other disorders. By concentrating centers in targeted markets, Syncor offers
managed care organizations and other third-party payors a full complement of
medical imaging services, including magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, computed
tomography, or CT, traditional X-ray, mammography, ultrasound and fluoroscopy
imaging, as well as PET imaging services. On June 14, 2002, Syncor announced
that it is exiting the medical imaging business and is entertaining offers for
CMI.

     As previously disclosed, in the quarter ending June 30, 2002, Syncor will
record an after-tax charge in the range of $22 to $24 million related to its
decision to divest CMI, the reorganization of its international operations
announced earlier in 2002, and other related operating charges. This charge,
which is unrelated to the proposed merger with Cardinal Health, relates to
facility closings, employee termination costs and the write-down of assets,
including additional provisions for allowance for uncollectible accounts and
contractual allowances, as well as corporate charges related to the
reorganization of Syncor's information technology division and the departure of
former Syncor executives.

     Syncor has its principal executive offices at 6464 Canoga Avenue, Woodland
Hills, California 91367-2407, and its telephone number is (818) 737-4000.
Additional information regarding Syncor is contained in its filings with the SEC
pursuant to the Exchange Act. See "Where You Can Find More Information."

                  DESCRIPTION OF CARDINAL HEALTH CAPITAL STOCK

     The following is a summary of certain rights of Cardinal Health
shareholders. Reference is made to Cardinal Health's articles of incorporation
and code of regulations, in each case, as amended and restated, copies of which
are filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this proxy
statement/prospectus is a part and are incorporated into this proxy
statement/prospectus by reference. See "Where You Can Find More Information" for
information on how to obtain a copy of Cardinal Health's articles of
incorporation or code of regulations.

AUTHORIZED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES

     Cardinal Health's articles of incorporation authorize Cardinal Health to
issue up to 750,000,000 Cardinal Health common shares. On July 1, 2002,
approximately 448,745,492 Cardinal Health common shares were issued and
outstanding, approximately 12,283,008 Cardinal Health common shares were held in
treasury, approximately 81,398,599 Cardinal Health common shares were reserved
for issuance under Cardinal Health's stock incentive and deferred compensation
plans and approximately 14,700,000 Cardinal Health common shares were reserved
for issuance under Cardinal Health's equity shelf registration statement. Based
on the number of shares of Syncor common stock outstanding and the number of
Syncor options outstanding (including Syncor options that are
"out-of-the-money") as of the record date, Cardinal Health estimates that in
connection with the merger, it will issue approximately [     ] Cardinal Health
common shares. Cardinal Health's articles of incorporation also authorize
Cardinal Health to issue up to 5,000,000 Class B common shares, none of which
Cardinal Health Class B common shares are outstanding, and 500,000 nonvoting
preferred shares, none of which Cardinal Health nonvoting preferred shares are
outstanding. From time to time, Cardinal Health may issue additional authorized
but unissued Cardinal Health common shares for share dividends, stock splits,
employee benefit programs, financing and acquisition transactions, and other
general purposes. Those Cardinal Health common shares will be available for
issuance without action by Cardinal Health shareholders, unless such action is
required by applicable law or the rules of the New York Stock Exchange or any
other stock exchange on which Cardinal Health common shares may be listed in the
future. All outstanding Cardinal Health common shares are fully paid and
nonassessable. Cardinal Health shareholders do not have preemptive rights and
have no rights to convert their Cardinal Health common shares into any other
security. All Cardinal Health common shares are entitled to participate equally
and ratably in dividends, when and as declared by the Cardinal Health board of
directors.

VOTING

     Cardinal Health shareholders are entitled to one vote per Cardinal Health
common share for the election of directors and upon all matters on which
Cardinal Health shareholders are entitled to vote. Holders of Cardinal Health
Class B common shares (if any are issued in the future) are entitled to
one-fifth of one vote per Cardinal Health Class B common share in the election
of directors and upon all matters on which Cardinal Health shareholders are
entitled to vote. Under certain circumstances, holders of Cardinal Health Class
B common shares have a separate class vote. Under Ohio law, Cardinal Health
shareholders are afforded the right to vote their Cardinal Health common shares
cumulatively for the election of nominees to fill the particular class of
directors to be elected at each annual meeting, subject to compliance with
certain procedural requirements.

THE CARDINAL HEALTH BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The Cardinal Health board of directors currently consists of 15 members,
divided into three classes of five members each. Cardinal Health's code of
regulations provides that the number of directors may be increased or decreased
by action of the Cardinal Health board of directors upon the majority vote of
the Cardinal Health board of directors, but in no case may the number of
directors be fewer than nine or more than 16 without an amendment approved by
the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 75% of the shares having
voting power with respect to that proposed amendment. Cardinal Health's code of
regulations requires that any proposal to either remove a director during his or
her term of office or to further amend Cardinal Health's code of regulations
relating to the classification or removal of directors be approved by the
affirmative vote of the

holders of not less than 75% of the shares having voting power with respect to
the proposal. The Cardinal Health board of directors may fill any vacancy with
an individual who will serve until Cardinal Health shareholders hold an election
to fill the vacancy. The purpose of these provisions is to prevent directors
from being removed from office prior to the expiration of their respective
terms, thus protecting the safeguards inherent in the classified board
structure, unless dissatisfaction with the performance of one or more directors
is widely shared by Cardinal Health's shareholders. These provisions also could
have the effect of increasing, from one year to two or three years (depending
upon the number of Cardinal Health common shares held), the amount of time
required for an acquiror to obtain control of Cardinal Health by electing a
majority of the Cardinal Health board of directors, and also could make the
removal of incumbent Cardinal Health management more difficult and discourage or
render more difficult certain mergers, tender offers, proxy contests, or other
potential takeover proposals.

ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS OF OHIO REVISED CODE

     Chapter 1704 of the Ohio Revised Code generally provides that any person
that acquires 10% or more of a corporation's voting stock (thereby becoming an
"interested shareholder") may not engage in a wide range of "business
combinations" with the corporation for a period of three years following the
date the person became an interested shareholder, unless the directors of the
corporation have approved the transactions or the interested shareholder's
acquisition of shares of the corporation prior to the date the interested
shareholder became a shareholder of the corporation. These restrictions on
interested shareholders do not apply under certain circumstances, including, but
not limited to, the following:

     - if the corporation's original articles of incorporation contain a
       provision expressly electing not to be governed by Chapter 1704 of the
       Ohio Revised Code;

     - if the corporation, by action of its shareholders, adopts an amendment to
       its articles of incorporation expressly electing not to be governed by
       Chapter 1704 of the Ohio Revised Code; or

     - if, on the date the interested shareholder became a shareholder of the
       corporation, the corporation did not have a class of voting shares
       registered or traded on a national securities exchange.

     Cardinal Health's articles of incorporation do not contain a provision
electing not to be governed by Chapter 1704 of the Ohio Revised Code. Under
Section 1701.831 of the Ohio Revised Code, unless the articles of incorporation
or code of regulations of a corporation otherwise provide, any control share
acquisition of an "issuing public corporation" can be made only with the prior
approval of the shareholders of the corporation. A "control share acquisition"
is defined as any acquisition of shares of a corporation that, when added to all
other shares of that corporation owned by the acquiring person, would enable
that person to exercise levels of voting power in any of the following ranges:
at least 20% but less than 33 1/3%, at least 33 1/3% but less than 50%, or 50%
or more. Cardinal Health falls within the definition of issuing public
corporation, but Cardinal Health's code of regulations expressly provides that
the provisions of Section 1701.831 of the Ohio Revised Code do not apply to
Cardinal Health.

TRANSFER AGENT AND REGISTRAR

     The transfer agent and registrar for Cardinal Health common shares is
EquiServe Trust Company, Jersey City, New Jersey.

                  COMPARISON OF SHAREHOLDER/STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS

     As a result of the merger, Syncor stockholders will receive Cardinal Health
common shares in exchange for their shares of Syncor common stock. The following
is a summary of certain material differences between the rights of holders of
shares of Syncor common stock and the rights of holders of Cardinal Health
common shares. These differences arise in part from the differences between
Delaware law governing business corporations, including the Delaware General
Corporation Law, commonly referred to as the DGCL, and Ohio law governing
business corporations, including the Ohio General Corporation Law, commonly
referred to as the OGCL. Additional differences arise from the governing
instruments of the two companies (in the case of Syncor, its certificate of
incorporation and by-laws, in each case, as amended and restated, and, in the
case of Cardinal Health, its articles of incorporation and its code of
regulations, in each case, as amended and restated). Although it is impractical
to compare all of the aspects in which Delaware law and Ohio law and Syncor's
and Cardinal Health's governing instruments differ with respect to stockholders'
or shareholders' rights, as the case may be, the following discussion summarizes
certain significant differences between them.

CLASSES OF DIRECTORS

     A classified board of directors is one in which some, but not all, of the
directors are elected on a rotating basis each year. The purpose of staggering
the terms of members of a board of directors is to promote stability and
continuity within the board of directors. However, staggering the terms of
directors also has the effect of decreasing the number of directors that may
otherwise be elected by stockholders or shareholders, as the case

may be, in a given year, and, therefore, may have the effect of precluding a
contest for the election of directors or may delay, prevent or make more
difficult changes in control of a corporation.

CUMULATIVE VOTING

     Cumulative voting entitles each shareholder or stockholder, as the case may
be, to cast an aggregate number of votes equal to the number of voting shares or
voting stock, as the case may be, held, multiplied by the number of directors to
be elected. Each shareholder or stockholder, as the case may be, may cast all of
his, her or its votes for one nominee or distribute them among two or more
nominees. The candidates (up to the number of directors to be elected) receiving
the highest number of votes are elected.

                                                 associated with the Syncor common stock
                                                 represented by the Syncor certificate.

                                               The rights are not exercisable until the
                                               distribution date and will expire at the
                                               close of business on September 28, 2009,
                                               unless earlier redeemed or extended by Syncor
                                               as described below. As soon as practicable
                                               after the distribution date, rights
                                               certificates will be mailed to holders of
                                               record of Syncor common stock as of the close
                                               of business on the distribution date, and,
                                               thereafter, the separate rights certificates
                                               alone will represent the rights. Shares of
                                               Syncor common stock issued after the
                                               distribution date will be issued with rights
                                               if those

                                               shares of Syncor common stock are issued
                                               pursuant to the exercise of Syncor options or
                                               under an employee benefit plan, or upon the
                                               conversion of securities issued after
                                               adoption of the rights agreement. Except as
                                               otherwise determined by the Syncor board of
                                               directors, no other shares of Syncor common
                                               stock issued after the distribution date will
                                               be issued with rights.

                                               In the event that a person becomes an
                                               acquiring person, except pursuant to an offer
                                               for all outstanding shares of Syncor common
                                               stock at a price determined by a majority of
                                               the Syncor independent directors, after
                                               receiving advice from one or more investment
                                               banking firms, to be adequate and otherwise
                                               in the best interests of Syncor and Syncor
                                               stockholders, each holder of a right will,
                                               thereafter, have the right to receive, upon
                                               exercise, Syncor common stock (or, in certain
                                               circumstances, cash, property or other
                                               securities of Syncor), having a value equal
                                               to two times the "exercise price" of the
                                               right. The exercise price is the purchase
                                               price times the number of shares of Syncor
                                               common stock associated with each right
                                               (initially, one share of Syncor common
                                               stock). Notwithstanding any of the foregoing,
                                               following the occurrence of the event set
                                               forth in this paragraph, all rights that are,
                                               or (under certain circumstances specified in
                                               the rights agreement) were, beneficially
                                               owned by any acquiring person will be null
                                               and void. However, rights are not exercisable
                                               following the occurrence of the event set
                                               forth above until the time as the rights are
                                               no longer redeemable by Syncor as set forth
                                               below.

                                               For example, at an exercise price of $180 per
                                               right, each right not owned by an acquiring
                                               person (or by certain related parties)
                                               following the event set forth in the
                                               preceding paragraph would entitle its holder
                                               to purchase $360 worth of Syncor common stock
                                               (or other consideration, as noted above).
                                               Assuming that Syncor common stock had a per
                                               share value of $40 at that time, the holder
                                               of each valid right would be entitled to
                                               purchase nine shares of Syncor common stock
                                               for $180.

                                               In the event that, following the stock
                                               acquisition date, (1) Syncor engages in a
                                               merger or other business combination
                                               transaction in which Syncor is not the
                                               surviving corporation, (2) Syncor engages in
                                               a merger or other business combination
                                               transaction in which Syncor is the surviving
                                               corporation and Syncor common stock is
                                               changed or exchanged, or (3) 50% or more of
                                               Syncor's assets, cash flow or earning power

                                               is sold or transferred, each holder of a
                                               right (except rights that previously have
                                               been voided as set forth above) shall
                                               thereafter have the right to receive, upon
                                               exercise of the right, common stock of the
                                               acquiring company having a value equal to two
                                               times the exercise price of the right. The
                                               events set forth in this paragraph and in the
                                               second preceding paragraph are referred to as
                                               the "triggering events."

                                               Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, for
                                               180 days, which we refer to as the special
                                               period, following a change in control of the
                                               Syncor board of directors that has not been
                                               approved by the Syncor board of directors,
                                               occurring within nine months of announcement
                                               of an unsolicited third-party acquisition or
                                               business combination proposal or of a third
                                               party's intent or proposal otherwise to
                                               become an acquiring person, the new Syncor
                                               directors are entitled to redeem the rights
                                               (assuming the rights would have otherwise
                                               been redeemable), including to facilitate an
                                               acquisition or business combination
                                               transaction involving Syncor, but only

                                                 - if they have followed certain prescribed
                                                   procedures, or
                                                 - if the procedures are not followed, and
                                                 if their decision regarding redemption and
                                                   any acquisition or business combination
                                                   is challenged as a breach of fiduciary
                                                   duty of care or loyalty, the directors
                                                   (solely for purposes of the effectiveness
                                                   of the redemption decision) are able to
                                                   establish the entire fairness of the
                                                   redemption or transaction.

                                               Until a right is exercised, the holder of the
                                               right, as such, will have no rights as a
                                               Syncor stockholder, including, without
                                               limitation, the right to vote or to receive
                                               dividends. While the distribution of the
                                               rights will not be taxable to Syncor
                                               stockholders or to Syncor, Syncor
                                               stockholders may, depending upon the
                                               circumstances, recognize taxable income in
                                               the event that the rights become exercisable
                                               for Syncor common stock (or other
                                               consideration) or for common stock of the
                                               acquiring company or in the event of the
                                               redemption of the rights as set forth above.

                                               In connection with the execution of the
                                               merger agreement, Syncor and the rights agent
                                               executed an amendment to the rights agreement
                                               so as to provide that neither Cardinal Health
                                               nor Mudhen Merger Corp. will become an
                                               acquiring person and that no stock
                                               acquisition date, distribution date, or
                                               triggering event will occur as a result of
                                               the completion of the

                                               merger or any other transaction contemplated
                                               by the merger agreement. See "The Merger
                                               Agreement -- Syncor Rights Agreement
                                               Amendment."

                                               The rights are designed to protect Syncor
                                               stockholders in the event of unsolicited

                OTHER ACTION TO BE TAKEN AT THE SPECIAL MEETING

SYNCOR ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL

     Syncor is submitting a proposal to Syncor stockholders to authorize the
named proxies to vote in favor of the adjournment proposal at the special
meeting of stockholders in the event that there are not sufficient votes to
approve the merger agreement proposal at the time of the special meeting. Even
though a quorum may be present at the special meeting, it is possible that
Syncor may not have received sufficient votes to approve the merger agreement
proposal. In that event, we would need to adjourn the special meeting in order
to solicit additional proxies.

     To allow the proxies that have been received by Syncor at the time of the
special meeting to be voted for the adjournment, if necessary, Syncor has
submitted the question of adjournment under such circumstances, and only under
such circumstances, to Syncor stockholders for their consideration. Approval of
the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the voting power of shares of Syncor common stock present in person
or represented by proxy at the special meeting.

     The Syncor board of directors recommends that the Syncor stockholders vote
their proxies "FOR" the adjournment proposal so that their proxies may be used
for that purpose, should it become necessary. Properly executed proxies will be
voted "FOR" the adjournment proposal, unless otherwise noted on the proxies. If
it is necessary to adjourn the special meeting, no notice of the time and place
of the adjourned special meeting is required to be given to Syncor stockholders
other than an announcement of the time and place at the special meeting, unless
the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or, if, after the adjournment, a new
record date is set. The adjournment proposal relates only to an adjournment of
the special meeting occurring for purposes of soliciting additional proxies for
approval of the merger agreement proposal in the event that there are
insufficient votes to approve the merger agreement proposal at the special
meeting. Any other adjournment of the special meeting (e.g., an adjournment
required because of the absence of a quorum) would be voted upon pursuant to the
discretionary authority granted by the proxy.

     The Syncor board of directors retains full authority to postpone the
special meeting prior to the special meeting being convened, without the consent
of any Syncor stockholder.

     THE SYNCOR BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE
ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL.

     As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the Syncor board of
directors does not know of any matters that will be presented for consideration
at the special meeting other than as described in this proxy
statement/prospectus. If any other matters do properly come before the special
meeting or any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting and are
voted upon, the enclosed proxy will be deemed to confer discretionary authority
on the individuals named as proxies to vote shares of Syncor common stock
represented by those proxies as to any of those matters.

                                 LEGAL MATTERS

     The validity of Cardinal Health common shares to be issued in the merger
will be passed upon for Cardinal Health by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz,
special counsel to Cardinal Health.

     Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, special counsel to Syncor, will
render the opinion referred to under "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences."

                         INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

     The consolidated financial statements and the related consolidated
financial statement schedule of Cardinal Health and its subsidiaries as of June
30, 2001 and 2000, and for each of the three years in the period ended June 30,
2001, have been incorporated in this proxy statement/prospectus by reference
from Cardinal Health's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June
30, 2001. Such consolidated financial statements and schedule as of and for the
fiscal years ended June 30, 2001 and 2000, except for the financial

statements of Bindley Western Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("Bindley")
as of and for the year ended December 31, 1999, have been audited by Arthur
Andersen LLP as stated in their report which is incorporated herein by reference
from the Cardinal Health Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001. The
consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity and cash flows and the
related consolidated financial statement schedule of Cardinal Health and its
subsidiaries for the year ended June 30, 1999, prior to restatement for the 2001
pooling of interests with Bindley, which are not presented separately herein,
and except for the financial statements of Bindley, Allegiance Corporation and
its subsidiaries ("Allegiance") and R.P. Scherer Corporation ("Scherer"), have
been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP as stated in their report which is
incorporated herein by reference from the Cardinal Health Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2001. The separate financial statements of Scherer
for the year ended June 30, 1999, which are not presented herein, have been
audited by Arthur Andersen LLP, as stated in their reports which are
incorporated herein by reference from Cardinal Health's Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2001. Arthur Andersen LLP audited the combination of the
consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial statement
schedule for the year ended June 30, 1999, after restatement for the 2001
Bindley pooling of interests.

     The financial statements of Bindley as of December 31, 1999 and for each of
the two years in the period ended December 31, 1999 and the financial statements
of Allegiance for the year ended June 30, 1999, such financial statements not
being included or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus,
have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants, as
stated in their reports appearing in Cardinal Health's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, which is incorporated by reference
in this proxy statement/prospectus.

     As previously disclosed in Cardinal Health's 8-K filed on May 9, 2002,
Cardinal Health dismissed Arthur Andersen LLP as its independent public
accountants and announced that Cardinal Health had appointed Ernst & Young LLP
to replace Arthur Andersen LLP as its independent public accountants. On July 3,
2002, Arthur Andersen LLP publicly announced that it has commenced the closure
of its Columbus, Ohio office. Solely due to insufficient professional staff
remaining in Arthur Andersen LLP's Columbus office, after reasonable efforts,
Cardinal Health has been unable to obtain Arthur Andersen LLP's written consent
to include Arthur Andersen LLP's reports on Cardinal Health's or Scherer's
financial statements which are incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus. Under these circumstances, this proxy statement/prospectus
is permitted to be filed without a written consent from Arthur Andersen LLP in
accordance with Rule 437a of the Securities Act of 1933. The absence of this
consent may limit recovery against Arthur Andersen LLP under Section 11 of the
Securities Act. In addition, as a practical matter, the ability of Arthur
Andersen LLP to satisfy any claims (including claims arising from Andersen's
provision of auditing and other services to Cardinal Health and Arthur Andersen
LLP's other clients) may be limited due to recent events regarding Arthur
Andersen LLP, including without limitation its conviction on federal obstruction
of justice charges arising from the federal government's investigation of Enron
Corp.

     The consolidated financial statements of Syncor International Corporation
as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2001, have been incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement/prospectus in reliance on the report by KPMG LLP, independent
accountants.

                                 OTHER MATTERS

     Representatives of KPMG LLP are expected to be present at the special
meeting with the opportunity to make statements if they so desire. These
representatives also are expected to be available to respond to appropriate
questions.

                             STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

     The 2003 annual meeting of Syncor stockholders is presently scheduled to be
held in June 2003, but will not be held if the merger is completed. If the 2003
annual meeting of Syncor stockholders is held, stockholder proposals must be
received by Syncor no later than January 13, 2003 in order for the proposal to
be considered timely for inclusion in the 2003 annual meeting proxy materials.
To be included, proposals must be proper

under law and must comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC and Syncor's
by-laws. All stockholder proposals should be addressed to Mr. Edwin A. Burgos,
Secretary of Syncor.

                      WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION

     Cardinal Health will file with the SEC a registration statement under the
Securities Act that registers the distribution to Syncor stockholders of the
Cardinal Health common shares to be issued in connection with the merger. The
registration statement, including the attached exhibits and schedules, will
contain additional relevant information about Cardinal Health and Syncor. The
rules and regulations of the SEC allow us to omit certain information included

                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

     This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement") is made and entered
into as of the 14th day of June 2002, by and among Cardinal Health, Inc., an
Ohio corporation ("Cardinal"), Mudhen Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Cardinal ("Subcorp"), and Syncor International
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Syncor").

                             PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS

     A. Cardinal desires to combine its businesses with the businesses operated
by Syncor through the merger of Subcorp with and into Syncor, with Syncor as the
surviving corporation (the "Merger"), pursuant to which each share of Syncor
Common Stock (as defined in Section 4.4) outstanding at the Effective Time (as
defined in Section 1.2) will be converted into the right to receive Cardinal
Common Shares (as defined in Section 3.3(a)), all as more fully provided in this
Agreement.

     B. The Board of Directors of Syncor has determined that the Merger is
consistent with and in furtherance of the long-term business strategy of Syncor,
and Syncor desires to combine its businesses with the businesses operated by
Cardinal and for the holders of shares of Syncor Common Stock ("Syncor
Stockholders") to have a continuing equity interest in the combined
Cardinal/Syncor businesses through the ownership of Cardinal Common Shares.

     C. The parties to this Agreement intend that the Merger constitute a
"reorganization" (within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(B) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (together with the rules and regulations
thereunder, the "Code")) and this Agreement be adopted as a plan of
reorganization for the purposes of Section 368 of the Code.

     D. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition
and inducement to Cardinal's willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain
Syncor Stockholders are entering into Support Agreements (as defined in Section
4.26) with Cardinal in the form of Exhibit B to this Agreement.

     E. The respective Boards of Directors of Cardinal, Subcorp and Syncor have
determined the Merger in the manner contemplated in this Agreement to be
advisable and in the best interests of their respective shareholders or
stockholders, as the case may be, and, by resolutions duly adopted, have
approved and adopted this Agreement.

                                   AGREEMENT

     Now, therefore, in consideration of these premises and the mutual and
dependent promises set forth in this Agreement, the parties to this Agreement
agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I.

                                   THE MERGER

     1.1.  The Merger.  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, and in accordance with the provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), Subcorp shall be merged with and into Syncor at
the Effective Time. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence
of Subcorp shall cease and Syncor shall continue its existence under the laws of
the State of Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of Cardinal. Syncor, in its
capacity as the corporation surviving the Merger, is sometimes referred to as
the "Surviving Corporation."

     1.2.  Effective Time.  As promptly as possible on the Closing Date (as
defined below), the parties to this Agreement shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the
"Delaware Secretary of State") a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of
Merger") in such form as is required by and executed in accordance with Section
251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective when the Certificate of
Merger has been filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such later

                                       A-1

time as shall be agreed upon by Cardinal and Syncor and specified in the
Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time"). Prior to the filing referred to in
this Section 1.2, a closing (the "Closing") shall be held at the offices of
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, New York, or such
other place as the parties to this Agreement may agree on, as soon as
practicable (but in any event within three business days) following the date
upon which all conditions set forth in Article VI that are capable of being
satisfied prior to the Closing have been satisfied or waived, or at such other
date as Cardinal and Syncor may agree; provided that the Closing shall be
delayed if and only for so long as necessary if a banking moratorium, act of
terrorism or war (whether or not declared) affecting United States banking or
financial markets generally prevents the Closing. The date on which the Closing
takes place is referred to as the "Closing Date." For all Tax (as defined in
Section 4.13(j)) purposes, the Closing shall be effective at the end of the day
on the Closing Date.

     1.3.  Effects of the Merger.  From and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects as provided for in this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of the DGCL, including those set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

     1.4.  Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws.  The Certificate of Merger
shall provide that, at the Effective Time, (a) the Certificate of Incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be amended as of the Effective Time so as to contain the provisions,
and only the provisions, contained immediately prior to the Effective Time in
the Certificate of Incorporation of Subcorp (the "Subcorp Certificate of
Incorporation"), except for Article I of the Subcorp Certificate of
Incorporation, which shall continue to read "The name of the corporation is
"SYNCOR INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION'," and (b) the By-laws of Subcorp (the
"Subcorp By-laws") in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, in each case, until amended in
accordance with the DGCL.

     1.5.  Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.  From and after
the Effective Time, the officers of Syncor shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation and the directors of Subcorp shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation, in each case, until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified. On or prior to the Closing Date, Syncor shall deliver to
Cardinal evidence satisfactory to Cardinal of the resignations of the directors
of Syncor, such resignations to be effective as of the Effective Time.

     1.6.  Additional Actions.  If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further deeds,
assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable to
(a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of Syncor or (b) otherwise carry out the provisions of this
Agreement, Syncor and the officers and directors of Syncor shall be deemed to
have granted to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney, and
the Surviving Corporation and the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation will be authorized in the name of and on behalf of Syncor to execute
and deliver all such deeds, assignments or assurances in law and to take all
acts necessary, proper or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm title to and
possession of such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation and
otherwise to carry out the provisions of this Agreement, and the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation are authorized in the name of Syncor or
otherwise to take any and all such action.

                                  ARTICLE II.

                            CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

     2.1.  Conversion of Capital Stock.  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Cardinal, Subcorp or Syncor or
their respective shareholders and stockholders, as applicable:

          (a) Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of Subcorp ("Subcorp
     Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
     Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
     nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Surviving
     Corporation. Such newly issued shares shall thereafter constitute all of
     the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

                                       A-2

          (b) Subject to the other provisions of this Article II, each share of
     Syncor Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
     Effective Time shall be converted into and represent the right to receive a
     number of Cardinal Common Shares equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined in
     Section 2.2(a)).

          (c) Each share of capital stock of Syncor held in the treasury of
     Syncor shall be cancelled and retired and no payment shall be made in
     respect thereof.

     2.2.  Exchange Ratio; Fractional Shares; Adjustments.

     (a) The "Exchange Ratio" shall be equal to 0.52.

     (b) No certificates for fractional Cardinal Common Shares shall be issued
as a result of the conversion provided for in Section 2.1(b) and such fractional
share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or have any rights of
a holder of Cardinal Common Shares.

     (c) In lieu of any such fractional Cardinal Common Shares, each holder of a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Syncor Common Stock (the "Certificates") that
would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a Cardinal Common Share upon
surrender of Certificates (determined after taking into account all Certificates
delivered by such Syncor Stockholder) shall be paid upon such surrender cash
(without interest) in an amount equal to such Syncor Stockholder's proportionate
interest in the net proceeds from the sale or sales in the open market by the
Exchange Agent, on behalf of all such Syncor Stockholders, of the aggregate
fractional Cardinal Common Shares issued pursuant to this Article II. As soon as
practicable following the Effective Date, the Exchange Agent shall determine the
excess of (i) the number of full Cardinal Common Shares delivered to the
Exchange Agent by Cardinal over (ii) the aggregate number of full Cardinal
Common Shares to be distributed to Syncor Stockholders (such excess, the "Excess
Shares"), and the Exchange Agent, as agent for the former Syncor Stockholders,
shall sell the Excess Shares at the prevailing prices on the New York Stock
Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE"). The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent
shall be executed on the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE and
shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. All commissions,
stock transfer Taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the
expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent, incurred in connection with
such sale of Excess Shares shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation. The
Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the proceeds of such sale to which
each Syncor Stockholder shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of
the proceeds of such sale by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of
fractional share interests to which such Syncor Stockholder is entitled (after
taking into account all shares of Syncor Common Stock held at the Effective Time
by such Syncor Stockholders) and the denominator of which is the aggregate
amount of fractional share interests to which all Syncor Stockholders are
entitled. Until the proceeds of such sale have been distributed to the former
Syncor Stockholders, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for
such former Syncor Stockholders. As soon as practicable after the determination
of the amount of cash to be paid to such Syncor Stockholder in lieu of any
fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall make available in accordance with
this Agreement such amounts to such former Syncor Stockholder.

     (d) In the event that, prior to the Effective Time, Cardinal shall declare
a stock dividend or other distribution payable in Cardinal Common Shares or
securities convertible into Cardinal Common Shares, or effect a stock split,
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization, combination or other like
change with respect to Cardinal Common Shares having a record date or effective
date prior to the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio set forth in this Section
2.2 shall be adjusted to reflect fully such dividend, distribution, stock split,
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization, combination or other like
change.

     2.3.  Exchange of Certificates.

     (a) Exchange Agent. Promptly following the Effective Time, Cardinal shall
deposit with EquiServe Trust Company or such other nationally-recognized
exchange agent as may be designated by Cardinal (the "Exchange Agent"), for the
benefit of Syncor Stockholders, for exchange in accordance with this Section
2.3, certificates representing Cardinal Common Shares issuable pursuant to
Section 2.1 in exchange for outstand-

                                       A-3

ing shares of Syncor Common Stock (such Cardinal Common Shares, together with
any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, the "Exchange Fund").

     (b) Exchange Procedures.  As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate, (i) a
letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and shall be in such
form and have such other customary provisions as Cardinal (in consultation with
Syncor) may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing Cardinal
Common Shares. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal, the holder of the
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) a certificate
or certificates representing that whole number of Cardinal Common Shares that
the Syncor Stockholder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1 in such
denominations and registered in such names as the Syncor Stockholder may request
and (ii) a check representing the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares,
if any, and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, which the Syncor
Stockholder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article
II, after giving effect to any required withholding Tax. The shares of Syncor
Common Stock represented by the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash in lieu of fractional
shares, if any, and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to
Syncor Stockholders. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Syncor
Common Stock that is not registered on the transfer records of Syncor, a
certificate representing the proper number of Cardinal Common Shares, together
with a check for the cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and
unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, may be issued to the transferee if
the Certificate held by the transferee is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect the
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been
paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3, each Certificate
shall be deemed, at any time after the Effective Time, to represent only the
right to receive upon surrender a certificate representing Cardinal Common
Shares and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and unpaid dividends and
distributions, if any, as provided in this Article II. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the person claiming the Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Cardinal, the posting by the person of a bond in such reasonable
and customary amount as Cardinal may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to the Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, a certificate
representing the proper number of Cardinal Common Shares, together with a check
for the cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares, if any, with respect to
the shares of Syncor Common Stock formerly represented by the Certificate, and
unpaid dividends and distributions on Cardinal Common Shares, if any, as
provided in this Article II. Receipt by the Exchange Agent of such affidavit in
reasonably acceptable form and posting of such a bond, if required, shall be
deemed delivery and/or surrender of a Certificate with respect to the relevant
shares of Syncor Common Stock for purposes of this Article II.

     (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares.  Notwithstanding any
other provisions of this Agreement, no dividends or other distributions declared
or made after the Effective Time with respect to Cardinal Common Shares having a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares
shall be paid to any such holder, until the holder shall surrender the
Certificate as provided in this Section 2.3. Subject to the effect of Applicable
Laws (as defined in Section 3.9), following surrender of the Certificate, there
shall be paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole Cardinal
Common Shares issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of
such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole
Cardinal Common Shares and not paid, less the amount of any withholding Taxes
that may be required thereon, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date
subsequent to surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date
subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole Cardinal Common
Shares, less the amount of any withholding Taxes that may be required thereon.

                                       A-4

     (d) No Further Ownership Rights in Syncor Common Stock.  All Cardinal
Common Shares issued upon surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement (including any cash paid pursuant to this Article II) shall be
deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Syncor Common Stock represented thereby, and, as of the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of Syncor shall be closed and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of Syncor of
shares of Syncor Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this Section 2.3. Certificates surrendered for exchange by any person identified
pursuant to Section 5.3(e) as an "affiliate" of Syncor for purposes of Rule
145(c) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and
regulations thereunder, the "Securities Act"), shall not be exchanged until
Cardinal has received written undertakings from such person in the form attached
as Exhibit A to this Agreement.

     (e) Termination of Exchange Fund.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to Syncor Stockholders six months after the date of the
mailing required by Section 2.3(b) shall be delivered to Cardinal, upon demand
thereby, and holders of Certificates that have not theretofore complied with
this Section 2.3 shall thereafter look only to Cardinal for payment of any claim
to Cardinal Common Shares, cash in lieu of fractional shares thereof, or
dividends or distributions, if any, in respect thereof, or any other
consideration pursuant to this Agreement.

     (f) No Liability.  None of Cardinal, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares of Syncor
Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from
the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificates shall not have
been surrendered prior to seven years after the Effective Time (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which any cash, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares or any dividends or distributions with respect to whole shares of Syncor
Common Stock in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Authority (as defined in Section 3.4(d))), any
such cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to
the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, become the property of Cardinal, free
and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

     (g) Investment of Exchange Fund.  The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
balances in the Exchange Fund as a result of Section 2.2(c), as directed by
Cardinal, on a daily basis; provided that no such investment shall affect
Cardinal's obligation to deposit the full amount of cash required from time to
time under Section 2.3(a). Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Cardinal upon termination of the Exchange Fund
pursuant to Section 2.3(e).

     (h) Withholding Rights.  Each of the Surviving Corporation and Cardinal
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Syncor Stockholder such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Cardinal, as
the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to Syncor Stockholders in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Cardinal, as
the case may be.

     2.4.  Treatment of Stock Options.

     (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Cardinal and Syncor shall take all such
actions as may be necessary to cause each unexpired and unexercised outstanding
option granted or issued under Syncor stock option or equity-incentive plans in
effect on the date of this Agreement (each, a "Syncor Option") to be
automatically converted at the Effective Time into a fully-vested option (a
"Cardinal Exchange Option") to purchase that number of Cardinal Common Shares
equal to the number of shares of Syncor Common Stock subject to the Syncor
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio
(and rounded to the nearest share), with an exercise price per share equal to
the exercise price per share that existed under the corresponding Syncor Option
divided by the Exchange Ratio (and rounded to the nearest whole cent), and with
other terms and conditions that are the same as the terms and conditions of the
Syncor Option

                                       A-5

immediately before the Effective Time; provided that, with respect to any Syncor
Option that is an "incentive stock option" (within the meaning of Section 422 of
the Code), the foregoing conversion shall be carried out in a manner satisfying
the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. In connection with the issuance
of Cardinal Exchange Options, Cardinal shall (i) reserve for issuance the number
of Cardinal Common Shares that will become subject to Cardinal Exchange Options
pursuant to this Section 2.4, and (ii) from and after the Effective Time, upon
exercise of Cardinal Exchange Options, make available for issuance all Cardinal
Common Shares covered by Cardinal Exchange Options, subject to the terms and
conditions applicable to Cardinal Exchange Options.

     (b) Cardinal will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission"), within ten days after the Effective Time, such registration
statements on Form S-8 or other appropriate forms under the Securities Act to
register Cardinal Common Shares necessary to fulfill Cardinal's obligation
pursuant to this Section 2.4, including those Cardinal Common Shares issuable
upon exercise of Cardinal Exchange Options and to use its reasonable efforts to
cause such registration statements to remain effective until the exercise or
expiration of all Cardinal Exchange Options.

     (c) Prior to the Effective Time: (i) the Board of Directors of Cardinal, or
an appropriate committee of non-employee directors of Cardinal, shall adopt a
binding resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the Commission
so that the acquisition by any officer or director of Syncor who may become a
covered person of Cardinal for purposes of Section 16 (together with the rules
and regulations thereunder, "Section 16") of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations thereunder, the
"Exchange Act"), of Cardinal Common Shares or Cardinal Exchange Options pursuant
to this Agreement and the Merger shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of
Section 16; and (ii) the Board of Directors of Syncor, or an appropriate
committee of non-employee directors of Syncor, shall adopt a binding resolution
consistent with the interpretive guidance of the Commission so that the
disposition by any officer or director of Syncor who is a covered person of
Syncor for purposes of Section 16 of shares of Syncor Common Stock or Syncor
Options pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger shall be an exempt transaction
for purposes of Section 16.

     (d) Cardinal shall be permitted to make additional grants of equal amounts
under the Syncor stock option plans following the Effective Time for an amount
of Cardinal Common Shares equal to the number of shares under the Syncor stock
option plans immediately prior to the Effective Time that are not subject to
outstanding awards, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio.

                                  ARTICLE III.

             REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF CARDINAL AND SUBCORP

     In order to induce Syncor to enter into this Agreement, Cardinal and
Subcorp hereby represent and warrant to Syncor that, subject to the
qualifications, limitations and exceptions set forth in this Agreement, the

corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of its state of incorporation with full corporate power and authority to own,
lease, use and operate its properties and to conduct its business as and where

duly qualified to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of the business conducted by it or the property it owns, leases or
operates, requires it to so qualify, except where the failure to be so qualified
or in good standing in such jurisdiction would not have a Material Adverse
Effect (as defined in Section 8.3) on Cardinal or Subcorp, as the case may be.
Cardinal is not in default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any
provision of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of Cardinal, as
amended (the "Cardinal Articles") or the Restated Code of Regulations of
Cardinal, as amended (the "Cardinal Code of Regulations"), and Subcorp is not in
default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any provisions of the
Subcorp Certificate of Incorporation or the Subcorp By-laws. Subcorp has, prior
to the date of this

                                       A-6

Agreement, furnished or made available to Syncor complete and correct copies of

Agreement, to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by Cardinal and Subcorp have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of each of Cardinal and Subcorp. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by each of Cardinal and Subcorp, and, assuming
this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Syncor, constitutes
the legal, valid and binding obligation of Cardinal and Subcorp enforceable
against each of them in accordance with its terms.

     3.3.  Capitalization of Cardinal and Subcorp.

     (a) As of June 12, 2002, Cardinal's authorized capital stock consisted
solely of (i) 750,000,000 common shares, without par value ("Cardinal Common
Shares"), of which (A) 450,657,143 shares were issued and outstanding, (B)
10,218,008 shares were issued and held in treasury (which does not include
Cardinal Common Shares reserved for issuance or issued and held in treasury as

issuance pursuant to equity based plans for employees and directors for Cardinal
and its subsidiaries or upon the exercise or conversion of options, warrants or
convertible securities granted or issuable by Cardinal and (D) shares will be
issued pursuant to equity based plans or upon the exercise or conversion of
options granted or issuable by Cardinal in connection with the anticipated
closing of the acquisition of Boron, LePore & Associates, Inc. in an amount
determined in accordance with the formula set forth in Section 3.3 to the
disclosure schedule delivered by Cardinal to Syncor and dated the date of this
Agreement (the "Cardinal Disclosure Schedule"), (ii) 5,000,000 Class B common
shares, without par value, none of which was issued and outstanding or reserved

all Cardinal Common Shares to be issued in connection with the Merger or upon
exercise of any Cardinal Exchange Option will be, duly authorized and validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and each outstanding share of capital
stock of Cardinal has not been, and all Cardinal Common Shares to be issued in

similar fee in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     3.6.  Reorganization.  To the best knowledge of Cardinal (including the
executive officers and directors of Cardinal), after due investigation, neither
Cardinal nor any of its affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action that

Commission all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents
required to be filed by it since January 1, 1999 under the Exchange Act or the
Securities Act (such documents, as supplemented and amended since the time of

including any financial statements or schedules included in the Cardinal SEC
Documents, at the time filed (and, in the case of registration statements and

therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (b) complied in

the Securities Act, as the case may be. The financial statements of Cardinal

                                       A-8

United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the
notes thereto, or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form
10-Q of the Commission), and fairly present in all material respects (subject,
in the case of unaudited statements, to normal, recurring audit adjustments) the

flows for the periods then ended.

     3.8.  Registration Statement.  None of the information provided in writing
by Cardinal for inclusion in the registration statement on Form S-4 (as amended,
supplemented or modified, the "Registration Statement") to be filed with the
Commission by Cardinal under the Securities Act, including the prospectus
relating to Cardinal Common Shares to be issued in the Merger and the proxy
statement and form of proxies relating to the vote of Syncor Stockholders with
respect to this Agreement (as amended, supplemented or modified, the "Proxy
Statement"), at the time the Registration Statement becomes effective, or, in
the case of the Proxy Statement, at the date of mailing and at the date of the
Syncor Stockholders Meeting (as defined in Section 5.3(a)) to consider the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The
Registration Statement and Proxy Statement, except for such portions of the
Registration Statement and Proxy Statement that relate only to Syncor, each will
comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act.

     3.9.  Compliance with Law.  Except as set forth in Section 3.9 to the
Cardinal Disclosure Schedule, Cardinal is in compliance with, and at all times
since January 1, 1999 has been in compliance with, all applicable laws,
statutes, orders, rules, regulations, policies or guidelines promulgated, or
judgments, decisions or orders entered by any Governmental Authority
(collectively, "Applicable Laws") relating to Cardinal or its business or
properties, except where the failure to be in compliance with such Applicable
Laws, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on Cardinal. Except as set forth in Section 3.9 to the
Cardinal Disclosure Schedule, no investigation or review by any Governmental
Authority with respect to Cardinal or its subsidiaries is pending, or, to the
knowledge of Cardinal, threatened, nor has any Governmental Authority indicated
in writing an intention to conduct the same, other than those the outcome of
which would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Cardinal.

     3.10.  Litigation.  Except as set forth in Section 3.10 to the Cardinal
Disclosure Schedule or in the Cardinal SEC Documents, there is no suit, claim,
action, proceeding, hearing, notice of violation, demand letter or investigation
(each, an "Action") pending, or, to the knowledge of Cardinal, threatened,
against Cardinal or any executive officer or director of Cardinal that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Cardinal or a material adverse effect on the ability
of Cardinal to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Cardinal is not subject to any outstanding order, writ, injunction or decree
specifically applicable to, or having a disproportionate effect on, Cardinal and
its subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Cardinal or a material adverse
effect on the ability of Cardinal to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Except as set forth in Section 3.10 to the Cardinal Disclosure
Schedule, since January 1, 1999, Cardinal has not been subject to any
outstanding material order, writ, injunction or decree relating to Cardinal's
method of doing business or its relationship with past, existing or future users
or purchasers of any goods or services of Cardinal.
