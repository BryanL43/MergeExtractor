                 MERGER PROPOSED--YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

   Amgen Inc. and Immunex Corporation have agreed to the acquisition of Immunex
by Amgen under the terms of a merger agreement. We are proposing the merger
because we believe it will benefit the stockholders of both companies by
creating more stockholder value than either company could create individually
and allowing stockholders to participate in a larger, more diversified company.
We also believe that the merger will enhance Amgen's position as a
biotechnology leader with a diverse portfolio of therapeutic drugs.

   When the merger is completed, Immunex shareholders will receive 0.44 of a
share of Amgen common stock and $4.50 in cash for each share of Immunex common
stock that they own. We estimate that Amgen will issue approximately
million shares of common stock in the merger and that immediately after the
merger Immunex shareholders will hold approximately ___% of the
then-outstanding shares of Amgen common stock, based on the number of shares of
Amgen and Immunex common stock outstanding on             , 2002. Amgen common
stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the trading symbol "AMGN."
On              , 2002, Amgen common stock closed at $     per share as
reported on the Nasdaq National Market. Amgen stockholders will continue to own
their existing shares which will not be affected by the merger. After the
merger, Immunex will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amgen.

   The merger cannot be completed unless the Amgen stockholders approve the
issuance of shares of Amgen common stock in the merger and the Immunex
shareholders approve the merger agreement. The obligations of Amgen and Immunex
to complete the merger are also subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
several conditions, including receiving clearance from regulatory agencies.
More information about Amgen, Immunex and the merger is contained in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus. We encourage you to read this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, including the section entitled "Risk Factors" beginning
on page 16 before voting.

    The board of directors of Amgen has unanimously approved the merger
agreement and the issuance of shares of Amgen common stock in the merger, and
the board of directors of Immunex has unanimously adopted the merger agreement.
The Amgen board of directors unanimously recommends that Amgen stockholders
vote " FOR " the proposal to approve the issuance of shares of Amgen common
stock in the merger. The Immunex board of directors unanimously recommends that
Immunex shareholders vote " FOR " the proposal to approve the merger agreement.

   Amgen and Immunex have each scheduled special meetings in connection with
the respective votes required. The dates, times and places of the meetings are
as follows:

                    QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q: Why am I receiving this joint proxy statement/prospectus?

A: Amgen and Immunex have agreed to the acquisition of Immunex by Amgen under
   the terms of a merger agreement that is described in this joint proxy
   statement/prospectus. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this
   joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.

   In order to complete the merger, Amgen stockholders must vote to approve the
   issuance of shares of Amgen common stock in the merger and Immunex
   shareholders must vote to approve the merger agreement.

   Amgen and Immunex will hold separate meetings of their respective
   stockholders to obtain these approvals. This joint proxy
   statement/prospectus contains important information about the merger and the
   special meetings of the respective stockholders of Amgen and Immunex, and
   you should read it carefully. The enclosed voting materials allow you to
   vote your shares without attending your respective special meeting.

   Your vote is important. We encourage you to vote as soon as possible.

Q: Why are Amgen and Immunex proposing the merger?

A: We believe that the merger will provide substantial strategic and financial
   benefits to the stockholders of both companies. We believe that the
   combination will create a stronger and more competitive biotechnology
   company that is capable of creating more stockholder value than either Amgen
   or Immunex could on its own. We believe that the merger will allow
   stockholders of both companies to participate in a larger, more diversified
   company. We also believe the merger will enhance Amgen's position as a
   biotechnology leader with a diverse portfolio of therapeutic drugs. To
   review the reasons for the merger in greater detail, see pages 30 and 32.
Q: What will happen in the merger?

A: A wholly-owned subsidiary of Amgen will merge with and into Immunex. As a
   result of the merger, Immunex will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of
   Amgen, and Immunex shareholders will receive 0.44 of a share of Amgen common
   stock and $4.50 in cash for each share of Immunex common stock they own,
   except that shares held by Immunex shareholders who validly exercise
   dissenters' rights will be subject to appraisal in accordance with
   Washington law. Based on the number of shares of Amgen and Immunex common
   stock outstanding on          , 2002, we estimate that Amgen will issue
   approximately      million shares of common stock in the merger and that
   immediately after the merger the former Immunex shareholders, in the
   aggregate, will own approximately   % of the then-outstanding shares of
   Amgen common stock.

   Example: If you currently own 100 shares of Immunex common stock, then as a
   result of the merger you will receive 44 shares of Amgen common stock and
   $450 in cash.

Q: Where and when are the special meetings?

A: The Amgen special meeting will take place at                            ,
   California, on            , 2002, at       .m., local time.

   The Immunex special meeting will take place at
                                  Seattle, Washington, on           , 2002 at
         .m., local time.

Q: What vote of Amgen stockholders is required to approve the issuance of Amgen
   common stock in the merger?

A: The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Amgen
   common stock present or represented by proxy and voting at the Amgen special
   meeting is required to approve the issuance of Amgen common stock to the
   Immunex shareholders in the merger.

Q: What vote of Immunex shareholders is required to approve the merger
   agreement?

A: The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
   of Immunex common stock entitled to vote is required to approve the merger
   agreement. As of         , 2002, the record date for the special meeting of
   Immunex shareholders, American Home Products Corporation beneficially owned
              shares of Immunex common stock, representing approximately   % of
   the outstanding shares of Immunex common stock. American Home Products has
   agreed to vote all of these shares in favor of approval of the merger
   agreement.

Q: How does my company's board of directors recommend that I vote?

A: The Amgen board of directors unanimously recommends that Amgen stockholders
   vote "FOR" the proposal to approve the issuance of shares of Amgen common
   stock to the Immunex shareholders in the merger. For a more complete
   description of the recommendation of the Amgen board of directors, see page
   19.

   The Immunex board of directors unanimously recommends that Immunex
   shareholders vote "FOR" the proposal to approve the merger agreement. For a
   more complete description of the recommendation of the Immunex board of
   directors, see page 23.

Q: How do I cast my vote?

A: If you are a holder of record, you may vote in person at your special
   meeting or by submitting a proxy for your special meeting. You can submit
   your proxy by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy
   card in the accompanying pre-addressed postage paid envelope. Amgen
   stockholders who own their shares of record can also submit a proxy over the
   Internet or by telephone. For specific instructions on how to use the
   telephone or the Internet to submit a proxy please refer to the instructions
   on your proxy card. In the case of Immunex shareholders, the failure to cast
   your vote will have the same effect as voting against the merger agreement.

   If you hold your shares in "street name," which means your shares are held
   of record by a broker, bank or nominee, you must provide the record holder
   of your shares with instructions on how to vote your shares. Please refer to
   the voting instruction card used by your broker, bank or nominee to see if
   you may submit voting instructions using the Internet or telephone.

Q: Can I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy?

A: Yes. If you are a record holder, you can change your vote at any time before
   your proxy is voted at your stockholders meeting by:

   .   delivering to the respective Secretary of Amgen or Immunex, as
       appropriate, a signed notice of revocation;

   .   granting a new, later-dated proxy, and if it is a written proxy, it must
       be signed and delivered to the respective Secretary of Amgen or Immunex,
       as appropriate; or

   .   attending your special meeting and voting in person, however, your
       attendance alone will not revoke your proxy.

   If you are an Amgen stockholder, you can also change your vote by submitting
   a proxy at a later date by telephone or over the Internet, in which case
   your later submitted proxy will be recorded and your earlier proxy revoked.
   However, whether you are an Amgen stockholder or an Immunex shareholder, if
   your shares are held in a street name account at a brokerage firm or bank,
   you must contact your broker, bank or other nominee to change your vote.

Q: Should I send in my Immunex stock certificates now?

A: No. After the merger is completed, you will receive written instructions
   from the exchange agent on how to exchange your Immunex stock certificates
   for the merger consideration. Please do not send in your Immunex stock
   certificates with your proxy.

Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?

A: You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple
   copies of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and multiple proxy cards or
   voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than
   one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card
   for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a holder of
   record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will
   receive more than one proxy card. In addition, if you are a stockholder of
   Amgen and a shareholder of Immunex, you will receive one or more separate
   proxy cards or voting instruction cards for each company. Please complete,
   sign, date and return each proxy card and voting instruction card that you
   receive.

Q: When do you expect the merger to be completed?

A: We are working to complete the merger as quickly as practicable. We
   currently expect to complete the merger in the second half of 2002. However,
   we cannot predict the exact timing of the completion of the merger because
   the merger is subject to United States and foreign regulatory approvals and
   other conditions. There may be a substantial period of time between the
   approval of the respective merger proposals by stockholders at the special
   meetings and the effectiveness of the merger.

Q: What rights do I have to seek a valuation of my shares:

A: If you are an Amgen stockholder, under applicable Delaware law, you will not
   have dissenters' rights of appraisal in connection with the issuance of
   Amgen common stock in the merger.

   If you are an Immunex shareholder, under applicable Washington law, you may
   assert dissenters' rights and receive a cash payment for the fair value of
   your shares, but only if you comply with all requirements of Washington law
   as set forth in Annex F of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Pursuant
   to your dissenters' rights under Washington law, you may seek a
   determination by a Washington court of the fair value of your shares. The
   fair value determined by the court may be more than, less than or equal to
   the value of the consideration to be paid in the merger.

Q: Who can help answer my questions?

A: If you have any questions about the merger or how to submit your proxy, or
   if you need additional copies of this joint proxy statement/prospectus or
   the enclosed proxy card or voting instructions, you should contact:

The Merger (see page 26)

   Amgen and Immunex have agreed to the acquisition of Immunex by Amgen under
the terms of the merger agreement that is described in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. We have attached the merger agreement as Annex A to this
joint proxy statement/prospectus. We encourage you to read the merger agreement

   Under the terms of the merger agreement, AMS Acquisition will merge with and
into Immunex, with Immunex surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Amgen. If you are an Immunex shareholder and do not validly exercise
dissenters' rights under Washington law, then, upon completion of the merger,

share of Amgen common stock and $4.50 in cash. We refer to the share and cash
consideration to be paid to the Immunex shareholders by Amgen as the merger
consideration. Amgen stockholders will continue to own their existing shares
which will not be affected by the merger.

merger agreement.

Stockholders and Shareholders Entitled to Vote; Vote Required (see pages 19 and
23)

  Amgen Stockholders

   You can vote at the Amgen special meeting if you owned Amgen common stock at
the close of business on       , 2002, the record date for the Amgen special
meeting. On that date, there were        shares of Amgen common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote. You can cast one vote for each share of Amgen
common stock that you owned on that date. Approval of the issuance of shares of
Amgen common stock in connection with the merger requires the affirmative vote
of the holders of a majority of the shares of Amgen common stock present or
represented by proxy and voted at the Amgen special meeting.

  Immunex Shareholders

   You can vote at the Immunex special meeting if you owned Immunex common
stock at the close of business on       , 2002, the record date for the Immunex
special meeting. On that date, there were        shares of Immunex common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote. You can cast one vote for each share of
Immunex common stock that you owned on that date. Approval of the merger
agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Immunex common stock entitled to vote.

Shareholder Voting Agreement (see page 80)

   Amgen has entered into a shareholder voting agreement with American Home
Products Corporation and two of its subsidiaries, MDP Holdings, Inc. and
Lederle Parenterals, Inc., pursuant to which these companies agreed, among
other things, to vote all of the shares of Immunex common stock beneficially
owned by them in favor of the approval of the merger agreement. As of the
record date, these companies beneficially owned        shares of Immunex common
stock, representing approximately       % of the outstanding shares of Immunex
common stock on that date.

Opinions of Financial Advisors (see pages 36 and 45)

  Amgen

   On December 16, 2001, Goldman, Sachs & Co., financial advisor to Amgen,
delivered to the Amgen board of directors its oral opinion, which was
subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated December 16,
2001, that, as of that date, and based upon and subject to the considerations
described in its opinion and based upon such other matters as Goldman Sachs
considered relevant, the merger consideration to be paid by Amgen for each
outstanding share of Immunex common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was
fair from a financial point of view to Amgen. The full text of Goldman Sachs'
written opinion is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex
D. We encourage you to read this opinion carefully in its entirety for a
description of the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered
and limitations on the review undertaken. Goldman Sachs' opinion is directed to
the Amgen board of directors and does not constitute a recommendation to any
stockholder as to any matters relating to the merger.

  Immunex

   On December 16, 2001, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated,
financial advisor to Immunex, delivered to the Immunex board of directors its
oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion
dated December 16, 2001, that, as of that date, and based upon and subject to
the factors and assumptions set forth in the opinion, the merger consideration
to be received by the holders of the shares of Immunex common stock pursuant to
the merger was fair to these holders, from a financial point of view. The full
text of Merrill Lynch's

written opinion is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex
E. We encourage you to read this opinion carefully in its entirety for a
description of the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered
and limitations on the review undertaken. Merrill Lynch's opinion is directed
to the Immunex board of directors and does not constitute a recommendation to
any shareholder as to any matters relating to the merger.

Ownership of Amgen after the Merger

   Amgen expects to issue approximately        million shares of Amgen common
stock in the merger. Based on the number of shares of Amgen and Immunex common
stock outstanding on              , 2002, after completion of the merger,
former Immunex shareholders will own approximately       % of the
then-outstanding shares of Amgen common stock.

Share Ownership of Directors and Executive Officers of Amgen and Immunex

   At the close of business on the record date for the Amgen special meeting,
directors and executive officers of Amgen and their affiliates beneficially
owned and were entitled to vote approximately        shares of Amgen common
stock, collectively representing approximately       % of the        shares of
Amgen common stock outstanding on that date.

   At the close of business on the record date for the Immunex special meeting,
directors and executive officers of Immunex and their affiliates beneficially
owned and were entitled to vote approximately        shares of Immunex common
stock (excluding shares owned by American Home Products or its affiliates),
collectively representing approximately       % percent of the        shares of
Immunex common stock outstanding on that date. As of the record date for the
Immunex special meeting, American Home Products, which has designated two
directors of Immunex in accordance with the terms of a governance agreement
with Immunex, beneficially owned a total of        shares of Immunex common
stock, or approximately   % of the shares of Immunex common stock outstanding
on that date.

Interests of Directors and Executive Officers of Immunex in the Merger (see
page 57)

   When considering the Immunex board of directors' recommendation that the
Immunex shareholders vote in favor of the approval of the merger agreement,
Immunex shareholders should be aware that some directors and executive officers
of Immunex have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in
addition to, the interests of Immunex shareholders.

   The Immunex board of directors knew about these additional interests, and
considered them, among other matters, when it adopted the merger agreement.

Listing of Amgen Common Stock and Delisting of Immunex Common Stock (see page
56)

   Application will be made to have the shares of Amgen common stock issued in
the merger approved for listing on the Nasdaq National Market, where Amgen
common stock currently is traded under the symbol "AMGN." If the merger is
completed, Immunex common stock will no longer be listed on the Nasdaq National
Market and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and
Immunex will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.

Dissenters' Rights of Appraisal (see page 114)

  Amgen Stockholders

   Under applicable Delaware law, Amgen stockholders will not have dissenters'
rights of appraisal in connection with the issuance of Amgen common stock in
the merger.

  Immunex Shareholders

   Under applicable Washington law, Immunex shareholders have the right to
dissent from the merger and to receive payment in cash for the appraised fair
value of their shares of Immunex common stock. The appraised value of their
shares

of Immunex common stock may be more than, less than or equal to the value of
the merger consideration. Each Immunex shareholder seeking to preserve
statutory dissenters' rights must:

   .   deliver to Immunex before the special meeting written notice of such
       shareholder's intent to exercise its dissenters' rights with respect to
       its shares of Immunex common stock if the merger is completed;

   .   not vote such shareholder's shares in favor of approval of the merger
       agreement; and

   .   follow the statutory procedures for perfecting dissenters' rights under
       Washington law, which are described in the section entitled "Dissenters'
       Rights--Appraisal Procedures."

   Merely voting against the merger agreement will not preserve your
dissenters' rights. Chapter 23B.13 of the Washington Business Corporation Act
is reprinted in its entirety and attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex F. Failure by an Immunex shareholder to precisely
comply with all procedures required by Washington law may result in the loss of
dissenters' rights for that shareholder.

Conditions to Completion of the Merger (see page 66)

   Completion of the merger depends on a number of conditions being met,
including:

   .   receipt of the required approvals from Amgen and Immunex stockholders;

   .   absence of breaches of the representations and warranties in the merger
       agreement which result in a material adverse effect on the representing
       party;

   .   material performance of each party's obligations under the merger
       agreement;

   .   absence of certain types of governmental orders or proceedings;

   .   receipt of opinions by Amgen and Immunex from their respective tax
       counsel that the merger will qualify as a reorganization under the
       Internal Revenue Code;

   .   receipt of material regulatory approvals, including the expiration or
       termination of the waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
       Improvements Act of 1976; and

   .   effectiveness of specific agreements between Amgen and American Home
       Products.

   Where legally permissible, a party may elect to waive a condition to its
obligation to complete the merger even though that condition has not been
satisfied.

No Solicitation by Immunex (see page 69)

   The merger agreement contains restrictions on the ability of Immunex to
solicit or engage in discussions or negotiations with a third party with
respect to a proposal to acquire a significant interest in Immunex.
Notwithstanding these restrictions, the merger agreement provides that under
specified circumstances, if Immunex receives an acquisition proposal from a
third party that is superior to the merger, Immunex may furnish nonpublic
information to that third party and engage in negotiations regarding an
acquisition proposal with that third party. Even if Immunex receives a proposal
from a third party that is superior to the merger, it is obligated to hold a
shareholders meeting to consider the merger.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (see page 76)

   Immunex and Amgen, by action of their respective boards of directors, may
mutually agree to terminate the merger agreement and abandon the merger at any
time prior to completion of the merger, whether before or after Immunex
shareholders have approved the merger agreement and Amgen stockholders have
approved the issuance of shares of Amgen common stock in the merger.

   In addition, either company could decide, without the consent of the other,
to terminate the

merger agreement in a number of situations, including:

   .   the merger is not completed by September 30, 2002 (which date may be
       extended to December 31, 2002 under some circumstances);

   .   a court or governmental authority permanently prohibits completion of
       the merger;

   .   the required approval of Amgen or Immunex stockholders is not obtained
       at the special meetings;

   .   the board of directors of the other party withdraws or adversely
       modifies its recommendation of the merger; or

   .   the other party breaches its representations, warranties or covenants in
       the merger agreement, which results in a failure of one of the
       conditions to the completion of the merger being satisfied.

Termination Fee and Expenses (see pages 77 and 78)

   If the merger agreement is terminated, either Amgen or Immunex, in specified
circumstances, may be required to pay a termination fee of $475 million to the
other party or reimburse up to $15 million of the other party's expenses.

Immunex Stock Options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (see page 61)

   In general, upon completion of the merger, options to purchase shares of
Immunex common stock will be converted into options to purchase shares of Amgen
common stock and assumed by Amgen. The conversion ratios and exercise prices
will be determined pursuant to the merger agreement. In addition, some
converted options will become fully vested and exercisable at the effective
time of the merger. Amgen has agreed to assume the Immunex stock option plans
at the effective time of the merger.

   Each outstanding purchase right under the Immunex employee stock purchase
plan will be assumed by Amgen and converted into a right to purchase Amgen
common stock in accordance with the merger agreement and the employee stock
purchase plan. Amgen has agreed to assume the Immunex employee stock purchase
plan at the effective time of the merger.

Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (see page
52)

   It is expected that the merger will qualify as a reorganization under
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and Amgen and Immunex are required
to receive opinions from their respective counsel to the effect that the merger
will so qualify. If these opinions are not rendered, Amgen and Immunex will not
consummate the merger unless approvals from Amgen stockholders and Immunex
shareholders are obtained with appropriate disclosure. If the merger qualifies
as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, then, in
general, Immunex shareholders will recognize gain, but not loss, equal to the
lesser of:

   .   the amount of cash they receive in the merger; or

   .   the amount equal to the excess, if any, of the sum of the amount of cash
       and the fair market value of Amgen common stock they receive in the
       merger over the adjusted tax basis of their Immunex common stock.

   No gain or loss will be recognized by Amgen, AMS Acquisition, Immunex or
stockholders of Amgen as a result of the merger.

   Tax matters are very complicated and the tax consequences of the merger to
you will depend on the facts of your own situation. We encourage you to consult
your tax advisor for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the merger
to you.

Accounting Treatment (see page 55)

   Amgen will account for the merger under the purchase method of accounting
for business combinations under United States generally accepted accounting
principles.

Regulatory Approvals (see page 52)

   Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, we cannot complete
the merger until we have notified the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department
of Justice and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission of the merger and filed the
necessary report forms and until the required waiting periods have ended. Amgen
and Immunex submitted the required filings on January 7, 2002. Amgen and
Immunex will make a joint filing relating to the merger with the German Federal
Cartel Office.

   We also may be required to obtain additional regulatory approvals from
various state and foreign authorities. While we expect to obtain all required
regulatory approvals, we cannot assure you that these regulatory approvals will
be obtained or that the granting of these regulatory approvals will not involve
the imposition of conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes
to the terms of the merger. These conditions or changes could result in the
conditions to the merger not being satisfied.

Litigation Related to the Merger (see page 64)

   As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Immunex is aware of
three purported class action lawsuits that have been filed against Immunex and
its officers and/or directors in connection with the merger. American Home
Products is also a defendant in one of these lawsuits. Among other things,
these lawsuits seek to prevent the closing of the merger.

   While these cases are in their early stages, Immunex believes that these
cases are without merit and intends to contest them vigorously. American Home
Products has advised Immunex that it also believes the lawsuit in which it is a
defendant is without merit and it intends to contest the lawsuit vigorously.

        Summary Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combining Financial Data

   The table below presents selected financial data from the Amgen and Immunex
unaudited pro forma condensed combining statements of operations for the year
ended December 31, 2000 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2001 and
from the unaudited pro forma condensed combining balance sheet as of September
30, 2001 included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The unaudited pro
forma condensed combining statements of operations give effect to the merger as
if it had occurred on January 1, 2000. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combining balance sheet presents the combined financial position of Amgen and
Immunex as of September 30, 2001 assuming that the acquisition had occurred as
of that date. The unaudited pro forma condensed combining financial data are
based on the estimates and assumptions set forth in the notes to such
statements, which are preliminary and have been made solely for the purposes of
developing such pro forma information. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combining financial data are not necessarily indicative of the financial
position or operating results that would have been achieved had the transaction
been consummated as of the dates indicated, nor are they necessarily indicative
of future financial position or operating results. This information should be
read in conjunction with the unaudited pro forma condensed combining financial
statements and related notes and the historical financial statements and
related notes of Amgen and Immunex included in or incorporated by reference
into this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

(1) The historical book value per share is calculated by dividing stockholders'
    equity by the number of shares outstanding at the end of each period
    presented.
(2) The pro forma combined book value per share is computed by dividing pro
    forma stockholders' equity by the pro forma number of Amgen shares that
    would have been outstanding as of September 30, 2001.
(3) The equivalent pro forma Immunex amounts are calculated by multiplying the
    pro forma combined per share amounts by the exchange ratio of 0.44 of a
    share of Amgen common stock for each share of Immunex common stock.

   On December 14, 2001, the last trading day before we announced the merger,
the closing price of Amgen common stock on the Nasdaq National Market was
$56.03 per share and the closing price of Immunex common stock on the Nasdaq
National Market was $25.62 per share. Based on the exchange ratio (i.e., 0.44
of a share of Amgen common stock for each outstanding share of Immunex common
stock), the closing price of Amgen common stock on December 14, 2001, and the
cash consideration of $4.50 per share, the pro forma equivalent per share value
of Immunex common stock on December 14, 2001 was approximately $29.15 per
share. On       , 2002, the last trading day prior to the date of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus, the closing price of Amgen common stock on the
Nasdaq National Market was $      , the closing price of Immunex common stock
on the Nasdaq National Market was $       and the pro forma equivalent per
share value of Immunex common stock, based on the merger consideration, was
approximately $       per share. Neither Amgen nor Immunex has ever declared or
paid cash dividends on its common stock. The policies of Amgen and Immunex are
to retain earnings for use in their respective businesses.

   The market value of the shares of Amgen common stock that will be issued in
exchange for shares of Immunex common stock upon the completion of the merger
will not be known at the time Immunex shareholders vote on the approval of the
merger agreement, or at the time Amgen stockholders vote on the approval of the
issuance of shares of Amgen common stock in the merger, because the merger will
not be completed by then.

   The above table shows only historical comparisons. Because the market prices
of Amgen common stock and Immunex common stock will likely fluctuate prior to
the merger, these comparisons may not provide meaningful information to Amgen
stockholders in determining whether to approve the issuance of shares of Amgen
common stock in the merger or to Immunex shareholders in determining whether to
approve the merger agreement. Amgen and Immunex stockholders are encouraged to
obtain current market quotations for Amgen and Immunex common stock and to
review carefully the other information contained in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus or incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus in considering whether to approve their respective
proposal. See the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information."

                                 RISK FACTORS

   In addition to the other information included in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, including the matters addressed in "Cautionary Statement
Concerning Forward-Looking Statements," you should carefully consider the
following risks before deciding whether to vote for approval of the merger
agreement, in the case of Immunex shareholders, or for approval of the issuance
of shares of Amgen common stock in the merger, in the case of Amgen
stockholders. In addition, you should read and consider the risks associated
with each of the businesses of Amgen and Immunex because these risks will also
affect the combined company. These risks can be found in our respective Annual
Reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000 and in our respective
Quarterly Reports for the quarters ended March 31, 2001, June 30, 2001 and
September 30, 2001, which are filed with the SEC and incorporated by reference
into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Additional risks and uncertainties
not presently known to Amgen and Immunex or that are not currently believed to
be important to you also may adversely affect the merger and Amgen following
the merger.

The value of Amgen common stock to be received in the merger will fluctuate.

   In the merger, Immunex shareholders will receive 0.44 of a share of Amgen
common stock and $4.50 in cash for each share of Immunex common stock they own.
As a result of Immunex shareholders receiving a portion of the merger
consideration in shares of Amgen common stock, the value of the merger
consideration to be received by Immunex shareholders will depend on the market
price of Amgen common stock at the time the merger is completed. The market
price of Amgen common stock at the closing of the merger will likely vary from
its market prices at the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and at
the date of the Amgen and Immunex special meetings. These variations may be
caused by a number of factors, including changes in the businesses, operations
or prospects of Amgen or Immunex, the timing of the merger, regulatory
considerations and general market and economic conditions. The merger
consideration will not be adjusted for any increase or decrease in the market
price of Amgen common stock or Immunex common stock. Accordingly, if the market
value of Amgen common stock declines prior to the time the merger is completed,
the value of the merger consideration to be received by Immunex shareholders
will decline. In addition, because the date that the merger is completed may be
later than the date of the special meetings, Amgen and Immunex stockholders
will not know the exact value of the Amgen common stock that will be issued in
the merger at the time they vote on the merger proposals. We encourage you to
obtain current market quotations for Amgen and Immunex shares before you vote
your shares.

Amgen may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the merger.

   The success of the merger will depend, in part, on the ability of Amgen to
realize the anticipated synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities from
integrating the businesses of Immunex with the businesses of Amgen. Amgen's
success in realizing these benefits and the timing of this realization depend
upon the successful integration of the operations of Immunex. The integration
of two independent companies is a complex, costly and time-consuming process.
The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among
others:

   .   consolidating research and development and manufacturing operations;

   .   retaining key employees;

   .   consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures;

   .   coordinating sales and marketing functions;

   .   preserving the research and development, distribution, marketing,
       promotion and other important relationships of Amgen and Immunex;

   .   minimizing the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business
       concerns; and

   .   coordinating geographically separate organizations.

We cannot assure you that the integration of Immunex with Amgen will result in
the realization of the full benefits anticipated by us to result from the
merger.

Amgen and Immunex may be required to comply with material restrictions or
conditions in order to obtain the regulatory approvals required to complete the
merger.

   The merger is subject to review by the Antitrust Division of the U.S.
Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. Under this statute, Amgen
and Immunex are required to make pre-merger notification filings and to await
the expiration or early termination of statutory waiting periods prior to
completing the merger. The merger is also subject to review by the German
Federal Cartel Office under the Act against Restraints of Competition (Gesetz
gegen Wettbewerbsbeschrankungen). The merger may also be subject to review by
the governmental authorities of various other jurisdictions. The governmental
entities from whom approvals are required may attempt to condition their
approval of the merger, or of the transfer to Amgen of licenses and other
entitlements, on the satisfaction of certain regulatory conditions that may
have the effect of imposing additional costs on Amgen or otherwise
substantially reducing the benefits to Amgen if the merger is completed. These
conditions could include a complete or partial license, divestiture, spin-off
or the holding separate of assets or businesses. In order to facilitate
clearance from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Immunex intends to divest the
product LEUKINE, which had sales for Immunex of $108.4 million in 2001. Amgen
and Immunex have not yet obtained any of the regulatory approvals required to
complete the merger.

Amgen's marketing of ENBREL will be dependent in part upon American Home
Products.

   Under the amended and restated promotion agreement, Amgen and American Home
Products will jointly market and sell ENBREL in the United States and Canada.
An ENBREL management committee comprised of an equal number of representatives
from Amgen and American Home Products will be responsible for overseeing the
marketing and sales of ENBREL including strategic planning, approval of an
annual marketing plan, product pricing and establishing an ENBREL brand team.
The ENBREL brand team, with equal representation from each of Amgen and
American Home Products, will prepare and implement the annual marketing plan
and will be responsible for all sales activities. If American Home Products
fails to market ENBREL effectively or Amgen and American Home Products fail to
coordinate their efforts effectively, Amgen's sales of ENBREL may not reach
their full potential or may decline.

other matters that may properly come before the special meeting.

Recommendation of the Amgen Board of Directors

   The Amgen board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement,
and unanimously recommends that Amgen stockholders vote "FOR" approval of the
issuance of Amgen common stock to Immunex shareholders in the merger. See "The
Merger--Reasons for the Merger--Amgen."

Record Date; Outstanding Shares; Shares Entitled to Vote

   Only holders of record of Amgen common stock at the close of business on the
record date, ______________ , 2002, are entitled to notice of and to vote at
the special meeting. As of the record date, there were ______ shares of Amgen
common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting, held by
approximately ______ holders of record. A list of Amgen stockholders will be
available for review at Amgen's executive offices during regular business hours
for a period of ten days before the special meeting. Each holder of Amgen
common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of Amgen common stock he or
she owned as of the record date.

Quorum and Vote Required

   A quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold a valid special meeting. The
presence, in person or by proxy, of shares of Amgen common stock representing a
majority of shares of Amgen common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on
the Amgen record date is necessary to constitute a quorum at the Amgen special
meeting. Abstentions and broker "non-votes," discussed below, count as present
for establishing a quorum.

   The issuance of the Amgen common stock in the merger requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Amgen common stock present or
represented by proxy and voting at the Amgen special meeting. Each share of
Amgen common stock outstanding on the record date for the special meeting
entitles its holder to one vote.

   As of the record date for the special meeting, the directors and executive
officers of Amgen as a group beneficially owned approximately __________shares
of Amgen common stock, including exercisable options, or approximately ______%
of the outstanding shares of Amgen on that date. As of the record date, there
were        shares of Amgen common stock held by employees of Amgen through the
Amgen Inc. Retirement and Savings Plan and the Retirement and Savings Plan for
Amgen Manufacturing, Ltd., and each of these shares will be voted by the
trustee of the plan in accordance with the instructions it receives from the
respective plan participant. The trustee will vote any shares of Amgen common
stock for which it has not received instructions in the same proportion as the
trustee votes the shares for which it has received instructions from plan
participants.

Voting; Proxies; Revocation

   You may vote by proxy or in person at the special meeting.

  Voting in Person

   If you plan to attend the special meeting and wish to vote in person, you
will be given a ballot at the special meeting. Please note, however, that if
your shares are held in "street name," which means your shares are held of
record by a broker, bank or other nominee, and you wish to vote at the special
meeting, you must bring to the special meeting a proxy from the record holder
of the shares authorizing you to vote at the special meeting.

  Voting by Proxy

   You should vote your proxy even if you plan to attend the special meeting.
You can always change your vote at the special meeting. Voting instructions are
included on your proxy card. If you properly grant your proxy and submit it to
Amgen in time to vote, one of the individuals named as your proxy will vote
your shares as you have directed. If no instructions are indicated on a
properly executed proxy card or voting instruction, the shares will be voted
"FOR" approval of the issuance of the shares of Amgen common stock in the
merger.

   If other matters properly come before the Amgen special meeting, the shares
represented by proxies will be voted, or not voted, by the individuals named in
the proxies in their discretion. No proxy that is voted against approval of the
issuance of shares of Amgen common stock in the merger will be voted in favor
of any adjournment or postponement of the Amgen special meeting for the purpose
of soliciting additional proxies.

   How to vote by proxy:

   .   In Writing: Amgen stockholders of record may submit their proxies
       through the mail by completing their proxy card, and signing, dating and
       returning it in the enclosed, pre-addressed postage-paid envelope. To be
       valid, a returned proxy card must be signed and dated.

   .   By Telephone: Amgen stockholders of record will be able to use the
       telephone to submit their proxies. In order to submit your proxy by
       telephone, you must dial the toll-free number 1-___-___-____, enter the
       Control Number located on your proxy card and follow the recorded
       instructions.

   .   Over the Internet: Amgen stockholders of record also may use the
       Internet to submit their proxies. In order to submit your proxy over the
       Internet, you must go to the Web site established for that purpose at
       http://www._________.com, enter the Control Number located on your proxy
       card and follow the instructions.

   The laws of the state of Delaware, where Amgen is incorporated, permit a
stockholder to grant a proxy in each of these ways. However, if you are not the
record holder of your shares, you must provide the record holder of your shares
with instructions on how to vote your shares. The bank, broker or other nominee
holding your shares may not offer telephone or Internet voting. Amgen
stockholders whose shares are held by a bank, broker or other nominee should
refer to their voting instruction card forwarded by the bank, broker or other
nominee holding their shares. If your voting instruction card does not include
telephone or Internet voting instructions, please complete and return your
voting instruction card by mail.

  Revocation of Proxy

   You may revoke your proxy at any time before they are voted at the Amgen
special meeting by:

   .   delivering to the Secretary of Amgen a signed notice of revocation,
       bearing a date later than the date of the proxy, stating that the proxy
       is revoked;

   .   granting a new proxy, relating to the same shares and bearing a later
       date; or

   .   attending the special meeting and voting in person, however, attendance
       at the special meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy.

You can also change your vote by submitting a proxy at a later date by
telephone or over the Internet, in which case your later submitted proxy will
be recorded and your earlier proxy revoked. If your shares are held in the name
of a broker, bank or other nominee, you may change your vote by submitting new
voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee. You must contact
your broker, bank or other nominee to find out how to do so.

   Written notices of revocation and other communications with respect to the
revocation of Amgen proxies should be addressed to:

          Amgen Inc.
          One Amgen Center Drive
          Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799
          Attention: Corporate Secretary, Mail Stop 27-4-A

Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

   Shares of Amgen common stock held by persons attending the Amgen special
meeting but not voting, and shares of Amgen common stock for which Amgen has
received proxies but with respect to which holders of those shares have
abstained from voting, will be counted as present at the Amgen special meeting
for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the
transaction of business at the Amgen special meeting, but will not be counted
as votes cast at the Amgen special meeting for purposes of determining whether
stockholder approval of the issuance of shares of Amgen common stock in the
merger has been obtained.

   Brokers that hold shares of Amgen common stock in nominee or street name for
customers who are the beneficial owners of those shares are prohibited from
giving a proxy to vote shares held for those customers on the matters to be
considered and voted upon at the Amgen special meeting without specific
instructions from those customers. Accordingly, if your broker holds your Amgen
common stock in nominee or street name, your broker will vote your shares only
if you provide instructions on how to vote by filling out the voting
instruction form sent to you by your broker with this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. If you do not provide your broker with voting
instructions, your unvoted shares, so-called "broker non-votes," will be
counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists, but will not be
counted as votes cast at the Amgen special meeting for purposes of determining
whether stockholder approval of the issuance of shares of Amgen common stock in
the merger has been obtained.

Proxy Solicitation

   Amgen is soliciting proxies for the Amgen special meeting from Amgen
stockholders. Amgen will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies from Amgen
stockholders, except that Amgen and Immunex have each agreed to pay one-half of
the costs of filing, printing and mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus
and related proxy materials. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by
mail, Amgen will request that banks, brokers and other record holders send
proxies and proxy materials to the beneficial owners of Amgen common stock held
by them and secure their voting instructions if necessary. Amgen will reimburse
those record holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing. Amgen has also
made arrangements with Georgeson Shareholder Communications, Inc. to assist it
in soliciting proxies, and has agreed to pay a fee of approximately $20,000
plus expenses for those services. Amgen also may use several of its regular
employees, who will not be specially compensated, to solicit proxies from Amgen
stockholders, either personally or by telephone, Internet, telegram, facsimile
or special delivery letter.

Other Business; Adjournments

   Amgen does not expect that any matter other than approval of the issuance of
the shares will be brought before the special meeting. However, if other
matters are properly presented at the special meeting or any adjournment or
postponement of the special meeting, the persons named as proxies will vote in
accordance with

their best judgment with respect to those matters. Under the laws of the state
of Delaware, no business may be raised at the Amgen special meeting unless
proper notice to the Amgen stockholders has been given.

   Adjournments may be made for the purpose of, among other things, soliciting
additional proxies. An adjournment may be made from time to time by approval of
the holders of shares representing a majority of the votes present in person or
by proxy at the special meeting, whether or not a quorum exists, without
further notice other than by an announcement made at the special meeting. If
the adjournment is for more than 30 days, a notice of the adjourned meeting
will be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting. Amgen does
not currently intend to seek an adjournment of the special meeting.

and unanimously recommends that Immunex shareholders vote "FOR" approval of the
merger agreement. See "The Merger--Reasons for the Merger--Immunex."

Record Date; Outstanding Shares; Shares Entitled to Vote

   Only holders of record of Immunex common stock at the close of business on
the record date, __________ , 2002, are entitled to notice of and to vote at
the special meeting. As of the record date, there were ______ shares of Immunex
common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting, held by
approximately __________ holders of record. A list of Immunex shareholders will
be available for review at the executive offices of Immunex during regular
business hours for a period of ten days before the special meeting. Each holder
of Immunex common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of Immunex
common stock he or she owned as of the record date. If you do not vote, either
in person or by proxy, it will have the same effect as voting against the
merger agreement.

Quorum and Vote Required

   A quorum of shareholders is necessary to hold a valid special meeting. The

Voting; Proxies; Revocation

   You may vote by proxy or in person at the special meeting.

  Voting in Person

   If you plan to attend the special meeting and wish to vote in person, you
will be given a ballot at the special meeting. Please note, however, that if
your shares are held in "street name," which means your shares are held of
record by a broker, bank or other nominee, and you wish to vote at the special
meeting, you must bring to the special meeting a proxy from the record holder
of the shares authorizing you to vote at the special meeting.

  Voting by Proxy

   You should vote your proxy even if you plan to attend the special meeting.
You can always change your vote at the special meeting. Voting instructions are
included on your proxy card. If you properly give your proxy and submit it to
Immunex in time to vote, one of the individuals named as your proxy will vote
your shares as you have directed.

   The method of voting by proxy differs for shares held as a record holder and
shares held in street name. If you hold your shares of Immunex common stock as
a record holder you will receive a proxy card. You should complete, date and
sign the proxy card and promptly return it in the enclosed, pre-addressed,
postage-paid envelope or otherwise mail it to Immunex. If you hold your shares
of Immunex common stock in street name, you will receive instructions from your
broker, bank or other nominee that you must follow in order to vote your
shares. Your broker or bank may allow you to deliver your voting instructions
by the telephone or over the Internet. Please see the intructions that
accompany this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

   All properly signed proxies that are received prior to the special meeting
and that are not revoked will be voted at the special meeting according to the
instructions indicated on the proxies or, if no direction is indicated, to
approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.

   You should not send in any certificates representing Immunex common stock at
this time. Following the completion of the merger, you will receive
instructions for the surrender and exchange of your Immunex stock certificates.

  Revocation of Proxy

   You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised at the special
meeting by taking any of the following actions:

   .   delivering to the Secretary of Immunex a signed notice of revocation,
       bearing a date later than the date of the proxy, stating that the proxy
       is revoked;

   .   signing and delivering a new proxy, relating to the same shares and
       bearing a later date; or

   .   attending the special meeting and voting in person, however, attendance
       at the special meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy.

   If your shares are held in street name, you may change your vote by
submitting new voting instructions to your brokers, bank or other nominee. You
must contact your broker, bank or other nominee to find out how to do so.

   Written notices of revocation and other communications with respect to the
revocation of Immunex proxies should be addressed to:

          Immunex Corporation
          51 University Street
          Seattle, Washington 98101
          Attention: Corporate Secretary

Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

   Brokers who hold shares of Immunex common stock in street name for a
beneficial owner of those shares typically have the authority to vote on
"routine" proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial
owners. However, brokers are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion
with respect to the approval of non-routine matters, such as approval of the
merger agreement, without specific instructions from the beneficial owner.
These non-voted shares are referred to as broker non-votes. If your broker
holds your Immunex common stock in street name, your broker will vote your
shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote by filling out the voter
instruction form sent to you by your broker with this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

   Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as voting against
the merger agreement.

Proxy Solicitation

   Immunex is soliciting proxies for the special meeting from shareholders of
Immunex. Immunex will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies from Immunex
shareholders, except that Immunex and Amgen have each agreed to pay one-half of
the costs of filing, printing and mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus
and related proxy materials. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by
mail, Immunex will request that banks, brokers and other record holders send
proxies and proxy materials to the beneficial owners of Immunex common stock
held by them and secure their voting instructions if necessary. Immunex will
reimburse those record holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing.
Immunex has also made arrangements with MacKenzie Partners, Inc. to assist it
in soliciting proxies, and has agreed to pay a fee of approximately $6,500 plus
expenses for those services. Immunex also may use several of its regular
employees, who will not be specially compensated, to solicit proxies from
Immunex shareholders, either personally or by telephone, Internet, telegram,
facsimile or special delivery letter.

Other Business; Adjournments

   Immunex does not expect that any matter other than approval of the merger
agreement will be brought before the special meeting. However, if other matters
incident to the conduct of the special meeting are properly presented at the
special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting, the
persons named as proxies will vote in accordance with their best judgment with
respect to those matters. Under the laws of the state of Washington, where
Immunex is incorporated, only business for which proper notice to the Immunex
shareholders has been given may be conducted at the Immunex special meeting.

   Adjournments may be made for the purpose of, among other things, soliciting
additional proxies. An adjournment may be made from time to time by approval of
the holders of shares representing a majority of the votes present in person or
by proxy at the special meeting, whether or not a quorum exists, without
further notice other than by an announcement made at the special meeting.
Immunex does not currently intend to seek an adjournment of the special meeting.

   The following is a description of the material aspects of the merger. While
we believe that the following description covers the material terms of the
merger, the description may not contain all of the information that is
important to you. We encourage you to read carefully this entire joint proxy
statement/prospectus, including the merger agreement attached to this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A, for a more complete understanding of the
merger.

General

   Each of the Amgen board of directors and the Immunex board of directors has
unanimously approved the merger agreement. At the effective time of the merger,
AMS Acquisition will be merged with and into Immunex, and Immunex will become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Amgen. Immunex shareholders will receive 0.44 of a
share of Amgen common stock and $4.50 in cash for each share of Immunex common
stock they own. The cash portion of the merger consideration is expected to be
paid out of Amgen's existing funds, cash provided by operating activities,
additional borrowings or a combination of these sources.

Background of the Merger

   The management of each of Amgen and Immunex continually reviews its
company's respective position in light of the changing competitive environment
of the biotechnology industry with the objective of determining what strategic
alternatives are available to enhance stockholder value. While each of the
companies believes that it has positive future prospects on a stand-alone
basis, from time to time the management of each of Amgen and Immunex has had
conversations with other companies to explore opportunities to improve the
competitive position of Amgen or Immunex, respectively, including potential
acquisitions or dispositions of assets, joint ventures or other strategic
transactions.

   In early 2000, Kevin W. Sharer, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and
President of Amgen, and Edward V. Fritzky, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer
and President of Immunex, met during a biotechnology industry conference in San
Francisco, California and discussed their general interest in exploring
possible strategic or other transactions involving their two companies. The
discussions were followed by telephone calls later in 2000 and early 2001, but
they did not lead to substantive negotiations at that time.

   In February 2001, Immunex engaged Merrill Lynch to assist Immunex in
reviewing strategic alternatives that might be available to it to enhance
shareholder value, including possible business combination transactions.
Merrill Lynch's engagement was later memorialized in writing pursuant to a
letter dated August 1, 2001.

   In June 2001, Mr. Sharer contacted Mr. Fritzky to raise the possibility of a
combination of Amgen and Immunex. On several occasions between June and
September 2001, Messrs. Sharer and Fritzky discussed the possibility of a
transaction between their two companies.

   In connection with the initial discussions, Amgen began consulting with
financial and legal advisors about issues relating to a possible transaction
with Immunex. Amgen retained Goldman, Sachs & Co., Bear, Stearns & Co. and,
later, Salomon Smith Barney as its financial advisors. Consultations with these
advisors continued throughout the remaining acquisition discussions.

   In mid-year 2001, Immunex began preliminary discussions with a third party
regarding a potential business combination transaction. These preliminary
discussions continued during the summer of 2001, but were suspended in the fall
of 2001.

   Between early October 2001 and mid-November 2001, executives of Amgen and
Immunex had several communications relating to a possible transaction. Mr.
Fritzky discussed these communications from time to time with Robert Essner,
Chief Executive Officer and President of American Home Products. On October 29,
2001, Amgen sent Immunex a letter proposing that Amgen would be willing to
pursue a transaction based on an exchange ratio of between 0.47 to 0.50 of a
share of Amgen common stock for each share of Immunex common stock, subject to
Amgen's satisfactory completion of due diligence.

   Mr. Sharer also contacted Mr. Essner to ascertain whether American Home
Products would consider a disposition of its interest in Immunex. Mr. Essner
indicated that American Home Products would be supportive if the Immunex board
of directors determined to pursue a transaction with Amgen at a satisfactory
valuation and if other necessary commercial matters could be agreed upon by the
parties. Mr. Sharer indicated that, as a condition to Amgen entering into an
acquisition agreement with Immunex, Amgen would require American Home Products
to agree to vote in favor of the transaction. Over the next several weeks,
Messrs. Sharer and Essner had periodic conversations to discuss a possible
transaction, as did Mr. Fritzky and Mr. Essner.

   On November 1, 2001, during a telephone conversation between Messrs. Fritzky
and Sharer, Mr. Fritzky indicated that Immunex would not be interested in
pursuing a transaction with Amgen unless the value of the consideration were at
a level above that proposed by Amgen in the October 29, 2001 letter, with a
meaningful portion of the consideration paid in cash.

   In order to understand better the position of American Home Products on
various matters relating to a possible transaction, in early November 2001,
representatives of Amgen and American Home Products had initial discussions
relating to the existing commercial relationship between Immunex and American
Home Products and the need for changes to such relationship in connection with
a possible transaction. The parties also discussed the need for an agreement
defining various rights and obligations of American Home Products upon its
becoming a stockholder of Amgen following a possible transaction. In
mid-November 2001, Amgen delivered to American Home Products a term sheet
outlining proposed terms for various agreements to be entered into between
Amgen and American Home Products in connection with a possible transaction.
American Home Products delivered to Amgen a counterproposal to this term sheet
in late November. At that time, Amgen and American Home Products did not reach
agreement on significant issues, including their respective co-promotion rights
with respect to ENBREL upon completion of a possible transaction.

   In order to further explore a possible transaction, Amgen and Immunex
executed a confidentiality and standstill agreement relating to a possible
transaction on November 14, 2001. On November 28, 2001, Amgen and American Home
Products executed a similar agreement relating to a possible transaction.

   On November 15, 2001, in response to the issues raised by Mr. Fritzky on
November 1, 2001, Amgen sent a letter to Immunex outlining the terms upon which
Amgen proposed to acquire Immunex. This letter proposed, subject to customary
conditions including satisfactory completion of due diligence review,
consideration equal to the value of 0.52 of a share of Amgen common stock for
each share of Immunex common stock. The letter also stated that Amgen was
willing to pay up to 15% of the total consideration in cash, with the remainder
of the consideration payable by means of an exchange of shares of Amgen common
stock for shares of Immunex common stock.

   Between November 15, 2001 and November 26, 2001, representatives of Amgen
and Immunex met or spoke on several occasions to discuss Amgen's November 15,
2001 letter. However, during this time, the parties did not reach agreement on
several significant terms raised in the letter, including the amount and form
of consideration.

   Despite lack of agreement regarding significant terms of a possible
transaction, Amgen's legal counsel delivered to Immunex and its legal advisors
a proposed form of merger agreement between Amgen and Immunex on November 26,
2001 in order to begin negotiating more ancillary terms of a possible
transaction. Thereafter, Amgen's legal counsel delivered to American Home
Products and its legal counsel proposed forms of a voting agreement between
Amgen and American Home Products, which provided for an agreement by American
Home Products to vote in favor of the proposed transaction and against
alternative transactions, a stockholders' rights agreement, which provided for
various rights and restrictions of American Home Products upon its becoming a
stockholder of Amgen following the merger, and an agreement relating to certain
governance and commercial matters. See "Shareholder Voting Agreement,"
"Stockholders' Rights Agreement" and "Other Agreements with American Home
Products."

   From November 26, 2001 through December 16, 2001, representatives and legal
advisors of Amgen, Immunex and American Home Products engaged in extensive
negotiations both in person and by telephone

regarding each of these agreements. During this period, representatives of
Amgen and Immunex also engaged in extensive discussions related to retention
and severance arrangements for employees of Immunex. In addition, Amgen and
American Home Products negotiated the terms of amendments to various existing
commercial arrangements between Immunex and American Home Products, including
the terms of an amended and restated promotion agreement. See "Other Agreements
with American Home Products."

   Notwithstanding that the parties had not yet reached agreement on
significant issues related to a proposed transaction, including the amount and
form of merger consideration and the roles of executive management following a
proposed transaction, Amgen and Immunex each made available to the other party
data rooms containing legal and business due diligence materials beginning on
December 1, 2001. From December 1, 2001 through December 15, 2001, the parties
reviewed these materials and conducted their on-site due diligence. During this
period, representatives of Amgen and Immunex also met to discuss business
integration issues and employee retention matters.

   On December 5, 2001, the Immunex board of directors held a special meeting
at which it was briefed on the status of discussions between Amgen and Immunex
and reviewed the possible transaction. Prior to the meeting, Immunex directors
were provided with draft agreements and other materials regarding the possible
transaction. At the meeting:

   .   Representatives of Merrill Lynch made a preliminary financial
       presentation setting forth Merrill Lynch's financial analyses relating
       to the possible transaction, which was similar to the final presentation
       made at the December 16, 2001 special meeting of the Immunex board of
       directors;

   .   Representatives of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP reviewed
       matters including the proposed terms of the merger agreement and the
       voting agreement and other agreements to be entered into among Amgen,
       American Home Products and certain subsidiaries of American Home
       Products, and the status of open issues; and

   .   Immunex management discussed with the board of directors the strategic
       rationale for the possible transaction and the challenges in trying to
       manage Immunex during the pendency of a transaction, as well as employee
       retention and severance arrangements intended to retain and to give
       incentives to Immunex employees during the pendency of the merger
       agreement and following the merger.

At the conclusion of the December 5, 2001 meeting, the Immunex board of
directors authorized Immunex management to continue discussions with Amgen
regarding a possible transaction.

   At a regular meeting of the Amgen board of directors on December 11, 2001,
the Amgen board extensively reviewed the proposed transaction. Prior to the
meeting, the Amgen board was provided with summaries of each of the transaction
documents between Amgen and Immunex and American Home Products. At the meeting:

   .   Amgen management reviewed the status of the negotiations of the proposed
       transaction, indicating that the parties had not reached agreement on
       significant issues, including the amount and form of consideration to be
       paid to Immunex shareholders and the commercial arrangements with
       American Home Products;

   .   Representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed financial analyses relating
       to the proposed transaction;

   .   Representatives of Latham & Watkins reviewed legal matters including the
       proposed terms of, and open issues under, the merger agreement, the
       voting agreement, the stockholders' rights agreement, the amended and
       restated promotion agreement and other agreements to be entered into
       among Amgen, American Home Products and certain subsidiaries of American
       Home Products;

   .   Amgen management reviewed with the board the strategic rationale for,
       and the potential benefits and risks of, the proposed transaction, as
       well as possible alternative transactions; and

   .   Amgen management reported on the status and results of Amgen's due
       diligence review of Immunex.

   On December 13, 2001, several national news organizations, including CNBC,
began reporting rumors of a possible transaction between Amgen and Immunex.
These market rumors continued until the announcement of the transaction on
December 17, 2001.

   On December 13, 2001 and December 14, 2001, Mr. Sharer and senior officers
of Amgen met with Mr. Essner and senior officers of American Home Products at
American Home Products' headquarters in New Jersey to attempt to reach
agreement on the outstanding issues related to the commercial arrangements
between Amgen and American Home Products.

   On December 14, 2001, the Immunex board of directors held a special
telephonic meeting to discuss the status of discussions with Amgen and the
market rumors regarding a possible transaction. At this meeting, Mr. Fritzky
updated the Immunex board of directors regarding developments since the
December 5, 2001 meeting of the Immunex board of directors. Representatives of
Skadden, Arps reviewed significant open issues in the merger agreement,
including the amount of cash consideration and the exchange ratio for the stock
portion of the consideration, termination rights and termination fees, as well
as issues relating to the voting agreement proposed by Amgen and the other
agreements proposed to be entered into among Amgen, American Home Products and
certain subsidiaries of American Home Products. The Immunex board of directors
also discussed the status of employee retention and severance arrangements.

   A special telephonic meeting of the Amgen board of directors was held on the
morning of December 16, 2001 to consider approval of the merger agreement, the
agreements with American Home Products and the transactions contemplated by
these agreements. Prior to the meeting, the Amgen board was provided with
substantially final drafts of all of the transaction documents as well as a
summary of the revisions of these documents since the December 11, 2001
meeting. At the meeting:

   .   Amgen's senior management updated the Amgen board of directors on the
       final results of Amgen's due diligence review;

   .   Representatives of Latham & Watkins updated the Amgen board of directors
       on the significant revisions to the merger agreement and other
       transaction documents since the December 11, 2001 board meeting; and

   .   Representatives of Goldman Sachs made a financial presentation to the
       Amgen board of directors and delivered Goldman Sachs' oral opinion that,
       as of that date, and based upon and subject to the considerations to be
       described in its written opinion and based upon such other matters as
       Goldman Sachs considered relevant, the merger consideration to be paid
       by Amgen for each outstanding share of Immunex common stock pursuant to
       the merger agreement was fair to Amgen from a financial point of view.

Following a lengthy discussion, the Amgen board of directors unanimously
approved the merger agreement, the proposed merger, the issuance of shares in
the merger and each of the transaction documents to be executed by Amgen in
connection with the proposed transaction and unanimously resolved to recommend
that the Amgen stockholders vote to approve the issuance of shares of Amgen
common stock in the merger.

   A special meeting of the Immunex board of directors was held on December 16,
2001 to consider adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Prior to the meeting, the
Immunex board of directors was provided with materials, including substantially
final drafts of the merger agreement and related documents. At this meeting:

   .   Mr. Fritzky updated the Immunex board of directors on developments since
       the December 14, 2001 meeting of the Immunex board of directors, and
       reviewed strategic considerations in connection with the proposed
       transaction;

   .   Representatives of Merrill Lynch made a financial presentation and
       presented the fairness opinion of Merrill Lynch discussed in "Opinion of
       Financial Advisor--Immunex";

   .   Representatives of Skadden, Arps reviewed legal matters, including the
       terms of the proposed merger agreement and voting agreement, including
       changes negotiated since the December 5, 2001 meeting of the Immunex
       board of directors, and the principal terms of the other agreements to
       be entered into among Amgen, American Home Products and certain of
       subsidiaries of American Home Products; and

   .   Management of Immunex reviewed the due diligence that had been conducted
       on Amgen.

   During a recess in the Immunex board of directors meeting, representatives
of management and Skadden, Arps reviewed for the compensation committee of the
Immunex board of directors the severance and retention arrangements and
amendments to stock option plans that management recommended be considered in
connection with the proposed transaction, as well as the proposed employment
arrangement between Mr. Fritzky and

Amgen. Following discussion, the severance and retention and option plan
amendments were approved by the compensation committee and recommended to the
Immunex board of directors for approval. When the board of directors meeting
resumed, following lengthy discussion, the Immunex board of directors
unanimously adopted the merger agreement and approved the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the merger and unanimously resolved to
recommend that Immunex shareholders vote in favor of approval of the merger
agreement. The Immunex board of directors also approved the severance and
retention arrangements and amendments to the stock option plans of Immunex
described under "The Merger--Interests of Directors, Executive Officers and
Shareholders of Immunex in the Merger," which had been approved by the
compensation committee of the Immunex board of directors earlier that day.

   The merger agreement, the shareholder voting agreement, the stockholders'
rights agreement, the amended and restated promotion agreement and the
agreement regarding governance and commercial matters were executed by the
parties on the evening of December 16, 2001.

   On December 17, 2001, Amgen and Immunex issued a joint press release
announcing the execution of the merger agreement.

Reasons for the Merger--Amgen

   The Amgen board of directors believes that the acquisition of Immunex will
enhance Amgen's position as a biotechnology leader with a diverse portfolio of
therapeutic drugs. The Amgen board of directors has unanimously approved the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and
recommends that Amgen stockholders vote "FOR" approval of the issuance of Amgen
common stock in the merger.

   In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, the Amgen board of
directors consulted with senior members of Amgen's management team regarding
the strategic and operational aspects of the merger and the results of the due
diligence efforts undertaken by management and Amgen's legal advisors. In
addition, the Amgen board of directors held discussions with representatives of
Goldman Sachs and Amgen's other financial advisors regarding the past and
current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of
Immunex. The Amgen board of directors also consulted with Goldman Sachs as to
the fairness, from a financial point of view to Amgen, of the merger
consideration to be paid by Amgen. The Amgen board of directors also consulted
with Amgen's internal counsel and with representatives of Latham & Watkins
regarding legal due diligence matters and the terms of the merger agreement and
related agreements. Amgen management and the Amgen board of directors also
retained L.E.K. Consulting LLC to provide consulting services to Amgen. In
reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, the Amgen board of
directors considered a variety of factors, a number of which are summarized
below:

   .   Strengthened Strategic Position.   The Amgen board of directors
       considered that the merger would further enhance Amgen's role as a
       global biotechnology leader with the benefits of increased size, product
       base, product pipeline and employees. The Amgen board of directors
       determined that the combination of the leading Immunex product, ENBREL,
       with Amgen's existing drug portfolio, will enhance Amgen's position in
       the inflammation therapeutic area, which will complement Amgen's
       nephrology and oncology businesses. The Amgen board of directors
       concluded that the acquisition of Immunex would strengthen and diversify
       Amgen's product base and product pipeline in key therapeutic areas and
       enhance Amgen's strategic position within the biotechnology market.

   .   Synergies.  The Amgen board of directors reviewed the potential
       strategic and other benefits of the merger, including the complementary
       nature of the businesses of Immunex and Amgen and the opportunity for
       significant cost savings. The Amgen board of directors noted that,
       although no assurances can be given that any particular level of
       synergies will be achieved, Amgen's management anticipates cost
       synergies of more than $200 million in 2003, and more than $250 million
       in 2004. Amgen's ability to achieve these goals is subject to various
       factors, a number of which will be beyond its control, including
       economic conditions and unanticipated changes in business conditions,
       and, therefore, there can be no assurance that these results will be
       achieved. See "Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking
       Statements."

   .   ENBREL and Complementary Technology Base.  The Amgen board of directors
       considered the performance and future prospects of ENBREL and
       management's belief that the acquisition will accelerate ENBREL
       achieving its full market potential. The Amgen board of directors also
       considered the scientific expertise of the research, development and
       manufacturing personnel of Immunex and the proven ability of Immunex to
       develop successful drugs, and concluded that the merger will
       substantially enhance Amgen's discovery research capabilities in
       proteins and antibodies.

   .   Positioned for Long-Term Growth.  The Amgen board of directors
       considered the fact that the acquisition of Immunex would likely
       accelerate Amgen's future revenue and earnings growth, which would add
       stockholder value. The Amgen board of directors concluded that the
       acquisition of Immunex would improve Amgen's prospects for long-term
       growth by creating a larger biotechnology company with increased revenue
       and improved future earnings.

   .   Strategic Alternatives.  The Amgen board of directors reviewed other
       possible acquisition candidates and determined that the acquisition of
       Immunex was a strategic fit and presented a unique opportunity to
       enhance and expand Amgen's business, product line and position for
       future growth.

   .   Integration of Immunex.  The Amgen board of directors considered the
       fact that the combination of the businesses of Amgen and Immunex would
       be challenging. However, after consultation with Amgen management, the
       Amgen board of directors determined that the operations of Immunex could
       be integrated with those of Amgen in an efficient manner.

   .   Terms of the Merger Agreement.  The Amgen board of directors, with the
       assistance of counsel, considered the general terms of the merger
       agreement, including:

       -- Fixed Exchange Ratio.  The Amgen board of directors considered the
          fact that the fixed exchange ratio provides certainty as to the
          number of shares of Amgen common stock to be issued to Immunex
          shareholders and the percentage of the total shares of Amgen common
          stock that current Immunex shareholders will own after the merger.
          The Amgen board of directors also considered the premium that the
          merger consideration implied.

       -- No Solicitation; Termination Fee.  The Amgen board of directors
          reviewed the provisions of the merger agreement that limit the
          ability of Immunex to solicit other acquisition offers. The Amgen
          board of directors also considered the provisions that require the
          payment of a $475 million termination fee by Amgen or Immunex if the
          merger agreement is terminated due to specified reasons. The Amgen
          board of directors believed that these provisions were reasonable
          under the circumstances.

       -- Conditions to Consummation.  The Amgen board of directors reviewed
          with counsel the conditions to consummation of the merger, in
          particular the likelihood of obtaining the necessary regulatory
          approvals and stockholder approvals, and the likelihood that the
          merger would be completed. While the Amgen board of directors
          believes that these approvals will be obtained in a timely fashion,
          the Amgen board of directors also noted that Amgen is not required to
          agree to any divestitures or other actions that would reasonably be
          expected to have a material adverse effect on Amgen after giving
          effect to the merger.

   .   Opinion of Financial Advisor.  The Amgen board of directors considered
       the opinion of Goldman Sachs that, as of the date of its opinion, and
       based upon and subject to the considerations described in the opinion
       and based on such other matters as Goldman Sachs considered relevant,
       the merger consideration to be paid by Amgen for each outstanding share
       of Immunex common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a
       financial point of view to Amgen. See "Opinion of Financial
       Advisor--Amgen."

   .   Tax Treatment.  The Amgen board of directors also considered the
       expected qualification of the merger as a reorganization within the
       meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code resulting in the
       common stock portion of the merger consideration being received by
       Immunex shareholders free of federal income tax.

   .   Voting Agreement.  The Amgen board of directors also discussed the terms
       of the shareholder voting agreement between Amgen and American Home
       Products and two of its subsidiaries. The Amgen board of directors noted
       that these companies, which as of the record date for the Immunex
       special meeting, beneficially owned approximately ___% of the
       outstanding shares of Immunex common stock, have agreed to vote for
       approval of the merger agreement.

   .   American Home Products Agreements.  The Amgen board of directors also
       considered the terms and conditions of the stockholders' rights
       agreement, the agreement regarding governance and commercial matters and
       the amended and restated promotion agreement with American Home Products
       and certain of its subsidiaries. After consultation with senior
       management, the Amgen board of directors concluded that these agreements
       would increase the likelihood of a continued commercial relationship
       between American Home Products and Immunex after the merger and enable
       Amgen to obtain the benefits of these relationships.

   In addition, the Amgen board of directors also identified and considered a
variety of potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the
merger, including:

   .   the risk that the potential benefits sought in the merger might not be
       fully realized;

   .   the possibility that the merger might not be completed, or that
       completion might be unduly delayed;

   .   the effect of public announcement of the merger on Amgen's stock price;

   .   the projected dilution of Amgen's earnings per share as a result of the
       issuance of the shares in the merger, and the estimated time period for
       the merger to be accretive to Amgen's earnings per share;

   .   the risk that management's efforts to integrate Immunex will disrupt
       Amgen's operations;

   .   the substantial charges to be incurred in connection with the merger,
       including costs of integrating the businesses of Amgen and Immunex and
       transaction expenses arising from the merger;

   .   the risk that despite the efforts of the combined company, key
       management and research and development personnel might not remain
       employed by Amgen; and

   .   various other risks associated with the merger and the businesses of
       Amgen, Immunex and the combined company described in the section
       entitled "Risk Factors" and in the documents incorporated by reference
       into this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

   The Amgen board of directors concluded, however, that these negative factors
could be managed or mitigated by Amgen or were unlikely to have a material
impact on the merger or Amgen, and that, overall, the potentially negative
factors associated with the merger were outweighed by the potential benefits of
the merger.

   The above discussion of the factors considered by the Amgen board of
directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but does set forth the principal
factors considered by the Amgen board of directors. The Amgen board of
directors collectively reached the unanimous conclusion to approve the merger
agreement in light of the various factors described above and other factors
that each member of the Amgen board of directors felt were appropriate. In view
of the wide variety of factors considered by the Amgen board of directors in
connection with its evaluation of the merger and the complexity of these
matters, the Amgen board of directors did not consider it practical, and did
not attempt, to quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the
specific factors it considered in reaching its decision. Rather, the Amgen
board of directors made its recommendation based on the totality of information
presented to and the investigation conducted by it. In considering the factors
discussed above, individual directors may have given different weights to
different factors.

   The Amgen board of directors unanimously recommends that Amgen stockholders
vote "FOR" approval of the issuance of Amgen common stock in the merger.

Reasons for the Merger--Immunex

   While Immunex has excellent growth potential and prospects for its future as
a stand-alone entity, Immunex believes that there are substantial benefits to
Immunex shareholders that can be obtained as a result of the

merger. A combination with Amgen will permit shareholders to receive a
substantial equity interest in a leading biotechnology company, with greater
product and revenue diversity, technological resources and financial strength
than Immunex has on its own. At the same time, Immunex shareholders will
receive a fixed cash component of the merger consideration. At a meeting held
on December 16, 2001, the Immunex board of directors adopted the merger
agreement and resolved to recommend that Immunex shareholders vote "FOR" the
approval of the merger agreement.

   In making its determination to adopt the merger agreement, the Immunex board
of directors consulted with senior members of the Immunex management team
regarding various matters, including the strategic and operational aspects of
the merger and the results of the due diligence efforts undertaken by
management and advisors of Immunex. In addition, the Immunex board of directors
consulted with representatives of Merrill Lynch regarding financial matters,
and with internal counsel and representatives of Skadden, Arps regarding legal
matters. In the course of reaching its determination, the Immunex board of
directors considered a variety of factors, including the following material
factors:

   .   Strategic Benefits of the Merger.  The Immunex board of directors
       considered the strategic benefits of the merger, including the following:

       -  Greater Revenue Diversification.  After the merger, Amgen will have a
          significantly larger revenue base than Immunex, with revenues driven
          not only by sales of ENBREL, but also by sales of Amgen's current
          product offerings of EPOGEN(R) (Epoetin alfa), NEUPOGEN(R)
          (Filgrastim) and ARANESP(R) (darbepoetin alfa). Following the merger,
          Amgen will also have a portfolio of leading products and a strong
          pipeline of new products in development which the Immunex board of
          directors believes should allow the combined company to pursue
          multiple new products to maintain revenue diversity. The Immunex
          board of directors concluded that the financial risk of dependence on
          fewer products will be diminished as a result of the combined
          company's greater revenue diversification.

       -  Enhanced Research and Development Capabilities.  The Immunex board of
          directors believes that following the merger, Amgen will be at the
          forefront of biotechnology research and development. The research and
          development budget of the combined company will increase
          significantly from the research and development budgets of either
          Immunex or Amgen on a stand-alone basis. The Immunex board of
          directors believes that by efficiently organizing key research and
          development functions and pooling both companies' expertise, and
          having access to a broader array of research and development
          possibilities, the combined company should be in a position to commit
          substantial resources to the most promising product opportunities.

       -  Enhanced Biologics Manufacturing.  The Immunex board of directors
          considered that after the merger Amgen would have greater biologics
          manufacturing capabilities than either Amgen or Immunex alone and
          believes that the manufacturing expertise of Amgen will assist in the
          scale-up of ENBREL production.

       -  Synergies and Cost Savings.  The Immunex board of directors reviewed
          the opportunity for cost savings and operation synergies that would
          result from the merger. Cost savings are expected from avoiding
          hiring and other costs that Immunex and Amgen would otherwise need to
          incur in the future and eliminating redundant functions which would
          exist in Amgen following the merger. Operating synergies are expected
          from enhanced marketing efforts by the combined sales force and the
          opportunity to accelerate research and development and product
          commercialization. The Immunex board of directors considered that
          these operational synergies could also be expected to make the
          combined company more attractive to other companies in the industry
          seeking a partner with development, production and marketing
          capabilities.

   .   Attractive Financial Terms.  The Immunex board of directors believes
       that the merger consideration values Immunex common stock at a
       financially attractive level and appropriately compensates Immunex
       shareholders in light of the current position and prospects of Immunex.
       In reaching this

       determination, the Immunex board of directors considered, among other
       things, various facts and analyses with respect to the financial terms
       of the proposed merger including the following:

       -  information concerning the financial performance and financial
          condition, business and prospects of Immunex and Amgen, as well as
          conditions in the biotechnology industry generally;

       -  information concerning the recent and historical stock price
          performance of Immunex common stock and Amgen common stock, as well
          as the views articulated by Wall Street equity analysts regarding
          such stocks;

       -  that the value implied by the merger consideration as of the date the
          merger agreement was entered into was at a premium to the one-week,
          one-month, six-month and twelve-month average trading prices for
          Immunex common stock;

       -  the value of the exchange ratio provided for in the merger agreement
          relative to the then-current market prices and historical trading
          prices of Immunex and Amgen shares over the past year. In this
          regard, the Immunex board of directors noted that at then-current
          market prices, the merger consideration represents a premium of (a)
          14% to the price of Immunex common stock on December 14, 2001, the
          last trading day prior to the execution of the merger agreement, (b)
          34% to the price of Immunex common stock on December 12, 2001, the
          last trading day before rumors of a possible business combination
          transaction between Immunex and Amgen were reported, (c) 68% to the
          six-month average trading price, and (d) 47% to the 12-month average
          trading price, of Immunex common stock from December 12, 2001;

       -  comparisons of historical financial and operational measures for
          Immunex and Amgen including revenues and earnings, and the fact that
          Immunex shareholders would hold a percentage of the outstanding stock
          of Amgen in excess of the percentage of Amgen's earnings contributed
          by Immunex in the near term; and

       -  the fixed nature of the exchange ratio for the stock portion of the
          merger consideration and that, therefore, an increase or decrease in
          the market value of Amgen common stock will increase or decrease from
          current levels the market value of the stock portion of the merger
          consideration to be received by the Immunex shareholders at the time
          of the closing of the merger.

   .   Alternatives to the Merger.  The Immunex board of directors considered,
       as possible alternatives to the merger, continuing to pursue execution
       of the business strategy of Immunex as an independent entity or the
       possibility of pursuing a business combination with a company other than
       Amgen.

       -  The Immunex board of directors considered the risks and potential
          rewards associated with continuing to execute the strategic plan of
          Immunex as an independent entity, including, the risks associated
          with the dependence on one product as the primary source for revenues
          and the reward of existing Immunex shareholders obtaining all of the
          increase in the value of Immunex from increased sales of ENBREL in
          the United Sates and Canada, and concluded that the likelihood of
          increasing shareholder value was greater pursuant to the merger than
          the likelihood of doing so on a stand-alone basis.

       -  The Immunex board of directors also considered the possibility of
          seeking to engage in a business combination or other strategic
          transaction with a company other than Amgen, and concluded that a
          transaction with Amgen is more feasible and expected to yield greater
          benefits to shareholders than other likely alternatives.

   .   Larger Capitalization and Greater Liquidity.  The Immunex board of
       directors considered that the market capitalization of Amgen following
       the merger would be approximately $73 billion, based on market prices of
       Amgen and Immunex common stock as of December 14, 2001. The Immunex
       board of directors also considered that only approximately 59% of the
       market capitalization of Immunex at the time the merger was announced
       was held by shareholders other than American Home Products. The

       Immunex board of directors determined that the larger market
       capitalization and public float of Amgen following the merger and
       resultant increases in liquidity should be beneficial to Immunex
       shareholders.

   .   Opinion of Financial Advisor.  The Immunex board of directors reviewed
       the analyses and presentations prepared by Merrill Lynch, and Merrill
       Lynch's opinion to the effect that the consideration to be received by
       the Immunex shareholders in the merger was fair to the Immunex
       shareholders from a financial point of view. See "Opinion of Financial
       Advisor--Immunex."

   .   Tax Treatment.  The Immunex board of directors considered the expected
       qualification of the merger as a reorganization within the meaning of
       Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code resulting in the common
       stock portion of the merger consideration being received by Immunex
       shareholders free of federal income tax.

   .   Terms of the Merger Agreement.  The Immunex board of directors, with the
       assistance of counsel, considered the terms and conditions of the merger
       agreement, including:

       -  restrictions on the conduct of business by Immunex between signing of
          the merger agreement and the effective time of the merger;

       -  the potential effect of the terms of the merger agreement on possible
          third-party proposals to acquire Immunex after execution of the
          merger agreement, including that if any third party made a superior
          proposal, the Immunex board of directors could provide information to
          and engage in negotiations with such third party, subject to the
          terms and conditions of the merger agreement;

       -  that Immunex must hold its shareholders meeting and allow
          shareholders to vote on the merger agreement even if a third party
          makes a superior proposal; and

       -  that the termination payment provisions of the merger agreement could
          have the effect of discouraging alternative proposals for a business
          combination with Immunex, but would not preclude bona fide
          alternative proposals, and that the size of the termination fee was
          reasonable in light of the size and benefits of the transaction.

   .   Voting Agreement.  The Immunex board of directors also reviewed the
       terms of the shareholder voting agreement among Amgen, American Home
       Products and certain American Home Products subsidiaries providing for,
       among other things, American Home Products and its subsidiaries to vote
       their shares of Immunex common stock, representing approximately 41% of
       the outstanding Immunex shares, in favor of the merger proposal at the
       Immunex shareholders meeting.

   .   Employee Matters.  The Immunex board of directors considered the terms
       of the merger agreement and other arrangements with respect to Immunex
       management and employees intended to maintain the organization of
       Immunex and preserve the value of Immunex prior to and following the
       merger, including:

       -  the role that the senior operating management of Immunex is expected
          to play in Amgen and the fact that Mr. Fritzky will be appointed to
          the Amgen board of directors;

       -  confirmation of Amgen's current intention to operate and grow the
          Seattle facility owned by Immunex as a major research and development
          center, base the team responsible for ENBREL in Seattle and continue
          the new Rhode Island facility of Immunex as a major manufacturing
          location;

       -  provision of Immunex employees with benefits that in the aggregate
          are no less favorable than those provided to these employees prior to
          the merger for a period of at least two years after completion of the
          merger; and

       -  the existence of severance and retention arrangements of Immunex.

   In its review of the proposed merger, the Immunex board of directors
identified and considered a variety of potentially negative factors or risks,
including:

   .   the risks described under the section entitled "Risk Factors";

   .   that, while the merger is expected to be completed, there can be no
       assurance that all conditions to the parties' obligations to complete
       the merger, such as obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, will be

       satisfied, and as a result, it is possible that the merger may not be
       completed even if approved by shareholders (see "The Merger
       Agreement--Conditions to the Completion of the Merger");

   .   the possibility that if the market price of Amgen common stock declines,
       as a result of the fixed nature of the exchange ratio for the stock
       portion of the merger consideration, the value of the merger
       consideration to be received by the Immunex shareholders at the time of
       the closing of the merger would decline;

   .   the possibility of disruption to the operations of Immunex and a loss of
       key employees as a result of the merger; and

   .   the possibility that the benefits anticipated in connection with the
       merger might not be realized by Amgen.

   In addition to the factors considered that are described above, in coming to
its determination, the Immunex board of directors was aware of the interests
that some executive officers and directors of Immunex may have with respect to
the merger in addition to their interests as shareholders of Immunex generally.
See "Interests of Directors, Executive Officers and Shareholders of Immunex in
the Merger." The Immunex board of directors was also aware of the agreement
regarding governance and commercial matters, the stockholders' rights
agreement, and the amended and restated promotion agreement, each between
Amgen, American Home Products and subsidiaries of American Home Products. See
"Stockholders' Rights Agreement" and "Other Agreements with American Home
Products."

   In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its
evaluation of the merger and the complexity of these matters, the Immunex board
of directors did not find it useful to and did not attempt to quantify, rank or
otherwise assign relative weights to these factors. The Immunex board of
directors conducted an overall analysis of the factors described above, and
overall considered the factors to be favorable to and to support its
determination. In considering the factors described above, individual members
of the Immunex board of directors may have given different weight to different
factors.

   The Immunex board of directors unanimously recommends that Immunex
shareholders vote "FOR" approval of the merger agreement.

Opinion of Financial Advisor--Amgen

   On December 16, 2001, Goldman, Sachs & Co., financial advisor to Amgen,
delivered to the Amgen board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated December 16, 2001, that, as of
that date, and based upon and subject to the considerations described in its
opinion and based upon such other matters as Goldman Sachs considered relevant,
the merger consideration to be paid by Amgen for each outstanding share of
Immunex common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial
point of view to Amgen.

   For purposes of the opinion and this description of the opinion, merger
consideration means the right to receive, with respect to each outstanding
share of Immunex common stock:

   .   0.44 shares of Amgen common stock; and

   .   $4.50 in cash.

   The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, which sets forth the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations on
the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is contained in Annex D.
Goldman Sachs provided its opinion for the information and assistance of
Amgen's board of directors in connection with its consideration of the
transaction contemplated by the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs' opinion is not
a recommendation as to how any holder of Amgen common stock should vote with
respect to the transaction. We encourage you to read the opinion in its
entirety.

   In connection with its opinion, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:

   .   the merger agreement;

   .   the shareholder voting agreement, dated as of December 16, 2001, by and
       among Amgen, American Home Products Corporation, MDP Holdings, Inc. and
       Lederle Parenterals, Inc.;

   .   annual reports to stockholders and annual reports on Form 10-K of Amgen
       and Immunex for the five years ended December 31, 2000;

   .   selected interim reports to stockholders and quarterly reports on Form
       10-Q of Amgen and Immunex;

   .   other communications from Amgen and Immunex to their respective
       stockholders; and

   .   financial analyses and forecasts for Amgen, Immunex and the combined
       company on a pro forma basis prepared by the management of Amgen,
       including certain cost savings and operating synergies projected by the
       management of Amgen to result from the transaction contemplated by the
       merger agreement.

   Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of
Amgen regarding their assessment of the strategic rationale for, and the
potential benefits of, the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement and
the past and current business operations, financial condition and future
prospects of Amgen, including the future prospects of the combined companies.
Goldman Sachs also held discussions with senior management of Amgen and with
L.E.K. Consulting LLC regarding discussions they had with the senior management
of Immunex regarding the past and current business operations, financial
condition and future prospects of Immunex.

   In addition, Goldman Sachs:

   .   reviewed the reported price and trading activity for Amgen common stock
       and Immunex common stock;

   .   compared financial and stock market information for Amgen and Immunex
       with similar information for other selected companies, the securities of
       which are publicly traded;

   .   reviewed the financial terms of selected recent business combinations in
       the biotechnology industry specifically and other industries generally;
       and

   .   performed such other studies and analyses as Goldman Sachs considered
       appropriate.

   Goldman Sachs relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial, accounting and other information discussed with or reviewed by it
and assumed the accuracy and completeness of this information for purposes of
rendering its opinion. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed, with the consent
of Amgen's board of directors, that the financial forecasts prepared by the
management of Amgen, including the forecasts relating to the cost savings and
operating synergies referred to above, were reasonably prepared on a basis
reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of Amgen, and
that the cost savings and operating synergies would be realized in the amounts
and time periods contemplated thereby. In addition, Goldman Sachs did not make
an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities of Amgen
or Immunex or any of their respective subsidiaries, and Goldman Sachs was not
furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals. Goldman Sachs also assumed
that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals
necessary for the consummation of the transaction contemplated by the merger
agreement would be obtained without any adverse effect on Amgen or Immunex or
on the contemplated benefits of the transaction contemplated by the merger
agreement.

   The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by
Goldman Sachs to the Amgen board of directors in connection with providing its
opinion to the Amgen board. In order to more fully understand the financial
analyses used by Goldman Sachs, the tables must be read together with the full
text of each summary. The tables alone are not a complete description of
Goldman Sachs' financial analysis.

   Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the
extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed
on or before December 16, 2001, and is not necessarily indicative of current
market conditions.

   This summary includes information presented in tabular format. These tables
should be read together with the text of each summary.

  Analysis of Transaction Premium and Multiples

   Goldman Sachs reviewed the premiums, multiples and other information derived
from the 0.52 exchange ratio implied by the merger consideration provided in
the merger agreement on the date of its opinion. The 0.52 exchange ratio
represents the sum of (1) the 0.44 shares of Amgen common stock that each
outstanding share of Immunex common stock will be exchanged for under the
merger agreement and (2) the 0.08 shares of Amgen common stock that $4.50 would
buy based on the closing price of Amgen common stock of $56.03 on December 14,
2001. Based on the closing price of Immunex common stock of $25.62 and the
closing price of Amgen common stock of $56.03 on December 14, 2001, Goldman
Sachs calculated an implied offer price of $29.15 per share, representing an
implied premium of 13.8% over the closing price of Immunex common stock on
December 14, 2001. Goldman Sachs then calculated the implied premium based on
the implied offer price of $29.15 using the closing prices of Immunex common
stock on December 14, 2001, and on other selected dates and over selected
periods.

   The results of these calculations are as follows:

   Goldman Sachs also reviewed the historical trading prices of Immunex common
stock and Amgen common stock in order to compare prices for Immunex common
stock implied by those historical trading prices, using the 0.52 exchange ratio
implied by the merger consideration provided in the merger agreement and based
on the closing price of Amgen common stock on December 14, 2001. Specifically,
Goldman Sachs multiplied the implied 0.52 exchange ratio by the daily closing
prices of Amgen common stock on December 14, 2001 and on other selected dates
and over selected periods to determine the implied price for Immunex common
stock on such dates and over such periods. Goldman Sachs then compared the
implied price for Immunex common stock to the historical trading price of
Immunex common stock for the corresponding period and derived an implied
premium. These analyses indicated the following implied prices for Immunex
common stock and implied premiums for these dates or periods:

   Based on an Amgen closing price of $56.03 on December 14, 2001 and using the
implied Immunex price per share of $29.15, Goldman Sachs calculated that the
fully diluted equity consideration in the merger would be $16.90 billion,
assuming exercise of outstanding options that are in-the-money, based on the
implied offer price. Goldman Sachs also determined that the enterprise value
would be $15.88 billion, based on the implied offer price and approximately
$1.02 billion of non-restricted cash and no debt as of September 30, 2001.
Using Amgen management estimates for fiscal years 2001 through 2003, Goldman
Sachs derived the following transaction multiples:

   .   enterprise value as a multiple of estimated 2001, 2002 and 2003 sales;

   .   enterprise value as a multiple of estimated 2001, 2002 and 2003 earnings
       before interest and taxes, or EBIT; and

   .   equity consideration on a fully-diluted basis as a multiple of estimated
       2001, 2002 and 2003 net income.

   The results of these analyses are as follows:

  Historical Stock Trading Analysis

   Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared the historical daily trading prices of
Immunex common stock during the period from December 14, 1999 to December 14,
2001 with the following: (1) a Profitable Biotech Index, comprised of the
common stock of Amgen, Biogen Inc., Chiron Corporation, Genentech Inc., Genzyme
Corporation, IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corp., MedImmune, Inc. and QLT, Inc., and (2)
a Near-Profitable Biotech Index, comprised of the common stock of Cell
Therapeutics, Inc., Cephalon, Inc., Corixa Corporation, Gilead Sciences, Inc.,
ImClone Systems Incorporated, Intermune Inc., Supergen Inc., Tanox Inc., Titan
Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

   The analysis indicated that for the period from December 14, 1999 to March
1, 2001, the Immunex common stock initially performed comparably to the above
indices; but, since early April 2000, Immunex common stock has been
underperforming the Near-Profitable Index and since early January 2001, Immunex
common stock has been underperforming both the Profitable Biotech Index and the
Near-Profitable Index.

   Goldman Sachs also reviewed and compared the historical daily trading prices
of Amgen common stock during the period from December 14, 1999 to December 14,
2001 with the following: (1) a Profitable Biotech Index, comprised of the
common stock of Immunex, Biogen Inc., Chiron Corporation, Genentech Inc.,
Genzyme Corporation, IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corp., MedImmune, Inc. and QLT, Inc.,
and (2) the Near-Profitable Biotech Index. The analysis indicated that, for the
period from December 14, 1999 to December 14, 2001, Amgen common stock
underperformed the Near-Profitable Biotech Index, but performed comparably to
the Profitable Biotech Index.

  Selected Public Companies Analysis

   Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared selected financial information relating
to Amgen and Immunex to corresponding financial information, ratios and public
market multiples for comparable companies whose securities are publicly traded.
Goldman Sachs calculated various financial multiples and ratios for Amgen and
Immunex based on the closing price of Amgen and Immunex common stock on
December 10, 2001. These financial multiples and ratios were compared with
those of the companies included the Profitable Biotech Index (including both
Amgen and Immunex) and Near-Profitable Biotech Index used in the historical
stock trading analyses. Where applicable, the financial multiples and ratios
for Amgen and Immunex and the selected companies were calculated using (1) the
closing prices of their common stock on December 10, 2001 and (2) their
respective equity market capitalizations.

   Goldman Sachs' analyses of the selected companies compared, among other
things, the following to the results for Amgen and Immunex:

   .   market price on December 10, 2001 as a percentage of the 52-week high;

   .   cash balance as of latest public filings;

   .   ratio of market price as of December 10, 2001 to 2002 and 2003 estimated
       earnings; and

   .   ratio of market price as of December 10, 2001 to 2002 and 2003 estimated
       earnings, relative to Institutional Broker Estimate System's, or IBES,
       estimates of long-term growth rates.

   The results of these analyses are summarized as follows:

  Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

   Goldman Sachs performed an analysis to compare the present value per share
of Immunex common stock, using discounted cash flow methodologies, to the value
per share implied by the merger consideration provided in the merger agreement
on the date of its opinion. Using Amgen management's projections for Immunex,
Goldman Sachs performed this analysis on a stand-alone basis. Goldman Sachs
analyzed the business of Immunex based on the following models: (1) the Immunex
base case scenario, which involved Amgen management's projections of future
revenue growth and earnings for the fiscal years 2002 through 2011, without any
cost savings or operating synergies; and (2) the Immunex synergies scenario,
which was based on the projections of future revenue growth and earnings used
in the Immunex base case scenario, but took into account certain cost savings
and operating synergies projected by the management of Amgen to result from the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

   In its analysis of both the Immunex base case and synergies scenarios,
Goldman Sachs applied discount rates ranging from 10.0% to 14.0% and terminal
value multiples of estimated 2011 price to earnings ranging from 20.0x to
40.0x. The range for discount rates and terminal value multiples were chosen by
Goldman Sachs based upon its prior experience in analyzing cost of capital
ranges that could be applicable. Based on these discount rates and terminal
value multiples, Goldman Sachs derived theoretical equity reference ranges per
share ranging from $13.27 to $32.64 for the Immunex base case scenario and
$17.96 to $42.82 for the Immunex synergies scenario.

   Goldman Sachs noted that the implied value of $29.15 per share derived on
the date of its opinion from the merger consideration provided in the merger
agreement was within the range of share valuations for Immunex on a stand-alone
basis implied by the range of values derived from the discounted cash flow
analysis of the Immunex base case scenario and the Immunex synergies scenario.

   Goldman Sachs also performed an analysis of the present value per share of
Amgen common stock using discounted cash flow methodologies. Using Amgen
management projections as provided by Amgen management for the fiscal years
2002 through 2011, Goldman Sachs performed this analysis for Amgen on a
stand-alone basis. Goldman Sachs analyzed three elements of the business based
on the following models: (1) the Amgen base case scenario, which involved Amgen
management's projections of future revenue growth and earnings for the fiscal
years 2002 through 2011; (2) the Amgen marketed products scenario, which was
based on projections for revenues and growth from approved products and
products currently being marketed by Amgen, and no contribution from Amgen's
pipeline scenario; and (3) the Amgen pipeline products scenario, which was
based on projections for revenues and growth for new compounds in development,
excluding any products currently being marketed.

   In its analysis of the Amgen base case scenario and the Amgen marketed
products scenario, Goldman Sachs applied discount rates ranging from 10.0% to
12.0% and terminal value multiples of estimated 2011 price to earnings ranging
from 15.0x to 25.0x. In its analysis of the Amgen pipeline products scenario,
Goldman Sachs applied discount rates ranging from 12.0% to 14.0% and terminal
value multiples of estimated 2011 price to earnings ranging from 20.0x to
40.0x. The various ranges for discount rates and terminal value multiples were
chosen by Goldman Sachs based upon its prior experience in analyzing cost of
capital ranges that could be applicable. Based on these discount rates and
terminal value multiples, Goldman Sachs derived theoretical equity reference
ranges per share ranging from $37.22 to $58.32 for the Amgen base case
scenario, $30.30 to $46.78 for the Amgen marketed products scenario and $4.87
to $8.45 for the pipeline products scenario.

  Pro Forma Merger Analysis

   Goldman Sachs prepared pro forma analyses of the financial impact of the
merger on Amgen and Immunex on a stand-alone basis for the six fiscal years
ending December 31, 2006 using projections for fiscal years 2001 through 2006
prepared by Amgen's management. For the fiscal years 2001 through 2006, Goldman
Sachs compared, among other financial items, fully diluted earnings per share
for the combined company on a pro forma basis, both with and without taking
into account certain cost savings and operating synergies projected by the
management of Amgen to result from the transaction contemplated by the merger
agreement. The pro forma analysis was calculated based on pro forma cash
earnings per share, which excludes the impact of non-cash charges associated
with identifiable intangible asset amortization. Goldman Sachs' analysis
indicated that the proposed merger, when taking the cost savings and operating
synergies into account but excluding identifiable intangible asset
amortization, would be dilutive to the combined company's fully diluted
earnings per share in estimated years 2002 and 2003 and accretive to the
combined company's fully diluted earnings per share in estimated years 2004,
2005 and 2006 assuming a closing date for the merger in June 2002. Further,
Goldman Sachs' analysis indicated that if none of the cost savings and
operating synergies projected by the management of Amgen to result from the
transaction were realized and all identifiable intangible asset amortization is
excluded, the proposed merger would be dilutive to the combined company's fully
diluted earnings per share in each of the estimated years 2002, 2003, 2004,
2005 and 2006 assuming a closing date for the merger in June 2002.

  Contribution Analysis

   Goldman Sachs conducted a contribution analysis of Immunex relative to the
pro forma combined entity resulting from the merger using discounted cash flow
methodologies. Using management projections provided by Amgen's management and
assuming all cost savings and operating synergies included in the discounted
cash flow analysis of Immunex, Goldman Sachs derived theoretical equity value
contribution percentages for Immunex assuming a discount rate of 11.0% and
terminal value multiples of 2011 price to earnings for Immunex ranging from
20.0x to 40.0x and for Amgen ranging from 15.0x to 25.0x. Based on this
discount rate and these

terminal value multiples, Goldman Sachs calculated theoretical equity reference
range contribution percentages ranging from 22.9% to 27.6%.

   Goldman Sachs also reviewed the historical and estimated future operating
and financial information, including, among other things, revenue and net
income, for Amgen, Immunex and the pro forma combined entity resulting from the
merger based on Amgen's management projections. A contribution analysis
demonstrates the parties' respective historical and projected contributions, on
a percentage basis, to certain income statement items of the combined company
and compares those contributions to the parties' stockholders' relative equity
interests in the combined company following the merger. Goldman Sachs analyzed
the relative income statement contribution of (1) Immunex, (2) Amgen and (3)
the synergies projected to result from the transaction contemplated by the
merger agreement, to the combined company on a pro forma basis based on
financial data and on the assumptions provided to Goldman Sachs by Amgen's
management for estimated years 2001 through 2006. Goldman Sachs calculated the
relative contributions of Immunex, Amgen and the projected synergies to the
combined company in terms of, among other things, (1) sales, (2) earnings
before interest and taxes, or EBIT, (3) net income, (4) enterprise value, based
on the closing price of Immunex common stock of $25.62 and the closing price of
Amgen common stock of $56.03 on December 14, 2001, Immunex non-restricted cash
of approximately $1.02 billion and no debt as of September 30, 2001 and net
cash of Amgen of approximately $2.11 billion as of September 30, 2001, (5)
fully diluted equity market capitalization, based on the closing market price
of Immunex common stock of $25.62 and Amgen's closing market price of $56.03 on
December 14, 2001, and (6) implied pro forma ownership, based on Amgen's
closing market price of $56.03 and the implied offer price for Immunex common
stock of $29.15 on December 14, 2001. The results of these analyses for 2001
and 2006 are as follows:

  Selected Transactions Analysis

   Using the implied value of $29.15 per share for Immunex common stock derived
from the merger consideration provided in the merger agreement and the closing
price of Amgen common stock on December 14, 2001, Goldman Sachs calculated (1)
the premium represented by the implied offer price in relation to the closing

price of Immunex common stock on December 14, 2001, the last trading day prior
to the announcement of the execution of the merger agreement, and (2) the 2001
estimated sales multiple. The premium was calculated to be 13.8% and the 2001
estimated sales multiple was 15.6x.

   Goldman Sachs compared the results with publicly available information for
42 pending and completed merger and acquisition transactions involving
consideration greater than $100 million during 1990 through 2001 in the
biotechnology industry. In addition, Goldman Sachs compared the results with
publicly available information for 18 biotechnology product-driven transactions
for the same time period. The results of the analyses are as follows:

   The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not
necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting
portions of the analyses or of the summary described above, without considering
the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes
underlying Goldman Sachs' opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination,
Goldman Sachs considered the results of all the analyses and did not attribute
any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it; rather,
Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its
experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all the
analyses. No company used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly
comparable to Amgen or Immunex, and no transaction used is directly comparable
to the proposed transaction contemplated by the merger agreement.

   Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses solely for purposes of providing an
opinion to the Amgen board of directors as to the fairness of the merger
consideration to Amgen from a financial point of view. The analyses do not
purport to be appraisals or to necessarily reflect the prices at which the
business or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of
future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which
may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses.
Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty and are based upon
numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their
respective advisors, none of Amgen, Immunex or Goldman Sachs assumes
responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.
As described above, the opinion of Goldman Sachs to the Amgen board of
directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Amgen board
in making its determination to approve the merger agreement. The foregoing
summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed
by Goldman Sachs.

   Goldman Sachs, as part of its investment banking business, is continually
engaged in performing financial analyses with respect to businesses and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated
underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and
unlisted securities as private placements as well as for estate, corporate and
other purposes. Goldman Sachs is familiar with Amgen having provided investment
banking services to Amgen from time to time, including having acted as its
financial advisor in connection with its stock repurchase program and having
acted as its financial advisor in connection with, and having participated in
certain of the negotiations leading to, the merger agreement.

   Amgen selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because Goldman Sachs
is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial
experience in transactions similar to the transaction

contemplated by the merger agreement. In addition, Goldman Sachs provides a
full range of financial advisory and securities services and, in the course of
its normal trading activities, may from time to time effect transactions and
hold positions in securities, including derivative securities, of Amgen and
Immunex for its own account and for the accounts of customers.

   Pursuant to a letter agreement, dated August 6, 2001, Amgen engaged Goldman
Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with a potential
transaction involving Immunex. Pursuant to this letter agreement, Amgen agreed
to pay Goldman Sachs a customary transaction fee, the principal portion of
which is payable upon completion of the merger. Amgen has also agreed to
reimburse Goldman Sachs for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including
attorneys' fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs against
certain liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities
laws.

Opinion of Financial Advisor--Immunex

   Immunex retained Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated to act
as its financial advisor in connection with the proposed merger. On December
16, 2001, Merrill Lynch delivered to the Immunex board of directors its oral
opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated December
16, 2001, that, as of that date, and based upon and subject to the factors and
assumptions set forth in the opinion, the merger consideration to be received
by the holders of the shares of Immunex common stock pursuant to the merger was
fair to such holders, from a financial point of view.

   The full text of Merrill Lynch's opinion, dated December 16, 2001, which
sets forth the assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and
limitations on the review undertaken by Merrill Lynch, is attached as Appendix
E to this document and is incorporated into this document by reference. The
summary of Merrill Lynch's opinion set forth below is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the full text of the opinion. Immunex shareholders are
encouraged to read the opinion carefully in its entirety.

   Merrill Lynch's opinion was prepared for, and addressed to, the Immunex
board of directors for the information of such directors, and is directed only
to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to
the Immunex shareholders. The opinion does not address any other aspect of the
merger, including the merits of the underlying decision by Immunex to engage in
the merger. Furthermore, the opinion does not constitute, nor should it be
construed as constituting, a recommendation to Immunex shareholders as to how
such shareholders should vote as to any matter relating to the merger.

   In preparing its opinion for the Immunex board of directors, Merrill Lynch
performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses, including, but not
limited to, those described below. The summary set forth below does not purport
to be a complete description of the analyses underlying Merrill Lynch's opinion
or the presentation made by Merrill Lynch to the Immunex board of directors.
The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytical process involving
various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of
financial analysis and the application of those methods to particular
circumstances and, therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to
partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Merrill
Lynch did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor
considered by it, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance
and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly, Merrill Lynch believes
that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of
its analyses and factors, or focusing on information presented in tabular
format, without considering all of the analyses and factors or the narrative
description of the analyses, would create a misleading or incomplete view of
the process underlying its opinion.

   In performing its analyses, Merrill Lynch made numerous assumptions with
respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and
financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of
Merrill Lynch, Immunex or Amgen. Any estimates contained in the analyses
performed by Merrill Lynch are not necessarily indicative of actual values or
future results, which may be significantly more or

less favorable than results suggested by such analyses. Additionally, estimates
of the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to
reflect the prices at which such businesses or securities might actually be
sold. Accordingly, such analyses and estimates are inherently subject to
substantial uncertainty. In addition, as described above, Merrill Lynch's
opinion was among several factors taken into consideration by the Immunex board
of directors in making its determination to approve the merger agreement.
Consequently, Merrill Lynch's analyses should not be viewed as determinative of
the decision of the Immunex board of directors or the management of Immunex
with respect to the fairness of the merger consideration set forth in the
merger agreement.

   In arriving at its opinion, Merrill Lynch, among other things, did the
following:

   .   reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information
       relating to Immunex and Amgen;

   .   reviewed certain information with respect to Amgen, including financial
       forecasts, relating to the business, earnings, cash flow, assets and
       prospects of Amgen, furnished to Merrill Lynch by Amgen;

   .   reviewed certain information with respect to Immunex, including
       financial forecasts, relating to the business, earnings, cash flow,
       assets and prospects of Immunex, furnished to Merrill Lynch by Immunex;

   .   conducted discussions with members of senior management of Immunex and
       Amgen concerning their respective businesses and prospects before and
       after giving effect to the merger and the potential synergies expected
       to result from the merger;

   .   reviewed the historical market prices, trading activity and valuation
       multiples for Immunex common stock and Amgen common stock and compared
       them with those of certain publicly traded companies which Merrill Lynch
       deemed to be reasonably similar to Immunex and Amgen, respectively;

   .   compared the results of operations of Immunex and Amgen with those of
       certain companies which Merrill Lynch deemed to be reasonably similar to
       Immunex and Amgen, respectively;

   .   compared the proposed financial terms of the transactions contemplated
       by the merger agreement with the financial terms of certain other
       mergers and acquisitions which Merrill Lynch deemed to be relevant;

   .   reviewed the potential pro forma impact of the merger;

   .   reviewed the merger agreement, the shareholder voting agreement, the
       stockholders' rights agreement and the agreement regarding governance
       and commercial matters; and

   .   reviewed such other financial studies and analyses and performed such
       other investigations and took into account such other matters as Merrill
       Lynch deemed necessary, including Merrill Lynch's assessment of general
       economic, market and monetary conditions.

   In preparing its opinion, Merrill Lynch assumed and relied on the accuracy
and completeness of all information supplied or otherwise made available to
Merrill Lynch by Immunex and Amgen, and did not assume any responsibility for
independently verifying such information. Merrill Lynch did not undertake an
independent appraisal of any of the assets and liabilities of Immunex or Amgen,
and was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition,
Merrill Lynch did not assume any obligation to conduct any physical inspection
of the properties or facilities of Immunex or Amgen. With respect to the
financial forecasts furnished to or discussed with Merrill Lynch by Immunex and
Amgen, Merrill Lynch assumed that they have been reasonably prepared and
reflect the best currently available estimates and judgments of Immunex or
Amgen's management as to the expected future financial performance of Immunex
or Amgen, as the case may be. Merrill Lynch further assumes that the merger
will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and that all conditions to the merger will be
satisfied.

   Merrill Lynch's opinion is necessarily based upon market, economic and other
conditions as they existed on, and on the information made available to Merrill
Lynch as of, the date of the opinion. Merrill Lynch assumed that in the course
of obtaining the necessary regulatory or other consents or approvals
(contractual or otherwise) for the consummation of the merger, no restrictions,
including divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, will be
imposed that will have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits
of the merger.

   In connection with the preparation of its fairness opinion, Merrill Lynch
was not authorized by Immunex or the Immunex board of directors to solicit, and
did not solicit, third party indications of interest for acquisition of all or
any part of Immunex.

   The following is a summary of the material analyses performed by Merrill
Lynch in connection with its opinion to the Immunex board of directors dated
December 16, 2001. Some of the financial analyses summarized below include
information presented in tabular format. In order to understand fully Merrill
Lynch's financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of
the summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the
financial analyses. Considering the data set forth below without considering
the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the
methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a
misleading or incomplete view of Merrill Lynch's financial analyses.

  Immunex Financial Analysis

   The per share prices set forth in this "Immunex Financial Analysis" section
compare to the merger's implied offer price of $32.83, based on 0.44 shares of
Amgen common stock and $4.50 in cash for each share of Immunex common stock,
and based on the per share closing price of Amgen common stock on December 12,
2001 (the day prior to the appearance of media reports of a possible
transaction between Immunex and Amgen). The per share prices also compare to
the merger's implied offer price of $29.15, based on the per share closing
price of Amgen common stock on December 14, 2001 (the day after reports of the
merger became public and the last trading day prior to the announcement of the
merger).

   Historical Trading.  Merrill Lynch reviewed the historical closing prices of
Immunex common stock for the six-month and twelve-month periods prior to
December 12, 2001. Merrill Lynch focused on the six-month trading range because
unlike the twelve-month range, the six-month trading range was not influenced
by stock prices of Immunex that were prior to the announcement by Immunex of
disappointing clinical studies of ENBREL for congestive heart failure and
NUVANCE(TM) (IL-4 receptor) for asthma. The ranges of closing prices for both
periods are set forth below:

                                                           Historical

   Securities Research Analysts' Future Price Targets.  Merrill Lynch reviewed
and analyzed projected twelve-month price targets for Immunex common stock
based on publicly available research analysts' estimates. These targets were
then discounted to present value at eighteen percent (18%), which is the
midpoint of the range of the cost of capital of Immunex estimated by Merrill
Lynch:

                                                         Present Value
                                                             Range
                                                         -------------
                                                          Low    High
                                                         ------ ------

         Twelve-Month Price Target...................... $16.10 $25.42

   Selected Comparable Companies.  Merrill Lynch compared financial and stock
market data of Immunex to corresponding data of the following selected publicly
traded companies, which are referred to in this summary as the Large-Cap
Biotech Group:

   .     Amgen                   .     Genzyme General Corporation
   .     Biogen, Inc.            .     IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation
   .     Chiron Corporation      .     MedImmune, Inc.
   .     Genentech, Inc.         .     Serono S.A.

   These comparable companies were chosen because they are publicly traded
companies with operations that for purposes of this analysis may be considered
reasonably similar to the operations of Immunex. For each of these comparable
companies, Merrill Lynch compared the price per share of Immunex common stock
as a multiple of the estimated earnings per share, or the PE Ratio, and the PE
Ratio as a multiple of the five year projected growth rate of earnings, or the
PEG Ratio, of Immunex to corresponding projected PE Ratios and PEG Ratios of
the Large-Cap Biotech Group. All multiples were based on closing stock prices
on December 14, 2001, with the exception of Immunex and Amgen, which were based
on stock prices on December 12, 2001. Estimated financial data for the selected
companies were based on publicly available research analysts' estimates.
Merrill Lynch then applied a range of multiples, with 2003 PE Ratios of 40.0x
to 55.0x and 2002 PEG Ratios of 1.7x to 2.1x, to a range of financial forecasts
for Immunex based on estimates of the management of Immunex and based on
publicly available research analysts' estimates. The results of such comparison
are presented below:

                                                  2003 PE Ratio   2002 PEG
                                                  ------------- -------------
                                                   Low    High   Low    High
                                                  ------ ------ ------ ------

  Implied Valuation Range........................ $14.40 $30.25 $13.60 $25.20

   None of the selected companies is identical to Immunex. Accordingly, an
analysis of the results of the foregoing necessarily involves complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating
characteristics of the selected companies and other factors that could affect
the public trading value of Immunex and the selected companies.

   Selected Transactions.  Using publicly available information, Merrill Lynch
reviewed the multiples implied by the purchase prices paid, or proposed to be
paid at the time of announcement, of the following twelve healthcare industry
acquisitions, including proposed acquisitions, that Merrill Lynch deemed
relevant in its evaluation of the fairness of the merger consideration to the
Immunex shareholders:

     Target                                Acquiror
     ------                                --------

     Aviron                                MedImmune, Inc.
     DuPont Pharmaceuticals Company        Bristol-Myers Squibb Company
     ALZA Corporation                      Johnson & Johnson
     Knoll, Inc.                           Abbott Laboratories
     BioChem Pharma Inc.                   Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc
     Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc.            Elan Corp. plc
     Jones Pharma Incorporated             King Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
     Roberts Pharmaceutical Corporation    Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc
     Centocor, Inc.                        Johnson & Johnson
     ALZA Corporation                      Abbott Laboratories
     Agouron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.         Warner-Lambert Company
     R.P. Scherer Corporation              Cardinal Health, Inc.

   For each of these selected transactions, Merrill Lynch compared the price
per share as a multiple of corresponding projected one-year and two-year
forward earnings per share and the offer value as a multiple of projected net
income, where appropriate, of the respective targets. Estimated financial data
for the respective

targets were based on publicly available research analysts' estimates. Merrill
Lynch then applied a range of multiples, with two-year forward PE Ratios of
40.0x to 45.0x, to a range of financial forecasts for Immunex, based on
estimates of the management of Immunex and based on publicly available research
analysts' estimates. The results of such comparison are presented below:

                                                               Two-Year

                                                             -------------
                                                              Low    High
                                                             ------ ------

      Implied Valuation Range............................... $14.40 $24.75

   No company or transaction used in the Selected Transactions analysis is
identical to Immunex or the proposed merger. Accordingly, an analysis of the
results of the Selected Transactions analysis involved complex considerations
of the companies and transactions involved and other factors that could affect
acquisition value of the companies and Immunex.

   Discounted Cash Flow.  Merrill Lynch performed a discounted cash flow
analysis of the projected after-tax unlevered free cash flows that Immunex
could produce over the fiscal years 2002 through 2004 based on estimates of the
management of Immunex and based on publicly available research analysts'
estimates. Merrill Lynch calculated implied equity values per share of Immunex
common stock, by utilizing discount rates between 16.0%-20.0%, and between
27.5%-32.5% to assess the more aggressive of the internal forecasts, and
terminal value multiples of estimated 2005 after-tax EBIT ranging from 35.0x to
45.0x:

  Amgen Financial Analysis

   Shares of Amgen common stock closed at a price per share of $64.39 on
December 12, 2001, and at a price of $56.03 on December 14, 2001.

   Historical Trading.  Merrill Lynch reviewed the historical closing prices of
Amgen common stock for the six-month and twelve-month periods prior to December
12, 2001. The ranges of closing prices for both periods are set forth below:

   Securities Research Analysts' Future Price Targets.  Merrill Lynch reviewed
and analyzed projected twelve-month price targets for Amgen common stock based
on publicly available research analysts' estimates. These targets were then
discounted to present value at thirteen percent (13%), which is the cost of
capital of Amgen estimated by Merrill Lynch:

                                                             Present Value

     Twelve Month Price Target.............................. $60.18 $79.65

   Selected Comparable Companies.  Based on comparisons with selected multiples
for the Large-Cap Biotech Group (see discussion under "--Immunex Financial
Analysis--Selected Comparable Companies," for the purposes of this analysis,
substitute "Amgen" for "Immunex," and "Immunex" for "Amgen," where
appropriate), Merrill Lynch calculated the implied equity reference range for
Amgen to be approximately $53.50 to $65.00 per share, based on 2002 PE Ratios
ranging from 38.0x to 46.0x and 2002 PEG Ratios ranging from 1.9x to 2.3x.

   Discounted Cash Flow.  Merrill Lynch performed a discounted cash flow
analysis of the projected after-tax unlevered free cash flows that Amgen could
produce over the fiscal years 2002 through 2004 based on estimates of the
management of Amgen. Merrill Lynch calculated implied equity values per share
of Amgen common stock, by utilizing discount rates ranging from 12.0% to 14.0%
and terminal value multiples of estimated 2005 after-tax EBIT ranging from
30.0x to 40.0x. This analysis indicated an implied equity reference range for
Amgen of approximately $54.00 to $73.00 per share.

  Relative Valuation Analysis

   The implied exchange ratios set forth in this "Relative Valuation Analysis"
section compare to an imputed 100% stock exchange ratio of approximately 0.52x.

   Implied Historical Exchange Ratio.  Merrill Lynch compared the exchange
ratio to the relative daily closing stock prices of Immunex and Amgen for the
six-month and twelve-month periods prior to December 12, 2001. The following
table presents the ranges of the implied exchange ratios resulting from this
analysis:

   Relative Comparable Companies.  Merrill Lynch compared the implied per share
equity reference ranges for Immunex and Amgen (see "--Immunex Financial
Analysis--Selected Comparable Companies" and "--Amgen Financial
Analysis--Selected Comparable Companies") in order to derive an implied
exchange ratio reference range for Immunex and Amgen. The results of this
analysis are set forth below:

   Relative Discounted Cash Flow.  After performing the respective discounted
cash flow analysis calculations with respect to Immunex and Amgen, Merrill
Lynch compared the implied per share equity reference ranges for Immunex and
Amgen in order to derive an implied exchange ratio reference range for Immunex
and Amgen. This analysis indicated the following implied exchange ratio
reference range:

   Relative Contribution.  Merrill Lynch performed an analysis of the relative
contributions by each of Immunex and Amgen to the net income of the pro forma
combined company (assuming a 100% stock transaction). In doing so, Merrill
Lynch reviewed the estimated 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 contribution to net
income of Immunex and Amgen, based on, in the case of Amgen, forecasts provided
by the management of Amgen, and, in the case of Immunex, a range of forecasts
based on estimates of the management of Immunex

and based on publicly available research analysts' estimates, and compared the
results to the implied ownership of Amgen in the pro forma combined company.
Summarized below are the results of Merrill Lynch's calculations of the implied
exchange ratios based upon these estimated contributions of each of Immunex and
Amgen to the pro forma combined company for each of the years indicated:

  Pro Forma Analysis

   Merrill Lynch performed an analysis of the potential pro forma financial
impact of the merger on the earnings per share of Amgen for the years 2002,
2003, 2004 and 2005, based on, in the case of Amgen, forecasts provided by the
management of Amgen, and, in the case of Immunex, a range of forecasts based on
estimates of the management of Immunex and based on publicly available research
analysts' estimates. In performing this analysis, Merrill Lynch assumed, among
other things:

   .   receipt by the Immunex shareholders of 0.44 shares of Amgen common stock
       and $4.50 cash for each share of Immunex common stock held;

   .   completion of the merger on or before June 30, 2002;

   .   realization of the pre-tax synergies of approximately $200 to $300
       million, phased in over time, expected by the management of Amgen to
       result from cost-reduction initiatives; and

   .   calculation of pro forma earnings per share before amortization of
       identifiable intangibles.

   The results of this analysis indicate that, including the impact of the cost
savings and related expenses and synergies expected to result from the merger,
the merger would be highly accretive to Immunex shareholders out to 2004 in all
cases and out to 2005 in most cases. In terms of the pro forma impact to the
per share earnings of Amgen, the merger would be dilutive to Amgen stockholders
in the first two years, and in most cases accretive or modestly dilutive in
2004 and 2005.

   Merrill Lynch also analyzed the potential pro forma financial impact of the
merger on the compound annual growth rates for revenues and earnings per share
of Amgen from 2002 to 2005, based on, in the case of Amgen, forecasts provided
by the management of Amgen, and, in the case of Immunex, a range of forecasts
based on estimates of the management of Immunex and based on publicly available
research analysts' estimates. Subject to the assumptions set forth in the first
paragraph of this section, the results of this analysis indicate that the
merger would be substantially additive to the growth rate of Amgen's projected
revenue and earnings per share over the next several years.

  Miscellaneous

   Pursuant to the terms of Merrill Lynch's engagement, Immunex has agreed to
pay Merrill Lynch for its financial advisory services in connection with the
merger a fee of $30 million, a significant portion of which is contingent upon
the closing of the merger. Immunex also has agreed to reimburse Merrill Lynch
for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Merrill Lynch in performing
its services and to indemnify Merrill Lynch and related persons and entities
against liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws,
arising out of Merrill Lynch's engagement.

   Immunex retained Merrill Lynch based upon Merrill Lynch's experience and
expertise. Merrill Lynch is an internationally recognized investment banking
and advisory firm. Merrill Lynch, as part of its investment banking business,
is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive
biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private
placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes.

   Merrill Lynch has, in the past, provided financial advisory and financing
services to Immunex and Amgen and has received fees for the rendering of such
services. Merrill Lynch is currently providing financial advisory services in
connection with the intended divestiture of LEUKINE. In addition, in the
ordinary course of its business, Merrill Lynch and its affiliates may actively
trade shares of Immunex common stock and other securities of Immunex, as well
as shares of Amgen common stock and other securities of Amgen, for their own
account and for the account of customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold
a long or short position in these securities.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger

   The merger is subject to review by the Antitrust Division of the U.S.
Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. Under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, Amgen and Immunex are
required to make pre-merger notification filings and to await the expiration or
early termination of statutory waiting periods prior to completing the merger.
On January 7, 2002, Amgen and Immunex each filed a Premerger Notification and
Report Form with the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and
the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. The merger is subject to review by the
German Federal Cartel Office under the Act against Restraints of Competition
(Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschrankungen). Amgen and Immunex will make a joint
filing relating to the merger with the German Federal Cartel Office. The merger
may also be subject to review by the governmental authorities of various other
jurisdictions. Amgen and Immunex have not yet obtained any of the governmental
or regulatory approvals required to complete the merger.

   There can be no assurance that the governmental reviewing authorities will
terminate the applicable statutory waiting periods or clear the merger at all
or without restrictions or conditions that would have a materially adverse
effect on the combined company if the merger is completed. These restrictions
and conditions could include the grant of a complete or partial license,
divestiture, spin-off or the holding separate of assets or businesses. Under
the terms of the merger agreement, neither Amgen nor Immunex is required to
commit to any divestitures, licenses or hold separate or similar arrangements
with respect to its assets or conduct of business arrangements if such
divestiture, license, holding separate or arrangement is not conditioned upon
the consummation of the merger or would have a material adverse effect on Amgen
after giving effect to the merger. Either Amgen or Immunex may refuse to
complete the merger if any such restrictions or conditions are required by
governmental authorities as a condition to approving the merger. No additional
stockholder approval is expected to be required or sought for any decision by
Amgen or Immunex, after the special meetings, to agree to any terms and
conditions necessary to resolve any regulatory objections to the merger, and
stockholder approval will not be sought unless additional stockholder approval
is required to approve the terms and conditions under applicable law. In
connection with the transaction, Immunex intends to divest the product LEUKINE
in order to facilitate clearance from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

   In addition, during or after the statutory waiting periods and clearance of
the merger, and even after completion of the merger, either the Antitrust
Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission
or the German Federal Cartel Office could challenge, seek to block or block the
merger under the antitrust laws, as it deems necessary or desirable in the
public interest. Other competition agencies with jurisdiction over the merger
could also initiate action to challenge or block the merger. In addition, in
some jurisdictions, a competitor, customer or other third party could initiate
a private action under the antitrust laws challenging or seeking to enjoin the
merger, before or after it is completed. Amgen and Immunex cannot be sure that
a challenge to the merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made,
Amgen and Immunex will prevail.

Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences

   The following general discussion summarizes the material United States
federal income tax consequences of the merger to Amgen, Amgen stockholders,
Immunex and to United States holders of Immunex common stock who hold their
Immunex common stock as a capital asset. It does not address all of the United
States federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to particular
shareholders in light of their individual circumstances or to shareholders who
are subject to special rules, including, without limitation:

   .   financial institutions;

   .   tax-exempt organizations;

   .   insurance companies;

   .   dealers in securities or foreign currencies;

   .   foreign holders;

   .   persons who hold such shares as a hedge against currency risk, or as
       part of a constructive sale or conversion transaction; or

   .   holders who acquired their shares upon the exercise of employee stock
       options or otherwise as compensation.

No ruling has been or will be sought from the Internal Revenue Service as to
the United States federal income tax consequences of the merger, and the
following summary is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the courts.
It is based upon the Internal Revenue Code, laws, regulations, rulings and
decisions in effect as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, all of
which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This summary
does not address tax consequences under state, local and foreign laws.

   For purposes of this discussion, we use the term "United States holder" to
mean:

   .   a citizen or resident of the United States;

   .   a corporation, partnership or other entity created or organized under
       the laws of the United States or any of its political subdivisions;

   .   a trust that (x) is subject to the supervision of a court within the
       United States and the control of one or more United States persons or
       (y) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States
       Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person; or

   .   an estate that is subject to United States federal income tax on its
       income regardless of its source.

   Holders of Immunex common stock are strongly encouraged to consult their tax
advisors as to the specific tax consequences to them of the merger, including
the applicability and effect of federal, state, local and foreign income and
other tax laws.

  Exchange of Immunex Common Stock for a Combination of Amgen Common Stock and
  Cash.

   The consummation of the merger is conditioned on (i) the receipt by Amgen of
an opinion from Latham & Watkins, counsel to Amgen, dated the date of the
effective time of the merger, to the effect that the merger will be treated as
a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code and (ii) the receipt by Immunex of an opinion from Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher & Flom LLP, counsel to Immunex, dated the date of the effective time of
the merger, to the effect that the merger will be treated as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Neither
Amgen nor Immunex may waive these conditions to the merger after Amgen
stockholders and Immunex shareholders have approved the merger unless further
Amgen stockholder and Immunex shareholder approvals are obtained with
appropriate disclosure. The opinions will be based on representations contained
in representation letters provided by Amgen and Immunex, all of which must
continue to be true and accurate in all respects as of the effective time of
the merger, and on certain customary factual assumptions. The opinions will not
be binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the courts.

   Assuming that the merger is treated as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code:

   .   An Immunex shareholder will recognize gain equal to the lesser of (A)
       the cash received by the shareholder in the merger or (B) an amount
       equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the sum of the amount of cash and
       the fair market value of the Amgen common stock received by the
       shareholder in the merger

       over (ii) the shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the Immunex common
       stock exchanged by the shareholder in the merger. For this purpose, an
       Immunex shareholder must calculate gain or loss separately for each
       identifiable block of Immunex common stock exchanged by the shareholder
       in the merger and cannot utilize a loss realized on one block of Immunex
       common stock to offset a gain realized on another block of Immunex
       common stock;

   .   Except as discussed below under "Tax Character of Cash Consideration,"
       the gain recognized by an Immunex shareholder in the merger will be
       treated as capital gain;

   .   An Immunex shareholder will not recognize any loss in the merger
       (except, possibly, in connection with cash received instead of a
       fractional share, as discussed below);

   .   The aggregate tax basis of the shares of Amgen common stock received by
       an Immunex shareholder (before reduction for the basis in any fractional
       share of Amgen common stock for which cash is received) in exchange for
       Immunex common stock in the merger will be the same as the aggregate tax
       basis of the shareholder's Immunex common stock, decreased by the amount
       of cash received by the shareholder in the merger (excluding any cash
       received instead of a fractional share) and increased by the amount of
       gain recognized by the shareholder in the merger (including any portion
       of the gain that is treated as a dividend but excluding any gain
       recognized as a result of cash received instead of a fractional share);

   .   An Immunex shareholder's holding period with respect to the shares of
       Amgen common stock received in the merger will include the holding
       period of the Immunex common stock exchanged for Amgen common stock;

   .   Amgen will not recognize gain or loss in the merger; and

   .   Amgen stockholders will not recognize gain or loss in the merger.

  Tax Character of Cash Consideration

   In the case of most Immunex shareholders having no direct or indirect
control over Amgen's corporate affairs, any gain will be treated as capital
gain for United States federal income tax purposes. However, there are
circumstances under which all or a part of any gain that an Immunex shareholder
recognizes in the merger could be treated as a distribution of a dividend
instead of capital gain to the extent of the shareholder's ratable share of the
undistributed accumulated earnings and profits of the corporation. Due to the
inherently factual nature of this determination, Immunex shareholders are
encouraged to consult their tax advisors to determine whether any cash received
in exchange for their Immunex stock in the merger will be treated as a
distribution of a dividend.

  Cash Received Instead of a Fractional Share

   An Immunex shareholder who receives cash instead of a fractional share of
Amgen common stock will generally recognize capital gain or loss based on the
difference between the amount of the cash received instead of a fractional
share and the shareholder's tax basis in such fractional share.

  Tax Consequences of Dissenter's Rights

   An Immunex shareholder who dissents to the merger will generally recognize
capital gain or loss in an aggregate amount equal to the difference between the
amount of cash received and the shareholder's tax basis in the dissenting
shares. Although there is no authority directly on point, it is possible that a
shareholder will be required to recognize gain or loss at the effective time of
the merger, and in advance of the receipt of any cash payment, in an amount
generally equal to the trading price of Immunex common stock at the effective
time of the merger. In this event, capital gain or loss would also be
recognized by the shareholder at the time the appraised fair cash value is
received, to the extent that such payment exceeds or is less than the amount
realized at the effective time of the merger, and a portion of such payment may
be characterized as interest income.

  Capital Gain

   Any capital gain recognized by an individual holder of Immunex common stock
in connection with the transfer of his or her Immunex common stock in the
merger will be subject to a maximum United States federal income tax rate of
20% if the individual's holding period for his or her Immunex common stock is
more than 12 months at the effective time of the merger.

  Restructure of Transaction

   Each of Amgen and Immunex has agreed that it will not take any action that
would disqualify the merger, and to use its reasonable best efforts to take any
action to qualify the merger, as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. If tax counsel to either Amgen or Immunex
is unable to render its opinion that the merger qualifies as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, the parties
have agreed to restructure the transaction such that tax counsel to Amgen and
Immunex are able to render their opinions. No such restructuring of the
transaction shall (A) result in any change in the merger consideration, (B) be
materially adverse to the interests of Amgen, Immunex, AMS Acquisition, Amgen
stockholders, or Immunex shareholders, or (C) unreasonably impede or delay
consummation of the merger. If the transaction is restructured in such a
manner, the material tax consequences of the merger would be the same as those
described in this summary.

  Backup Withholding

   Noncorporate holders of Immunex common stock may be subject to backup
withholding on any cash payments received in the merger. An Immunex shareholder
will not be subject to backup withholding, however, if the holder (a) furnishes
a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such holder is not
subject to backup withholding on the substitute Internal Revenue Service Form
W-9 or successor form included in the letter of transmittal to be delivered to
such holder following the completion of the merger; (b) provides a
certification of foreign status on Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or a
successor form; or (c) is otherwise exempt from backup withholding.

   Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a
refund or credit against a holder's United States federal income tax liability,
provided the holder furnishes the required information to the Internal Revenue
Service.

   Tax matters are very complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to
an Immunex shareholder will depend on such holder's particular tax situation.
Immunex shareholders are encouraged to consult their tax advisors regarding the
specific tax consequences of the merger, including tax return reporting
requirements, the applicability of federal, state, local and foreign tax laws
and the effect of any proposed change in the tax laws.

Accounting Treatment

   In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States, Amgen will account for the merger using the purchase method of
accounting. Under this method of accounting, Amgen will record the cash
consideration, the market value (based on an average of the closing prices of
Amgen common stock for a range of trading days from two days before and after
December 17, 2001, the announcement date) of its common stock issued in the
merger, the fair value of Amgen options issued in exchange for the options to
purchase shares of Immunex common stock and the amount of direct transaction
costs associated with the merger as the estimated purchase price of acquiring
Immunex. Amgen will allocate the estimated purchase price to the net tangible
and amortizable intangible assets acquired (primarily developed technology,
core technology and in-process research and development), based on their
respective fair values at the date of the completion of the merger. Any excess
of the estimated purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired will
be accounted for as goodwill.

   Amortizable intangible assets, currently estimated at $6,570,700,000, will
generally be amortized over useful lives of 15 years. In-process research and
development, which is currently estimated at $2,389,200,000, will be expensed
during the fiscal quarter in which the merger is completed. In accordance with
the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets," goodwill resulting from the business combination of
$9,390,100,000, will not be amortized but instead will be tested for impairment
at least annually (more frequently if certain indicators are present).

   In the event that Amgen's management determines that the value of goodwill
has become impaired, the combined company will incur an accounting charge for
the amount of impairment during the fiscal quarter in which the determination
is made. The amounts listed in the above paragraph are only preliminary
estimates, however, actual amounts may differ from these estimates.

Listing of Amgen Common Stock

   Amgen will use reasonable best efforts to:

   .   cause the shares of Amgen common stock to be issued in the merger to be
       approved for listing on the Nasdaq National Market upon the completion
       of the merger; and

   .   cause the shares of Amgen common stock to be issued upon the exercise of
       converted Immunex stock options to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq
       National Market.

Delisting and Deregistration of Immunex Common Stock

   If the merger is completed, Immunex common stock will be delisted from the
Nasdaq National Market and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, and Immunex will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.

Restrictions on Sales of Shares of Amgen Common Stock Received in the Merger

   The shares of Amgen common stock to be issued in the merger will be
registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and will be freely transferable,
except for shares of Amgen common stock issued to any person who is deemed to
be an "affiliate" of Immunex under the Securities Act of 1933 prior to the
merger. Persons who may be deemed to be "affiliates" of Immunex prior to the
merger include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are
under common control with Immunex prior to the merger, and may include officers
and directors, as well as significant shareholders of Immunex prior to the
merger. Affiliates of Immunex prior to the merger may not sell any of the
shares of Amgen common stock received by them in the merger except pursuant to:

   .   an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933
       covering the resale of those shares;

   .   an exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act of
       1933; or

   .   any other applicable exemption under the Securities Act of 1933.

   Amgen's registration statement on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is a part, does not cover the resale of shares of Amgen
common stock to be received by affiliates of Immunex in the merger.

Interests of Directors, Executive Officers and Shareholders of Immunex in the
Merger

   In considering the recommendation of the Immunex board of directors that
Immunex shareholders vote in favor of approval of the merger agreement, Immunex
shareholders should be aware that some Immunex executive officers and directors
may have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to,
their interests as shareholders of Immunex.

   These interests relate to or arise from, among other things:

   .   the continued indemnification of current directors and officers of
       Immunex under the merger agreement and providing these individuals with
       directors' and officers' insurance;

   .   the retention of some of the officers and directors of Immunex as
       officers of Amgen or, in the case of Mr. Fritzky, as a director of, and
       special advisor to, Amgen;

   .   the execution of an employment agreement between Amgen and Mr. Fritzky;

   .   the potential receipt of severance and retention payments; and

   .   the conversion, acceleration, and cancellation and reissuance of stock
       options.

   Amgen has also entered into four agreements with American Home Products and
some of its subsidiaries. The Immunex board of directors was aware of these
interests and considered them, among other matters, in making its
recommendation.

  Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance

   Under the merger agreement, Amgen has agreed to indemnify all directors,
officers and employees of Immunex and its subsidiaries to the fullest extent
permitted by law for all acts or omissions prior to the merger by such
individuals in such capacities. Amgen has also agreed to provide, for six years
after the merger, directors' and officers' liability insurance in respect of
acts or omissions occurring prior to the merger covering each person currently
covered by the directors' and officers' liability insurance policy of Immunex
on terms and in amounts no less favorable than those of the policies of
Immunex, provided that Amgen will not be required to pay an annual premium for
the insurance in excess of 200% of the estimated premium for the 2002 fiscal
year. Amgen has agreed to cause to be maintained charter and bylaw provisions
with respect to indemnification and advancement of expenses that are at least
as favorable to the intended beneficiaries as those contained in charter and
bylaws of Immunex as in effect on the date the merger agreement was signed.
Amgen has also agreed to honor all indemnification agreements entered into by
Immunex or any of its subsidiaries.

  Management Positions

   Amgen expects that Edward V. Fritzky, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive
Officer and President of Immunex, Peggy V. Phillips, a director, Executive Vice
President and Chief Operating Officer of Immunex, and Douglas E. Williams, a
director, Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of Immunex,
will play significant roles in Amgen following the merger. Mr. Fritzky has
entered into an employment agreement with Amgen described below, and under the
merger agreement, Amgen has agreed to take all action necessary so that
following the merger, Mr. Fritzky will be appointed to the Amgen board of
directors. If Amgen has multiple classes of directors at the time of the
merger, Mr. Fritzky will be appointed to the class of directors with the
longest remaining term, provided that Amgen will not be required to request
that an incumbent director switch classes. Ms. Phillips is expected to be
appointed as an Executive Vice President of Amgen, reporting directly to Kevin
W. Sharer, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President of
Amgen. Mr. Williams is expected to be appointed as a Senior Vice President of
Amgen, reporting to Roger Perlmutter, Executive Vice President, Research &
Development of Amgen. It is expected that Ms. Phillips and Mr. Williams will
also be appointed to the executive committee of Amgen.

  Employment Agreement with Chief Executive Officer

   Because Mr. Fritzky possesses intimate knowledge of the business and affairs
of Immunex, Amgen determined that it was important to retain his services
following the merger to assist in the integration of Amgen and Immunex. As a
result, Mr. Fritzky and Amgen have entered into a part-time employment
agreement with Amgen which will become effective upon the consummation of the
merger. Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Fritzky will serve as a special advisor
to Amgen for a period of two years following the merger, and will report
directly to Amgen's Chief Executive Officer. Additionally, Amgen has agreed
that, following the merger it will take all action necessary to cause Mr.
Fritzky to be elected to the Amgen board of directors. Mr. Fritzky will not be
required to provide services to Amgen for more than twenty hours a month.
During the term of his employment agreement, Mr. Fritzky will be entitled to:

   .   receive a base salary of $500,000 per year;

   .   participate in all of the employee benefit plans and arrangements
       (including any life, death, disability, accident, health, employee stock
       purchase and qualified or non-qualified retirement and savings plan)
       made available to senior executives of Amgen, except that Mr. Fritzky
       will not be eligible to participate in Amgen's performance based
       Management Incentive Plan;

   .   receive perquisites, including financial counseling and tax planning
       services, that are the same as or substantially equal to the perquisites
       received by Mr. Fritzky prior to the merger; and

   .   reimbursement for office space and office support services up to
       $250,000 per year.

   Amgen will contribute, at the effective time of the merger, a retention
bonus of $1,000,000 to a deferred compensation account established for Mr.
Fritzky under Amgen's deferred compensation plan. Mr. Fritzky's retention bonus
account will vest with respect to $500,000 on the first anniversary of the
merger and $250,000 on each of the eighteen month anniversary of the merger and
the second anniversary of the merger. In addition, at the time of the merger,
Amgen will grant Mr. Fritzky an option to purchase 450,000 shares of Amgen
common stock, one-third of which will be vested on the date of grant and an
additional one-third of which will vest on each of the first and second
anniversaries of the date of grant. Amgen has also agreed to issue Mr. Fritzky
100,000 shares of restricted Amgen common stock upon the closing of the merger,
34,000 shares of which will be vested on the date of issuance and the remainder
of which will vest in equal installments on the first and second anniversaries
of the date of issuance.

   In consideration of Mr. Fritzky's waiver of any right to payment pursuant to
the Immunex Corporation Leadership Continuity Policy, Amgen has agreed to make
a lump sum payment to Mr. Fritzky at the time of the merger in an amount equal
to three times the sum of:

   .   Mr. Fritzky's base salary immediately prior to the consummation of the
       merger;

   .   Mr. Fritzky's target annual incentive compensation in effect immediately
       prior to the consummation of the merger; and

   .   the value of contributions made on Mr. Fritzky's behalf to the qualified
       and non-qualified defined contribution plans of Immunex in the year
       prior to the year in which the merger occurs.

   Assuming current salary and bonus levels remain in effect, if the merger is
consummated on June 30, 2002, the approximate value of this payment due to Mr.
Fritzky, not including any payments that may be made with respect to any excise
tax, would be $5.4 million.

   In the event that Mr. Fritzky's employment is terminated for any reason
during the term of his employment agreement, Mr. Fritzky will be entitled to:

   .   continued participation in Amgen's employee benefit plans and
       arrangements and continued receipt of perquisites for three years
       following termination, except in the event of a termination by Amgen for
       "cause" or by Mr. Fritzky without "good reason";

   .   outplacement services for twelve months, except in the event of Mr.
       Fritzky's death; and

   .   all accrued salary and incurred expenses and amounts due under benefit
       plans and arrangements.

   In the event that Mr. Fritzky's employment is terminated by Amgen without
"cause" or by Mr. Fritzky for "good reason," Mr. Fritzky will be entitled to
all of the benefits described above, plus:

   .   Mr. Fritzky will receive a lump sum payment in an amount equal to all
       base salary due through the remainder of the term of the employment
       agreement;

   .   Mr. Fritzky's retention bonus account will fully vest and be paid out;

   .   Mr. Fritzky's restricted stock will fully vest; and

   .   all of Mr. Fritzky's options for Amgen stock will fully vest and become
       immediately exercisable.

Mr. Fritzky must execute a release in favor of Amgen as a condition to the
  receipt of these severance benefits.

   Pursuant to the employment agreement, Amgen is required, if necessary, to
make an additional "gross-up payment" to Mr. Fritzky to offset fully the effect
of any excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code on any
excess parachute payment, whether made to Mr. Fritzky pursuant to the
employment agreement or otherwise. In general, Section 4999 imposes an excise
tax on the recipient of any excess parachute payment equal to 20% of such
payment. A "parachute payment" is any payment that is contingent on a change in
control. Excess parachute payments consist of the excess of parachute payments
over an individual's average taxable compensation received by him from the
employer during the five taxable years (or if less, the entire period of
employment) preceding the year in which the change in control occurs. The
merger will constitute a change of control of Immunex under the employment
agreement and Section 4999.

   Mr. Fritzky has agreed to be bound by Amgen's standard proprietary
information agreement and arbitration agreement.

  Severance Agreements

   Each of the executive officers of Immunex, other than Mr. Fritzky, and two
non-executive officer employees of Immunex, is party to a severance agreement
with Immunex which provides for certain benefits in the event that the
executive or employee experiences a qualifying termination. A qualifying
termination is a termination of employment during the two-year period following
a change in control either by Immunex or its successor for reasons other than
"cause" or by the executive or employee for "good reason." In the event of a
qualifying termination, the executive officers and non-executive officer
employees will be entitled to receive:

   .   a lump sum cash payment equal to three times the sum of (a) the higher
       of the executive's or employee's base salary in effect on the date of
       termination of employment or in effect prior to an event constituting
       "good reason," (b) the higher of the executive's or employee's target
       annual incentive compensation in effect on the date of termination of
       employment or in effect prior to an event constituting "good reason" and
       (c) the higher of the value of contributions made to the qualified and
       non-qualified defined contribution plans of Immunex on the executive's
       or employee's behalf for the year prior to the year in which the date of
       termination occurs or for the year prior to the year in which an event
       constituting "good reason" occurs;

   .   continued life, dental, accident and health insurance benefits and
       continued perquisites (including financial counseling) for three years
       following termination; and

   .   outplacement services for twelve months.

In addition, a "gross-up" payment to compensate these executive officers and
non-executive officer employees for any "golden parachute" excise tax under
Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code is also provided. In consideration
for the right to payments as described above, each of these persons waived any
right to

payment pursuant to the leadership continuity policy referred to on page 62. In
addition, each executive officer and non-executive officer employee must
execute a release as a condition to the receipt of these benefits.

   For purposes of the severance agreements, "good reason" includes:

   .   the assignment of inconsistent duties or a reduction in the nature or
       status of the executive's or employee's responsibilities (including, for
       executive officers, the failure to be an executive officer of a public
       company immediately following a change in control);

   .   a reduction in the executive's or employee's annual base pay, annual
       incentive opportunity or long term incentive opportunity;

   .   relocation of the executive's or employee's principal place of
       employment or principal place of performance of duties by more than 50
       miles; or

   .   a termination of employment by the executive or employee for any reason
       within 60 days after the first anniversary of the change in control.

For purposes of the severance agreements, "cause" means the executive's or
employee's willful and continued failure to substantially perform his or her
duties or his or her willful engaging in conduct which is demonstrably and
materially injurious to Immunex.

   The merger will constitute a change in control under the severance
agreements and Section 4999. Assuming current salary and bonus information
remains in effect, that the merger is consummated on June 30, 2002 and a
qualifying termination occurs immediately thereafter, the approximate value of
the cash severance payments due under the severance agreements to each of the
executive officers, not including any payments that may be made with respect to
any excise tax, would be: Ms. Phillips, $2.6 million; Mr. Williams, $1.9
million; David A. Mann (Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer,
Treasurer), $1.7 million; and Barry G. Pea (Executive Vice President, General
Counsel, Secretary), $1.7 million.

  Immunex Retention Plan

   The Immunex Corporation Retention Plan provides for conditional retention
awards to all employees of Immunex who regularly work at least 20 hours per
week, including the executive officers other than Mr. Fritzky. Each executive
officer of Immunex who remains employed by Immunex through the effective time
of the merger will receive a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to the
executive's base salary and target annual bonus. On the first anniversary of
the effective time of the merger, each executive officer who is still employed
by Amgen will receive a lump sum cash payment on such first anniversary equal
to 1.5 times the executive's annual base salary and target annual bonus. If the
executive's employment is terminated by the acquiring company without "cause"
or by the executive for "good reason" (each, as defined in the executive
severance agreement, except with respect to ceasing to be an executive officer
of a public company), after the first month following the effective time but
prior to the first anniversary of the effective time of the merger, the
executive will be entitled to a pro rata portion of the retention payment the
executive would have received on the first anniversary of the effective time,
prorated based on the amount of time the executive was employed during the
year. Amounts payable under an individual severance agreement to any executive
officer who terminates his or her employment during the 60-day period following
the first anniversary of the closing of the merger for reasons that would not
otherwise constitute "good reason," will be offset by the amount of the
retention payment paid to the executive officer on the first anniversary of the
closing.

   Assuming current salary and bonus information remains in effect, that the
merger is consummated on June 30, 2002 and each of the executive officers
becomes entitled to all payments under the retention plan, the approximate
value of the cash payments due to each of the executive officers, not including
any payments that may be made with respect to any excise tax, would be: Ms.
Phillips, $2.0 million; Mr. Williams, $1.5 million; Mr. Mann, $1.4 million; and
Mr. Pea, $1.4 million.

   Cash payments made to employees other than executive officers may be made
under the retention plan immediately following the merger, on one or more of
the nine-month anniversary of the merger, the first anniversary of the merger,
the 18-month anniversary of the merger or the second anniversary of the merger,
provided that the employee remains employed on the respective payment date, and
the amount of each payment, if any, may vary from three months to 18 months of
base salary, wages and incentive bonus. Each eligible employee must execute an
arbitration agreement as a condition to the receipt of these benefits.

  Stock Option Plans

   Amgen has agreed to assume the Immunex stock option plans at the effective
time of the merger. Under the merger agreement, each outstanding option to
purchase shares of Immunex common stock will be assumed by Amgen at the
effective time of the merger and (except for converted options and Mr.
Fritzky's incentive stock options, described in the next two paragraphs) will
thereafter constitute an option to acquire the number (rounded down to the
nearest whole number) of shares of Amgen common stock determined by multiplying
the number of shares of Immunex common stock subject to the option immediately
prior to the merger by 0.52. The per share exercise price for the Amgen common
stock issuable upon conversion of these Immunex options will be equal to the
quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Immunex common
stock that otherwise could have been purchased under the Immunex stock option
by 0.52 (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). Each of these options will be
subject to the same terms and conditions as were in effect for the related
option immediately prior to the merger, except that each option, other than the
options discussed below, that was outstanding on the date of the merger
agreement will fully vest and become exercisable as to all shares of Amgen
common stock subject thereto. At the effective time of the merger, the number
and kind of shares of stock issuable under the Immunex stock option plans will
be adjusted and converted into shares of Amgen common stock.

   At the effective time of the merger, in order to increase the retention of
Immunex employees, each option to purchase shares of Immunex common stock with
an exercise price greater than the higher of $40 or the closing price of a
share of Immunex common stock on the last trading day prior to the merger will
be converted into an option to purchase that number of whole shares of Amgen
common stock equal to 40% of the number of shares subject to the related
converted option (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares) at an
exercise price per share equal to the fair market value of a share of Amgen
common stock on the date on which the converted option is granted (which shall
be as of the close of market on the date of the effective time of the merger).
The options for Amgen common stock granted with respect to these converted
options will be subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting
schedule) as were in effect for the related converted option immediately prior
to the merger.

   Mr. Fritzky currently holds an option for 140,000 shares of Immunex common
stock which is intended to qualify as an incentive stock option under Section
422 of the Internal Revenue Code. This option will be converted into an option
to purchase shares of Amgen common stock in a manner which preserves the
option's status as an incentive stock option.

   If an Immunex executive's or employee's employment is terminated by the
acquiring company without "cause" or by the executive or employee for "good
reason" (each as defined in the Immunex stock option plans) within fifteen
months following the merger, converted option discussed above and each option
which was granted after the date of the merger agreement will fully vest and
the post-termination exercise period for such option will be extended from
three months to one year.

   Options held by non-employee directors of Immunex as of the merger will be
treated in the same manner as other options, except that in the event that the
non-employee director's service as a director of Immunex or Amgen is terminated
immediately prior to, on or in the fifteen months following the merger, the
options held by the director, to the extent not then vested, will fully vest
and the post-termination exercise period for the options will be extended from
three months to one year.

   Amgen has agreed to assume the Immunex Corporation 1999 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan at the effective time of the merger. Under the merger agreement,
each outstanding purchase right under the Immunex employee stock purchase plan
will be assumed by Amgen and will be converted into a right to purchase shares
of Amgen common stock at the effective time of the merger. Each purchase right
so assumed and converted will continue to have the same terms and conditions as
in effect immediately prior to the merger, except that the purchase price of
shares of Amgen common stock and the number of shares of Amgen common stock to
be issued upon the exercise of such purchase rights will be adjusted in a
manner which preserves the tax treatment of such purchase rights as an option
to which Section 421(a) of the Internal Revenue Code applies.

  Deferred Compensation Plan

   The Immunex Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan will permit continued
deferral of account balances following the consummation of the merger.

  Leadership Continuity Policy

   Certain non-executive officer employees of Immunex are eligible to receive
severance benefits under the leadership continuity policy in the event of a
qualifying termination of their employment on or within two years following a
change in control of Immunex. Mr. Fritzky and the other executive officers of
Immunex have waived their rights to receive benefits under the leadership
continuity policy. A qualifying termination under the leadership continuity
policy is substantially similar to a qualifying termination under the severance
agreements, except that covered employees may not terminate their employment
for any reason during the 60-day period following a change in control and have
such termination deemed to be for "good reason."

   The leadership continuity policy provides that in the event of a qualifying
termination, a covered employee will be entitled to receive:

   .   a lump sum cash severance payment equal to (a) the sum of (i) the
       covered employee's annual base salary immediately prior to termination
       without regard to any reduction which constitutes good reason, (ii) the
       covered employee's target annual incentive compensation with respect to
       the year in which a change in control occurs and (iii) contributions
       made on the covered employee's behalf to the defined contribution plan
       of Immunex with respect to the year immediately preceding the year in
       which the change in control occurs, (b) multiplied by one or two,
       depending on the covered employee's position;

   .   continued life, disability, dental, accident and health insurance
       benefits and continued perquisites (including financial counseling) for
       one or two years; and

   .   outplacement services for twelve months.

Each eligible employee must execute a release as a condition to the receipt of
benefits under the leadership continuity policy. The merger will constitute a
change in control under the leadership continuity policy.

  Employee Severance Plan

   The Immunex Corporation Employee Severance Plan provides severance benefits
to employees of Immunex who are not entitled to benefits under the leadership
continuity policy or individual severance agreements. None of the executive
officers of Immunex is entitled to benefits under the employee severance plan.
In the event that an employee experiences a qualifying termination in the two
years following a change in control of Immunex, the employee will be entitled
to certain severance benefits the amount of which is based on job position and
years of service. A qualifying termination is deemed to occur if the employee
is terminated for reasons other than "cause" (as defined in the employee
severance plan) or terminates employment for "good reason." With respect to the
employee severance plan, "good reason" means a reduction in the employee's
annual base salary or wages, other than as part of a general reduction
applicable to substantially all employees of Immunex, or the relocation of the
employee's principal place of employment by more than 50 miles. Each eligible
employee must execute a release as a condition to the receipt of these
benefits. The merger will constitute a change in control of Immunex under the
employee severance plan.

  Agreements with American Home Products

   Two directors on the Immunex board of directors have been designated by
American Home Products under the term of the governance agreement among
Immunex, American Home Products and American Cyanamid Company, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of American Home Products. In connection with the merger agreement,
Amgen has entered into agreements with American Home Products and some of its
subsidiaries. The agreements include:

   .   a shareholder voting agreement which provides for American Home Products
       and two of its subsidiaries to vote in favor of the merger and against
       any alternative transaction;

   .   a stockholders' rights agreement which relates to the status of American
       Home Products and two of its subsidiaries as significant stockholders of
       Amgen following the merger and provides American Home Products with
       certain registration rights;

   .   an amended and restated promotion agreement relating to the promotion of
       ENBREL in the United States and Canada; and

   .   an agreement regarding governance and commercial matters which relates
       to, among other things:

       -  the rights of American Home Products to complete the development of
          and sell identified products under development by Immunex and the
          rights to market and promote those products developed by Immunex
          under an existing product rights agreement;

       -  Amgen's agreement to make a specified payment to American Home
          Products for the termination of the product rights described above;

       -  Amgen's agreement not to sue American Home Products for patent
          infringement under any of Amgen's patents or any patents that come
          under its control for activities related to ENBREL anywhere in the
          world outside of the United States and Canada; and

       -  Amgen's grant to American Home Products of an option to acquire an
          exclusive sublicense under a license agreement between Amgen and a
          third party.

Each of these agreements is further described in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus under the following headings "Shareholder Voting
Agreement," "Stockholders' Rights Agreement," "Other Agreements with American
Home Products--Amended and Restated Promotion Agreement" and "Other Agreements
with American Home Products--Agreement Regarding Governance and Commercial
Matters." These descriptions may not contain all of the information about these
agreements that is important to you. We encourage you to read each agreement
carefully in its entirety. The shareholder voting agreement and stockholders'
rights agreement are attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as
Annexes B and C, respectively. The amended and restated promotion agreement and
the agreement regarding governance and commercial matters are exhibits to the
registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part
and have been filed with the SEC.

Management and Operations Following the Merger

   Amgen expects that, initially following completion of the merger, the
businesses and operations of Immunex will, except as described in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus, be continued substantially as they are currently
being conducted. Amgen intends to undertake a comprehensive review of the
business, operations, capitalization and management of Immunex with a view to
optimizing development of its potential in conjunction with Amgen's business.

   Amgen's current directors and officers are expected to retain their
positions with Amgen following the merger, including Kevin W. Sharer retaining
the positions of Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President.
As described above, at the time the merger is completed, Mr. Fritzky will be
appointed to serve as a director of Amgen and serve as a special advisor to
Amgen. Ms. Phillips is expected to be appointed as an Executive Vice President
and officer of Amgen and Mr. Williams is expected to be appointed as a Senior
Vice President and officer of Amgen.

Litigation Related to the Merger

   On December 14, 2001, a lawsuit was filed by David Osher against Immunex,
all members of the Immunex board of directors (Edward V. Fritzky, Kirby L.
Cramer, Robert J. Herbold, John E. Lyons, Joseph M. Mahady, Edith W. Martin,
Peggy V. Phillips, Lawrence V. Stein and Douglas E. Williams) and American Home
Products in the King County Superior Court of Washington. The suit is
denominated as a class action purportedly on behalf of a class of Immunex
shareholders. The complaint alleges that American Home Products and the Immunex
board of directors breached their fiduciary duties owed to Immunex shareholders
by stalling the merger discussions as a result of positions taken by American
Home Products in the negotiations relating to its control of Immunex and its
marketing rights in future Immunex products. The complaint further alleges that
American Home Products and the Immunex board of directors are favoring their
own interests and not acting in good faith toward the plaintiff and other
members of the purported class. The plaintiff seeks relief:

   .   ordering the action to be maintained as a class action and certifying
       plaintiff as the Class representative;

   .   enjoining, preliminarily and permanently, defendants from proceeding
       with, or closing, the merger or any transaction that improperly favors
       the interests of American Home Products;

   .   rescinding and setting aside the merger in the event that it is
       consummated;

   .   awarding plaintiff the costs of the action including attorneys' and
       experts' fees; and

   .   granting such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and
       proper.

   On December 18, 2001, a lawsuit was filed by Adele Brody against Immunex,
Messrs. Fritzky, Williams, Mann and Pea, Ms. Phillips, and the marital
community of each named individual in the King County Superior Court of
Washington. The suit is denominated as a class action purportedly on behalf of
a class of Immunex shareholders. The complaint alleges, among other things,
that the defendants breached their fiduciary duty to the purported class by
failing to take all reasonable steps to assure the maximization of shareholder
value, including the implementation of a bidding mechanism to foster a fair
auction of Immunex to the highest bidder, or the exploration of strategic
alternatives which would return a greater value to plaintiff and the other
members of the purported class. The complaint further alleges that defendants
are continuing to breach their fiduciary duties in order to entrench themselves
in office and to receive the benefits of negotiating only with Amgen. The
plaintiff seeks relief:

   .   ordering the action to be maintained as a class action and certifying
       plaintiff as the Class representative;

   .   enjoining, preliminarily and permanently, Amgen's offer for the
       acquisition of Immunex stock owned by plaintiff and the other members of
       the purported class;

   .   rescinding the transaction and granting rescissionary damages in the
       event that the merger is consummated;

   .   directing defendants to pay plaintiff and the other members of the
       purported class damages and to account for all profits and any special
       benefits obtained by defendants;

   .   awarding plaintiff the costs of the action including attorneys' and
       experts' fees; and

   .   granting such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and
       proper.

   On December 20, 2001 a lawsuit was filed by Edwin Weiner against Immunex,
Messrs. Fritzky, Williams, Mann and Pea, Ms. Phillips, and the marital
community of each named individual in the King County Superior Court of
Washington. The allegations and the relief requested in the Weiner complaint
are substantially identical to those in the Brody complaint described above.

   While these cases are in their early stages, Immunex believes that the cases
are without merit and intends to contest them vigorously. American Home
Products has advised Immunex that it also believes the lawsuit to which it is a
defendant is without merit and it intends to contest it vigorously.

                             THE MERGER AGREEMENT

   The following summary describes certain material provisions of the merger
agreement, which is included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex
A and is incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
This summary may not contain all of the information about the merger agreement
that is important to you. We encourage you to read the merger agreement
carefully in its entirety.

Structure of the Merger

   The merger agreement provides for the merger of AMS Acquisition Inc., a
newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of Amgen, with and into Immunex. As a
result of the merger, Immunex will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amgen.

Completion and Effectiveness of the Merger

   The closing of the merger will occur on the first business day after all of
the conditions to completion of the merger contained in the merger agreement
are satisfied or waived unless the parties agree otherwise in writing (see the
section entitled "Conditions to Completion of the Merger" below). The merger
will become effective upon the filing of articles of merger with the Secretary
of State of the State of Washington.

   We are working to complete the merger quickly. We currently expect to
complete the merger in the second half of 2002. However, because completion of
the merger is subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions, we cannot
predict the actual timing.

Merger Consideration

   Upon completion of the merger, each share of Immunex common stock
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be
cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into 0.44 of a share of
Amgen common stock and $4.50 in cash upon surrender of the certificate
representing that share of Immunex common stock in the manner provided in the
merger agreement. However, shares held by Immunex shareholders who validly
exercise dissenters' rights will be subject to appraisal in accordance with
Washington law. Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding option to
purchase Immunex common stock will be converted into an option to purchase
Amgen common stock, as described further in the section entitled "Employee
Benefit Matters--Immunex Stock Options."

   The exchange ratio in the merger (0.44 of a share of Amgen common stock for
each share of Immunex common stock) and the cash consideration will be adjusted
to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with
respect to Amgen common stock or Immunex common stock having a record date on
or after the date of the merger agreement and prior to completion of the merger.

   Upon completion of the merger, each share of Immunex common stock held by
Amgen or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Amgen immediately
prior to the merger will be automatically cancelled and extinguished, and none
of Amgen or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries will receive any
securities of Amgen or other consideration in exchange for those shares.

Fractional Shares

   Amgen will not issue any fractional shares of Amgen common stock in the
merger. Instead, each holder of Immunex common stock exchanged in the merger
who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Amgen
common stock will receive cash, without interest, in lieu of a fractional share.

Exchange of Immunex Stock Certificates for Amgen Stock Certificates

   Promptly following completion of the merger,
                                  , the exchange agent for the merger, will
mail to each record holder of Immunex common stock a letter of transmittal and
instructions for surrendering the record holder's stock certificates in
exchange for a statement indicating book-entry ownership of Amgen common stock
or, if requested, a certificate representing Amgen common stock. Only those
holders of Immunex common stock who properly surrender their Immunex stock
certificates in accordance with the exchange agent's instructions will receive
(a) a statement indicating book-entry ownership of Amgen common stock or, if
requested, a certificate representing Amgen common stock, (b) the cash
consideration, (c) cash in lieu of any fractional share of Amgen common stock,
and (d) dividends or other distributions, if any, on Amgen common stock to
which they are entitled under the terms of the merger agreement. After the
effective time of the merger, each certificate representing shares of Immunex
common stock that has not been surrendered will represent only the right to
receive upon surrender of that certificate each of the items listed in the
preceding sentence. The surrendered certificates representing Immunex common
stock will be cancelled. Following completion of the merger, Immunex will not
register any transfers of Immunex common stock outstanding on its stock
transfer books prior to the merger.

   Holders of Immunex common stock should not send in their Immunex stock
certificates until they receive a letter of transmittal from the exchange
agent, with instructions for the surrender of Immunex stock certificates.

Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares

   Holders of Immunex common stock are not entitled to receive any dividends or
other distributions on Amgen common stock until the merger is completed. After
the merger is completed, holders of Immunex common stock certificates will be
entitled to dividends and other distributions declared or made after completion
of the merger with respect to the number of whole shares of Amgen common stock
which they are entitled to receive upon exchange of their Immunex stock
certificates, but they will not be paid any dividends or other distributions on
the Amgen common stock until they surrender their Immunex stock certificates to
the exchange agent in accordance with the exchange agent instructions.

Transfers of Ownership and Lost Stock Certificates

   Amgen only will issue (a) a statement indicating book-entry ownership of
Amgen common stock or, if requested, an Amgen stock certificate, (b) the cash
consideration, (c) cash in lieu of a fractional share and (d) any dividends or
distributions on Amgen common stock that may be applicable in a name other than
the name in which a surrendered Immunex stock certificate is registered if the
person requesting such exchange presents to the exchange agent all documents
required by the exchange agent to show and effect the unrecorded transfer of
ownership and to show that such person paid any applicable stock transfer
taxes. If an Immunex stock certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, the holder
of such certificate may need to execute an affidavit or post a bond prior to
receiving each of the items listed in the preceding sentence.

   The obligations of Amgen and Immunex to complete the merger are subject to
the satisfaction or waiver, if legally permissible, of the following conditions:

   .   the registration statement of which this joint proxy
       statement/prospectus is a part must be declared effective by the SEC and

   .   the receipt of all other governmental and regulatory consents, approvals

       Amgen common stock to be issued in the merger;

       or assets of Immunex or Amgen, or (b) seeking divestiture of any shares
       of Immunex common stock or seeking to impose limitations on the ability
       of Amgen to exercise effectively full rights of ownership of the shares
       of Immunex common stock, including the right to vote any securities on
       any matters properly presented to shareholders, in each case, which
       would, or would reasonably be expected to, have a material adverse
       effect on the combined company;

   .   the representations and warranties of the other party, disregarding all
       qualifications and exceptions relating to materiality or material
       adverse effect, being accurate on the date of the merger agreement and
       the date the merger is completed as if they were made on that date
       (except to the extent that the representations and warranties speak as
       of another date), except where the failure of such representations and
       warranties to be accurate would not reasonably be expected to have a
       material adverse effect on the representing party, and the receipt of a
       certificate of an executive officer of the other party to that effect;

   .   the other party having performed or complied with its agreements and
       covenants in the merger agreement in all material respects, and the
       receipt of a certificate of an executive officer of the other party to

stockholders' rights agreement, the amended and restated promotion agreement
and the agreement regarding governance and commercial matters by and among
Amgen and the various other parties to each agreement, being in full force and
effect, and the absence of any written notice from an authorized officer of
American Home Products of, and the absence of any public announcement by
American Home Products of, American Home Products' intention to repudiate any
of these agreements. These agreements are further described in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus under the headings "Stockholders' Rights Agreement,"
"Other Agreements with American Home Products--Amended and Restated Promotion
Agreement" and "Other Agreements with American Home Products--Agreement
Regarding Governance and Commercial Matters."

   "Material adverse effect," when used in reference to Amgen or Immunex, means
any change affecting, or condition having an effect on, the referenced company
that is, or would reasonably be expected to be, materially adverse to the
business, financial condition or results of operations of the referenced
company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. However, any change or
condition will not be deemed to have a material adverse effect if it results
from or arises out of:

   .   changes or developments in the biotechnology industry generally, which
       changes or developments do not disproportionately affect the referenced
       company relative to other participants in the biotechnology industry in
       any material respect;

   .   changes or developments in financial or securities markets or the
       economy in general, which changes do not disproportionately affect the
       referenced company in any material respect;

   .   any change in the referenced company's stock price or trading volume, in
       and of itself; or

   .   the announcement of the transactions contemplated by the merger
       agreement.

   .   properties.

   The merger agreement also contains additional representations and warranties
of Amgen relating to the ownership and activities of AMS Acquisition Inc. and
the funds necessary to pay the merger consideration upon completion of the
merger.

   The representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement are
subject to materiality and knowledge qualifications in many respects, and
expire at the completion of the merger.

Immunex Prohibited from Soliciting Other Offers

   Under the terms of the merger agreement, subject to specific exceptions
described below, Immunex has agreed that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries
will, and that it will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
representatives not to, directly or indirectly:

   .   solicit, initiate, encourage, knowingly facilitate or induce any inquiry
       with respect to, or the making, submission or announcement of, any
       acquisition proposal;

   .   participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to
       any person any nonpublic information with respect to, or take any other
       action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
       constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any acquisition
       proposal;

   .   engage in discussions with any person with respect to any acquisition
       proposal, except to notify such person as to the existence of the no
       solicitation provisions of the merger agreement;

   .   approve, endorse or recommend any acquisition proposal; or

   .   enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any agreement,
       commitment or understanding contemplating or otherwise relating to any
       acquisition proposal or a transaction contemplated thereby.

   Under the merger agreement, Immunex agreed to cease all existing discussions
or negotiations as of December 16, 2001 with any parties with respect to any
acquisition proposal.

   Immunex is obligated to notify Amgen promptly in writing upon receipt of any
type of acquisition proposal or any request for nonpublic information or
inquiry it reasonably believes could lead to an acquisition proposal. The
notice must include the material terms and conditions of the acquisition
proposal, request or inquiry, the identity of the person or group making the
acquisition proposal, request or inquiry and all related written materials
provided in connection with the acquisition proposal, request or inquiry.
Immunex also must provide Amgen with all information as is reasonably necessary
to keep Amgen informed in all material respects of the status and details of
any acquisition proposal, request or inquiry.

   Notwithstanding the prohibitions contained in the merger agreement, if
Immunex receives an acquisition proposal which constitutes a superior proposal
or which the Immunex board of directors in good faith concludes proposes
consideration that is more favorable to the Immunex shareholders than the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and which could reasonably be
expected to result in a superior proposal in all other respects, Immunex may,
after notifying Amgen, take the following actions:

   .   furnish nonpublic information to the third party making the acquisition
       proposal, provided it:

      (a) supplies to Amgen a copy of the information furnished concurrently
          with its delivery of the information to the third party; and

      (b) enters into a confidentiality agreement with the third party
          containing customary limitations on the use and disclosure of the
          non-public information furnished to the third party and customary
          standstill provisions; and

   .   engage in negotiations with the third party with respect to the
       acquisition proposal.

For a period of not less than five business days after Amgen's receipt from
Immunex of notice of a superior proposal, Immunex is required, if requested by
Amgen, to negotiate in good faith with Amgen to revise the merger agreement so
that the acquisition proposal that constituted a superior proposal no longer
constitutes a superior proposal.

   Amgen and Immunex have agreed to call, hold and convene a meeting of their
respective stockholders promptly after the registration statement of which this
joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part is declared

effective by the SEC. The Amgen board of directors also agreed to recommend to
Amgen stockholders the approval of the issuance of shares of Amgen common stock
in the merger and to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required
stockholder approval for the issuance of shares. The Immunex board of directors
agreed to recommend the approval of the merger agreement to its shareholders
and to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required shareholder
approval for the merger agreement. However, in response to the receipt of a
superior proposal that has not been withdrawn and continues to constitute a
superior proposal, the Immunex board of directors may withhold or withdraw its
recommendation and, in the case of a superior proposal that is a tender or
exchange offer made directly to the Immunex shareholders, may recommend that
the Immunex shareholders accept the tender or exchange offer, if both of the
following conditions are met:

   .   the Immunex shareholders meeting has not occurred; and

   .   the Immunex board of directors has concluded in good faith, following
       the receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel, that, in light of
       the superior proposal, the failure of the Immunex board of directors to
       change its recommendation would result in a breach of its fiduciary
       obligations to its shareholders under applicable law.

   Regardless of whether Immunex has received an acquisition proposal or
changed its recommendation, Immunex is obligated under the terms of the merger
agreement to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
shareholders to consider and vote upon the merger agreement. However, if
Immunex changes its recommendation of the merger agreement to the Immunex
shareholders as discussed in the previous paragraph, Immunex must submit the
merger agreement to a vote of Immunex shareholders with no recommendation as
permitted by Washington law. Immunex may not submit to the vote of its
shareholders any acquisition proposal (whether or not a superior proposal) or
propose to do so.

   No provision of the merger agreement restricts Immunex from complying with
Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or restricts
Immunex or Amgen from making such other disclosures as may be required by
federal securities laws or applicable State of Washington fiduciary duties laws.

   An "acquisition proposal" means any offer or proposal made by a person other
than Amgen concerning any:

   .   merger, consolidation, business combination, or similar transaction
       involving Immunex or any significant subsidiary of Immunex pursuant to
       which the shareholders of Immunex immediately prior to such transaction
       would own less than 80% of any class of equity securities of the entity
       surviving or resulting from such transaction (or the ultimate parent
       entity thereof);

   .   sale or other disposition directly or indirectly of assets of Immunex or
       its subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the consolidated assets of
       Immunex and its subsidiaries;

   .   issuance, sale or other disposition of securities (or options, rights or
       warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable
       for, such securities) in each case by Immunex representing 20% or more
       of the voting power of Immunex; or

   .   transaction in which any person would acquire beneficial ownership, or
       the right to acquire beneficial ownership or any group would have been
       formed which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial
       ownership of, 20% or more of the outstanding voting capital stock of
       Immunex.

   A "superior proposal" means any bona fide offer or proposal (on its most
recently amended or modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a person
other than Amgen that:

   .   concerns any:

      (a) merger, tender offer, exchange offer, business combination or similar
          transaction involving Immunex or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to
          which:

           -  shareholders of Immunex immediately prior to the transaction
              would own less than 50% of the voting power of the entity
              surviving or resulting from the transaction (or the ultimate
              parent entity thereof); and

           -  shareholders of Immunex other than American Home Products would
              own less than 30% of the voting power of the entity surviving or
              resulting from the transaction (or the ultimate parent entity
              thereof); or

      (b) sale or other disposition directly or indirectly of assets of Immunex
          or any of its subsidiaries representing 67% or more of the
          consolidated assets of Immunex and its subsidiaries;

   .   is on terms which the Immunex board of directors in good faith concludes
       (following receipt of the advice of its financial advisors and outside
       counsel) are more favorable to the Immunex shareholders (in their
       capacities as shareholders) than the transactions contemplated by the
       merger agreement (including any revisions thereto); and

   .   is, in the good faith judgment of Immunex, reasonably likely to be
       completed and financed.

Conduct of Business Before Completion of the Merger

  General Restrictions on Operations

   Amgen and Immunex have agreed to restrictions on their respective activities
until either the completion of the merger or the termination of the merger
agreement. In general, Amgen is required to conduct its business such that its
primary business will involve biotechnology or pharmaceuticals. Immunex is
required to conduct its businesses in the usual and ordinary course consistent
with past practice and to use its reasonable best efforts to keep available the
services of the current officers, key employees and consultants of Immunex and
its subsidiaries and to preserve the current relationships of Immunex and its
subsidiaries with their customers, suppliers and other persons with which
Immunex and its subsidiaries have significant business relations as is
reasonably necessary in order to preserve substantially intact its business
organization.

  Additional Restrictions on Amgen's Interim Operations

   In addition, Amgen has also agreed that, without the written consent of
Immunex, it will not and not permit any of its subsidiaries to:

   .   amend or otherwise change its certificate of incorporation in a manner
       that adversely affects the rights of holders of Amgen common stock
       (including holders of the Amgen common stock issuable in the merger),
       except to increase the authorized number of shares of Amgen capital
       stock;

   .   issue any shares of Amgen common stock if, following such issuance,
       there would be an insufficient number of shares of Amgen common stock to
       pay the merger consideration and to be reserved for issuance in
       connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

   .   declare, set aside, make or pay any dividend or other distribution,
       payable in cash, stock property or otherwise, with respect to any Amgen

       combination) that is intended or could reasonably be expected to result
       in any of the conditions to the merger not being satisfied; and

   .   authorize or enter into any agreement or otherwise make any commitment
       to do any of the foregoing.

  Additional Restrictions on the Interim Operations of Immunex

written consent of Amgen, it will not and will not permit any of its
subsidiaries to:

   .   amend or otherwise change its articles or certificate of incorporation
       or bylaws or equivalent organizational documents;

   .   issue, sell, pledge, dispose of, grant, transfer, encumber, or authorize
       the issuance, sale, pledge, disposition, grant, transfer or encumbrance

          common stock to existing employees and non-employee directors, (2)

      (c) issuances of equity securities under the governance agreement between

          conduct of the business of Immunex and in connection with obtaining
          regulatory approval as contemplated by the merger agreement;

      (b) any intellectual property which protects ENBREL, except pursuant to

Restructure of Transaction

   Each of Amgen and Immunex has agreed that it will not take any action that
would disqualify the merger, and to use its reasonable best efforts to take any
action to qualify the merger, as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. If tax counsel to either Amgen or Immunex
is unable to render its opinion that the merger qualifies as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, the parties
have agreed to restructure the transaction such that tax counsel to Amgen and
Immunex are able to render their opinions. No such restructuring of the
transaction shall (A) result in any change in the merger consideration, (B) be
materially adverse to the interests of Amgen, Immunex, AMS Acquisition, Amgen
stockholders, or Immunex shareholders, or (C) unreasonably impede or delay
consummation of the merger. If the transaction is restructured in such a
manner, the material tax consequences of the merger would be the same as those
described in section entitled "The Merger--Material United States Federal
Income Tax Consequences."

Regulatory Filings; Antitrust Matters; Obtaining Regulatory Approvals

   Amgen and Immunex have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to:

   .   take all appropriate action and do all things necessary under applicable
       law or otherwise to consummate the merger as promptly as practicable;

   .   obtain from any governmental entities any consents, licenses, permits,
       waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained or
       made by either party, to avoid any action or proceeding by any
       governmental entity related to the merger agreement and to prevent a
       material adverse effect on Immunex from occurring prior to or after the
       closing or a material adverse effect on Amgen from occurring after the
       effective time of the merger;

   .   make all necessary filings with respect to the merger agreement required
       under applicable federal and state securities laws, the
       Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and antitrust and
       competition laws of any other applicable jurisdiction and any other
       applicable law; and

   .   avoid the entry of, or have terminated, any decree, order or judgment
       that would restrain, prevent or delay the merger, including defending
       through litigation any claim asserted in any court.

   In furtherance of the foregoing, Amgen and Immunex have agreed to use their
reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
any antitrust, competition or trade regulation law that may

be asserted by any governmental entity with respect to the merger so as to
enable the closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible, including
implementing, contesting or resisting any litigation before any court or
quasi-judicial administrative tribunal seeking to restrain or enjoin the
merger. However, neither Amgen nor Immunex is required to commit to any
divestitures, licenses or hold separate or similar arrangements with respect to
its assets or conduct of business arrangements, whether as a condition to
obtaining any approval from a governmental entity or any other person or for
any other reason, if such divestiture, license, holding separate or arrangement
is not conditioned upon the consummation of the merger or would have a material
adverse effect on Amgen after giving effect to the merger.

Employee Benefit Matters

  Immunex Stock Options

   Under the merger agreement, each outstanding option to purchase shares of
Immunex common stock will be assumed by Amgen at the effective time of the
merger and (except for converted options described in the next paragraph and
Mr. Fritzky's incentive stock option described in the section "The
Merger--Interests of Directors, Executive Officers and Shareholders of Immunex
in the Merger") will thereafter constitute an option to acquire the number
(rounded down to the nearest whole number) of shares of Amgen common stock
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Immunex common stock subject
to the option immediately prior to the merger by 0.52. The per share exercise
price for the Amgen common stock issuable upon conversion of these Immunex
options will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price
per share of Immunex common stock that otherwise could have been purchased
under the Immunex stock option by 0.52. Each of these options will be subject
to the same terms and conditions as were in effect for the related option
immediately prior to the merger, except that each option, other than the
options discussed below, that was outstanding on the date of the merger
agreement will fully vest and become exercisable as to all shares of Amgen
common stock subject thereto.

   At the effective time of the merger, each option to purchase shares of
Immunex common stock with an exercise price greater than the higher of $40 or
the closing price of a share of Immunex common stock on the last trading day
prior to the merger will be converted into an option to purchase that number of
whole shares of Amgen common stock equal to 40% of the number of shares subject
to the related converted option (rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares) at an exercise price per share equal to the fair market value of a
share of Amgen common stock on the date on which the converted option is
granted (which shall be as of the close of market on the date of the effective
time of the merger). The options for Amgen common stock granted with respect to
these converted options will be subject to the same terms and conditions
(including vesting schedule) as were in effect for the related converted option
immediately prior to the merger.

  Immunex Employee Stock Purchase Plan

   Each outstanding purchase right under the employee stock purchase plan of
Immunex will be assumed by Amgen and converted into a right to purchase Amgen
common stock. Each purchase right so assumed and converted by Amgen will
continue to have the same terms and conditions set forth in the employee stock
purchase plan of Immunex and the other documents governing the outstanding
purchase rights under the plan, except that the purchase price of shares of
Amgen common stock and the number of shares of Amgen common stock to be issued
upon the exercise of the purchase rights will be adjusted in a manner which
preserves the tax treatment of such purchase rights as an option to which
Section 421(a) of the Internal Revenue Code applies.

  Immunex Employees

   For a period of at least two years following the effective time of the
merger, Amgen has agreed to provide employee benefits (excluding equity based
benefits) to employees and former employees of Immunex that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than those provided to employees of Immunex as of
December 16, 2001. Amgen

also agreed to give continuing Immunex employees credit for prior service with
Immunex for purposes of (a) determining vesting and entitlement to certain
benefits under Amgen's benefit plans and (b) satisfying any waiting periods,
evidence of insurability requirements or the application of any pre-existing
condition limitations. However, service credit will not be given where such
crediting would result in a duplication of benefits. Amgen has also agreed to
waive pre-existing condition limitations to the same extent waived under the
applicable Immunex benefit plan. Continuing Immunex employees will also be
given credit for amounts paid under a corresponding benefit plan during the
same period for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket
maximums.

Indemnification and Insurance

   Amgen has agreed to cause to be maintained in effect provisions of the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of Immunex with respect to indemnification
and advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable to the intended
beneficiaries as those contained in the existing articles of incorporation and
bylaws of Immunex. Amgen has also agreed to indemnify, and provide advancement
of expenses to, all past and present directors, officers and employees of
Immunex and its subsidiaries to the fullest extent permitted by law for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger in their
capacities as such. Amgen will honor all indemnification agreements entered
into by Immunex or any of its subsidiaries.

   For six years from the effective time of the merger, Amgen will maintain for
the benefit of the current directors and officers of Immunex an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for acts or omissions occurring
prior to the effective time of the merger covering each person currently
covered by the officers' and directors' liability insurance policies of Immunex
on terms with respect to coverage and in amounts no less favorable than those
of the policies of Immunex in effect as of December 16, 2001. However, Amgen is
not required to pay an annual premium for the insurance in excess of 200% of
the estimated premium for the 2002 fiscal year.

Termination of the Merger Agreement

  Termination by Amgen or Immunex

   Either Immunex or Amgen, by action of their respective boards of directors,
may terminate the merger agreement and abandon the merger at any time prior to
completion of the merger, whether before or after approval of the merger
agreement by Immunex shareholders or the approval of the issuance of shares of
Amgen common stock to Immunex shareholders by Amgen stockholders:

   .   by mutual written consent of Amgen and Immunex;

   .   if the merger is not completed by September 30, 2002 (which may, from
       time to time, be extended by either party up to and including December
       31, 2002 in the event all conditions to effect the merger other than one
       or more of the regulatory conditions have been or are capable of being
       satisfied at the time of each such extension and the regulatory
       conditions have been or are reasonably capable of being satisfied on or
       prior to December 31, 2002), except that this right to terminate the
       merger agreement is not available to any party whose failure to fulfill
       any obligation under the merger agreement has been the cause of the
       failure of the merger to close;

   .   if any governmental entity issues an order, decree or ruling or taken
       any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
       prohibiting the merger, and such order, decree, ruling or other action
       has become final and nonappealable; or

   .   if (a) the Immunex shareholders do not approve the merger agreement at a
       duly convened shareholders meeting at which the vote to approve the
       merger agreement was taken, or (b) the Amgen stockholders do not approve
       the issuance of Amgen common stock to Immunex shareholders in the merger
       at a duly convened stockholders meeting at which the vote to approve the
       share issuance was taken.

  Termination by Amgen

   Amgen, by action of the Amgen board of directors, may terminate the merger
agreement and abandon the merger at any time prior to completion of the merger,
whether before or after approval of the merger agreement by Immunex
shareholders or the approval of the issuance of shares of Amgen common stock to
Immunex shareholders by Amgen stockholders:

   .   if (a) the Immunex board of directors withdraws or adversely modifies
       its recommendation (or resolves to do so) of the merger agreement; (b)
       the Immunex board of directors approves or recommends (or resolves to do
       so) to the Immunex shareholders an acquisition proposal other than the
       merger agreement; or (c) Immunex fails to call or hold its special
       meeting of shareholders by September 25, 2002; or

   .   if there has been a breach by Immunex of any representation, warranty,
       covenant or agreement contained in the merger agreement which (a) would
       result in a failure of a closing condition relating to the accuracy of
       the representations and warranties of Immunex or the performance by
       Immunex of its obligations under the merger agreement and (b) cannot be
       cured prior to September 30, 2002 (as that date may be extended).
       However, Amgen is required to give Immunex written notice, delivered at
       least twenty days prior to such termination, stating Amgen's intention
       to terminate the merger agreement and the basis for the termination.

  Termination by Immunex

   Immunex, by action of the Immunex board of directors, may terminate the
merger agreement and abandon the merger at any time prior to completion of the
merger, whether before or after approval of the merger agreement by Immunex
shareholders or the approval of the issuance of shares of Amgen common stock to
Immunex shareholders by Amgen stockholders:

   .   if (a) the Amgen board of directors withdraws or adversely modifies its
       recommendation (or resolves to do so) of the issuance of shares of Amgen
       common stock to Immunex shareholders in the merger; or (b) Amgen fails
       to call or hold its special meeting of stockholders by September 25,
       2002; or

   .   if there has been a breach by Amgen of any representation, warranty,
       covenant or agreement contained in the merger agreement which (a) would
       result in a failure of a closing condition relating to the accuracy of
       the representations and warranties of Amgen or the performance by Amgen
       of its obligations under the merger agreement and (b) cannot be cured
       prior to September 30, 2002 (as that date may be extended). However,
       Immunex is required to give Amgen written notice, delivered at least
       twenty days prior to such termination, stating the intention of Immunex
       to terminate the merger agreement and the basis for the termination.

Termination Fee

   Each of Amgen and Immunex have agreed to pay to the other a termination fee
of $475 million within two business days of the occurrence of a triggering
event in relation to it as described below.

  Termination Fee to be Paid by Amgen

   Amgen has agreed to pay Immunex a termination fee of $475 million if:

   .   the Amgen board of directors withdraws or adversely modifies its
       recommendation of the issuance of Amgen common stock to Immunex
       shareholders in the merger and, thereafter, the merger agreement is
       terminated by Amgen or Immunex because the Amgen stockholders did not
       approve the issuance of Amgen common stock to Immunex shareholders in
       the merger; or

   .   the merger agreement is terminated by Immunex because Amgen failed to
       call or hold its special meeting of stockholders by September 25, 2002.

  Termination Fee to be Paid by Immunex

   Immunex has agreed to pay Amgen a termination fee of $475 million if:

   .   the merger agreement is terminated by Amgen because the Immunex board of
       directors withdraws or adversely modifies its recommendation (or
       resolves to do so) of the merger agreement and has done so in such a
       manner that Immunex cannot submit the merger agreement to a vote of the
       Immunex shareholders pursuant to Chapter 23B.11.030(2) of the Washington
       Business Corporation Act;

   .   the merger agreement is terminated by Amgen because the Immunex board of
       directors approved or recommended (or resolves to do so) to the Immunex
       shareholders an acquisition proposal other than the merger agreement;

   .   the merger agreement is terminated by Amgen because Immunex failed to
       call or hold its special meeting of shareholders by September 25, 2002;

   .   the Immunex board of directors has withdrawn or adversely modified its
       recommendation of the merger agreement prior to the special meeting of
       Immunex shareholders and the merger agreement is terminated by Amgen
       because Immunex shareholders did not approve the merger agreement; or

   .   the merger agreement is terminated by Amgen or Immunex because the
       Immunex shareholders did not approve the merger agreement and, at any
       time after December 16, 2001 and before the vote at the Immunex
       shareholders meeting, an acquisition proposal has been publicly
       announced and not bona fide withdrawn and Immunex enters into a
       definitive agreement with respect to a competing transaction or
       completes a competing transaction, in either case, within twelve months
       following the termination of the merger agreement.

   A "competing transaction" means any (a) merger, consolidation, business
combination or similar transaction involving Immunex or any significant
subsidiary of Immunex pursuant to which the Immunex shareholders immediately
prior to such transaction would own less than 70% of any class of equity
securities of the entity surviving or resulting from such transaction (or the
ultimate parent entity thereof), (b) sale or other disposition directly or
indirectly of assets of Immunex or its subsidiaries representing 30% or more of
the consolidated assets of Immunex and its subsidiaries, (c) issuance, sale, or
other disposition of securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) in each case
by Immunex to any person or "group" (as defined in Rule 13d-5(b)(1) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934) representing 30% or more of the voting power
of Immunex or (d) transaction in which any person would acquire beneficial
ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial ownership or any group would have
been formed which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial
ownership of, 30% or more of the outstanding voting capital stock of Immunex
(other than any shares beneficially owned by American Home Products or its
subsidiaries).

   Except as described in the sections entitled "Termination Fees" and
"Expenses," neither party will have any liability to the other upon termination
of the merger agreement, unless it breaches its obligations with respect to
confidentiality under the merger agreement or willfully and materially breaches
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under the merger
agreement.

Expenses

   If the merger agreement is terminated by either Amgen or Immunex because of
a breach by the other party of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in the merger agreement, the breaching party
will pay the other party's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses up to an amount
equal to $15 million. Amgen and Immunex have agreed to each pay one-half of the
expenses related to printing, filing and mailing this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and all SEC and other regulatory filing fees incurred in
connection with the registration statement of which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is a part. Except as described in the previous two
sentences, all expenses incurred by Amgen and Immunex in connection with the
merger will be borne solely and entirely by the party which has incurred the
expense.

Amendments, Extensions and Waivers

  Amendments

   The merger agreement may be amended by action of the Amgen board of
directors and the Immunex board of directors at any time prior to the effective
time of the merger. However, after approval of the merger agreement by the
Immunex shareholders, no amendment may be made without further shareholder
approval which, by law or in accordance with the rules of the Nasdaq National
Market, requires further approval by the Immunex shareholders. All amendments
to the merger agreement must be in writing signed by each party.

  Extensions and Waivers

   At any time prior to the effective time of the merger, any party to the
merger agreement may:

   .   extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
       acts of any other party to the merger agreement;

   .   waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any
       other party contained in the merger agreement or in any document
       delivered pursuant the merger agreement; and

   .   waive compliance by any other party with any of the agreements or
       conditions contained in the merger agreement.

However, after any approval of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement by the Immunex shareholders, there may not be, without further
approval of the Immunex shareholders, any extension or waiver of the merger
agreement or any portion of the merger agreement which, by law or in accordance
with the rules of the Nasdaq National Market, requires further approval by the
Immunex shareholders. All extensions and waivers must be in writing and signed
by the party against whom the extension or waiver is to be effective.

                         SHAREHOLDER VOTING AGREEMENT

   The following summary describes certain material provisions of the
shareholder voting agreement, which is attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex B and is incorporated by reference into this
joint proxy statement/prospectus. This summary may not contain all of the
information about the shareholder voting agreement that is important to you. We
encourage you to read the shareholder voting agreement carefully in its
entirety.

   Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, Amgen
entered into a shareholder voting agreement with American Home Products
Corporation, and two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, MDP Holdings, Inc. and
Lederle Parenterals, Inc. These Immunex shareholders are referred to as the
"AHP shareholders" in this summary of the shareholder voting agreement and in
the summary of the stockholders' rights agreement below. As of the record date
for the Immunex special meeting, the AHP shareholders beneficially owned
shares of Immunex common stock, representing approximately       % of the
outstanding shares of Immunex common stock.

   Under the shareholder voting agreement, the AHP shareholders agreed to vote
their shares of Immunex common stock:

   .   in favor of the approval of the terms of the merger agreement;

   .   against any action, proposal, transaction or agreement that would result
       in a breach in any respect of any covenant, representation or warranty
       or any other obligation or agreement of Immunex contained in the merger
       agreement or of any of the AHP shareholders contained in the shareholder
       voting agreement; and

   .   except with the written consent of Amgen, against the following actions
       or proposals (other than the merger with Amgen):

      (a) any acquisition proposal;

      (b) any change in the persons who constitute the Immunex board of
          directors that is not approved in advance by at least a majority of
          the persons who were directors of the Immunex on December 16, 2001
          (or their successors who were so approved);

      (c) any material change in the present capitalization of Immunex or any
          amendment of the articles of incorporation or bylaws of Immunex;

      (d) any other material change in the corporate structure or business of
          Immunex; or

      (e) any other action or proposal involving Immunex or any of its
          subsidiaries that is intended, or could reasonably be expected, to
          prevent, delay or adversely affect the transactions contemplated by
          the merger agreement.

   However, the shareholder voting agreement does not limit or affect any
actions taken by any member of the Immunex board of directors nominated by, or
appointed at the request of, American Home Products solely in his or her
capacity as a director of Immunex. The AHP shareholders have given Amgen an
irrevocable proxy to vote their shares of Immunex common stock on the matters
set forth above.

   The shareholder voting agreement prohibits any AHP shareholders from
transferring any shares of Immunex common stock, except to other AHP
shareholders or to any wholly-owned subsidiary of American Home Products that
agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of the shareholder voting agreement.
However, with the consent of Amgen (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld), the AHP shareholders may pledge or encumber any of their shares of
Immunex common stock so long as the pledge or encumbrance would not impair
their ability to perform their obligations under the shareholder voting
agreement.

   Each AHP shareholder also agreed:

   .   it will not participate in a solicitation of proxies or powers of
       attorney or similar rights to vote, or seek to advise or influence any
       person with respect to the voting of, any shares of Immunex common stock
       in connection with any vote or other action on any matter, other than to
       recommend that the Immunex shareholders vote in favor of the merger
       agreement;

   .   it will not act in concert with any person to, deposit any shares of
       Immunex common stock in a voting trust or subject any shares of Immunex
       common stock to any arrangement with any person with respect to the
       voting of such shares of Immunex common stock, except as permitted by
       the shareholder voting agreement; and

   .   it will not enter into or conduct any discussions or negotiations with,
       or encourage or respond to any inquiries by, or provide any information
       to, any person, other than Amgen, relating to any acquisition proposal;
       however, in connection with superior proposals as to which Amgen has
       received written notice from Immunex, American Home Products may provide
       information and engage in discussions to the same extent as Immunex is
       permitted under the merger agreement.

   Amgen agreed to take all actions necessary to ensure that each AHP
shareholder will receive the cash portion of the merger consideration payable
to such AHP shareholder immediately after the effective time of the merger.

   The shareholder voting agreement terminates upon the earliest to occur of:

   .   the mutual consent of Amgen and American Home Products;

   .   the completion of the merger;

   .   the date the merger agreement is terminated;

   .   the date of any modification, waiver or amendment to the merger
       agreement in a manner that reduces either the merger exchange ratio or
       the cash consideration payable in the merger; and

   .   December 31, 2002.

                        STOCKHOLDERS' RIGHTS AGREEMENT

   The following summary describes certain material provisions of the
stockholders' rights agreement, which is attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex C and is incorporated by reference into this
joint proxy statement/prospectus. This summary may not contain all of the
information about the stockholders' rights agreement that is important to you.
We encourage you to read the stockholders' rights agreement carefully in its
entirety.

   In connection with the execution and delivery of the merger agreement, Amgen
entered into a stockholders' rights agreement with the AHP shareholders dated
as of the date of the merger agreement.

Standstill Provisions

   Under the stockholders' rights agreement, the AHP shareholders agreed that
until December 16, 2006, the AHP shareholders may not:

   .   acquire or propose to acquire any securities of Amgen or its
       subsidiaries or any assets of Amgen or its subsidiaries or make any
       public announcement with respect to any of the foregoing;

   .   participate in any way in any solicitation of proxies to vote, or seek
       to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of, any
       securities of Amgen or make any public announcement with respect to any
       of the foregoing;

   .   form or in any way participate in a group in connection with any of the
       foregoing;

   .   otherwise act to seek to control or influence Amgen's management, board
       of directors or policies;

   .   request Amgen to amend or waive the standstill provisions of the
       stockholders' rights agreement or take any action which would reasonably
       be expected to require Amgen to make a public announcement regarding the
       possibility of a business combination or merger or make any public
       announcement with respect to any of the restrictions in this clause; or

   .   advise, assist or encourage, or direct any person to advise, assist or
       encourage any other persons, in connection with any of the foregoing.

   The above restrictions do not apply to:

   .   purchases by American Home Products of Amgen common stock for employee
       benefit or other plans not to exceed 1% of the outstanding shares of
       Amgen common stock; or

   .   securities held by a company that American Home Products acquires in the
       future, if the fair market value of the securities represents less than
       20% of the assets of that company. However, American Home Products must
       use commercially reasonable efforts to divest those securities within 18
       months of the consummation of the acquisition.

Voting of Amgen Common Stock

   Under the stockholders' rights agreement, the AHP shareholders agreed that,
until the AHP shareholders beneficially own in the aggregate less than 2% of
the outstanding shares of Amgen common stock, the AHP shareholders must cause
all shares of Amgen common stock beneficially owned by them to be voted:

   .   with respect to the election of directors, in favor of those individuals
       nominated by the Amgen board of directors or a nominating committee of
       the Amgen board of directors;

   .   on all proposals of any other Amgen stockholder, in accordance with the
       recommendation of the Amgen board of directors; and

   .   on all other matters that come before Amgen stockholders for a vote, in
       proportion to the votes cast by the other Amgen stockholders.

Lock-Up of Shares of Amgen Common Stock Acquired in the Merger

   Under the stockholders' rights agreement, the AHP shareholders and Amgen
agreed that for 90 days following the closing of the merger, none of the AHP
shareholders may transfer any shares of Amgen common stock other than transfers:

   .   to a wholly-owned subsidiary of American Home Products;

   .   pursuant to a third party tender offer or exchange offer which was not
       induced by an AHP shareholder and (a) which is approved by the Amgen
       board of directors or (b) in circumstances in which it is reasonably
       likely that AHP shareholders would be, as a result of not tendering or
       exchanging, forced to receive consideration that is different than the
       consideration available to those stockholders who did tender or exchange;

   .   arising as a result of a merger or similar transaction involving Amgen;
       or

   .   in the form of a pledge in connection with bona fide financings (other
       than derivative transactions) with a financial institution, provided the
       pledgee agrees to the applicable restrictions set forth in stockholders'
       rights agreement.

Volume Limitations on Sales of Amgen Common Stock

   The AHP shareholders and their affiliates may not transfer more than 20
million shares of Amgen common stock (including common stock underlying
derivative transactions) in any calendar quarter, excluding shares of Amgen
common stock transferred pursuant to underwritten syndicated offerings.

   In addition, the aggregate number of shares of Amgen common stock underlying
derivative transactions effected in any calendar week by the AHP shareholders
may not exceed 20% of the aggregate trading volume of Amgen common stock on the
Nasdaq National Market in the immediately preceding calendar week.

Registration Rights

  Shelf Registration

   Amgen will prepare and file with the SEC immediately after the closing of
the merger a registration statement registering the resale of Amgen common
stock from time to time by the AHP shareholders or any other permitted holders
of the Amgen common stock received by the AHP shareholders in the merger. Amgen
has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to:

   .   cause the shelf registration statement to be declared effective within
       90 days after the closing of the merger; and

   .   keep the shelf registration statement continuously effective until the
       earlier of (a) the first anniversary of the closing of the merger and
       (b) the sale of all of the securities included in the shelf registration
       statement.

   The AHP shareholders, or any other permitted holders of the Amgen common
stock received by the AHP shareholders in the merger, may request Amgen to
effect an underwritten syndicated offering by supplement or amendment to the
shelf registration statement. In this case, Amgen and the requesting party or
parties will enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the
underwriters for the offering which will be underwritten by two co-managing
underwriters with the requesting holders selecting one co-managing underwriter
and Amgen selecting the second co-managing underwriter. In some circumstances,
Amgen may delay an offering for a limited period of time.

   Amgen is only obligated to effect two offerings under the shelf registration
statement and each of these offerings must include at least 5 million shares of
Amgen common stock. Inaddition, these underwritten offerings will be subject to
cutback if either of the co-managing underwriters reasonably advises Amgen that
the number of shares of Amgen common stock requested to be included in the
offering exceeds the number that can be sold in the offering at a price
reasonably related to the then current market value of Amgen common stock.

  Demand Registration Rights

   Beginning on the first anniversary of the closing of the merger, and until
the fourth anniversary of the closing of the merger, the AHP shareholders, or
any other permitted holders of the Amgen common stock received by the AHP
shareholders in the merger, may request that Amgen file a registration
statement covering the registration of a minimum of 5 million shares of Amgen
common stock held by these holders in an underwritten offering. Amgen has
agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be registered all
the shares that the requesting party or parties have requested to be registered.

   Offerings pursuant to demand registrations will be underwritten by two
co-managing underwriters with the requesting holders selecting one co-managing
underwriter and Amgen selecting the second co-managing underwriter. Amgen is
obligated to effect up to four demand registrations, less the number of
underwritten offerings effected under the shelf registration statement. These
offerings will be subject to customary cutbacks if either of the co-managing
underwriters reasonably advises Amgen that the shares of Amgen common stock
requested to be included in the offering exceeds the number that can be sold in
the offering at a price reasonably related to the then current market value of
Amgen common stock. In certain circumstances, Amgen may delay an offering for a
limited period of time. Furthermore, the Amgen board of directors may delay the
filing of a demand registration statement if the filing would likely materially
interfere with a potential contemplated material financing, acquisition,
corporation reorganization, corporate development or merger or other
transaction involving Amgen.

   If Amgen files a demand registration statement registering an underwritten
offering of Amgen common stock on behalf of any AHP shareholder, or any other
permitted holders of the Amgen common stock received by the AHP shareholders in
the merger, Amgen may include in the registration statement shares of Amgen
common stock for its own account. Amgen's right to so include shares for its
own account is subject to cutback if either of the co-managing underwriters
reasonably advises American Home Products that the number of shares of Amgen
common stock requested to be included in the offering exceeds the number that
can be sold in the offering at a price reasonably related to the then current
market value of Amgen common stock.

  Piggy Back Registration Rights

   If Amgen files a registration statement registering an underwritten offering
of Amgen common stock on its behalf or on behalf of other holders of Amgen
common stock, the AHP shareholders, or any other permitted holders of the Amgen
common stock received by the AHP shareholders in the merger, have the right to
request that Amgen include their Amgen common stock in the registration
statement. This right to include Amgen common stock is subject to customary
cutbacks if the managing underwriter, to be selected by Amgen, advises Amgen
that the number securities requested to be included in the offering exceeds the
number that can be sold in the offering at a price reasonably related to the
then current market value of Amgen common stock. Furthermore, Amgen may decide
for any reason not to proceed with the proposed registration and may, at its
election, give written notice of the determination to the parties requesting
inclusion in the registration, and, thereupon, Amgen will be relieved of its
obligation to register any shares of Amgen common stock in connection with that
registration statement.

  Expenses of Registration; Indemnification

   All expenses incurred in connection with each shelf registration and demand
registration will be borne by the AHP shareholders or any other permitted
holders participating in the registration. The AHP shareholders and

other permitted holders will also bear the underwriting commissions and
discounts applicable to the securities offered for their account. In connection
with the exercise of the AHP shareholders of their piggy-back registration
rights, the AHP shareholders will bear the underwriting commissions and
discounts applicable to the securities offered for their account and Amgen will
pay all other expenses.

   Amgen and the AHP shareholders have agreed to indemnify each other for third
party claims arising out of securities law violations under customary
circumstances.

  Termination

   Except with respect to the standstill provisions and the voting provisions,
which will terminate as described above, the stockholders' rights agreement and
the obligations of the parties under it will terminate on the first date on
which the AHP shareholders, and any of their subsidiaries or affiliates,
beneficially own, in the aggregate, less than 5 million shares of Amgen common
stock.

                 OTHER AGREEMENTS WITH AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS

   The following summaries describe certain material provisions of the amended
and restated promotion agreement and the agreement regarding governance and
commercial matters, which were filed as exhibits to the registration statement
of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part and which are
incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. These
summaries may not contain all of the information about these agreements that is
important to you. We encourage you to read each agreement carefully in its
entirety.

Amended and Restated Promotion Agreement

   Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, Amgen entered into
an agreement with American Home Products to amend and restate an existing
long-term promotion agreement between American Home Products and Immunex. The
principal operative terms of the amendment and restatement of the promotion
agreement will become effective at the effective time of the merger.

   Under the amended and restated promotion agreement, American Home Products
and Immunex will jointly market and sell ENBREL to all appropriate customer
segments in the United States and Canada for all approved indications other
than oncology. The rights to promote ENBREL in the United States and Canada for
oncology indications are reserved to Immunex.

   Under the amended and restated promotion agreement, an ENBREL management
committee comprised of an equal number of representatives from Immunex and from
American Home Products will be responsible for overseeing the marketing and
sales of ENBREL including strategic planning, approval of an annual marketing
plan, product pricing and establishing an ENBREL brand team. The ENBREL brand
team, with equal representation from each party, will prepare and implement the
annual marketing plan and will be responsible for all sales activities. The
agreement provides that each of Immunex and American Home Products will:

   .   have primary tactical execution responsibility for specific activities
       identified within the agreement or as directed by the management
       committee;

   .   be required to maintain a minimum level of financial commitment to
       promotion and marketing and a minimum number of sales personnel for
       ENBREL as established from time to time by the management committee; and

   .   pay a defined percentage of all marketing and sales expenses approved by
       the management committee.

   The amended and restated promotion agreement further provides that Immunex
will:

   .   record all product sales of ENBREL in the United States and Canada made
       under the agreement;

   .   pay American Home Products a percentage of the annual gross profits of
       ENBREL in the United States and Canada attributable to all indications
       for ENBREL, other than oncology indications, on a scale that increases
       as gross profits increase;

   .   retain a majority percentage of these nononcology gross profits in the
       United States and Canada on an annual basis;

   .   be entitled to keep all of the gross profits attributable to any future
       United States or Canadian oncology indications for ENBREL; and

   .   pay American Home Products specified residual royalties on a declining
       scale based on net sales of ENBREL in the United States and Canada in
       the three years following the expiration or termination of American Home
       Products' detailing and promotion of ENBREL.

   If American Home Products sells or distributes a biologic product in the
United States and Canada that is directly competitive with ENBREL, as defined
in the amended and restated promotion agreement, and subject to

several exclusions, American Home Products will give Immunex prior written
notice and, upon the request of Immunex, the parties will attempt in good faith
to either establish mutually acceptable terms under which Immunex will
co-promote this competitive biologic product or establish other terms for a
commercial relationship with American Home Products, or negotiate an adjustment
to the gross profits allocated to American Home Products under the amended and
restated promotion agreement. If Immunex is unable to establish acceptable
terms with American Home Products within 90 days of the request of Immunex,
Immunex will have the option to reacquire from American Home Products all
marketing rights to ENBREL in the United States and Canada and terminate the
amended and restated promotion agreement, subject to the payment by Immunex of
a substantial amount to American Home Products over a defined period. If
American Home Products obtains a biologic product that is directly competitive
with ENBREL through the acquisition of another company and Immunex reacquires
the marketing rights to ENBREL in the United States and Canada, American Home
Products' primary field sales force that had detailed ENBREL in the relevant
territory within the United States and Canada for a specified period will not
sell, detail or otherwise distribute the competitive biologic product for a
specified period in the United States and Canada.

   American Home Products has agreed to reimburse Immunex for a defined
percentage of the clinical and regulatory expenses it incurs in connection with
the filing and approval of any new indications for ENBREL in the United States
and Canada, excluding oncology and rheumatoid arthritis indications. American
Home Products' reimbursement of these clinical and regulatory expenses is in
addition to another existing cost-sharing arrangement between Immunex and
American Home Products for development costs related to ENBREL. The additional
American Home Products reimbursement for clinical and regulatory expenses under
this agreement, a portion of which is payable upon regulatory filing of any new
indication and the remainder of which will be payable upon regulatory approval
of any new indication, if any, applies for that part of the United States and
Canadian clinical and regulatory expenses for ENBREL for which Immunex would
otherwise be financially responsible under the cost-sharing provisions in the
other cost-sharing agreement. American Home Products has also agreed to
reimburse Immunex under this agreement for a defined percentage of specified
patent expenses related to ENBREL, including any up-front license fees and
milestones, as well as patent litigation and interference expenses.

   Subject to specified limitations, American Home Products will also be
responsible for a defined percentage of the liabilities, costs and expenses
associated with the manufacture, use or sale of ENBREL in the United States or
Canada.

Agreement Regarding Governance and Commercial Matters

   Amgen has also entered into an agreement regarding governance and commercial
matters with American Home Products and its wholly-owned subsidiary, American
Cyanamid Company, that provides, among other things, that:

   .   if American Home Products exercises its rights under an existing product
       rights agreement between American Home Products and Immunex to acquire
       all of the rights of Immunex to one or more specified products under
       development by Immunex, or the rights to market or promote those
       products, American Home Products' rights will terminate at the effective
       time of the merger. Upon such a termination, Amgen must reimburse
       American Home Products for any amounts paid to Immunex in conjunction
       with its exercise of those rights;

   .   the product rights agreement will be amended as of the effective time of
       the merger to terminate the rights described above in exchange for a
       specified payment to American Home Products;

   .   Amgen has agreed not to sue American Home Products or its affiliates
       under any of Amgen's patents or any patents that come under Amgen's
       control for infringement for developing, making, using, marketing,
       distributing, importing or selling ENBREL anywhere in the world outside
       of the United States and Canada; and

   .   Amgen granted to American Home Products an exclusive option to acquire,
       subject to the approval of a third party, an exclusive sublicense under
       a license agreement between Amgen and a third party. American Home
       Products may exercise this option at any time on or before December 31,
       2002. If exercised, in addition to all upfront payments, milestone
       payments, and royalties payable under the sublicense agreement, American
       Home Products will pay to Amgen reimbursement in an amount not to exceed
       a defined cap for amounts paid to the third party in 2002 to maintain
       the license agreement.

         UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

   The following unaudited pro forma condensed combining balance sheet as of
September 30, 2001 and the unaudited pro forma condensed combining statements
of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 and the nine months ended
September 30, 2001 have been prepared to illustrate the effect of the merger as
though the merger had occurred on September 30, 2001 in the pro forma balance
sheet and as of January 1, 2000 in the pro forma statements of operations. The
pro forma information is based upon the historical consolidated financial
statements of Amgen and the historical consolidated financial statements of
Immunex, giving effect to the merger under the purchase method of accounting
and the assumptions, estimates and adjustments described in the notes to the
unaudited pro forma condensed combining financial statements. The assumptions,
estimates and adjustments are preliminary and have been made solely for
purposes of developing such pro forma information. All interim financial data
used to develop the Amgen and Immunex unaudited pro forma condensed combining
balance sheet and statements of operations are unaudited, but in the opinion of
Amgen management and Immunex management, respectively, reflect all adjustments
necessary (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) for a fair
presentation thereof. However, results for interim periods may not be
indicative of results that may be achieved in a full fiscal year.

   The unaudited pro forma condensed combining financial statements are
presented for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of
the consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations that
would have been reported had the merger occurred on the dates indicated, nor do
they represent a forecast of the consolidated financial position at any future
date or the consolidated results of operations for any future period.
Furthermore, no effect has been given in the unaudited pro forma condensed
combining statements of operations for synergistic benefits that may be
realized through the combination of the two companies or costs that may be
incurred in integrating their operations. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combining financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
historical consolidated financial statements and management's discussion and
analysis of financial condition and results of operations of Amgen and Immunex
covering those periods incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

                        COMBINING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1--Basis of Presentation

   On December 16, 2001, Amgen signed a definitive agreement to acquire Immunex
in a transaction to be accounted for as a purchase under accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. The transaction is expected to qualify
as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code. Under the terms of the merger agreement, each share of Immunex
common stock outstanding at the closing of the merger, other than shares as to
which dissenters' rights have been validly exercised, will be converted into
0.44 of a share of Amgen common stock and $4.50 cash. In addition, at the
closing of the merger each option outstanding to purchase a share of Immunex
common stock will be assumed by Amgen, except for "converted options" described
below, and will thereafter constitute an option to acquire the number of shares
of Amgen common stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of Immunex
common stock subject to the option immediately prior to the merger by 0.52,
with an exercise price equal to the exercise price of the assumed Immunex
option divided by 0.52. Each of these options will be subject to the same terms
and conditions that were in effect for the related Immunex options, except that
each option that was outstanding on the date of the merger agreement, December
16, 2001, will fully vest and become immediately exercisable for shares of
Amgen common stock. Options granted subsequent to the date of the merger
agreement will retain their original vesting provisions. Each option
outstanding at the close with an exercise price greater than the higher of $40
or the closing price of a share of Immunex common stock on the last trading day
prior to the merger (the "converted options") will be cancelled and converted
into an option to purchase that number of shares of Amgen common stock equal to
40% of the number of shares subject to the related converted option at an
exercise price per share equal to the fair market value of a share of Amgen
common stock on the date which the converted option is granted (which shall be
as of the close of market on the date of the effective time of the merger) and
otherwise subject to the terms and conditions, including the vesting schedule,
that were applicable to the related converted option.

   As of December 31, 2001, there were approximately 545,300,000 shares of
Immunex common stock outstanding and approximately 50,800,000 Immunex shares
issuable upon exercise of outstanding options. Based upon these amounts and the
terms outlined above, Immunex shareholders will receive a total of
approximately 239,900,000 shares of Amgen common stock; holders of Immunex
options will receive options to purchase approximately 26,300,000 shares of
Amgen common stock, under which the right to purchase approximately 24,100,000
shares of Amgen common stock will be fully vested and immediately exercisable.
The exact number of shares to be issued and options assumed will depend upon
the number of related Immunex shares and options, respectively, outstanding at
the closing of the merger. In addition, Amgen will pay American Home Products a
payment specified in the agreement regarding governance and commercial matters,
at the closing of the merger, for the termination of certain Immunex product
rights in favor of American Home Products.

   The purchase price of the acquisition is approximately $17.6 billion
estimated as follows (in millions):

 Value of Amgen shares issued....................................... $14,041.9
 Cash consideration (including payment to American Home Products)...   2,478.9
 Value of Amgen options issued......................................   1,062.0
 Transaction costs..................................................      30.0
                                                                     ---------
 Total.............................................................. $17,612.8
                                                                     =========

   The value of the Amgen shares used in determining the purchase price was
$58.525 per share based on the average of the closing prices of Amgen common
stock for a range of four trading days, two days prior to and two days
subsequent to the announcement of the merger. The fair values of the options
issued were determined based on the closing price of Amgen common stock as of
December 31, 2001 using the Black-Scholes method assuming an expected weighted
average life of 2.4 years, weighted average risk-free rate of 3.2%, volatility
of 50%, and no expected dividends.

                    NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED

                  COMBINING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   The allocation of the purchase price as of September 30, 2001 is summarized
below (in millions):

     Current assets............................................. $ 1,171.6
     Property plant and equipment...............................     186.1
     In-process research and development........................   2,389.2
     Identifiable intangible assets (including developed
       technology and core technology of $4,778.2 and $1,598.3,
       respectively)............................................   6,570.7
     Goodwill...................................................   9,390.1
     Other assets...............................................     862.4
     Current liabilities........................................    (361.1)
     Deferred tax liability.....................................  (2,595.4)
     Other long-term liabilities................................      (0.8)
                                                                 ---------
     Net assets................................................. $17,612.8
                                                                 =========

   The allocation of the purchase price is preliminary. The final determination
of the purchase price allocation will be based on the fair values of assets
acquired, including the fair values of in-process research and development and
other identifiable intangibles, and the fair values of liabilities assumed as
of the date that the acquisition is consummated. The excess of the purchase
price over the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired is allocated to
goodwill. The purchase price allocation will remain preliminary until Amgen
completes a third party valuation of significant identifiable intangible assets
acquired (including in-process research and development), evaluates
restructuring plans to be undertaken following the consummation of the merger,
and determines the fair values of other assets and liabilities acquired. The
final determination of the purchase price allocation is expected to be
completed as soon as practicable after the consummation of the merger. The
final amounts allocated to assets and liabilities acquired could differ
significantly from the amounts presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed
combining financial statements.

   The amount allocated to in-process research and development represents an
estimate of the fair value of purchased in-process technology for research
projects that, as of the date of the expected closing date of the merger, will
not have reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use.
The values of these research projects will be determined based on analyses
using cash flows to be generated by the products that result from the
in-process projects. These cash flows will be estimated by forecasting total
revenues expected from these products and then deducting appropriate operating
expenses, cash flow adjustments and contributory asset returns to establish a
forecast of net cash flows arising from the in-process technology. These cash
flows will be substantially reduced to take into account the time value of
money and the risks associated with the inherent difficulties and uncertainties
given the projected stage of development of these projects at closing. For
purposes of the pro forma balance sheet as of September 30, 2001,
$2,389,200,000 of the total purchase price has been allocated to in-process
research and development--including the estimated value of projected new
indications of ENBREL ($985,100,000) and approximately 10 additional research
and development programs that are in various stages of development but are not
expected to have reached technological feasibility as of the closing date and
have no alternative future use. The amounts allocated to in-process research
and development will be charged to the statement of operations in the period
the acquisition is consummated.

   The total estimated amounts of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets
are approximately $9,390,100,000 and $6,570,700,000, respectively. The useful
life of identifiable intangible assets, primarily ENBREL, is approximately 15
years. The values of identifiable intangible assets will be determined using a
discounted cash flow model with appropriate discount rates. The amount of
identifiable intangible assets, the estimated useful lives and acquired
in-process research and development will be determined upon completion of a
third party valuation, and therefore, may differ significantly from the amounts
presented in these unaudited pro forma condensed combining financial
statements. To the extent the amounts and estimated useful lives are different
than those presented above, the unaudited pro forma condensed combining
financial statements could change significantly.

                  COMBINING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

   In connection with this transaction, Immunex intends to divest the product
LEUKINE, which had annual revenues for Immunex of $88,300,000 and $75,800,000
for the year ended December 31, 2000 and the nine-months ended September 30,
2001, respectively. Information regarding the results of operations and
financial position attributable to LEUKINE is not reviewable by Amgen due to
applicable antitrust laws, and therefore, has not been excluded from the pro
forma condensed combining financial statements presented.

Note 2--Pro Forma Adjustments

Pro Forma Condensed Combining Statements of Operations

1) Reflects amortization of identifiable intangible assets based on the
   estimated fair values assigned to these assets at the date of acquisition.

2) Reflects higher interest expense due to additional assumed borrowings of
   $2,478,900,000 at 2.5% to finance the cash portion of the merger
   consideration. Including cash and investments of Immunex, Amgen has adequate
   cash and marketable securities on hand to finance the cash portion of the
   merger consideration. However, it is reviewing all its financing options,
   including the issuance of debt. Therefore, solely for the purposes of
   presenting the pro forma condensed combining financial statements, it has
   assumed additional debt issuance to finance the cash portion of the merger
   consideration.

3) Reflects compensation expense payable to Immunex employees under the Immunex
   Corporation Retention Plan. Because these expenses will have a continuing
   impact over a two year period subsequent to the acquisition date, they are
   reflected in the pro forma condensed combining statements of operations.

4) Reflects the tax effect of the pro forma adjustments, including amortization
   of identifiable intangible assets. The Immunex historical pre-tax income and
   the pro forma adjustments have been tax effected at Amgen's marginal tax
   rate of 39.5%.

5) Pro forma basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the pro forma
   net income by the pro forma weighted average shares outstanding. Pro forma
   diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the pro forma net
   income by the pro forma weighted average shares outstanding and dilutive
   potential weighted shares outstanding. A reconciliation of the shares used
   to calculate Amgen's historical basic and diluted earnings per share to
   shares used to calculate the pro forma basic and diluted earnings per share

1) To record the estimated fair values of identifiable intangible assets and
   goodwill arising from the acquisition.

2) To reflect the estimated fair value of in-process research and development.
   Because this expense is directly attributable to the acquisition and will

                      DESCRIPTION OF AMGEN CAPITAL STOCK

   The following is a summary of the material terms of Amgen's capital stock.
Because it is only a summary, it does not contain all the information that may
be important to you. Accordingly, you should read carefully the more detailed
provisions of the restated certificate of incorporation of Amgen, as amended,
the amended and restated bylaws of Amgen and the Amended and Restated Rights
Agreement between Amgen and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, each of
which has been filed with the SEC, as well as applicable Delaware law. See
"Comparison of Stockholder Rights and Corporate Governance Matters."

       COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS

   Amgen is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware, while Immunex
is incorporated under the laws of the State of Washington. Before the
completion of the merger, the rights of holders of Immunex common stock are
governed by the Washington Business Corporation Act, or the WBCA, the restated
articles of incorporation of Immunex and the amended and restated bylaws of
Immunex. After the completion of the merger, Immunex shareholders will become
stockholders of Amgen, and their rights will be governed by the Delaware
General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, the restated certificate of incorporation
of Amgen, as amended, the amended and restated bylaws of Amgen and the Amended
and Restated Rights Agreement between Amgen and American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company.

   While there are substantial similarities between the WBCA and the DGCL as
well as between the charters and bylaws of Amgen and Immunex, a number of
differences do exist. The following is a summary of the material differences
between the rights of Amgen stockholders and the rights of Immunex
shareholders. While we believe that this summary covers the material
differences between the two, this summary may not contain all of the
information that is important to you. This summary is not intended to be a
complete discussion of the respective rights of Amgen and Immunex stockholders
and it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the DGCL, the WBCA, and the
various documents of Amgen and Immunex we refer to in this summary. You should
carefully read this entire joint proxy statement/prospectus and the other
documents we refer to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus for a more
complete understanding of the differences between being a stockholder of Amgen
and being a shareholder of Immunex. Amgen and Immunex have filed with the SEC
their respective documents referred to herein and will send copies of these
documents to you upon your request. See the section entitled "Where You Can
Find More Information."

                     Redemption of Rights.  Prior to the time a
                     person or group becomes the beneficial
                     owner of 10% or more of the outstanding
                     shares of Amgen common stock, the Amgen
                     board of directors may redeem the rights in
                     whole, but not in part, at a redemption price
                     of $0.00025 per right, subject to adjustment.

                     Amendment of Rights.  Amgen may amend
                     the rights agreement for so long as the rights
                     are then redeemable. After the rights are no
                     longer redeemable, Amgen may amend or
                     supplement the rights agreement only:

                     . to cure an ambiguity or correct a
                        defective or inconsistent provision;

                     . to shorten or lengthen any time period
                        under the rights agreement; or

                     . in any manner that does not adversely
                        affect the interests of the holders of the
                        rights.

                     Once the rights are no longer redeemable,
                     the Amgen board may not adopt any
                     amendment that would lengthen the time
                     period during which the rights are
                     redeemable. Until March 12, 2004, any
                     supplement or amendment to the rights
                     agreement requires approval of a majority of
                     the outside directors, and any extension of
                     the final expiration date requires approval of
                     three-quarters of the outside directors.

                     Final Expiration Date.  If not previously
                     exercised, the rights will expire on
                     December 12, 2010, unless Amgen earlier
                     redeems or exchanges the rights or extends
                     the final expiration date.
