                 PROPOSED MERGER -- YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

Dear Stockholders:

     On August 13, 2001, Devon Energy Corporation agreed to acquire Mitchell
Energy & Development Corp. by merging Mitchell into a wholly owned subsidiary of
Devon. In the merger, each Mitchell stockholder, other than those exercising
dissenters' rights, will receive $31.00 in cash and 0.585 of a share of Devon
common stock for each share of Mitchell common stock that the stockholder owns.
We expect that Mitchell stockholders will not recognize gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as a result of the merger, except to the extent of
the cash received in the merger.

     The merger agreement requires the approval of Mitchell stockholders. The
issuance of shares of Devon common stock in the merger requires the approval of
Devon stockholders. Devon and Mitchell have each scheduled special meetings of
their stockholders on           , 2001, to vote on these matters. Regardless of
the number of shares that you own or whether you plan to attend a meeting, it is
important that your shares be represented and voted. Voting instructions are
inside.

MERGER AGREEMENT AND DETERMINED THAT THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER ARE
ADVISABLE AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF MITCHELL AND ITS STOCKHOLDERS.

VOTE TO APPROVE THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

DIRECTORS WHO ATTENDED THE MEETING, APPROVED AND ADOPTED THE MERGER AGREEMENT

DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT DEVON STOCKHOLDERS VOTE TO APPROVE THE ISSUANCE OF
DEVON COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER.

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q:   Why am I receiving these materials?

A:   Devon and Mitchell have agreed to combine their businesses by merging
     Mitchell into a wholly owned subsidiary of Devon. The merger cannot be
     completed without the approval of the stockholders of both Devon and
     Mitchell.

Q:   What will happen to Mitchell as a result of the merger?

A:   Mitchell will merge with and into a Devon subsidiary, and the Devon
     subsidiary will be the surviving company of the merger and a wholly owned
     subsidiary of Devon.

Q:   What will Mitchell stockholders receive in the merger?

A:   Each Mitchell stockholder, other than those exercising dissenters' rights,
     will receive $31.00 in cash and 0.585 of a share of Devon common stock for
     each share of Mitchell common stock that the stockholder owns at the
     effective time of the merger. Instead of issuing fractional shares, Devon
     will pay cash, without interest, for any fractional shares based on the
     average closing price for a share of Devon common stock on the American
     Stock Exchange on the five trading days immediately prior to the last
     business day before the date of the merger.

Q:   Should Mitchell stockholders send in their stock certificates now?

A:   No. After the merger is completed, Mitchell stockholders will receive
     written instructions for exchanging their stock certificates. Please do not
     send in your Mitchell stock certificates with your proxy.

Q:   What stockholder approvals are needed?

A:   The following stockholder approvals are needed to complete the merger:

     - the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares
       of Mitchell common stock outstanding to approve the merger agreement; and

     - the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the votes
       cast in person or by proxy at the Devon meeting to approve the issuance
       of Devon common stock in the merger.

Q:   When do you expect the merger to be completed?

A:   We are working to complete the merger as soon as possible. A number of
     conditions must be satisfied before we can complete the merger, including
     approval of the stockholders of both Devon and Mitchell. Although we cannot
     predict when all of the conditions to the merger will be satisfied, we hope
     to complete the merger in the fourth quarter of 2001.

Q:   What do I need to do now?

A:   You should carefully read this document. Then, if you choose to vote by
     proxy, you should do so as soon as possible by completing, signing and
     mailing your proxy card. Devon stockholders can also vote by proxy by
     either (1) using the toll-free phone number listed on their proxy cards and
     following the recorded instructions or (2) going to the Internet website
     listed on their proxy cards and following the instructions provided.

Q:   If I am planning on attending a meeting in person, should I still grant my
     proxy?

A:   Yes. Whether or not you plan to attend a meeting, you should grant your
     proxy as described above. If you are a Mitchell stockholder, your shares
     will not be voted if you neither attend the Mitchell meeting and vote in
     person nor grant your proxy. This would have the same effect as a vote
     against approval of the merger agreement. Assuming a quorum is present, the
     failure of a Devon stockholder to vote in person or by proxy will not
     affect the outcome of the Devon vote.

                                        i

Q:   Can I change my vote after I have granted my proxy?

A:   Yes. You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the
     meeting by following the procedures set forth in this document under "The
     Special Meetings -- Voting Procedures -- Revocation."

Q:   If my shares are held in "street name" by my broker, will my broker vote my
     shares for me?

A:   No. Your broker will NOT vote your shares unless you tell the broker how to
     vote. To do so, you should follow the directions that your broker provides
     you.

Q:   Am I entitled to dissenters' rights of appraisal?

A:   Yes, but only if you are a Mitchell stockholder and you comply with the
     procedures described in this document under "The Merger -- Dissenters'
     Rights of Appraisal." Devon stockholders are not entitled to dissenters'
     rights of appraisal in connection with the merger.

Q:   Whom do I call if I have further questions about voting, the meetings or
     the merger?

A:   Mitchell stockholders may call Mitchell's Investor Relations at (713)
     377-6625.

     Devon stockholders may call Devon's Investor Relations at (405) 552-4570.

their current capacities with the combined company. The combined company may
select members of Mitchell's executive staff to augment its management team.

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

     The merger has been structured so that, in general, Mitchell stockholders
will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result
of the merger, except to the extent of the cash received for shares of Mitchell
common stock. As a condition to the merger, Mitchell and Devon must each receive
a satisfactory opinion from its own legal counsel regarding the U.S. federal
income tax treatment of the merger.

     Tax matters are very complicated. The tax consequences of the merger to you
will depend on your own situation. You should consult your tax advisor for a
full understanding of the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax
consequences of the merger to you.

OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS

 TO MITCHELL STOCKHOLDERS:

     Mitchell's board of directors has unanimously approved and adopted the
merger agreement and determined that the merger agreement and the merger are
advisable and in the best interests of Mitchell and its stockholders.
Accordingly, the board recommends that Mitchell stockholders vote to approve the

currently are held by Mitchell's directors, executive officers and their
respective affiliates, all of whom Mitchell expects will vote their shares for

Executive Officer of Mitchell, and his wife, Cynthia Woods Mitchell, have
granted Devon an irrevocable proxy to vote their shares for approval of the
merger agreement. Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell collectively beneficially own
approximately 47% of the outstanding shares of Mitchell common stock, including
shares covered by outstanding options.

 TO DEVON STOCKHOLDERS:

     Devon's board of directors has, by a unanimous vote of those directors who
attended the meeting, approved and adopted the merger agreement and determined
that the merger agreement and the merger are advisable and in the best interests
of Devon and its stockholders. Accordingly, the board recommends that Devon
stockholders vote to approve the issuance of Devon common stock in the merger.

     Less than 1% of Devon's outstanding voting shares currently are held by
Devon's directors, executive officers and their affiliates, all of whom Devon
expects will vote their shares for approval of the issuance of Devon common
stock in the merger.

consideration, the opinions of Mitchell's financial advisors, the tax
consequences of the merger and the other matters referred to under "The
Merger -- Recommendation of Mitchell's Board of Directors and Reasons for the
Merger."

DEVON'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     Devon's board of directors considered various factors in approving and
adopting the merger agreement, including expected per share accretion in various
financial measures on a pro forma basis, opportunities for increased production,
marketing and transportation opportunities, the addition of significant
midstream assets, expected benefits from improved technologies, increased size
and the other matters referred to under "The Merger -- Recommendation of Devon's
Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger."

INTERESTS OF MITCHELL'S EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE MERGER

     Some of Mitchell's executive officers and directors have interests in the
merger that are different from yours:

- - at the effective time of the merger, J. Todd Mitchell, who is currently a
  member of Mitchell's board of directors, or an alternate Mitchell designee,
  will be appointed to Devon's board of directors to serve until his successor
  is elected and qualified or until his earlier resignation or removal;

- - George P. Mitchell, who is currently the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
  of Mitchell, and his wife, Cynthia Woods Mitchell, have entered into an
  agreement with Devon that, subject to a number of conditions, will provide
  them with rights to require Devon to use its reasonable best efforts to
  register the resale of the shares of Devon common stock that they receive in
  the merger, and Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell will be subject to legal and contractual
  restrictions on the resale of the shares of Devon common stock that they
  receive in the merger not generally applicable to other Mitchell stockholders;

- - all outstanding stock options and bonus units, including those held by
  Mitchell's executive officers, will fully vest at the effective time of the
  merger and, if not exercised at that time, will be converted into fully vested
  options to purchase shares of Devon common stock and bonus units redeemable
  for cash based on the appreciation of Devon common stock, respectively, in
  each case subject to adjustment to reflect the value of the consideration paid
  by Devon in the merger;

- - after the merger, some Mitchell executive officers may remain executive
  officers of the surviving corporation of the merger or may become officers of
  Devon;

- - Mitchell executive officers will be entitled to severance payments and
  enhanced pension benefits in the event that their employment ceases after the
  merger;

- - benefits of Mitchell's executive officers under their individual severance
  agreements cannot be reduced for 24 months following the merger;

- - benefits under Mitchell's non-qualified retirement plans held by some of
  Mitchell's executive officers will automatically be distributed as a lump sum
  into the Mitchell Energy & Development Corp. 1998 Mutual Fund Option Plan upon
  their retirement; and

- - the merger agreement generally requires Devon to honor Mitchell's existing
  employee benefit plans and commitments in accordance with their terms after
  the merger.

     Mitchell's directors and executive officers beneficially owned
approximately 47% of the outstanding shares of Mitchell common stock as of
August 13, 2001, including shares covered by outstanding options. Devon's
directors and executive officers did not beneficially own any shares of Mitchell
common stock as of that date.

     The boards of directors of both companies were aware of these interests and
considered them in approving the merger and the merger agreement.

OPINIONS OF FINANCIAL ADVISORS

     The opinions of Mitchell's and Devon's financial advisors are attached as
Annexes D, E and F. We encourage you to read those opinions carefully, as well
as the descriptions of the analyses and assumptions on which the opinions were
based in the "The Merger -- Opinions of Financial Advisors" section of this
document. Each opinion is directed to the applicable company's board of
directors and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to any
matter relating to the merger.

 OPINIONS OF MITCHELL'S FINANCIAL ADVISORS

     Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Mitchell's financial
advisors, each delivered its opinion to Mitchell's board of directors to the
effect that, as of the date of its opinion and subject to the matters and
assumptions set forth in the opinion, the consideration to be received by the
holders of Mitchell common stock in the merger was fair from a financial point
of view to the holders.

 OPINION OF DEVON'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     UBS Warburg LLC, Devon's financial advisor, delivered its opinion to
Devon's board of directors to the effect that, as of the date of its opinion and
subject to the matters and assumptions set forth in the opinion, the
consideration to be paid by Devon in connection with the merger was fair from a
financial point of view to Devon.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The merger agreement is attached as Annex A. We encourage you to read the
merger agreement because it is the legal document that governs the merger.

 WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO COMPLETE THE MERGER

     Devon and Mitchell will complete the merger only if the conditions set
forth in the merger agreement are satisfied or, in some cases, waived. These
conditions are:

- - approval by Mitchell's stockholders of the merger agreement;

- - approval by Devon's stockholders of the issuance of Devon common stock in the
  merger;

- - the expiration of applicable antitrust waiting periods or the receipt of
  necessary antitrust approvals;

- - the absence of legal prohibitions to the merger;

- - the continued effectiveness of the registration statement of which this
  document is a part;

- - the approval for listing on the American Stock Exchange of the shares of Devon
  common stock to be issued in the merger;

- - the continued accuracy of each company's representations and warranties;

- - the performance by each company of its obligations under the merger agreement;
  and

- - the receipt of legal opinions from counsel for each company as to the
  treatment of the merger for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

     Either Devon or Mitchell may choose to complete the merger even though a
condition to that company's obligation has not been satisfied if the necessary
stockholder approvals have been obtained and the law allows the company to do
so.

 TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     Devon and Mitchell can agree to terminate the merger agreement at any time
without completing the merger, even after stockholder approval. In addition,
either company can terminate the merger agreement on its own without completing
the merger if:

- - the merger is not completed by March 13, 2002, other than due to a breach of
  the merger agreement by the terminating party;

- - the necessary approval of the stockholders of the other company is not
  obtained at their meeting and 20 days have passed since that meeting;

- - any legal prohibition to completing the merger has become final and
  non-appealable; or

- - the other company materially breaches the merger agreement and cannot or does
  not correct the breach within a 30-day cure period.

     Devon can terminate the merger agreement if Mitchell's board of directors:

- - withdraws, modifies or changes, in a manner adverse to Devon, its approval or
  recommendation of the merger; or

- - recommends approval of a proposed business transaction with a third party that
  conflicts with the merger.

     Mitchell can terminate the merger agreement if Devon's board of directors
withdraws, modifies or changes, in a manner adverse to Mitchell, its approval or
recommendation of the merger.

 TERMINATION FEES AND EXPENSES

     If the merger agreement is terminated under circumstances involving a
proposed business transaction between either Mitchell or Devon and a third party
that conflicts with the merger and certain other conditions are satisfied,
either Mitchell will be required to pay Devon (if Mitchell received the proposal
from the third party) or Devon will be required to pay Mitchell (if Devon
received the proposal from the third party) a $100 million termination fee and,
in addition, reimburse the other party for all expenses incurred by the other
party in connection with the merger agreement up to $10 million.

 NO SOLICITATION BY MITCHELL

     Mitchell has generally agreed not to initiate or continue any discussions
with another party regarding a business combination while the merger is pending
or to engage in any such discussions unless required by fiduciary obligations
under applicable law.

AGREEMENTS AMONG DEVON, GEORGE P. MITCHELL AND CYNTHIA WOODS MITCHELL

     George P. Mitchell and Cynthia Woods Mitchell entered into two agreements,
discussed in the following paragraphs, with Devon in connection with the merger.
They collectively beneficially own approximately 47% of the outstanding shares
of Mitchell common stock, including shares covered by outstanding options.
George P. Mitchell is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Mitchell.
Cynthia Woods Mitchell is his wife.

 PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT CONTAINING A VOTING AGREEMENT AND AN
 IRREVOCABLE PROXY

     The principal shareholders agreement was entered into as an inducement to
Devon to enter into the merger agreement and as a condition to Devon's
willingness to do so. In that agreement, Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell:

- - agreed for two years to vote all of the shares of Mitchell common stock
  beneficially owned by them in favor of the merger and, generally, against any
  proposal inconsistent with the merger, including a competing transaction; and

- - granted Devon an irrevocable proxy to vote their shares of Mitchell common
  stock in accordance with the agreement.

     The principal shareholders agreement cannot be terminated by Mr. and Mrs.
Mitchell unless the merger agreement is (1) terminated by Devon or (2)
terminated by Mitchell because any of the

conditions to its obligation to complete the merger is not and cannot be
satisfied, other than the condition that the merger agreement be approved by the
required vote of Mitchell stockholders. Together with the termination fees
provided for in the merger agreement, the principal shareholders agreement may
have the effect of discouraging a third party from proposing a competing
transaction, including one that might be more favorable than the merger to
Mitchell stockholders.

 INVESTOR RIGHTS AGREEMENT

     The investor rights agreement contains restrictions on Mr. and Mrs.
Mitchell's ability to sell or otherwise dispose of the Devon common stock that
they will receive in the merger. It also requires Devon to use reasonable best
efforts to register the resale of those shares at the request of Mr. and Mrs.
Mitchell, subject to some limitations.

COMPARATIVE RIGHTS OF MITCHELL AND DEVON STOCKHOLDERS

     Some of the rights of a Mitchell stockholder are different from the rights
of a Devon stockholder. One of the most important differences is that Devon has
a stockholder rights plan that may discourage unwelcome or hostile takeover
attempts. Mitchell has no such plan. Another difference is that Devon's board of
directors is divided into three classes, with only one class elected each year.
In contrast, Mitchell's entire board of directors stands for election every
year. See "Comparison of the Rights of Mitchell and Devon Stockholders" for more
information concerning the comparative rights of Mitchell and Devon
stockholders.

OTHER INFORMATION

 ANTITRUST CLEARANCE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE MERGER

     The merger is subject to antitrust laws. We are making the required filings
with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. We are not
permitted to complete the merger until the applicable waiting periods have
expired or otherwise terminated. We expect that the applicable waiting periods
will expire on or about           , 2001. Although we do not expect the federal
or any state government to attempt to stop the merger, we cannot assure you that
they will not try to do so.

 DEVON'S FINANCING OF THE MERGER

     Devon currently intends to finance the cash portion of the merger
consideration with funds that Devon expects to obtain from traditional financing
sources. Devon's obligation to complete the merger is not subject to any
financing contingency.

 LISTING OF DEVON COMMON STOCK TO BE ISSUED IN THE MERGER

     Devon expects to obtain approval to list on the American Stock Exchange the
additional shares of Devon common stock to be issued in the merger.

 DISSENTERS' RIGHTS OF APPRAISAL

     Mitchell stockholders are entitled to exercise dissenters' rights of
appraisal in connection with the merger in accordance with Texas law. Devon
stockholders are not entitled to dissenters' rights of appraisal in connection
with the merger. See "The Merger -- Dissenters' Rights of Appraisal" for more
information regarding the dissenters' rights of Mitchell stockholders.

 ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     Devon will account for the merger using the purchase method of accounting.
Under that method of accounting, the aggregate consideration that Devon pays to
Mitchell stockholders will be allocated to Mitchell's assets and liabilities
based on their fair values, with any excess being treated as goodwill.

(1) In 2000, Mitchell changed its fiscal year end from January 31 to December
    31. Operating results related to the calendar years ended December 31, 1997,
    1998 and 1999 were recast from the previously reported results ending on
    January 31. To make this transition, it was necessary to have an
    eleven-month transition reporting period ended December 31, 1996.

SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA

     The following describes the pro forma effect of the merger on (1) the
statements of operations data of Devon and Mitchell for the year ended December
31, 2000 and the six months ended June 30, 2001 and (2) the balance sheet data
of Devon and Mitchell as of June 30, 2001.

     This information is only a summary. You should read the unaudited pro forma
combined financial information and the accompanying notes that are included in
this document. You should also read the historical information and related notes
of Devon and Mitchell that are incorporated by reference into this document.

     We are providing the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial and
other information for informational purposes only. It does not purport to
represent what the financial position and results of operations of the combined
company would actually have been had the merger and other pro forma adjustments
in fact occurred at the dates indicated. It also does not purport to represent
the future results that the combined company will achieve after the merger.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet data and the
unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of operations data show the
estimated effects of the merger as if it had occurred on June 30, 2001 and
January 1, 2000, respectively.

     We prepared the pro forma information based on the following:

- - Devon uses the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas activities,
  while Mitchell uses the successful efforts method. Pro forma adjustments have
  been made to estimate the effect of converting Mitchell's successful efforts
  method to Devon's full cost method.

- - Devon will account for the merger using the purchase method of accounting.

- - In the six-month period ended June 30, 2001, Devon recognized a $49.5 million
  after-tax gain from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
  This related to Devon's adoption, as of January 1, 2001, of a new accounting
  principle related to accounting for derivative financial instruments. The
  $49.5 million gain is not included in the summary unaudited pro forma combined
  statements of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2001.

- - We have not reflected as an adjustment to the historical data annual cost
  savings of approximately $20 million that Devon expects to result from the
  elimination of duplicate expenses after the merger.

     No pro forma adjustments have been made with respect to the following
unusual items. These items are reflected in the historical results of Devon or
Mitchell, as applicable, and should be considered when making period-to-period
comparisons:

- - In 2000, Devon recognized $60.4 million of expenses related to its merger with
  Santa Fe Snyder Corporation. Devon accounted for the Santa Fe Snyder merger
  using the pooling-of-interests method of accounting and, therefore, the
  expenses incurred related to the merger were expensed. The after-tax effect of
  these expenses in 2000 was $37.2 million.

- - In 2000, Mitchell realized income tax savings of $12.8 million related to
  prior years' Section 29 tax credits and $6.3 million related to the reversal
  of prior years' deferred income taxes.

- - In 2000, Mitchell recognized a $4.9 million gain from the exchange of certain
  gas services assets. Also in 2000, Mitchell recognized a $10.8 million
  impairment expense related to other gas services assets. Net of tax, these two
  events reduced Mitchell's 2000 net earnings by $3.8 million.

- - During the second quarter of 2001, Devon elected to discontinue operations in
  Malaysia, Qatar and on certain properties in Brazil. Accordingly, during the
  second quarter of 2001, Devon recorded a $76.9 million charge associated with
  the impairment of those properties. The after-tax effect of this reduction was
  $62.1 million.

- - Mitchell has incentive compensation plans pursuant to which it has
  periodically issued awards referred to as "bonus units" under which employees
  can earn compensation based on increases in the market price of Mitchell
  common stock. Mitchell generally awards these bonus units in lieu of stock
  option grants. Pro forma general and administrative expenses re-

  ported in the accompanying unaudited pro forma statements of operations for
  the year 2000 include $21.3 million of expense related to these plans, while
  pro forma general and administrative expenses for the first six months of 2001
  include a credit in the amount of $4.1 million related to these plans. After
  taxes, these plans had the effect of decreasing 2000 unaudited pro forma net
  earnings by $13.8 million and increasing net earnings for the first half of
  2001 by $2.7 million. Devon will not issue bonus units after the merger.

- - Devon's historical results of operations for the year 2000 and the first half
  of 2001 include $41.3 million and $16.9 million, respectively, of amortization
  expense for goodwill related to previous mergers. As of January 1, 2002, in
  accordance with new accounting pronouncements recently issued, this goodwill
  will cease to be amortized and, instead, will be tested for impairment at
  least annually. No goodwill amortization expense has been recognized in the
  pro forma statements of operations for the goodwill related to the merger.

                                                                      COMBINED COMPANY PRO FORMA

(1) Modified EBITDA represents earnings before interest (including the deferred
    effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rate on a subsidiary's
    long-term debt), taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, reduction
    of carrying value of oil and gas properties and change in fair value of
    derivative instruments.

(2) Cash margin represents total revenue less cash expenses. Cash expenses are
    all expenses other than the non-cash expenses of depreciation, depletion and
    amortization, deferred effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rate
    on a subsidiary's long-term debt, reduction of carrying value of oil and gas
    properties, deferred income tax expense and change in fair value of
    derivative instruments. We use cash margin to measure the net cash that is
    generated by our operations during a given period, without regard to the
    period in which the cash is actually physically received or spent by us.
    Cash margin ignores the non-operational effect on our "net cash provided by
    operating activities," as measured by accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America, from our activities as an operator
    of oil and gas wells and gas services facilities. Those activities produce
    net increases or decreases in temporary cash funds held by us that have no
    effect on our net earnings.

(3) Modified EBITDA is presented because it is a commonly used measurement in
    the oil and gas industry as a financial indicator of a company's ability to
    service or incur debt. Cash margin is presented because it is a commonly
    used measurement in the oil and gas industry as a financial indicator of a
    company's ability to fund capital expenditures or service debt. Modified
    EBITDA and

    cash margin are also presented because investors routinely request this
    information. Devon's and Mitchell's managements use modified EBITDA and cash
    margin as supplemental financial measurements in the evaluation of their
    businesses and interpret the trends of modified EBITDA and cash margin in a
    similar manner as trends in net earnings.

    Neither modified EBITDA nor cash margin is a measurement of financial
    performance under generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly,
    neither should be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by
    operating activities, as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to net
    income as indicators of operating performance or any other measure of
    performance derived in accordance with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America. There may be operational or
    financial demands and requirements that reduce management's discretion over
    the use of modified EBITDA and cash margin. Modified EBITDA and cash margin
    may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     You should consider carefully the following risk factors before deciding
how to vote. Additional risks associated with Devon's and Mitchell's businesses
are described in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings that are
incorporated by reference into this document. See "Additional Information --
Where You Can Find More Information."

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO INTEGRATE THE OPERATIONS OF DEVON AND MITCHELL
SUCCESSFULLY

     The merger will present challenges to management, including the integration
of the operations, technologies and personnel of Devon and Mitchell. For
example, the addition of Mitchell will substantially increase the midstream
(i.e., gas processing and similar activities) business of Devon. The merger will
also include other risks commonly associated with transactions of this type,
including unanticipated liabilities, unanticipated costs and diversion of
management's attention. Any difficulties that we encounter in the transition and
integration processes could have an adverse effect on the revenue, level of
expenses and operating results of the combined company. The combined company may
also experience operational interruptions or the loss of key employees,
customers or suppliers. As a result, we may not realize any of the anticipated
benefits of the merger.

THE VALUE OF CONSIDERATION TO MITCHELL STOCKHOLDERS IN THE MERGER WILL DECREASE
IF THE MARKET VALUE OF DEVON COMMON STOCK DECREASES

     Mitchell stockholders will not receive consideration in the merger with a
set market value or a minimum market value. The number of shares of Devon common
stock that Mitchell stockholders will receive in the merger is fixed. The value
of these shares will depend on the trading price of Devon common stock. No
adjustment will be made to the number of shares of Devon common stock to be
received by Mitchell stockholders regardless of whether the market price of
Devon common stock or Mitchell common stock increases or decreases. For
historical and current market prices of Devon common stock and Mitchell common
stock, see "Market Prices and Dividend Information."

WE EXPECT TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER

     We expect to incur approximately $90 million of costs related to the
merger. These costs will include investment banking expenses, severance, legal
and accounting fees, printing expenses and other related charges incurred by
both Devon and Mitchell. We may also incur additional unanticipated costs and
expenses in connection with the merger. In addition, Devon expects to incur
approximately $15 million of expenses in connection with its intended financing
of the cash portion of the merger consideration.

MITCHELL'S SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN THE BARNETT SHALE IN NORTH TEXAS MAY NOT
GENERATE THE BENEFITS EXPECTED BY DEVON

     Devon believes that a significant portion of Mitchell's value and future
potential is tied to its assets in the Barnett Shale in North Texas. To the
extent that these assets do not generate the return expected of them, the
benefits of the merger to Devon will be reduced. For more information on
Mitchell's investment and operations in the Barnett Shale, see "Properties of
the Combined Company -- Mitchell's Properties -- Exploration and Production
Operations."

THE COMBINED COMPANY MAY NOT REALIZE THE ACCRETION TO VARIOUS FINANCIAL
MEASUREMENTS THAT DEVON EXPECTS TO RESULT FROM THE MERGER

     Devon expects the merger to be accretive to its reserves per share,
production per share, cash margin (i.e., revenue less cash expenses) per share
and earnings per share on a pro forma basis to varying degrees.

However, these expectations are based on various assumptions about future events
and conditions that may or may not be realized. These assumptions relate to,
among other things:

     - energy market conditions;

     - commodity prices for natural gas, oil and NGLs;

     - maintenance and growth of production levels;

     - anticipated reserve levels;

     - future operating results;

     - competitive conditions;

     - the effectiveness of technologies;

     - the availability of capital resources;

     - laws and regulations affecting the energy business;

     - capital expenditure obligations; and

     - general economic conditions.

     There can be no assurance that the underlying assumptions will prove to
have been correct or that the merger will actually be accretive to Devon's
reserves per share, production per share, cash margin per share or earnings per
share for any future periods. It is possible that the merger may, in fact, prove
to be dilutive to Devon's actual per share results in the future.

THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT ASSETS LOCATED IN NORTH TEXAS, WHICH
COULD HEIGHTEN ITS EXPOSURE TO REGULATORY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES

     Most of Mitchell's assets are located near large population centers in
North Texas. This means that the combined company will be particularly sensitive
to regulatory or environmental issues relating to these large population centers
that could adversely affect the combined company's operating results.

THE COMBINED COMPANY'S DEBT LEVEL MAY LIMIT ITS FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY

     As of June 30, 2001, Devon had approximately $2.1 billion of total debt and
a total debt to total capital ratio of 27% as calculated under the provisions of
Devon's revolving credit facilities. After giving effect to the acquisition of
Mitchell, including Devon's intended financing of the cash portion of the merger
consideration, as of June 30, 2001, the combined company would have had
approximately $3.8 billion of total debt and a total debt to total capital ratio
of 37%. The combined company may also incur additional debt in the future,
including in connection with other acquisitions. The level of the combined
company's debt could have several important effects on the combined company's
future operations, including, among others:

     - a significant portion of the combined company's cash flow from operations
       will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on the debt
       and will not be available for other purposes;

     - covenants contained in Devon's existing debt arrangements and anticipated
       covenants related to the debt that Devon intends to issue to finance the
       cash portion of the merger consideration will require the combined
       company to meet financial tests that may affect the combined company's
       flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in its business,
       including possible acquisition opportunities;

     - the combined company's ability to obtain additional financing for working
       capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate and other
       purposes may be limited;

     - the combined company may be at a competitive disadvantage to similar
       companies that have less debt; and

     - the combined company's vulnerability to adverse economic and industry
       conditions may increase.

DEVON'S OFFSHORE OPERATIONS ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF TROPICAL WEATHER
DISTURBANCES

     Some of Devon's production and reserves are located offshore in the Gulf of
Mexico. Operations in this area are subject to tropical weather disturbances.
Some of these disturbances can be severe enough to cause substantial damage to
facilities and possibly interrupt production. In accordance with customary
industry practices, Devon maintains insurance against some, but not all, of
these risks. Losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts
in excess of existing insurance coverage. We cannot assure you that Devon will
be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates that it considers
to be reasonable or that any particular types of coverage will be available. An
event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse
effect on the combined company's financial position and results of operations.

DEVON IS SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTIES OF FOREIGN OPERATIONS

     Devon has significant international operations in Azerbaijan, South
America, Southeast Asia and West Africa. Local political, economic and other
uncertainties may adversely affect these operations. These uncertainties
include:

     - the risk of war, general strikes, civil unrest, expropriation, forced
       renegotiation or modification of existing contracts, and import, export
       and transportation regulations and tariffs;

     - taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive
       tax claims;

     - exchange controls, currency fluctuations, devaluation or other activities
       that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments or the movement of
       funds, and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government
       sovereignty over international operations;

     - laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, taxation
       and investment;

     - the possibility of being subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign
       courts in connection with legal disputes and the possible inability to
       subject foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts in the United
       States; and

     - difficulties in enforcing Devon's rights against a governmental agency
       because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity.

DEVON IS SUBJECT TO FEDERAL ACREAGE LIMITATIONS AND, AS A RESULT, MAY BE
REQUIRED TO REDUCE ITS ACREAGE IN WYOMING

     Current United States law restricts the amount of federal acreage that can
be controlled by individual parties within each state. This controlled acreage
is considered "chargeable" to individual parties. The current federal limit
within Wyoming is 246,080 chargeable acres. Controlled leasehold acreage that is
part of a federally authorized drilling or production unit is, however, not
considered chargeable acreage for the purposes of this limitation. Devon is
above the current federal limit on chargeable acres within Wyoming. Under
current law, Devon will be required to reduce its chargeable acreage. Devon has
petitioned the Bureau of Land Management for additional time to restructure its
leasehold acreage. The Bureau of Land Management has granted Devon an additional
year and has also assured Devon of its willingness to work together on any
additional delays. Currently there are only two ways available to reduce Devon's
chargeable acreage. One way is to sell or divest a portion of the acreage. The
other way is to apply to the Bureau of Land Management to "unitize" a portion of
the acreage. If approved, the acreage included in these federally authorized
drilling or production units would not be counted as chargeable acreage. If we
have to sell or divest to reduce our chargeable acreage in Wyoming, we will have
less acreage in Wyoming on which to drill, which could have a negative impact on
future production, cash flow and earnings.

DEVON MAY INCUR A TAX LIABILITY AS A RESULT OF ITS 1999 MERGER WITH PENNZENERGY

     On August 17, 1999, Devon completed a merger with PennzEnergy Company. If
PennzEnergy's distribution to its stockholders of the stock of Pennzoil-Quaker
State Company in December 1998 were to be considered part of a plan or series of
related transactions that includes the merger of Devon with PennzEnergy, Devon
would recognize gain under section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code. Devon
believes the distribution and the merger with PennzEnergy should not be
considered part of such a plan or series of related transactions because, among
other things, prior to the distribution neither party contemplated a business
combination with the other and, until April 1999, the parties had no discussions
regarding a business combination. However, any transaction within a four-year
period beginning two years before the distribution is presumed to be a part of
such a plan. We cannot assure you that Devon will be able to overcome this
presumption. Devon currently estimates its potential tax liability upon such
transaction at $16 million in additional tax for 1998 and the elimination of
approximately $183 million in net operating loss carryovers.

REPORTED NATURAL GAS, OIL AND PLANT NGL RESERVE DATA AND FUTURE NET REVENUE
ESTIMATES ARE UNCERTAIN

     Estimates of reserves are projections based on engineering data, projected
future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures. Mitchell's
estimates of its proved natural gas, oil and plant NGL reserves and projected
future net revenue are based on reserve reports that Mitchell prepares. Devon's
estimates of its proved natural gas, oil and plant NGL reserves and projected
future net revenue are based on reserve reports that Devon prepares and on the
reports of independent consulting petroleum engineers that Devon hires for that
purpose. The process of estimating natural gas, oil and plant NGL reserves
requires substantial judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations,
particularly for new discoveries. Different reserve engineers may make different
estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data.
Future performance that deviates significantly from the reserve reports could
have a material adverse effect on the combined company's financial position and
results of operations.

PRODUCT PRICES ARE VOLATILE, AND LOW PRICES CAN ADVERSELY IMPACT RESULTS

     The results of operations of both Devon and Mitchell are highly dependent
on the prices of and demand for natural gas, oil and NGLs. Historically, the
markets for natural gas, oil and NGLs have been volatile and are likely to
continue to be volatile in the future. Accordingly, the prices received by Devon
and Mitchell for their natural gas, oil and NGL production depend on numerous
factors beyond their control. These factors include, among other things:

     - the level of ultimate consumer product demand;

     - governmental regulations and taxes;

     - the price and availability of alternative fuels;

     - the level of imports and exports of natural gas, oil and NGLs; and

     - the overall economic environment.

Any significant decline in prices for natural gas, oil and NGLs, as has occurred
from time to time in the past, could have a material adverse effect on the
combined company's financial condition, results of operations and quantities of
reserves recoverable on an economic basis. Should the oil and gas industry
experience significant price declines or other adverse market conditions, the
combined company may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from
operations to meet its obligations and to make planned capital expenditures.

DEVON HAS CHARTER AND OTHER PROVISIONS THAT MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO CAUSE A
CHANGE OF CONTROL

     Some provisions of Devon's charter and bylaws and of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, as well as Devon's stockholder rights plan, may make it
difficult for stockholders to cause a change of control of Devon and replace
incumbent management. These provisions include:

     - a classified board, the members of which serve staggered three-year terms
       and may be removed by stockholders only for cause;

     - a prohibition on stockholders calling special meetings or acting by
       written consent; and

     - rights issued under Devon's rights plan that would be triggered if a
       person acquired 15% or more of Devon's common stock.

                                 THE COMPANIES

MITCHELL ENERGY & DEVELOPMENT CORP.

     Mitchell is one of the largest producers of natural gas and NGLs in the
United States. Mitchell's two primary businesses are: (1) the exploration,
development and production of natural gas and NGLs and (2) the gathering,
processing and marketing of natural gas and NGLs. In 2000, Mitchell produced 101
Bcf of natural gas and 6.5 MMBbls of liquid hydrocarbons (NGLs, oil and
condensate). Additionally, Mitchell sold 13.7 MMBbls of NGLs through its
midstream operations. (The volumes in this paragraph are calculated on a "dry"
gas basis which Devon uses to report is production.)

     Exploration, Development and Production.  As of December 31, 2000, Mitchell
had interests in approximately 3,400 gross wells and approximately 1.1 million
gross acres. Mitchell operates over 90% of its net wells and its proved reserve
base reached almost 2.1 Tcfe as of June 30, 2001 determined on a "wet" gas
basis. (On a "dry" gas basis, Devon estimates that Mitchell's June 30, 2001
proved reserves would have been 2.5 Tcfe.) Ninety-five percent of these reserves
are natural gas, with an average reserve life of over 14 years.

     Mitchell produced 101 Bcf of natural gas in 2000, a 25% increase from the
prior year, and is on pace to exceed the 25% growth target that it previously
set for 2001. With its large backlog of undrilled well locations, Mitchell
expects its gas production to increase at a compounded rate of more than 20%
over the three-year period ending December 31, 2003.

     Gas Services.  Mitchell owns and operates all of its major midstream
assets, including six natural gas processing plants and approximately 9,100
miles of natural gas gathering pipelines, virtually all of which are located in
Texas. Natural gas processing plants extract NGLs such as ethane, propane and
butanes from streams of natural gas. Mitchell increased NGL production by 13% in
2000 to 18.2 MMBbls and, at year-end, its proved plant NGL reserves (NGL
reserves committed to Mitchell-owned natural gas processing plants) totaled 175
MMBbls.

     Mitchell's pipelines intersect with both interstate and intrastate
pipelines enhancing its natural gas marketing flexibility. In North Texas,
Mitchell benefits from the integration of its pipeline operations with its
natural gas production and processing operations. Mitchell also owns interests
in two significant downstream assets located in the Texas Gulf Coast area.
Specifically, the company has a one-third interest in an MTBE gasoline additive
plant and a 38.75% interest in an NGL fractionator.

DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION

     Devon is an independent energy company engaged primarily in oil and natural
gas exploration, development and production and in the acquisition of producing
properties. Devon currently ranks among the five largest U.S.-based independent
oil and natural gas companies in terms of oil and natural gas reserves, oil and
natural gas production, equity market capitalization and enterprise value. As of
December 31, 2000, the company owned proved oil and natural gas reserves of 1.1
billion Boe. Approximately 53% of these reserves were natural gas and 47% were
oil and NGLs. North American proved reserves accounted for 75% of the company's
total reserves and were weighted 62% to natural gas. Devon's North American
reserves are concentrated in four operating divisions:

     - the Gulf Division, which includes oil and natural gas properties located
       primarily onshore in South Texas and South Louisiana and offshore in the
       Gulf of Mexico;

     - the Rocky Mountain Division, which includes oil and natural gas
       properties located in the Rocky Mountains area of the United States
       ranging from the Canadian border south into northern New Mexico;

     - the Permian/Mid-Continent Division, which includes oil and natural gas
       properties located in the United States other than those included in the
       Gulf Division and Rocky Mountain Division; and

     - the Canadian Division, which includes properties in the Western Canadian
       Sedimentary Basin in Alberta and British Columbia.

     Devon's proved reserves outside of North America totaled approximately 278
MMBoe as of December 31, 2000. The company's international activities are
concentrated in four core areas:

     - Azerbaijan;

     - South America, which includes Argentina and Brazil;

     - Southeast Asia, which includes Indonesia and China; and

     - West Africa and Egypt.

     In addition to proved oil and natural gas properties, Devon has an
inventory of exploration acreage of approximately 17.6 million net acres as of
December 31, 2000. This includes 5.4 million net acres in North America.

     Based upon the distribution of proved reserves, over 80% of the combined
company's oil and gas operations will be within North America. The remainder is
in several other regions. Devon has organized its operations geographically into
five separate divisions. Each division controls an underlying base of producing
oil and gas wells and an inventory of undeveloped lands on which to explore for
new oil and gas reserves. Mitchell's operations are located entirely in the
United States and primarily within the state of Texas.

  DEVON'S PROPERTIES

  ROCKY MOUNTAIN DIVISION

     The Rocky Mountain Division extends north from New Mexico and includes the
states of Colorado, Utah and Wyoming. Over a dozen oil and gas producing basins
are located in the Rocky Mountains. As of December 31, 2000, this area comprised
24% of Devon's proved oil and gas reserves.

     Devon's Rocky Mountain assets include interests in conventional oil and gas
properties as well as three significant coalbed methane projects. The most
significant conventional properties in the division lie in the gas-prone
Washakie, Wind River, Big Horn and Green River basins in Wyoming. Significant
coalbed methane properties are located in the San Juan Basin in northwest New
Mexico and southern Colorado, the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and the Raton
Basin of northeast New Mexico.

     Devon was a pioneer in the production of natural gas from underground coal
deposits, or coalbed methane. In the mid-1980s, Devon advanced one of the first
and most successful coalbed methane projects in the world -- the Northeast
Blanco Unit in the San Juan Basin. More than 15 years after its initial
development this property is still producing significant quantities of natural
gas.

     Using the expertise gained in the San Juan Basin, Devon has established
significant positions in two additional coalbed methane plays in the Rocky
Mountains. In the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, Devon has drilled over 700
coalbed methane wells since 1998. It plans to drill more than 1,000 additional
wells in the Powder River Basin over the next few years. Additionally, Devon
controls a majority interest in a 126-mile gas gathering system servicing the
Powder River Basin that commenced operations in the third quarter of 1999. The
system has access to multiple interstate pipelines, and when fully developed,
will have an estimated capacity of 450 MMcf of gas per day. Devon is also
aggressively developing coalbed methane production in the Raton Basin of
northeast New Mexico and southeast Colorado. With an interest in approximately
280,000 prospective acres, Devon has one of the largest land positions in the
play and expects to drill about 100 Raton Basin wells in each of the next few
years.

  PERMIAN BASIN/MID-CONTINENT DIVISION

     Permian Basin.  The Permian Basin encompasses approximately 66,000 square
miles in southeastern New Mexico and west Texas and contains more than 500 major
oil and gas fields. The area is characterized by prolific, long-lived oil and
gas production from numerous formations found at a wide variety of depths. The
Permian Basin represented 18% of Devon's proved reserves at December 31, 2000.

     In the first half of 2001, Devon acquired an additional 140,000 net acres
in the Permian Basin. The acquired acreage included 90,000 net acres in Lea and
Eddy counties in New Mexico. This increased Devon's holdings in these counties
to 330,000 net acres and provides an estimated 400 additional potential drilling
locations. Devon is now one of the largest exploration and production companies
in the area.

     Mid-Continent.  The mid-continent area includes all or portions of the
states of Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.
The mid-continent covers a wide spectrum of geologic formations producing both
oil and natural gas. Advanced technologies such as 3-D seismic enable Devon to
study complex geologic environments and identify new exploratory prospects on
its extensive undeveloped acreage base. Application of nuclear magnetic
resonance logging and advanced fracture stimulation technology have enabled
exploitation of previously bypassed gas reserves in the Carthage-Bethany and
Sligo fields of east Texas and north Louisiana. At December 31, 2000, the
mid-continent area represented about 10% of Devon's proved reserves.

     In the first half of 2001, Devon established a significant acreage position
in a coalbed methane project in the mid-continent. It acquired an average
working interest of almost 100% in over 370,000 acres in the Cherokee and Arkoma
Basins of southeast Kansas and northeast Oklahoma. Devon expects to drill up to
400 wells per year with a target of 2,500 wells over the life of the play.

  GULF DIVISION

     Offshore.  At December 31, 2000, 9% of Devon's proved reserves were
attributable to the offshore Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf of Mexico is comprised of
two major operating areas, as defined by water depth. In the shallow "shelf"
area, in water depths up to 600 feet, Devon is among the largest oil and gas
producers. The shelf is a relatively mature producing region that is a vital
source of U.S. natural gas supply. Devon holds approximately 650,000 net acres
on the shelf, about one-half of which are developed.

     The deepwater Gulf is a promising frontier area. The deepwater is believed
to hold some of the largest remaining undiscovered reserves in North America.
Devon holds 400,000 net acres in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico of which about 90%
are unexplored. Because deepwater exploration is capital intensive, the
company's strategy is to move cautiously. Devon generally avoids ultra-deep
water and focuses drilling efforts on prospects at water depths for which
production technology is well-established. The company also shares projects with
industry partners to further mitigate risk.

     Onshore.  Devon's Gulf Division includes operations onshore in south Texas
and south Louisiana. This area accounted for 2% of proved reserves at year-end
2000. This area has a well-established infrastructure of pipelines and
production facilities. In south Texas, where exploration for oil and gas is
accelerating, Devon has 3-D seismic data covering its major acreage positions.
Much of this acreage is prospective for production from the Charco Lobo, Middle
Wilcox and Frio-Vicksburg formations. The company's exploration efforts in south
Louisiana are focused on natural gas prospects in the lower, mid and upper
Miocene age formations.

  CANADIAN DIVISION

     Devon's Canadian operations are conducted through Northstar Energy, its
subsidiary headquartered in Calgary, Alberta. Canada accounted for 12% of
Devon's proved reserves at year-end 2000. On a stand-alone basis, Devon's
Canadian operations would rank 12th among independent producers in Canada.

     Over one-third of Devon's Canadian oil and gas reserves are located in the
shallow gas areas of northern Alberta. Wells here range between 1,000 and 2,500
feet in depth and can be drilled quickly and inexpensively. Devon has become
quite efficient at drilling shallow gas wells in Alberta, and over the past
three years has cut its average drilling costs in half.

     Devon also has an extensive acreage position in the northern foothills of
British Columbia and Alberta. This is a high-potential exploration area with
prospect sizes ranging from 50 Bcf to more than 100 Bcf of gas reserves. Devon
has drilled 12 wells here since 1998, with several notable successes. A major
pipeline company is now constructing transportation and processing facilities
into the area. Devon expects to commence production from the northern foothills
area in mid-2002.

  INTERNATIONAL DIVISION

     Approximately 25% of Devon's proved oil and gas reserves at December 31,
2000 were in countries outside North America. As one of the five largest
U.S.-based independents, Devon has the technical capabilities and financial
strength necessary to support an international exploration and production
effort. The company's international focus is on selected oil and gas provinces
outside North America that can provide reserve growth opportunities, access to
markets and favorable fiscal regimes. Devon's international operations are
concentrated in Azerbaijan, Southeast Asia, South America and Egypt. Devon also
operates a minor amount of production offshore Gabon and is conducting an
exploration program offshore Congo and Gabon in West Africa.

  MITCHELL'S PROPERTIES

     Mitchell's operations are located almost entirely within the state of
Texas. The operations include exploration and production activities in North
Texas, East Texas and the Texas Gulf Coast as well as significant gas
transportation, processing and marketing operations.

  EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS

     In North Texas, Mitchell has held acreage in the Fort Worth Basin since the
1950s and originally focused most of its drilling activities on the shallow
conventional reservoirs above the Barnett Shale. Beginning in the early 1980s
Mitchell directed its efforts towards unlocking the gas producing potential of
the dense Barnett Shale. By the early 1990s, Mitchell was completing wells in
the Barnett Shale using traditional heavy gel fracturing techniques. In 1998,
Mitchell implemented the use of a new fracture completion technology in the
Barnett Shale referred to as light sand fracturing, or LSF. LSF injects large
volumes of water into the formation to create fissures within the rock that are
propped open with a small amount of sand. This contrasts with gel fracturing
where a smaller amount of water and a heavy gel are used to create fissures that
are propped open with large amounts of sand. LSF not only materially reduced
total well costs, but also allowed the completion of another section of the
formation that was not economical to develop with the more expensive gel frac.
The results were higher per well production rates and reserves.

     Mitchell estimates that it is recovering only about 8% of the Barnett Shale
gas reserves in place on the current 55-acre well spacing. To increase the rate
of recovery, Mitchell is conducting pilot projects to evaluate the effectiveness
of 27-acre spacing. Depending on the results of these pilot projects, the
potential number of drillable locations on existing acreage could essentially be
doubled.

     Mitchell has also used LSF to rework and refrac more than 130 existing
Barnett Shale wells that were originally completed with a conventional gel frac.
This has resulted in an average eight-fold increase in individual well
production rates with some wells actually producing at rates higher than when
they were originally completed. Mitchell plans to rework and refrac over 200
additional existing wells that were originally completed with gel fracturing.

     In addition, Mitchell expects to refrac LSF wells one or more times over
their lives. Although none have been refraced to date because sufficient time
has not elapsed from the original drilling date, refracs of LSF wells are
expected to perform similarly to a refrac and rework of a conventional gel frac
well. Mitchell believes that 27-acre well spacing, multiple refrac and reworks
or some combination of the two will meaningfully raise recovery rates above the
current 8% level.

     More recently, Mitchell successfully transferred this LSF technology to the
North Personville field in East Texas where it has been developing the Cotton
Valley Limestone formation over the past 20 years. The combination of LSF and a
reduction in well spacing from 160 acres to 80 acres is expected to
significantly increase reserves produced from the formation.

  MIDSTREAM OPERATIONS

     Mitchell's midstream operations are the largest among independent producers
in the United States. Mitchell owns 9,100 miles of natural gas transportation
pipelines, six natural gas processing plants, a one-third interest in an MTBE
plant and a 38.75% interest in an NGL fractionating plant. Concentration of
these facilities near Mitchell's core operating areas in Texas enables it to
gather approximately 87% of its own gas. About 46% of the NGLs produced at the
six plants is from Mitchell operated gas. The remaining 54% is from third party
operated gas. Mitchell markets its natural gas and NGL products primarily in the
Dallas-Fort Worth and Texas Gulf Coast areas and also has interconnects with
multiple interstate pipeline systems.

                           COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA

     The following table presents historical per share data for Devon and
Mitchell individually and pro forma per share data of the combined company after
giving effect to the merger. The combined company pro forma per share data was
derived by combining information from the historical consolidated financial
statements of Devon and Mitchell using the purchase method of accounting for the
merger. You should read this table in conjunction with the historical
consolidated financial statements of Devon and Mitchell that are filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and incorporated by reference into this
document. See "Additional Information -- Where You Can Find More Information."
You should not rely on the pro forma per share data as being necessarily
indicative of actual results had the merger occurred in the past, or of future
results.

(1) The combined company's pro forma data includes the effect of the merger on
    the basis described in the notes to the unaudited pro forma combined
    financial information included elsewhere in this document.

(2) Devon's historical basic and diluted earnings per share for the six months
    ended June 30, 2001 do not include the effect of a $49.5 million gain
    related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The
    gain related to Devon's adoption as of January 1, 2001, of a new accounting
    principle related to accounting for derivative financial instruments. The
    $49.5 million gain represented $0.38 and $0.37 of basic and diluted earnings
    per share, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2001.

(3) For the year ended December 31, 2000, Devon's annual dividends were paid at
    the rate of $0.20 per share. However, the table above presents Devon's 2000
    historical dividends at the rate of $0.17 per share. The difference is
    caused by the merger with Santa Fe Snyder Corporation, which was completed
    on August 29, 2000. Devon accounted for the Santa Fe Snyder merger using the
    pooling-of-interests method of accounting and, accordingly, historical
    results for the year ended December 31, 2000 are presented as though Devon
    and Santa Fe Snyder had been combined for the entire year. Since Santa Fe
    Snyder did not pay dividends on its common stock prior to the merger, the
    combined 2000 dividends per share of the two companies totaled $0.17, as
    opposed to Devon's stand-alone dividend rate of $0.20 per share.

(4) Prior to June 29, 2000, Mitchell had two classes of common stock. On June
    29, 2000, following stockholder approval, Mitchell combined the two classes
    of common stock into a single class. Mitchell's historical 2000 dividends
    per share of $0.78 are presented as though the single class of stock had
    existed for the entire year. The $0.78 per share of historical dividends in
    2000 includes a special dividend of $0.25 per share.

(1) Devon paid dividends on its common stock in 1999, 2000 and 2001 at a per
    share rate of $0.05 per quarter. No dividends were paid during 1999 or 2000
    on shares of Santa Fe Snyder common stock prior to the August 2000 merger
    pursuant to which Santa Fe Snyder became a part of Devon. As adjusted for
    the Santa Fe Snyder merger, which Devon accounted for using the
    pooling-of-interests method of accounting, Devon's dividends per share
    reported for accounting purposes are lower than the historical per share
    rate of $0.05 per quarter. See "Summary -- Selected Historical Financial
    Data of Devon."

     Until June 29, 2000, Mitchell had two classes of common stock, Class A
shares and Class B shares. The two classes of Mitchell common stock were

     Devon is currently paying a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per
share. The payment of dividends by Devon in the future will depend on business
conditions, Devon's financial condition, earnings and other factors.

     Mitchell has paid regular quarterly cash dividends for more than 20 years
and, if the merger is not completed as expected, Mitchell currently intends to
continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends. The cash dividends of $0.3825
per share paid by Mitchell in the third quarter of 2000 included a special cash
dividend of $0.25 and, in making that payment, Mitchell emphasized that the
special cash dividend did not signal any future departure in the level of
regular quarterly cash dividends. If the merger is not completed as expected,
determination of the amount of future cash dividends to be declared and paid
will depend on, among other things, Mitchell's results of operations, cash
flows, anticipated capital requirements and restrictions contained in its debt
instruments.

                                   THE MERGER

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     For Mitchell, the proposed merger with Devon represents the culmination of
a lengthy and deliberate process.

     In the late summer of 1999, Mitchell's board of directors determined to
explore strategic alternatives for the company in order to increase stockholder
returns. On October 6, 1999, Mitchell announced its engagement of Goldman, Sachs
& Co. and a predecessor firm of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. to advise Mitchell
regarding strategic alternatives, including possible transactions that might
result in a sale or merger.

     Over the next six months, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan contacted on behalf of
Mitchell numerous parties, including Devon, as to their interest in
participating in an auction process leading to a possible business combination
with Mitchell. Conditions within the energy industry and the stock market during
the auction process were not, however, generally supportive of a business
combination at a price acceptable to Mitchell. At that point, Mitchell's board
of directors decided to terminate sales efforts.

     In April 2000, Mitchell announced that, as a result of its review of
strategic alternatives, the company planned to continue operating as an
independent oil and gas company and to take several steps to improve its stock
price performance. These steps included (1) accelerating its development
drilling program, (2) expanding its North Texas gas processing facilities, (3)
reducing long-term debt and (4) combining its Class A and Class B common stock
into a single voting class. Mitchell believes that these efforts, combined with
a 50% increase in reserves at mid-year 2000, rapidly growing gas production
volumes, increasing gas prices and record earnings, contributed to a doubling of
Mitchell's stock price by the early fall of 2000 and the realization of a stock
trading multiple comparable to the leaders in the independent oil and natural
gas sector. By mid-fall of 2000, Mitchell's management felt that its future
outlook was promising enough to consider again a possible merger or sale of the
company. Discussions ensued with Mitchell's financial advisors about the
strategy and timing of such initiatives. Meanwhile, Mitchell's stock price
continued to increase throughout the remainder of 2000, reaching an all time
high of $64 per share in late December.

     Beginning in late November and continuing into mid-December 2000, contacts
occurred between Mitchell's senior management and another independent oil and
gas company regarding that company's possible interest in pursuing a business
combination with Mitchell. Although no transaction resulted from these contacts,
in the course of discussions, several verbal merger proposals were made to
Mitchell. A final offer was made in early March 2001 that valued Mitchell at or
near the then current market price for Mitchell's stock. George P. Mitchell and
W.D. Stevens, Mitchell's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer,
respectively, responded that the offer did not represent fair value for the
company's assets and, consequently, Mitchell was not interested in pursuing the
proposal. All negotiations were then terminated. Throughout this process,
Mitchell management kept Mitchell's board of directors informed.

     In the spring of 2001, George P. Mitchell, who was then the majority
stockholder of the company, decided to sell a significant block of his Mitchell
shares to meet certain personal estate planning, financial and philanthropic
goals. Specifically, in early May 2001, Mr. Mitchell sold 4.7 million shares of
Mitchell common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price to the
public of $53 per share. Mr. Mitchell retained Bracewell & Patterson, L.L.P. to
represent his personal interests in this offering.

     Later in May 2001, Mitchell asked its two financial advisors, during the
course of their routine contacts with a select group of energy companies, to
make these companies aware of Mitchell's openness to a possible sale or merger.
Some of these contacts expressed a possible interest, but no meaningful
follow-up by them resulted. Subsequently, however, representatives of Goldman
Sachs and JPMorgan informally inquired of several of Devon's executive officers
whether or not Devon might be interested in assessing a possible business
combination with Mitchell. These inquiries met with a positive response from
Devon. Selected publicly available information regarding Mitchell was provided
to Devon.

     On June 14, 2001, a meeting among J. Larry Nichols, Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Officer of Devon, another executive officer of Devon, Mr.
Stevens and Mitchell's Chief Financial Officer occurred in Houston, Texas. At
that meeting, Mitchell management confirmed Devon's interest in evaluating a
possible business combination in light of Mitchell's transaction expectations in
order to ensure that neither company would be wasting time and effort, as had
happened with Mitchell earlier in the year. Satisfied that there was a
reasonable basis for proceeding, the parties agreed generally on a schedule for
beginning the evaluation process. On June 21, 2001, Mitchell entered into a
confidentiality agreement with Devon. Shortly thereafter Devon commenced a due
diligence investigation of Mitchell. Over the next several weeks, Mitchell
furnished Devon with confidential evaluation materials in several meetings which
took place between senior operating management of the two companies. Management
of both companies informed the boards of directors of their respective companies
of these meetings.

     On August 7, 2001, Mr. Nichols submitted a letter to Mitchell's financial
advisors proposing that Devon acquire Mitchell for cash of $30 per share and
0.585 of a share of Devon common stock for each share of Mitchell common stock.
The letter stated that the proposal would expire on August 17, 2001. The
Mitchell board of directors held a meeting the next day, August 8, 2001, at the
company's offices in Houston. At that meeting, Mitchell's management, together
with representatives of Mitchell's financial advisors and outside counsel,
reviewed with Mitchell's board of directors the proposal contained in Mr.
Nichols' August 7 letter as well as background information on Devon. Mitchell's
board of directors authorized Mitchell's management to negotiate with Devon.

     Later that same day, August 8, a representative of Goldman Sachs telephoned
Mr. Nichols on behalf of Mitchell to inform him that Mitchell's board of
directors had considered Devon's proposal and to discuss the board's response to
that proposal.

     At about this same time, Devon engaged UBS Warburg LLC to act as its
financial advisor in connection with its possible acquisition of Mitchell.

     Mr. Nichols, in the course of a telephone conversation on the evening of
August 9 with a representative of Goldman Sachs, responded to the issues raised
by Mitchell's board of directors in considering Devon's August 7 proposal,
including the proposed merger consideration. Mr. Nichols stated that Devon was
prepared to raise the cash portion of its offer to $31 per share. Mr. Nichols
insisted that Devon would require Mr. and Mrs. George P. Mitchell to grant Devon
an irrevocable proxy to vote their Mitchell shares in connection with the merger
and an option to purchase those shares.

     In telephone conversations on August 10, Mr. Stevens and a representative
of Goldman Sachs discussed with Mr. Nichols the proposed terms of the merger and
asked Devon to increase its offer again. Mr. Nichols refused to do so. Finally,
Messrs. Stevens and Nichols agreed to meet in Houston over the next several
days, together with their respective management teams, financial advisors and
legal counsel, to complete mutual due diligence and to determine if Devon and
Mitchell could agree on merger terms and if Devon could reach agreement with Mr.
and Mrs. George P. Mitchell on contractual support for the merger. Later that
same day, Devon instructed its outside legal counsel, Mayer, Brown & Platt, to
commence documentation of the proposed merger as well as the proposed
contractual arrangements between Devon and Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell.

     The Devon and Mitchell groups met as proposed at the Houston offices of
Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. beginning on Saturday, August 11, and continuing until
the early evening of Monday, August 13. They were joined by Mr. and Mrs. George
P. Mitchell's legal counsel. At his initial meeting with Devon's General Counsel
and its outside legal counsel, Mayer, Brown & Platt, on August 11, Mr. and Mrs.
Mitchell's legal counsel explained his clients' objection to the proposed grant
of an option to Devon to purchase their Mitchell shares. In view of the
relatively large number of Devon shares that Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell would receive
in the proposed merger, Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell's legal counsel also requested
that Devon grant Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell both demand and "piggyback" registration
rights. He indicated, however, that Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell were generally
agreeable to entering an agreement with Devon to vote in favor of the merger and
not to sell their Mitchell shares during the next two years. By the following
Monday, August 13, Devon had reached the agreements with Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell
that are

embodied in the principal shareholders agreement and the investor rights
agreement described under "Agreements among Devon, George P. Mitchell and
Cynthia Woods Mitchell."

     Mayer, Brown & Platt presented Mitchell and its outside legal counsel,
Vinson & Elkins L.L.P., with a draft of the proposed merger agreement early on
Saturday evening, August 11. Over the ensuing 48-hour period, Devon and Mitchell
negotiated and documented a definitive merger agreement. For a description of
the terms of the definitive merger agreement, see "The Merger Agreement."

     During the course of negotiations in Houston on August 11 and 12, Mitchell
and Devon and their financial advisors also completed their respective due
diligence work.

     During the afternoon of Monday, August 13, 2001, Mitchell's board of
directors met at the company's offices in Houston to discuss the proposed
transaction. After a management presentation, a member of Vinson & Elkins L.L.P.
presented to Mitchell's board of directors an overview of the terms and
conditions of the proposed merger agreement and advised the board as to its
fiduciary duties. Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell's legal counsel summarized for
Mitchell's board of directors the terms and conditions of the proposed principal
shareholders agreement and investor rights agreement among Devon and Mr. and
Mrs. Mitchell. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan then provided their
respective financial analyses with regard to the proposed merger agreement.
Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan then delivered their respective opinions to
Mitchell's board of directors to the effect that, as of that date and subject to
the assumptions and other matters set forth in the opinions, the consideration
to be received by the holders of Mitchell common stock pursuant to the merger
agreement was fair from a financial point of view to the holders. For a
discussion of the opinions of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, see "-- Opinions of
Financial Advisors -- Opinion of Goldman, Sachs & Co. -- Financial Advisor to
Mitchell" and "-- Opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. -- Financial Advisor to
Mitchell." Based on the information presented, Mitchell's board of directors
unanimously approved and adopted the merger agreement and determined that the
merger agreement and the merger are advisable and in the best interests of
Mitchell and its stockholders. Mitchell's board of directors also adopted a
resolution recommending to Mitchell stockholders that they vote FOR approval of
the merger agreement.

     On August 13, 2001, Devon's board of directors also met to discuss the
proposed transaction. During that meeting, Devon's General Counsel and a
representative of Mayer, Brown & Platt presented to Devon's board of directors
and discussed with the board a legal overview of the terms and conditions of the
proposed merger agreement and the proposed principal shareholders agreement and
investor rights agreement among Devon and Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell. Representatives
of Devon's management and UBS Warburg LLC then provided an overview of
Mitchell's assets and a description of the combined company to Devon's board of
directors. UBS Warburg LLC also discussed with the board a strategic and
financial overview of the proposed merger. UBS Warburg LLC then delivered its
opinion to Devon's board of directors to the effect that the consideration to be
paid by Devon to holders of Mitchell common stock pursuant to the merger
agreement was fair to Devon from a financial point of view as of that date. For
a discussion of UBS Warburg LLC's opinion, see "-- Opinions of Financial
Advisors -- Opinion of UBS Warburg LLC -- Financial Advisor to Devon." Based on
the information presented, Devon's board of directors, by a unanimous vote of
those directors who attended the meeting, approved and adopted the merger
agreement and determined that the merger agreement and the merger are advisable
and in the best interests of Devon and its stockholders. Devon's board of
directors also adopted a resolution recommending to Devon stockholders that they
vote FOR approval of the issuance of Devon common stock in the merger.

     Devon purchased 100 shares of Mitchell common stock from Mr. Mitchell for
$6,212 and the merger agreement, the principal shareholders agreement and the
investor rights agreement were signed after the close of trading on August 13,
2001. Devon and Mitchell issued a joint press release announcing the merger the
following morning before the stock markets opened.

RECOMMENDATION OF MITCHELL'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     Mitchell's board of directors has unanimously approved and adopted the
merger agreement and determined that the merger agreement and the merger are
advisable and in the best interests of Mitchell and its stockholders.
Accordingly, the board recommends that Mitchell stockholders vote to approve the
merger agreement.

     Mitchell's board of directors considered various factors, including the
following, in unanimously approving the merger agreement and the merger (the
order does not reflect the relative significance):

     - Merger Consideration -- The value of the merger consideration, as of
       August 13, 2001, represented a 32% premium over the closing price of
       Mitchell's common stock on that date and, in the board's view, was the
       only offer it had received for the company that appropriately reflected
       the company's enterprise value. The merger agreement requires Devon to
       pay approximately $1.6 billion and to issue approximately 30.2 million
       shares of its common stock to Mitchell stockholders. Accordingly,
       Mitchell stockholders will obtain in the merger cash for a substantial
       portion of the value of their shares and will also have the opportunity
       to participate in any post-merger appreciation in the value of Devon
       common stock.

     - Increased Liquidity -- The combined company's common stock will be traded
       on the American Stock Exchange in substantially greater dollar volumes
       than that of Mitchell on the New York Stock Exchange, providing greater
       liquidity for Mitchell stockholders and for new institutional investors.

     - Complementary Assets and Diversification -- Mitchell's operations and its
       reserves are concentrated in North Texas, East Texas and along the Texas
       Gulf Coast, complementing Devon's core operating areas elsewhere in the
       United States. Mitchell's largest field, the Newark East Barnett Shale
       field in North Texas, will also add a new high-growth core area to
       Devon's domestic natural gas assets and operations. Further, Devon's
       United States, Canadian and international oil and gas operations will
       provide Mitchell stockholders with a more diversified exploration and
       exploitation portfolio. Lastly, Mitchell is one of the nation's largest
       independent producers of NGLs, and Mitchell's NGL assets will expand
       considerably Devon's midstream business.

     - Industry Leadership Position -- Devon and Mitchell together produced
       approximately 1.4 Bcf of natural gas per day in the United States during
       the second quarter of 2001, and the combined company will be the second
       largest independent natural gas producer in the United States in terms of
       total per day natural gas production. Based on year-end 2000 reserve
       information and on a pro forma basis, Mitchell's merger with Devon will
       increase Devon's proved reserves by approximately 38% to 1.5 billion Boe.

     - Strong Pro Forma Financial Profile -- Devon has a strong balance sheet
       and its debt securities carry higher ratings than Mitchell's debt
       securities. Mitchell's board of directors believes that the pro forma
       financial profile of the combined company will result in an improved
       ability to increase reserves and production through expanded exploration
       and development drilling programs than had Mitchell elected to remain
       independent.

     - Tax Consequences of the Merger -- The merger is structured to be tax
       free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to Devon, Mitchell and their
       respective stockholders, except to the extent that Mitchell stockholders
       receive cash in the merger.

     - Opinions of Financial Advisors -- Mitchell's board of directors also
       considered the presentations and opinions of both Goldman Sachs and
       JPMorgan described elsewhere in this document to the effect that, based
       on their assumptions and other matters stated in their respective
       opinions, the consideration to be received by holders of Mitchell's
       common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial
       point of view to the holders as of the date of those opinions.

     The preceding discussion of the information and factors considered and
given weight by Mitchell's board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive.
However, Mitchell's board of directors believes that the

discussion includes all of the material factors that it considered. In reaching
its decision to approve and to recommend approval to Mitchell stockholders of
the merger agreement, Mitchell's board of directors did not assign any relative
or specific weights to the factors it considered. Individual directors may have
given different weights to different factors.

     Mitchell's board of directors realizes that there are risks associated with
the merger, including the risks that:

     - the operations of the two companies may not be successfully integrated;
       and

     - the merger might not be completed as a result of a failure to satisfy the
       conditions contained in the merger agreement.

     These factors and additional factors are discussed more fully under "Risk
Factors." However, Mitchell's board of directors believes that the positive
factors should outweigh any negative factors, although Mitchell's board of
directors can give no assurances in this regard.

RECOMMENDATION OF DEVON'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     Devon's board of directors has, by a unanimous vote of those directors who
attended the meeting, approved and adopted the merger agreement and determined
that the merger agreement and the merger are advisable and in the best interests
of Devon and its stockholders. Accordingly, the board recommends that Devon
stockholders vote to approve the issuance of Devon common stock in the merger.

     The merger is part of Devon's overall business strategy for growth through
exploration and development of existing properties and through strategic mergers
and acquisitions. Following the merger, Devon will be the second largest
independent natural gas producer in the United States based on pro forma
production for the quarter ended June 30, 2001. In reaching its decision to
approve and adopt the merger agreement, Devon's board of directors consulted
with Devon's management, as well as its financial and legal advisors. Devon's
board of directors believes that Devon and its stockholders will benefit from
the merger for the following reasons (the order does not reflect the relative
significance):

     - Per Share Accretion -- Devon anticipates that the merger will provide
       accretion, to varying degrees, in cash margin per share, earnings per
       share, reserves per share and production per share on a pro forma basis.

     - Growth Oriented Asset Base -- Devon believes that there are significant
       development and exploitation projects in each of Mitchell's core areas.
       Devon expects these exploitation and development projects to provide
       Devon with relatively low-risk (geological and technical) opportunities
       to increase production for the next several years. Devon also anticipates
       that the midstream business will grow significantly during the next two
       years. Devon expects that this growth will come not only from the
       expected production growth, but also from additional processing capacity
       and efficiency to be realized from the investment of over $200 million
       that Mitchell has made over the last two years to expand and upgrade its
       midstream facilities.

     - Marketing and Transportation Opportunities -- The pipeline infrastructure
       that Mitchell owns currently transports gas both from Mitchell's wells
       and from third parties' wells. These pipelines have multiple direct
       connections to end users of natural gas and to major interstate pipelines
       that can take gas to the east, midwest and southeast portions of the
       United States. Because the Mitchell pipelines have capacity to accept
       additional gas, Devon expects that these facilities will provide Devon an
       opportunity to deliver and sell its own gas to the most favorable of the
       multiple markets that the pipelines serve. In addition, the gas produced
       from Mitchell's Texas fields, when aggregated with Devon's east Texas and
       Permian Basin gas production, is expected to provide Devon with increased
       ability to negotiate the sale of its natural gas production.

     - Midstream Opportunities -- Natural gas production often contains NGLs,
       which can either be (1) left in the natural gas stream and sold along
       with the natural gas or (2) extracted from the natural gas at a
       processing facility and sold separately, depending on the quality of the
       liquid, as

       pentane, butane, propane or similar products. The decision of whether to
       sell the liquids with the gas stream or to extract the liquids and sell
       them separately is based on a number of factors, including (1) access to
       a processing facility; (2) fees charged by such facilities; and (3)
       prices for natural gas and the separated liquids. Generally, extracting
       the liquids and selling them separately results in more value per Mcf
       produced than selling the natural gas with the liquids. Mitchell's
       natural gas produced from the Barnett Shale, and natural gas produced
       from some of Devon's other properties in the area, contain NGLs. Owning
       Mitchell's processing facilities is expected to give Devon:

      - the ability to increase the value of Devon's own natural gas production;

      - additional revenue from processing third party natural gas; and

      - a significant share of the regional NGL supply, which should enhance
        Devon's ability to negotiate the sale of NGL production.

      In addition to its tangible cash generating value, Devon believes that
      there is significant intangible value to Mitchell's midstream business.
      Although Devon currently has midstream operations associated with existing
      producing properties, the merger would increase the size of Devon's
      midstream assets by more than eight-fold. The addition of these assets and
      the employees specialized in their operation is expected to enable Devon
      to deepen and broaden its knowledge and experience base in this business.
      It will also provide Devon a much larger platform on which to build.

     - Knowledge and Experience with a Unique Technology -- In 1998, Mitchell
       began implementing a new fracture completion technology referred to as
       light sand fracturing, or LSF. This technology has significant intangible
       value to Devon. LSF costs materially less than more traditional hydraulic
       fracturing techniques. This has made it economical to expand development
       of the Barnett Shale. Devon believes that LSF technology can be used on
       other Devon assets to enhance recoveries and economics. Devon views the
       merger as an opportunity to gain Mitchell's experience and expertise with
       a lower-cost technology that is not yet widely used.

     - Increased Exposure to North American Natural Gas -- Mitchell's reserves
       are in excess of 70% natural gas. Devon's reserves would increase from
       53% natural gas to approximately 58% natural gas on a pro forma basis
       after giving effect to the merger. Given the current supply/demand
       balance within the North American natural gas market and the outlook for
       this market, Devon believes that increasing its exposure to North
       American natural gas is opportune.

     - Larger Size -- The combined company will be the fourth largest oil and
       gas company in North America, based on enterprise value. There are
       several intangible advantages to the larger size:

      - Devon expects to have even greater liquidity in the market for its
        shares;

      - Based on Devon's prior experience with making acquisitions, the combined
        company's larger size should allow Devon to consider future transactions
        that would not otherwise be possible; and

      - The combined company's larger size is expected to give Devon greater
        marketing, purchasing and operating strengths.

     - Opinion of Financial Advisor -- Devon's board of directors also
       considered the presentation and opinion of UBS Warburg LLC described
       elsewhere in this document to the effect that, based on its assumptions
       and other matters stated in its opinion, the merger consideration to be
       paid by Devon in the merger was fair from a financial paint of view to
       Devon as of the date of the opinion.

     The preceding discussion of the information and factors considered and
given weight by Devon's board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive.
However, Devon's board of directors believes that the discussion includes all of
the material factors that it considered. In reaching its decision to approve the
merger agreement and the transactions that it contemplates and to recommend
approval to Devon stockholders of the issuance of Devon common stock in the
merger, Devon's board of directors did not

assign any relative or specific weights to the factors it considered. Individual
directors may have given different weights to different factors.

     Devon's board of directors realizes that there are risks associated with
the merger, including the risks that:

     - the operations of the two companies may not be successfully integrated;

     - the merger might not be completed as a result of a failure to satisfy the
       conditions contained in the merger agreement;

     - Mitchell's significant investment in the Barnett Shale may not generate
       the benefits expected by Devon;

     - the combined company may not realize the accretion that Devon expects
       from the merger to its reserves per share, production per share, cash
       margin per share or earnings per share; and

     - Mitchell has significant assets located near large population centers in
       North Texas, which makes it particularly sensitive to regulatory or
       environmental issues relating to these large population centers.

     These factors and additional factors are discussed more fully under "Risk
Factors." However, Devon's board of directors believes that the positive factors
should outweigh any negative factors, although Devon's board of directors can
give no assurances in this regard.

OPINIONS OF FINANCIAL ADVISORS

     OPINION OF GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. -- FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO MITCHELL

     On August 13, 2001, Goldman Sachs delivered its opinion to Mitchell's board
of directors that as of the date of the opinion and based on and subject to the
various qualifications and assumptions described in the opinion, the
consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Mitchell common stock
pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such
holders.

     The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated August 13,
2001, which sets forth assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on
the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex D.
You are urged to, and should, read the Goldman Sachs opinion in its entirety.
Goldman Sachs provided its opinion for the information and assistance of
Mitchell's board of directors in connection with its consideration of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The Goldman Sachs opinion is
not a recommendation as to how any Mitchell stockholder should vote with respect
to the approval of the merger agreement.

     In connection with its opinion, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:

     - the merger agreement;

     - annual reports to stockholders and annual reports on Form 10-K of
       Mitchell for the year ended December 31, 2000 and for the four fiscal
       years ended January 31, 2000;

     - annual reports to stockholders and annual reports on Form 10-K of Devon
       for the five years ended December 31, 2000;

     - interim reports to stockholders and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of
       Mitchell and Devon, including a draft report on Form 10-Q of Devon for
       the six-month period ended June 30, 2001;

     - other communications from Mitchell and Devon to their respective
       stockholders;

     - reports of Mitchell management with respect to the estimated oil and gas
       reserves of Mitchell;

     - reports of Devon management with respect to the estimated oil and gas
       reserves of Devon; and

     - internal financial analyses and forecasts for Mitchell and Devon prepared
       by their respective managements, including certain cost savings and
       operating synergies projected by the managements of Mitchell and Devon to
       result from the merger.

     Goldman Sachs also held discussions with the senior management of each of
Mitchell and Devon regarding their assessment of the strategic rationale for,
and the potential benefits of, the merger and the past and current business
operations, financial condition and future prospects of their respective
companies. In addition, Goldman Sachs:

     - reviewed the reported price and trading activity for shares of Mitchell
       common stock and shares of Devon common stock;

     - compared financial and stock market information for Mitchell and Devon
       with similar information for certain other companies that have publicly
       traded securities;

     - reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in
       the oil and gas industry specifically and in other industries generally;
       and

     - performed other studies and analyses that Goldman Sachs considered
       appropriate.

     Goldman Sachs relied on the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial, accounting and other information discussed with or reviewed by it and
assumed such accuracy and completeness for purposes of rendering its opinion. In
that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed, with the consent of Mitchell's board of
directors, that the financial forecasts prepared by the managements of Mitchell
and Devon have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of Mitchell and Devon. In addition, Goldman
Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and
liabilities of Mitchell or Devon or any of their subsidiaries and, except for
the reserve reports provided by Devon's and Mitchell's management, was not
furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal.

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by
Goldman Sachs in connection with providing its opinion to Mitchell's board of
directors on August 13, 2001. This summary does not purport to be a complete
description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs. The following summary of
the financial analyses include information presented in tabular form. In order
to more fully understand each financial analysis used by Goldman Sachs, each
table must be read together with the full text of the related part of the
summary.

     Selected Companies Analysis -- Mitchell.  Goldman Sachs reviewed and
compared selected financial information, ratios and public market multiples
relating to Mitchell to corresponding financial information, ratios and public
market multiples for the following six publicly traded companies:

     - Burlington Resources Inc.;

     - Cross Timbers Oil Company;

     - EOG Resources, Inc.;

     - Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp.;

     - Newfield Exploration Company; and

     Goldman Sachs calculated and compared various financial multiples and
ratios based on the most recent publicly available information. The multiples
and ratios for Mitchell and each of the six selected companies were calculated
using closing share prices as of August 10, 2001. Goldman Sachs' analyses of the
selected companies compared the following to the results for Mitchell:

     - closing share price on August 10, 2001 as a percentage of the highest
       share price over the prior 52-week period;

     - closing share price on August 10, 2001 as a multiple of First Call mean
       estimated discretionary cash flow ("DCF") per share for 2001 and 2002;

     - total enterprise value, which is the market value of common equity plus
       preferred stock plus minority interest plus total debt less working
       capital, as a multiple of estimated debt adjusted cash flow, which is DCF
       plus after-tax interest expense ("DACF"), for 2001 and 2002; and

     - closing share price on August 10, 2001 as a multiple of First Call mean
       estimated earnings per share for 2001 and 2002.

     Financial Analysis of 3-Year Forecast.  Goldman Sachs performed analyses to
determine the present values as of August 10, 2001 of hypothetical future stock
prices for Mitchell and future Mitchell dividends at Mitchell's current
quarterly rate. These analyses were based on Mitchell management's three-year
financial forecast, including its oil and gas pricing assumptions, and were
calculated on the basis of both

price to discretionary cash flow terminal multiples and enterprise value to debt
adjusted cash flow terminal multiples.

     The following tables present the ranges of present values indicated by
these analyses.

and Mitchell dividends based on Mitchell management's forecasts as adjusted to
reflect alternative assumptions as to future oil and gas pricing. The following
table presents the ranges of present values indicated by the analyses using
alternative pricing assumptions identified by Mitchell management and assuming
the same range of discount rates and terminal multiples.

     Mitchell Net Asset Valuation Analysis.  Goldman Sachs analyzed the present
value of the net assets of Mitchell based on projections provided by Mitchell's
management, including estimates with respect to future production for proved,
probable and possible reserves based on a reserve summary prepared by Mitchell's
management as of May 31, 2001 and financial projections with respect to
Mitchell's natural gas gathering, processing and marketing assets, and oil and
gas pricing forecasts provided by Mitchell's management. The results of these
analyses suggested a range of net asset values of $47.89 to $63.27 per share of
Mitchell common stock. Goldman Sachs also performed these analyses on the net
asset values using two alternative oil and gas pricing assumptions provided by
Mitchell's management. Based on these alternative pricing assumptions, these
analyses suggested a range of net asset values of $44.32 to $56.69 per share of
Mitchell common stock using Alternative 1 pricing and $52.25 to $68.10 per share
of Mitchell common stock using Alternative 2 pricing.

     Pro Forma Merger Analysis.  Goldman Sachs prepared a pro forma analysis of
the financial impact of the merger on Devon. The analysis was based on First
Call mean estimates as of August 10, 2001 and

guidance from Mitchell and Devon management, and assumed $10 million and $20
million in pre-tax synergies in 2002 and 2003, respectively.

     This analysis indicated that the merger would be accretive to Devon -- that
is, would represent an addition -- to both 2002 and 2003 estimated earnings per
share and 2002 and 2003 estimated discretionary cash flow per share.

     The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not
necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting
portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering
the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes
underlying Goldman Sachs' opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination,
Goldman Sachs considered the results of all such analyses and did not attribute
any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather,
Goldman Sachs made its determination on the basis of its experience and
professional judgment after considering the results of all of these analyses. No
company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly
comparable to Mitchell or Devon or the transaction contemplated by the merger
agreement.

     The analyses were prepared solely for purposes of providing an opinion to
Mitchell's board of directors as to the fairness from a financial point of view
of the consideration to be received by the holders of shares of Mitchell common
stock in the merger. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily
reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold.
Analyses based on forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of
actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by such analyses. Because such analyses are inherently subject to
uncertainty, being based on numerous factors or events beyond the control of the
parties or their respective advisors, none of Mitchell, Devon, Goldman Sachs or
any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially
different from those forecast.

     As described above, Goldman Sachs' opinion was one of many factors taken
into consideration by Mitchell's board of directors in making its determination
to approve the merger agreement and the merger. The foregoing summary does not
purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs.

     Goldman Sachs, as part of its investment banking business, is continually
engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings,
secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements
and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes.

     Goldman Sachs is familiar with Mitchell, having provided certain investment
banking services to Mitchell from time to time, including having acted as a
co-managing underwriter of a public offering in May 2001 of Mitchell common
stock, and having acted as its financial advisor in connection with, and having
participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the merger agreement.
Goldman Sachs has also provided certain investment banking services to Devon
from time to time and may provide investment banking services to Devon in the
future.

     Goldman Sachs provides a full range of financial advisory and securities
services and, in the course of its normal trading activities, may from time to
time effect transactions and hold securities, including derivative securities,
of Mitchell or Devon for its own account and for the accounts of customers.

     Pursuant to a letter agreement dated August 27, 1999, Mitchell engaged
Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with various
financial alternatives available to it, including a possible merger or sale of
Mitchell. Pursuant to the terms of that agreement, Mitchell has agreed to pay
Goldman Sachs a fee in cash upon consummation of the merger equal to 0.5% of the
aggregate consideration paid in connection with the merger. Mitchell has also
agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses,
including attorneys' fees, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs against certain
liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.

  OPINION OF J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES INC. -- FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO MITCHELL

     On August 13, 2001, JPMorgan delivered its oral opinion, subsequently
confirmed in writing, to Mitchell's board of directors, to the effect that, as
of that date and based on and subject to certain matters stated in the opinion,
the merger consideration to be received by the holders of Mitchell common stock
in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

     The full text of the JPMorgan's opinion, dated August 13, 2001, which sets
forth the assumptions made, factors considered and limitations on the review
undertaken by JPMorgan in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex E.
JPMorgan's written opinion was addressed to Mitchell's board of directors, was
directed only to the merger consideration to be received by the holders of
Mitchell common stock in the merger and did not constitute a recommendation to
any Mitchell stockholder as to how such stockholder should consent to, or
otherwise vote on, the merger. The following summary of the material provisions
of JPMorgan's opinion is qualified by reference to the opinion. Mitchell
stockholders are urged to read JPMorgan's opinion in its entirety.

     In arriving at its opinion, JPMorgan, among other things:

     - reviewed a draft of the merger agreement dated August 13, 2001 and a
       draft of the principal shareholders agreement dated August 12, 2001;

     - compared certain publicly available business and financial information
       concerning Mitchell and Devon and the industries in which they operate;

     - compared the proposed financial terms of the merger with the publicly
       available financial terms of certain transactions involving companies
       deemed relevant and the consideration received for such companies;

     - compared the financial and operating performance of Mitchell and Devon
       with publicly available information concerning certain other companies
       deemed relevant and the current and historical market prices of
       Mitchell's and Devon's common stock and certain other publicly traded
       securities of those other companies;

     - reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by
       the managements of Mitchell and Devon relating to their respective
       businesses;

     - reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by
       certain engineering consultants, including each of LaRoche Petroleum
       Consultants, Ryder Scott Company Petroleum Consultants and Paddock
       Lindstrom & Associates relating to the oil, gas and natural gas liquids
       reserves of Devon as of December 31, 2000; and

     - reviewed other financial studies and analyses and other information
       deemed relevant by JPMorgan.

     JPMorgan also held discussions with certain members of the managements of
Mitchell and Devon with respect to certain aspects of the merger, and the past
and current business operations of Mitchell and Devon, the financial condition
and future prospects and operations of Mitchell and Devon, the effects of the
merger on the financial condition and future prospects of Mitchell and Devon,
and certain other matters believed necessary or appropriate to JPMorgan's
inquiry.

     In rendering its opinion, JPMorgan relied on and assumed, without
independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all information that
was publicly available or that was furnished to it by Mitchell, Devon and the
engineering consultants or otherwise reviewed by it, and JPMorgan did not assume
any responsibility or liability therefor. JPMorgan did not conduct any valuation
or appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor have any valuations or appraisals
(other than the reserve reports written by the engineering consultants) been
provided to it. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to it,
JPMorgan assumed that they were reasonably prepared based on assumptions
reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by management as
to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of Mitchell
and Devon to which such analyses or forecasts relate. In addition, JPMorgan
assumed that the merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S.
federal income tax

purposes, and that the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
will be consummated as described in the merger agreement and the parties to the
principal shareholders agreement will perform their obligations under that
agreement necessary for the merger to be effected. JPMorgan further assumed that
the definitive merger agreement and the definitive principal shareholders
agreement would not differ in any material respects from the draft merger
agreement dated August 13, 2001 and the draft principal shareholders agreement
dated August 12, 2001 furnished to it.

     The projections furnished to JPMorgan for Mitchell and Devon were prepared
by the respective managements of each company. Neither Mitchell nor Devon
publicly discloses internal management projections of the type provided to
JPMorgan in connection with JPMorgan's analysis of the merger consideration, and
such projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure. These
projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently
uncertain and may be beyond the control of management, including, without
limitation, factors related to general economic and competitive conditions and
prevailing interest rates. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly
from those set forth in such projections.

     JPMorgan's opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other
conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to JPMorgan as
of, the date of its opinion. Subsequent developments may affect the written
opinion dated August 13, 2001, and JPMorgan does not have any obligation to
update, revise or reaffirm such opinion. JPMorgan's opinion was limited to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be received by
the holders of Mitchell common stock and JPMorgan expressed no opinion as to the
underlying decision by Mitchell to engage in the merger. JPMorgan expressed no
opinion as to the price at which Mitchell's or Devon's common stock will trade
at any future time.

     JPMorgan's opinion noted that, although JPMorgan worked for Mitchell from
August 1999 through April 2000, that engagement did not result in the
consummation of a transaction. Since that time and in connection with the
preparation of its opinion dated August 13, 2001, JPMorgan was not authorized to
and did not solicit any expressions of interest from any other parties with
respect to the sale of all or any part of Mitchell or any other alternative
transaction. Therefore, JPMorgan assumed that such terms were the most
beneficial terms from Mitchell's perspective that could under the circumstances
be negotiated among the parties to those transactions, and JPMorgan expressed no
opinion whether any alternative transaction might produce consideration for
Mitchell stockholders in an amount in excess of that contemplated in the merger.

     In accordance with customary investment banking practice, JPMorgan employed
generally accepted valuation methods in reaching its opinion. The following is a
summary of the material financial analyses utilized by JPMorgan in connection
with delivering its opinion.

  Analysis of Mitchell

     Net Asset Value Analysis.  JPMorgan conducted a net asset value analysis to
determine the net asset value per share of Mitchell's common stock. Using
financial forecasts provided by Mitchell's management, JPMorgan estimated
Mitchell's net asset value by discounting the projected after-tax cash flows
from Mitchell's exploration and production business at rates of 8% to 10% and
Mitchell's natural gas gathering, processing and marketing business, referred to
as its midstream business, at rates of 10% to 12%.

     For the exploration and development business, free cash flows derived from
production of existing reserves were discounted to July 31, 2001, based on
management's current production forecast. Cash flows were taxed at an effective
rate of 35%, with adjustments for certain existing tax assets that were valued
at approximately $100 million in the aggregate. Based on the foregoing, this
analysis indicated a value range for the exploration and production business of
approximately $1,661 million to $1,895 million.

     For the midstream business, free cash flows derived from financial
forecasts provided by Mitchell's management for 2001 to 2005 were discounted to
July 31, 2001. Cash flows were taxed at an effective rate of 35%. The present
value of the 2005 terminal value was derived by applying a 6x to 8x multiple to

projected EBITDA for the business and discounting this estimate at the above
stated range of rates. Based on the foregoing, this analysis indicated a value
range for the midstream business of approximately $1,038 million to $1,397
million.

     JPMorgan then calculated an implied net asset value by summing the above
value ranges and subtracting from this sum the net indebtedness of Mitchell and
adding the value of current net working capital, both of which values came from
Mitchell's June 30, 2001 unaudited financial statements. Based on the foregoing,
this analysis implied a net asset value range of between approximately $52 and
$57 per share of Mitchell common stock on a fully diluted basis, compared to the
implied value of the consideration to be received in the merger of $60.13 per
share of Mitchell common stock, based on the closing price per share of Devon
common stock on August 10, 2001 of $49.79. In addition, JPMorgan calculated an
implied asset value associated with further development of infill drilling
locations and the refracturing of existing wells, which implied an incremental
$2 of value per share of Mitchell common stock on a fully diluted basis.

     Comparable Public Companies Analysis.  Using publicly available
information, JPMorgan compared certain financial and operating information and
ratios for Mitchell with corresponding financial and operating information and
ratios for the following five exploration and production companies:

     - Cabot Corporation;

     - EOG Resources, Inc.;

     - Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp.;

     - Noble Affiliates, Inc.; and

     - XTO Energy Inc.

     This analysis indicated that:

     - the ratio of the firm value to projected 2002 EBITDAX ranged from 3.8x to
       4.6x, with a mean of 4.3x and a median of 4.5x; and

     - the ratio of the equity value to projected 2002 cash flow ranged from
       3.3x to 4.2x, with a mean and median of 3.7x.

     This analysis indicated a range of implied prices per share of Mitchell's
common stock on a fully-diluted basis of approximately $42 to $48 value per
share by applying a range of 4.0x to 4.5x for the ratio of equity value to
projected 2002 cash flow. JPMorgan also calculated a range of implied prices per
share of Mitchell's common stock of approximately $44 to $50 by applying a range
of 4.0x to 4.5x for the ratio of firm value to 2002 estimated EBITDAX, compared
to the implied value of the consideration to be received in the merger of $60.13
per share of Mitchell common stock, based on the closing price per share of
Devon common stock on August 10, 2001 of $49.79.

     Premiums Paid Analysis.  JPMorgan reviewed the premiums paid in selected
business combinations in the oil and gas exploration and production industry.
The transactions considered and the month and year in which each transaction was
announced were:

     - Westport Resources Corporation's acquisition of Belco Oil & Gas Corp.
       (June 2001);

     - Conoco Inc.'s acquisition of Gulf Canada Resources Limited (May 2001);

     - Kerr-McGee Corporation's acquisition of HS Resources, Inc. (May 2001);

     - The Williams Companies, Inc. acquisition of Barrett Resources Corporation
       (March 2001);

     - Calpine Corporation's acquisition of Encal Energy Ltd. (February 2001);

     - Anadarko Petroleum Corporation's acquisition of Berkely Petroleum Corp.
       (December 2000);

     - Pogo Producing Company's acquisition of NORIC Corporation (the parent of
       North Central Oil Corporation) (November 2000);

     - Gulf Canada Resources Limited's acquisition of Crestar Energy Inc.
       (October 2000);

     - Forest Oil Corporation's acquisition of Forcenergy Inc. (July 2000);

     - Devon Energy Corporation's acquisition of Santa Fe Snyder Corporation
       (May 2000); and

     - Anadarko Petroleum Corporation's acquisition of Union Pacific Resources
       Group Inc. (April 2000).

     For each transaction listed above, JPMorgan calculated the premium
represented by the offer price over the target company's share price for the
period one day, one week and one month prior to the date of the transaction's
announcement. The analysis indicated that:

     - the premium to the share price one day prior to the announcement ranged
       from negative 4% to 61%, with a mean of 21.9% and a median of 21.0%;

     - the premium to the average share price one week prior to the announcement
       ranged from negative 2% to 63%, with a mean of 25.9% and a median of
       28.7%; and

     - the premium to the average share price one month prior to the
       announcement ranged from 4% to 55%, with a mean of 31.2% and a median of
       32.0%.

     JPMorgan calculated a range of implied prices per share of Mitchell's
common stock by applying the median figures listed above to the corresponding
average closing share price of Mitchell's common stock for the periods one day,
one week and one month prior to the announcement. This analysis indicated an
implied offer price per share of Mitchell's common stock on a fully diluted
basis of approximately $54, $58 and $59, respectively, compared to the implied
value of the consideration to be received in the merger of $60.13 per share of
Mitchell common stock, based on the closing price per share of Devon common
stock on August 10, 2001 of $49.79.

     Selected Transaction Analysis.  Using publicly available information,
JPMorgan examined selected transactions in the oil and gas exploration and
production industry to value Mitchell's exploration and production business. The
transactions selected were the same transactions listed above in the premiums
paid analysis. In addition, JPMorgan examined certain transactions involving
companies with significant midstream operations in order to value Mitchell's
midstream business.

     The analysis of the exploration and production transactions indicated that:

     - the consideration paid in the transaction divided by the most recently
       disclosed quantity of estimated reserves, on a dollars per millions of
       cubic feet equivalent, referred to as Mcfe, basis, ranged from $0.84 to
       $1.40, with a mean of $1.14 and a median of $1.19; and

     - the ratio of transaction value to projected two-year forward EBITDAX
       ranged from 3.6x to 8.1x, with a mean of 5.2x and a median of 5.0x.

     The analysis of the midstream transactions indicated that:

     - the ratio of transaction value to LTM EBITDA ranged from 6.3x to 13.4x,
       with a mean of 8.9x and a median of 8.4x.

     Based on the ranges of multiples derived from the above analyses, JPMorgan
calculated the implied firm value of Mitchell by selecting a range of +/- 10%
around the median value from each of the above metrics and applying these ranges
to the relevant Mitchell statistics. JPMorgan combined the exploration and
production value derived by applying the range of values paid per Mcfe to the
range of values derived for the midstream business to arrive at a value per
share of Mitchell common stock on a fully diluted basis of approximately $60 to
$70. JPMorgan combined the exploration and production value derived by applying
the range of EBITDAX multiples to the range of values derived for the midstream
business to arrive at a value per share of Mitchell common stock on a fully
diluted basis of approximately $54 to $65, compared to the implied value of the
consideration to be received in the merger of $60.13 per share of

Mitchell common stock, based on the closing price per share of Devon common
stock on August 10, 2001 of $49.79.

  Analysis of Devon

     Comparable Public Company Analysis.  Using publicly available information,
JPMorgan compared certain financial and operating information and ratios for
Devon with corresponding financial and operating information and ratios for the
following companies in lines of business believed to be generally comparable to
those of Devon:

     - Anadarko Petroleum Corporation;

     - Apache Corporation;

     - Burlington Resources Inc.;

     - EOG Resources, Inc.;

     - Kerr-McGee Corporation;

     - Ocean Energy, Inc.; and

     - Unocal Corporation.

     This analysis indicated that:

     - the ratio of the firm value to projected 2002 EBITDAX ranged from 4.2x to
       6.2x, with a mean of 4.9x and a median of 4.8x;

     - the ratio of the equity value to projected 2002 cash flow ranged from
       3.6x to 5.4x, with a mean and median of 4.5x; and

     - the ratio of firm value to total reserves on a dollars per Mcfe basis
       ranged from $0.98 to $1.55, with a mean of $1.24 and a median of $1.20.

     Using First Call consensus estimates of 2002 EBITDAX and cash flow, and
Devon's most recently published reserve estimate, and applying a ratio of equity
value to projected 2002 cash flow of between 4.0x and 5.0x, a ratio of firm
value to projected 2002 EBITDAX of between 4.25x and 5.25x and ratio of firm
value to total reserves on a dollars per Mcfe basis of between $1.10 and $1.30,
this analysis indicated a range of implied per share values of Devon common
stock on a fully diluted basis of approximately $46 to $57, $53 to $67 and $50
to $60, respectively, compared to the closing price per share of Devon common
stock on August 10, 2001 of $49.79.

     Net Asset Value Analysis.  JPMorgan conducted a net asset value analysis to
determine the net asset value per share of Devon's common stock. Using financial
forecasts provided by Devon's management, JPMorgan estimated Devon's net asset
value by discounting Devon's projected after-tax cash flows from Devon's
exploration and development business at rates of 8% to 10%. Cash flows derived
from production of existing reserves were discounted to July 31, 2001, based on
management's current production forecast. Cash flows were taxed at an effective
rate of 38%. Based on the foregoing, this analysis indicated a value range for
Devon's exploration and production business of approximately $9,746 million to
$10,877 million.

     JPMorgan then calculated an implied net asset value by subtracting from
this range the net indebtedness of Devon and adding the value of current net
working capital, both of which values came from Devon's June 30, 2001 unaudited
financial statements. Based on the foregoing, this analysis implied a net asset
value range of between approximately $68 and $76 per share of Devon common stock
on a fully diluted basis, compared with the closing price per share of Devon
common stock on August 10, 2001 of $49.79.

     Pro Forma Merger Analysis.  JPMorgan also analyzed the pro forma effects of
the merger on the projected cash flow of Devon for fiscal year 2002 based on
projections provided by the managements of Mitchell and Devon. Incorporating
assumptions with respect to various structural considerations,

transaction and financing costs and estimated annual synergies of $20 million to
be realized in 2002, this analysis indicated that the merger would be accretive
to cash flow and dilutive to earnings per share of Devon common stock in 2002.

     The summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete description
of the analyses or data presented by JPMorgan. The preparation of an opinion
regarding fairness is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to
partial analysis or summary description. JPMorgan believes that the summary set
forth above and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting
portions thereof, without considering all of its analyses, could create an
incomplete view of the processes underlying its analyses and opinion. JPMorgan
based its analyses on assumptions that it deemed reasonable, including
assumptions concerning general business and economic conditions and
industry-specific factors. The other principal assumptions on which JPMorgan
based its analyses are set forth above under the description of each such
analysis. JPMorgan's analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or
actual future results that might be achieved, which values may be higher or
lower than those indicated. Moreover, JPMorgan's analyses are not and do not
purport to be appraisals or otherwise reflective of the prices at which
businesses actually could be bought or sold.

     None of the comparable companies used in the comparable public companies
analysis described above is identical to Mitchell or Devon, and none of the
comparable transactions used in the comparable transactions analysis described
above is identical to the merger. Accordingly, an analysis of publicly traded
comparable companies and transactions is not exclusively mathematical; rather it
involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in
financial and operating characteristics of the comparable companies and other
factors that could affect the public trading value of the comparable companies
or company to which they are being compared.

     As a part of its investment banking business, JPMorgan and its affiliates
are continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control
purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and
unlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for estate, corporate
and other purposes. JPMorgan was selected to advise Mitchell with respect to the
merger and deliver an opinion to Mitchell's board of directors with respect to
the merger on the basis of such experience and JPMorgan's familiarity with
Mitchell.

     For services rendered in connection with the merger and the delivery of its
opinion, Mitchell has agreed to pay JPMorgan customary fees where the aggregate
consideration will be determined by the average of the last sales price for
Devon common stock on the five trading days ending prior to the consummation of
the merger, payable upon the closing of the merger. In addition, Mitchell has
agreed to reimburse JPMorgan for its expenses incurred in connection with its
services, including the fees and disbursements of counsel, and will indemnify
JPMorgan against certain liabilities, including liabilities arising under the
federal securities laws.

     Certain affiliates of JPMorgan have, from time to time, performed certain
financial advisory and other commercial and investment banking services for
Mitchell and Devon, for which they received customary compensation, and in the
future may continue to perform, from time to time, certain financial advisory
and other commercial and investment banking services for Mitchell or Devon, for
which they would receive customary compensation. Specifically, affiliates of
JPMorgan have acted as co-lead manager for a secondary offering of shares of
Mitchell common stock of George P. Mitchell, have a commitment under Mitchell's
revolving credit facility and have a commitment under Devon's revolving credit
facility that currently has not been drawn upon; that affiliate is also the
documentation agent with regard to Devon's revolving credit facility and was
selected to be one of Devon's commercial paper dealers.

     In addition, in the ordinary course of their businesses, JPMorgan and its
affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities and loans of
Mitchell or Devon for their own account or for the accounts of customers and,
accordingly, they may at any time hold long or short positions in such
securities or loans.

  OPINION OF UBS WARBURG LLC -- FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO DEVON

     On August 13, 2001, UBS Warburg LLC rendered its oral opinion, which was
confirmed by its written opinion dated August 13, 2001, to Devon's board of
directors to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based on and
subject to various assumptions, matters considered and limitations described in
the opinion, the merger consideration to be paid by Devon in the merger was
fair, from a financial point of view, to Devon.

     The full text of UBS Warburg LLC's opinion, dated August 13, 2001, which
sets forth a description of the assumptions made, general procedures followed,
matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as
Annex F. UBS Warburg LLC's opinion is directed only to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be paid by Devon in the
merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any Devon stockholder as to
how such stockholder should vote on the approval of the issuance of Devon common
stock in the merger. Devon stockholders are urged to read the opinion carefully
in its entirety, especially with regard to the assumptions made and matters
considered by UBS Warburg LLC. The summary of UBS Warburg LLC's opinion set
forth in this document is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full
text of such opinion.

     In arriving at its opinion, UBS Warburg LLC, among other things:

     - reviewed the August 13, 2001 draft of the merger agreement;

     - reviewed certain publicly available business and historical financial
       information relating to Devon and Mitchell;

     - reviewed certain information and other data provided to it by Devon that
       is not publicly available relating to the business and prospects of Devon
       that was prepared by the management of Devon, including operating
       estimates and financial forecasts;

     - reviewed certain information and other data provided to it by Devon and
       Mitchell that is not publicly available relating to the business and
       prospects of Mitchell that was prepared by the managements of Devon and
       Mitchell, including operating estimates and financial forecasts;

     - considered estimates, prepared by the management of Devon and not
       publicly available, of the amounts and timing of the synergies expected
       to result from the merger;

     - considered the pro forma financial effects of the merger on Devon;

     - reviewed publicly available financial and stock market data with respect
       to certain other companies in lines of business it believes to be
       generally comparable to those of Devon and Mitchell;

     - compared the financial terms of the merger with the financial terms of
       certain other selected transactions that it deemed to be relevant;

     - reviewed the historical market prices and trading volumes of both Devon
       and Mitchell common stock;

     - conducted discussions regarding Devon with selected members of Devon's
       senior management;

     - conducted discussions regarding Mitchell with selected members of the
       senior management of Mitchell and Devon; and

     - conducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations, and
       considered such other information, as it deemed necessary or appropriate.

     In connection with its review, and at Devon's direction, UBS Warburg LLC
did not assume any responsibility for independent verification of any of the
information reviewed by UBS Warburg LLC for the purposes of its opinion and, at
Devon's direction, relied on its being complete and accurate in all material
respects. In addition, UBS Warburg LLC did not make any independent evaluation
or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of
Devon or Mitchell, nor has UBS Warburg LLC been furnished with any such
evaluation or appraisal.

     UBS Warburg LLC's opinion does not address Devon's underlying business
decision to effect the merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any
Devon stockholder as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the
approval of the issuance of Devon common stock in the merger. UBS Warburg LLC
was not asked to, nor did UBS Warburg LLC, offer any opinion as to the material
terms of the merger agreement or the form of the merger. UBS Warburg LLC
expressed no opinion as to what the value of Mitchell common stock or Devon
common stock would be at the time of the merger or the prices at which either
would trade at any time in the future. In rendering its opinion, UBS Warburg LLC
assumed, with Devon's consent, that Devon and Mitchell would comply with all of
the material terms of the merger agreement.

     With respect to the projected operating and financial information,
estimates, pro forma effects and calculations of synergies referred to above,
UBS Warburg LLC assumed, at Devon's direction, that they were reasonably
prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and
judgments of the management of each company as to the future performance of
their respective companies. Moreover, UBS Warburg LLC assumed that all
governmental, regulatory and other consents and approvals necessary for the
consummation of the merger would be obtained without any adverse effect on Devon
or Mitchell. UBS Warburg LLC's opinion was necessarily based on economic,
monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made
available to UBS Warburg LLC as of, the date of the opinion.

     The following paragraphs summarize the material quantitative analyses
performed by UBS Warburg LLC in arriving at the opinion dated August 13, 2001
presented to Devon's board of directors. The financial analyses summarized below
include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand
UBS Warburg LLC's financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the
text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description
of the financial analyses. Considering the data below without considering the
full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the
methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading
or incomplete view of UBS Warburg LLC's financial analyses.

  Mitchell Valuation Analysis

     Comparable Company Analysis.  UBS Warburg LLC reviewed the public stock
market trading multiples for selected publicly traded independent exploration
and production companies with financial and operating characteristics that UBS
Warburg LLC deemed to be similar to those of Mitchell, including:

     - EOG Resources, Inc.;

     - Evergreen Resources, Inc.;

     - Forest Oil Corporation;

     - Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp.;

     - Newfield Exploration Company;

     - Pioneer Natural Resources Company;

     - Pogo Producing Company;

     - Stone Energy Corporation;

     - Western Gas Resources, Inc.; and

     - XTO Energy, Inc.

     Using publicly available information, including certain published equity
research estimates from UBS Warburg LLC equity research and elsewhere, UBS
Warburg LLC calculated and analyzed indicated reserve value ("IRV"), total
enterprise value ("TEV") and equity market value ("EMV") multiples of certain
historical and projected financial and operating metrics such as proved
reserves, earnings before interest, taxes, exploration expense, depreciation,
depletion and amortization ("EBITDA"), and cash flow from operations ("CFFO")
for each of these companies. The total enterprise value of each company was

obtained by adding its total debt at book value to the sum of the market value
of its common equity, the liquidation value of its preferred stock, the book
value of its long-term liabilities (excluding deferred taxes) and the book value
of any minority interest minus cash and cash equivalents. The indicated reserve
value of each company was obtained by subtracting from its total enterprise
value the value of its working capital, excluding cash and cash equivalents and
short-term debt, and an estimate of the value of its non-reserve tangible assets
and undeveloped acreage. The indicated reserve value per proved reserves
valuation for these companies ranged from $3.34 per Boe to $12.03 per Boe, with
a median of $6.15 per Boe. The total enterprise value to projected 2001 EBITDA
multiples ranged from 2.8x to 8.9x, with a median of 4.0x. The total enterprise
value to projected 2002 EBITDA multiples ranged from 3.6x to 8.7x, with a median
of 4.7x. The equity market value to projected 2001 CFFO multiples ranged from
2.4x to 8.5x, with a median of 3.3x. The equity market value to projected 2002
CFFO multiples ranged from 3.1x to 10.6x, with a median of 3.8x. UBS Warburg LLC
then calculated and analyzed the corresponding statistics for Mitchell at the
implied value per share of $60.13, based on the Devon closing price of $49.79 on
August 10, 2001. Based on this implied value per share, Mitchell's indicated
reserve value per proved reserves valuation was $6.23 per Boe. The total
enterprise value to projected 2001 EBITDA and 2002 EBITDA multiples were 5.1x
and 5.8x, respectively. The equity market value to projected 2001 CFFO and
projected 2002 CFFO multiples were 5.4x and 5.7x, respectively.

     Because of the inherent differences between the corporate structure,
businesses, operations and prospects of Mitchell and the corporate structure,
businesses, operations and prospects of the companies included in the group of
selected comparable companies, UBS Warburg LLC believed that it was
inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the quantitative results
of the analysis and, accordingly, also made qualitative judgments concerning
differences between the financial and operating characteristics of Mitchell and
those of the companies in the comparable company group that would affect the
public trading values of Mitchell and such comparable companies.

     - Burlington Resources Inc./Louisiana Land and Exploration Company; and

     - Mesa Inc./Parker & Parsley Petroleum Co.

     Using publicly available information, including certain published equity
research estimates, UBS Warburg LLC calculated and analyzed indicated reserve
value, total enterprise value and equity market value multiples of certain
historical and projected financial and operating metrics such as proved
reserves, EBITDA and CFFO. The indicated reserve value per proved reserves
valuation ranged from $4.86 per Boe to $12.87 per Boe, with a median of $7.12
per Boe. The total enterprise value to latest twelve months ("LTM") EBITDA
multiples ranged from 4.8x to 38.2x, with a median of 6.9x. The equity market
value to LTM CFFO multiples ranged from 2.2x to 33.7x, with a median of 6.1x.
The equity market value to one-year forward projected CFFO multiples ranged from
3.7x to 15.8x, with a median of 5.3x. The equity market value to two-year
forward projected CFFO multiples ranged from 2.6x to 8.7x, with a median of
4.4x. UBS Warburg LLC noted that commodity prices increased sharply in late-2000
and remained at these increased levels in early-2001. As a result, UBS Warburg
LLC deemed the six most recent transactions (the first six listed above)
beginning October 2000 to be the most relevant transactions. For this group of
six transactions, the median indicated reserve value per Boe was $8.21. The
median total enterprise value to LTM EBITDA multiple was 8.3x. The median
multiples of equity market value to LTM CFFO, and one-year and two-year forward
projected CFFO for this group were 6.9x, 5.4x and 5.2x, respectively. UBS
Warburg LLC then calculated and analyzed the corresponding statistics for
Mitchell at the implied value per share of $60.13. Based on this implied value
per share, Mitchell's indicated reserve value per proved reserves valuation was
$6.23 per Boe. The total enterprise value to LTM EBITDA multiple was 4.9x. The
multiples of equity market value to LTM CFFO, and one-year and two-year forward
CFFO were 5.3x, 5.4x and 5.7x, respectively.

     Because the market conditions, rationale and circumstances surrounding each
of the transactions analyzed were specific to such transaction and because of
the inherent differences between the businesses, operations and prospects of
Mitchell and those of the acquired businesses analyzed, UBS Warburg LLC believed
that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the
quantitative results of the analysis and, accordingly, also made qualitative
judgments concerning differences between the characteristics of each of these
transactions and the proposed transaction.

     Net Asset Value Analysis.  UBS Warburg LLC estimated the present value of
pre-tax cash flows that Devon expected Mitchell to generate from its total
proved, probable and possible reserves in each of Mitchell's major operating
regions. The present value calculations were performed as of June 1, 2001, used
a pre-tax discount rate of 10% and were calculated under four separate price
forecasts, set forth below. In addition, UBS Warburg LLC, at Devon's direction,
applied a risk adjustment of 47% to the value of Mitchell's probable reserves
and applied a risk adjustment of 45% to Mitchell's possible reserves.

     In performing the net asset value analysis, UBS Warburg LLC used four
separate commodity price forecasts, hereinafter referred to as the "UBS Warburg
forecast", the "Devon price forecast", "the NYMEX strip price forecast" and the
"Wall Street consensus forecast". The "UBS Warburg forecast" was based on
commodity prices forecasted by UBS Warburg LLC equity research. The "Devon price
forecast" was based on commodity prices forecasted by Devon's management. The
"NYMEX strip price forecast" was based on the average futures prices listed on
the NYMEX as of August 10, 2001. The "Wall Street consensus forecast" was based
on the consensus forecasts for natural gas and oil prices as reported by First
Call.

     UBS Warburg LLC included in the net asset value analysis an assessment of
the fair value of Mitchell's natural gas processing business. This assessment
was made by UBS Warburg LLC based on information and assumptions provided by
Devon's and Mitchell's managements and on various industry benchmarks.
Mitchell's aggregate net asset value was calculated by adding the risk-adjusted
present value of Mitchell's proved, probable and possible reserves to its
working capital (including cash and cash equivalents), the value of its natural
gas processing business and the value of its undeveloped acreage. After
subtracting Mitchell's total debt, and other long-term liabilities other than
deferred taxes, as of June 30, 2001, UBS Warburg LLC then determined a range of
net asset values per share on a diluted basis. A summary of the per share value
calculated as part of the net asset value analysis is set forth below:

     Premiums Paid Analysis.  UBS Warburg LLC, using a sample of 18 selected
independent exploration and production company transactions announced between
April 1997 and July 2001, reviewed the premiums paid to the price of the target
one day, one week and one month prior to the announcement of the transaction.
Using this information, UBS Warburg LLC determined the mean and median premiums
paid one day prior to the announcement of such transactions to be 22.7% and
21.1%, respectively, the mean and median premiums paid one week prior to the
announcement of such transactions to be 27.2% and 30.9%, respectively, and the
mean and median premiums paid one month prior to the announcement of such
transactions to be 30.2% and 33.4%, respectively. Further, UBS Warburg LLC
reviewed 15 selected business combinations with disclosed total enterprise
values of $3 billion to $4 billion announced since August 1, 1999. Using this
information, UBS Warburg LLC determined the mean and median premiums paid one
day prior to the announcement of such transactions to be 26.3% and 22.7%,
respectively, the mean and median premiums paid one week prior to the
announcement of such transactions to be 29.4% and 32.8%, respectively, and the
mean and median premiums paid one month prior to the announcement of such
transactions to be 39.6% and 38.4%, respectively. Based on implied consideration
of $60.13 per share of Mitchell common stock, the premiums to Mitchell's stock
price one day, one week and four weeks prior to announcement were 33.7%, 29.9%
and 37.5%, respectively.

     Pro Forma Merger Consequences Analysis.  UBS Warburg LLC analyzed certain
pro forma effects that could result from the merger. In connection with such
analyses, UBS Warburg LLC reviewed the estimates of UBS Warburg LLC equity
research for Devon and the First Call consensus estimates for Mitchell. Based on
these projections, certain financing assumptions and certain cost savings and
synergies that Devon's management expected to result from the merger, UBS
Warburg LLC examined the impact of the merger on Devon's diluted earnings per
share and CFFO per share. The analysis indicated that the merger, assuming that
the acquisition occurred at the beginning of each respective fiscal year, would
be accretive to both earnings per share and CFFO per share for 2001 and 2002.

  Devon Valuation Analysis

     UBS Warburg LLC performed a valuation of Devon using the following
methodologies: comparable company analysis and net asset value analysis.

     Comparable Company Analysis.  UBS Warburg LLC reviewed the public stock
market trading multiples for selected publicly traded independent exploration
and production companies with financial and operating characteristics that UBS
Warburg LLC deemed to be similar to those of Devon, including:

     - Anadarko Petroleum Corporation;

     - Apache Corporation;

     - Burlington Resources, Inc.;

     - EOG Resources, Inc.;

     - Kerr-McGee Corporation;

     - Noble Affiliates, Inc.;

     - Ocean Energy, Inc.; and

     - Unocal Corporation.

     Using publicly available information, including certain published equity
research estimates from UBS Warburg LLC equity research and elsewhere, UBS
Warburg LLC calculated and analyzed indicated reserve value, total enterprise
value and equity market value multiples of certain historical and projected
financial and operating metrics such as proved reserves, EBITDA and CFFO for
each of these companies. The indicated reserve value per proved reserves
valuation for these companies ranged from $5.27 per Boe to $8.93 per Boe, with a
median of $6.28 per Boe. The total enterprise value to projected 2001 EBITDA
multiples ranged from 3.4x to 5.2x, with a median of 4.4x. The total enterprise
value to projected 2002 EBITDA multiples ranged from 4.4x to 6.6x, with a median
of 5.0x. The equity market value to projected 2001 CFFO multiples ranged from
3.1x to 4.3x, with a median of 3.6x. The equity market value to projected 2002
CFFO multiples ranged from 3.6x to 5.5x, with a median of 4.0x. UBS Warburg LLC
then calculated and analyzed the corresponding statistics for Devon at its
closing price as of August 10, 2001 of $49.79. Based on this price per share,
Devon's indicated reserve value per proved reserves valuation was

$6.24 per Boe. The total enterprise value to projected 2001 EBITDA and 2002
EBITDA multiples were 3.4x and 4.2x, respectively. The equity market value to
projected 2001 CFFO and projected 2002 CFFO multiples were 3.5x and 4.3x,
respectively.

     Because of the inherent differences between the corporate structure,
businesses, operations and prospects of Devon and the corporate structure,
businesses, operations and prospects of the companies included in the group of
selected comparable companies, UBS Warburg LLC believed that it was
inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the quantitative results
of the analysis and, accordingly, also made qualitative judgments concerning
differences between the financial and operating characteristics of Devon and
those of the companies in the comparable company group that would affect the
public trading values of Devon and such comparable companies.

     Net Asset Value Analysis.  UBS Warburg LLC estimated the present value of
pre-tax cash flows that Devon expected to generate from its total proved,
probable and possible reserves in each of its major operating regions. The
present value calculations were performed as of January 1, 2001, used a pre-tax
discount rate of 10% and were calculated assuming the same four commodity price
forecasts used to perform the net asset value analysis on Mitchell described
above. In addition, UBS Warburg LLC, at Devon's direction, applied a risk
adjustment of 40% to the value of Devon's probable reserves and applied a risk
adjustment of 30% to Devon's possible reserves.

     Devon's aggregate net asset value was calculated by adding the
risk-adjusted present value of its proved, probable and possible reserves to its
working capital (including cash), the value of its other assets and undeveloped
acreage. After subtracting its total debt at book value, preferred stock at
liquidation value and other long-term liabilities (excluding certain deferred
tax liabilities) at book value, as of March 31, 2001, a range of net asset
values per share was then determined on a diluted basis. A summary of the per
share value calculated as part of the net asset value analysis is set forth
below:

evaluation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids, secondary

selected UBS Warburg LLC on the basis of its experience and independence. UBS
Warburg LLC and its predecessors have provided, and may in the future provide,
investment banking services to Devon, and received, and may in the future
receive, compensation for the rendering of such services. In the ordinary course
of business, UBS Warburg LLC, its successors and affiliates may trade securities

     Pursuant to the engagement letter, dated as of August 10, 2001, between
Devon and UBS Warburg LLC, Devon has agreed to pay UBS Warburg LLC customary
fees for services rendered in connection with the merger. Devon also has agreed
to reimburse UBS Warburg LLC for the expenses reasonably incurred by it entering
into and performing services in connection with its engagement and to indemnify
UBS Warburg LLC and its officers, directors, employees, agents and controlling
persons against certain expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities in
connection with its services performed in connection with its engagement.

INTERESTS OF MITCHELL'S EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE MERGER

     In considering the recommendation of Mitchell's board of directors with
respect to the merger, Mitchell stockholders should be aware that some of
Mitchell's executive officers and directors have interests in the merger that
are different from the interests of Mitchell stockholders generally. The boards
of directors of both companies were aware of these interests and considered them
in approving the merger and the merger agreement.

  Appointment of Mitchell's Designee to Devon's Board of Directors

     The merger agreement requires Devon's board of directors to appoint J. Todd
Mitchell to fill a vacancy on Devon's board of directors immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger. He will hold office until his successor is
elected and qualified or until his earlier resignation or removal. If J. Todd
Mitchell becomes unavailable or unwilling to serve, a substitute Mitchell
designee acceptable to Devon will fill the vacancy on Devon's board of
directors. Accordingly, either J. Todd Mitchell or a substitute Mitchell
designee will become a director of Devon at the effective time of the merger.
Additional information regarding J. Todd Mitchell and his principal occupation
and experience during the past five years follows:

     J. Todd Mitchell, age 42, has been a member of Mitchell's board of
directors since 1993. Mr. Mitchell has served as president of GPM, Inc., a
family-owned investment company, since 1988. He has also served as President of
and geologist to Dolomite Resources, Inc., a privately owned mineral exploration
and investments company, since 1987 and as Chairman of Rock Solid Images, a
privately owned seismic data analysis software company, since 1998. J. Todd
Mitchell is the son of George P. Mitchell, the Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of Mitchell.

  Investor Rights Agreement among Devon, George P. Mitchell and Cynthia Woods
  Mitchell

     George P. Mitchell, who is currently the Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of Mitchell, and his wife, Cynthia Woods Mitchell, have entered into an
agreement with Devon that, subject to a number of conditions, will provide them
with rights to require Devon to use its reasonable best efforts to register the
resale of the shares of Devon common stock that they receive in the merger. This
agreement also imposes limitations on Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell's ability to sell or
transfer the shares of Devon common stock to be received by them that will not
apply to other Mitchell stockholders. More details regarding the terms of this
agreement can be found under "Agreements among Devon, George P. Mitchell and
Cynthia Woods Mitchell -- Investor Rights Agreement."

  Other Interests

     Mitchell's executive officers also have the following interests in the
merger that are different from Mitchell stockholders' interests generally:

     - All outstanding stock options and bonus units, including those held by
       Mitchell's executive officers, will fully vest at the effective time of
       the merger and, if not exercised at that time, will be converted into
       fully vested options to purchase shares of Devon common stock and bonus
       units redeemable for cash based on the appreciation of Devon common
       stock, respectively, in each case subject to adjustment to reflect the
       value of the consideration to be paid by Devon in the merger.

     - At the effective time of the merger, 439,735 bonus units held by
       Mitchell's executive officers and options held by them relating to
       253,334 shares of Mitchell common stock, will vest.

     - After the merger, some Mitchell executive officers may remain officers of
       the surviving corporation of the merger or may become officers of Devon.

     - Mitchell executive officers will be entitled to severance payments and
       enhanced pension benefits in the event that their employment ceases after
       the merger. If qualifying terminations are made after the merger, the
       estimated amounts of the severance payments, exclusive of any possible
       gross-ups for income taxes applicable to parachute payments, that would
       be payable as of September 30, 2001 to Mitchell's executive officers are
       as follows:

NAME/TITLE                                                   AMOUNT
- ----------                                                 ----------

George P. Mitchell.......................................  $2,900,000
  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
W.D. Stevens.............................................   4,000,000
  President and Chief Operating Officer
Philip S. Smith..........................................   2,200,000
  Senior Vice President
Allen J. Tarbutton, Jr. .................................   1,900,000
  Senior Vice President
Thomas P. Battle.........................................     900,000
  Senior Vice President

     - Benefits of Mitchell's executive officers under their individual
       severance agreements cannot be reduced for 24 months following the
       merger.

     - Except for Mr. Mitchell, benefits under Mitchell's non-qualified
       retirement plans held by Mitchell executive officers will automatically
       be distributed as a lump sum into the Mitchell Energy & Development Corp.
       1998 Mutual Fund Option Plan upon their retirement.

     - The merger agreement generally requires Devon to honor Mitchell's
       existing employee benefit plans and commitments in accordance with their
       terms after the merger. The merger agreement also provides assurances
       that Mitchell officers and employees who become and remain full-time
       employees of Devon after the merger will receive employee benefits (other
       than stock-based benefits) no less favorable than those provided to
       similarly situated Devon employees for a two-year period after the
       merger. Details regarding Devon's obligations with respect to Mitchell's
       existing employee benefit plans and commitments can be found under "The
       Merger Agreement -- Covenants and Other Agreements -- Employee Benefits."

     Mitchell's directors and executive officers beneficially owned, as of
August 13, 2001, approximately 47% of the outstanding shares of Mitchell common
stock, including shares covered by outstanding options. They will be entitled to
receive the same consideration as all other Mitchell stockholders.

     Devon's directors and executive officers did not beneficially own any
shares of Mitchell common stock as of August 13, 2001.

DEVON'S FINANCING OF THE MERGER

     Devon currently intends to finance the cash portion of the merger
consideration with funds that Devon expects to obtain using traditional
financing sources. Devon anticipates finalizing the terms of, and definitive
documentation for, the financing prior to completing the merger. Devon's
obligation to complete the merger is not subject to any financing condition.

DISSENTERS' RIGHTS OF APPRAISAL

  Mitchell Stockholders

     Any stockholder of record of Mitchell may exercise dissenters' rights of
appraisal in connection with the merger by properly complying with the
requirements of Articles 5.11, 5.12 and 5.13 of the Texas Business Corporation
Act. If you are a Mitchell stockholder and you want to exercise your dissenters'
rights, you must follow the required procedure set forth in Articles 5.11, 5.12
and 5.13 of the Texas Business Corporation Act exactly or you may lose your
right to dissent from the merger.  The information that follows is a general
summary of dissenters' rights available to Mitchell stockholders. It is
qualified by and not a substitute for the provisions of Articles 5.11, 5.12 and
5.13 of the Texas Business Corporation Act, the full text of which is attached
as Annex G. Mitchell stockholders should read Annex G in its entirety for more
complete information concerning their right to dissent from the merger.

     Mitchell stockholders of record who follow the procedures set forth in
Articles 5.11, 5.12 and 5.13 of the Texas Business Corporation Act will be
entitled to demand that Devon purchase their shares of Mitchell common stock for
a purchase price in cash equal to the fair value of their shares. Under Texas
law, fair value of shares for purposes of the exercise of dissenters' rights is
defined as the value of the shares as of the day immediately preceding the day
the vote is taken approving the merger agreement, excluding any appreciation or
depreciation in value of the shares in anticipation of the proposed merger.

     In order to be entitled to exercise dissenters' rights, you must file a
written objection to the merger with Mitchell prior to the date of the Mitchell
meeting. The written objection must state that you will exercise your right to
dissent if the merger becomes effective and give your address where notice of
the effectiveness of the merger should be delivered or mailed. Mitchell
stockholders who desire to exercise their dissenter's rights should send this
written objection to Mitchell Energy & Development Corp., P.O. Box 4000, The
Woodlands, Texas 77387-4000, Attention: General Counsel. Neither a proxy nor a
vote against the merger is sufficient to constitute a written objection as
required under the Texas Business Corporation Act.

     If the merger is approved by the Mitchell stockholders and subsequently
becomes effective, within 10 days of the effectiveness of the merger, Devon must
deliver or mail notice of the effectiveness of the merger to each dissenting
stockholder that did not vote in favor of the merger. Any dissenting stockholder
that did not vote to approve the merger agreement may then make a written demand
on Devon for the payment of the fair value of the stockholder's shares within 10
days from the delivery or mailing of the notice by Devon. The failure to vote
against approval of the merger agreement will not constitute a waiver of your
right to dissent. Such demand must state the number and class of shares of
Mitchell stock owned by the dissenting stockholder and the dissenting
stockholder's estimate of the fair value of the dissenting stockholder's
Mitchell stock. Any dissenting stockholder that fails to make such a demand
within the 10-day period will lose the right to dissent and will be bound by the
terms of the merger. In order to preserve dissenters' rights, within 20 days of
making a demand for payment, a dissenting stockholder must also submit such
dissenting stockholder's Mitchell stock certificates to Devon for the
appropriate notation of the demand. Devon, at its option, may terminate the
dissenting stockholder's rights under Article 5.12 of the Texas Business
Corporation Act for failure to submit the Mitchell stock certificates within the
20-day period unless a court of competent jurisdiction directs otherwise upon a
showing to the court that there is good and sufficient cause.

     Within 20 days of receipt of a proper demand for payment by a dissenting
stockholder, Devon must deliver or mail to the dissenting stockholder written
notice that either (1) Devon accepts the amount the dissenting stockholder
claimed and agrees to pay the amount of the stockholder's demand within 90 days
after the effectiveness of the merger upon receipt of the dissenting
stockholder's duly endorsed Mitchell stock certificates or (2) (A) contains an
estimate by Devon of the fair value of the dissenting stockholders' Mitchell
stock and (B) includes an offer to pay the amount of Devon's estimate upon
receipt of the dissenting stockholder's duly endorsed Mitchell stock
certificates within 90 days after the effectiveness of the merger, provided that
Devon receives notice from the stockholder within 60 days after the effective
date of the merger that the dissenting stockholder agrees to accept Devon's
estimate. If the

dissenting stockholder and Devon agree upon the value of the dissenting
stockholder's shares within 60 days after effectiveness of the merger, Devon
must pay the amount of the agreed value to the dissenting stockholder upon
receipt of the dissenting stockholder's duly endorsed Mitchell stock
certificates within 90 days of the effectiveness of the merger. Upon payment of
the agreed value, the dissenting stockholder will no longer have any interest in
such shares of Mitchell or in Devon.

     If the dissenting Mitchell stockholder and Devon do not agree on the value
of the dissenting stockholder's shares within 60 days after the effectiveness of
the merger, then either the dissenting stockholder or Devon may, within 60 days
after the expiration of that 60-day period, file a petition in a court of
competent jurisdiction in the county in Texas where the principal office of
Mitchell is located (Montgomery County), seeking a determination of the fair
value of the dissenting stockholder's shares. Devon must file with the court a
list of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares with whom an
agreement as to value has not been reached within 10 days following receipt of a
petition filed by a dissenting stockholder or upon the filing of such a claim by
Devon. The clerk of the court will give notice of the hearing of any such claim
to Devon and to all of the dissenting stockholders on the list provided by
Devon. All dissenting stockholders notified in this manner and Devon will be
bound by the final judgment of the court as to the value of the shares.

     In considering such a petition, the court will determine which of the
dissenting Mitchell stockholders have complied with the provisions of the Texas
Business Corporation Act and are entitled to the payment of the fair value of
their shares and will appoint one or more qualified appraisers to determine the
fair value of the shares who are directed to make such determination "upon such
investigation as to them may seem proper." The appraisers will also allow the
dissenting stockholders and Devon to submit to them evidence as to the fair
value of the shares.

     Upon receipt of the appraisers' report, the court will determine the fair
value of the shares of the dissenting stockholders and will direct the payment
to the dissenting stockholders of the amount of the fair value of their Mitchell
shares, with interest from the date 91 days after the effectiveness of the
merger to the date of the judgment, by Devon, upon receipt of the dissenting
stockholder's Mitchell stock certificates. Upon payment of the judgment, the
dissenting stockholders will no longer have any interest in such Mitchell shares
or in Devon. The court will allow the appraisers a reasonable fee as court costs
and will allocate all court costs between the parties in such manner as it
determines to be fair and equitable.

     Any dissenting stockholder may withdraw his or her demand at any time
before receiving payment for the shares or before a petition has been filed
seeking determination of the fair value of the shares. No dissenting stockholder
may withdraw his or her demand after payment has been made or, unless Devon
consents to the withdrawal, where a petition has been filed.

     Any dissenting stockholder who has properly demanded payment for his or her
shares of Mitchell stock will not have any rights as a stockholder, except the
right to receive payment for such shares and the right to claim that the merger
and the related transactions were fraudulent.

     For a discussion of the tax consequences of exercising dissenters' rights,
please see "Certain Federal Income Tax Considerations -- Exercise of Dissenters'
Rights of Appraisal."

     If you are a Mitchell stockholder who is considering dissenting from the
merger, we urge you to consult with legal counsel.

  Devon Stockholders

     Devon stockholders are not entitled to dissenters' rights of appraisal in
connection with the merger.

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

     Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and the rules promulgated thereunder by the
Federal Trade Commission, the merger cannot be completed until notifications
have been given and certain information has been furnished to the Federal Trade
Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of

Justice and specified waiting period requirements have been satisfied. Devon and
Mitchell filed notification and report forms under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act
with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division on             ,
2001. The waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act will expire at 11:59
p.m., Eastern Time, on           , 2001, unless a request for additional
information or documentary material is made by the Department of Justice or
Federal Trade Commission before that time or the waiting period is terminated
earlier.

     At any time before or after completion of the merger, the Antitrust
Division or the Federal Trade Commission or any state could take such action
under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public
interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, to rescind
the merger or to seek divestiture of particular assets of Devon or Mitchell.
Private parties also may seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws
under certain circumstances. In addition, non-United States governmental and
regulatory authorities may seek to take action under applicable antitrust laws.
A challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds may be made and, if such a
challenge is made, it is possible that Devon and Mitchell will not prevail.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The following is a summary of the material terms of the merger agreement.
It is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of
which is attached as Annex A. You should read the merger agreement because it,
and not this document, is the legal document that governs the merger.

STRUCTURE OF THE MERGER

     At the effective time of the merger, Mitchell will merge with and into
Devon NewCo Corporation, a newly formed, nominally capitalized Delaware
corporation that is wholly owned by Devon. Devon NewCo Corporation will be the
surviving corporation in the merger, and the surviving corporation will be
wholly owned by Devon.

     The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Devon NewCo Corporation
immediately before the effective time of the merger will be the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation until duly amended. The
directors of Devon NewCo Corporation at the effective time of the merger will be
the directors of the surviving corporation. In addition, at the effective time
of the merger, J. Todd Mitchell, or a substitute designee of Mitchell, will be
appointed to fill a vacancy on Devon's board of directors. See "The
Merger -- Interests of Mitchell's Executive Officers and Directors in the
Merger -- Appointment of Mitchell's Designee to Devon's Board of Directors."

WHEN THE MERGER BECOMES EFFECTIVE

     Mitchell and Devon NewCo Corporation will execute and file a certificate of
merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and articles of merger with the
Texas Secretary of State on the first business day after the day on which the
last condition to completing the merger is satisfied or waived or at such other
time as Devon and Mitchell may agree. The merger will become effective at the
time and on the date on which those documents are filed or such other time and
date on which the parties agree and specify in those documents. That time is
referred to as the "effective time of the merger."

CONVERSION OF STOCK, STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER AWARDS

     At the effective time of the merger:

     - each outstanding share of Mitchell common stock, other than (1) shares
       owned or held by Devon, Devon NewCo Corporation, Mitchell or their
       respective subsidiaries, including treasury stock, and (2) shares held by
       Mitchell stockholders who validly exercise their dissenters' rights under
       Texas law, will be converted into the right to receive $31.00 in cash and
       0.585 of a share of Devon common stock;

     - shares of Mitchell common stock held by Mitchell stockholders who
       exercise their dissenters' rights under Texas law will be treated as
       described under "The Merger -- Dissenters' Rights of Appraisal," assuming
       that those stockholders validly exercise their dissenters' rights; and

     - shares of Mitchell common owned or held by Devon, Devon NewCo
       Corporation, Mitchell or their respective subsidiaries, including
       treasury stock, will be canceled.

     If, before the effective time of the merger, the issued and outstanding
shares of Devon or Mitchell common stock are changed into a different number of
shares as a result of a reclassification, stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend, stock distribution or similar event, an appropriate adjustment
will be made to the consideration to be received by the Mitchell stockholders.

     Each outstanding option to purchase Mitchell common stock granted under
Mitchell's stock plans that is unexercised as of the effective time of the
merger will vest and will be converted automatically at the effective time of
the merger into, and will become, a fully vested option to purchase 1.20 shares
of Devon common stock for each share of Mitchell common stock covered by the
option before the merger. After conversion, the exercise price per share of
Devon common stock subject to each option will equal

the pre-conversion exercise price per share of Mitchell common stock subject to
each option, divided by 1.20. Bonus units issued by Mitchell will be similarly
converted into Devon bonus units.

     For a description of Devon's or Mitchell's common stock and a description
of the comparative rights of holders of Devon common stock and Mitchell common
stock, see "Comparison of the Rights of Mitchell and Devon Stockholders."

EXCHANGE OF SHARES; FRACTIONAL SHARES

     Exchange Agent.  At or prior to the effective time of the merger, Devon
will deposit with the exchange agent, for the benefit of the holders of Mitchell
common stock, an amount in cash and certificates representing Devon common stock
sufficient to effect the conversion of Mitchell common stock into the cash and
stock consideration to be paid in the merger. Devon will also make funds
available to the exchange agent from time to time after the effective time of
the merger as needed to pay any cash instead of fractional shares or any
dividends or other distributions declared by Devon on its common stock with a
record date after the effective time of the merger and a payment date on or
before the date the relevant Mitchell stock certificate was surrendered.

     At the effective time of the merger, the stock transfer books of Mitchell
will be closed and no further issuances or transfers of shares of Mitchell
common stock will be made. If, after the effective time, valid Mitchell stock
certificates are presented to the surviving corporation for any reason, they
will be cancelled and exchanged as described above to the extent allowed by
applicable law.

     Exchange of Shares.  If you own Mitchell common stock, promptly after the
merger, but in no event more than three business days following the effective
time of the merger, the exchange agent will mail to you a transmittal letter and
instructions explaining how to surrender your certificates to the exchange
agent.

     Mitchell stockholders who surrender their stock certificates to the
exchange agent, together with a properly completed and signed transmittal letter
and any other documents required by the instructions to the transmittal letter,
will receive:

     - Devon common stock certificates representing the number of shares to
       which each holder is entitled in accordance with the 0.585 exchange
       ratio; and

     - after giving effect to any required tax withholdings, a check in the
       aggregate amount of:

      - $31.00 per share of Mitchell common stock surrendered to the exchange
        agent;

      - the amount of cash being paid in lieu of fractional shares of Devon
        common stock; and

      - any cash dividends and any other dividends or other distributions
        declared by Devon on its common stock with a record date after the
        effective time of the merger and a payment date on or before the date
        the relevant Mitchell stock certificate was surrendered.

     If you have a Mitchell stock certificate, you should surrender that
certificate for exchange after the effective time of the merger. Until you
surrender your Mitchell stock certificates, dividends or other distributions
declared with a record date after the effective time of the merger will accrue,
but will not be paid, on shares of Devon common stock that you are entitled to
receive as a result of the conversion of your shares of Mitchell common stock.
When you surrender your certificates, any unpaid dividends or other
distributions will be paid, less the amount of any withholding taxes that may be
required. No interest will be paid or accrued on:

     - the $31.00 in cash being paid per share of Mitchell common stock
       surrendered to the exchange agent;

     - the amount of cash being paid in lieu of fractional shares of Devon
       common stock; or

     - any cash dividends and any other dividends or other distributions
       declared by Devon on its common stock with a record date after the
       effective time of the merger and a payment date on or before the date the
       relevant Mitchell stock certificate was surrendered.

     The exchange agent will deliver to Devon any shares of Devon common stock
to be issued in the merger or funds set aside by Devon to pay the cash
consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares in connection with the merger
or to pay dividends or other distributions on shares of Devon common stock to be
issued in the merger that are not claimed by former Mitchell stockholders within
180 days after the effective time of the merger. Thereafter, Devon will act as
the exchange agent and former Mitchell stockholders may look only to Devon for
payment of their shares of Devon common stock, cash consideration, cash in lieu
of fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions. None of Devon, the
surviving corporation, the exchange agent or any other person will be liable to
any former Mitchell stockholder for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

     If any certificates for shares of Devon common stock are to be issued in a
name other than that in which the Mitchell common stock certificate surrendered
in exchange for such shares is registered, the person requesting the exchange
must (1) pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of
certificates for shares of Devon common stock in a name other than that of the
registered holder of the certificate surrendered or (2) establish to the
satisfaction of Devon or the exchange agent that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable.

     MITCHELL STOCK CERTIFICATES SHOULD NOT BE RETURNED WITH THE ENCLOSED PROXY
CARD. A TRANSMITTAL LETTER AND ACCOMPANYING INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE PROVIDED TO
MITCHELL STOCKHOLDERS FOLLOWING THE MERGER.

     Fractional Shares.  No fractional shares of Devon common stock will be
issued to Mitchell stockholders. Instead of fractional shares, each Mitchell
stockholder otherwise entitled to a fractional share will receive, in cash and
without interest, an amount representing the fractional share, rounded to the
nearest one-hundredth of a share, multiplied by the average closing price of
Devon common stock as reported in the Wall Street Journal, Southwestern edition,
on the five trading days immediately prior to the last business day before the
effective time of the merger.

     Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.  If a Mitchell stock certificate
has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the exchange agent will issue the
consideration properly payable in accordance with the merger agreement, without
interest, upon receipt of (1) an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
the certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed and (2) appropriate and customary
indemnification or the posting of a bond in the form customarily required by
Devon to indemnify against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such certificate.

      - in the case of the Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. opinion, no gain or loss will
        be recognized by Mitchell or its stockholders to the extent that they
        receive Devon common stock, and, in the case of the Mayer, Brown & Platt
        opinion, no gain or loss will be recognized by any corporation that is a
        party to the merger.

     Waiver of Conditions.  Either Devon or Mitchell may choose to complete the
merger even though a condition to that company's obligation has not been
satisfied if the necessary stockholder approvals have been obtained and the law
allows the company to do so.

     Other Agreements Relating to the Period Before the Effective Time.  The
merger agreement contains additional agreements between Devon and Mitchell
relating to, among other things:

     - the preparation, filing and distribution of this document and Devon's
       filing of the registration statement of which this document is a part;

     - the required recommendations by each company's board of directors to
       their respective stockholders;

     - convening and holding the Devon and Mitchell stockholders meetings;

     - access to information and cooperation regarding filings with governmental

     - using their reasonable best efforts to satisfy the conditions to closing;

     - Mitchell refraining from, without Devon's prior written consent,
       committing to any divestitures, licenses, hold separate agreements or
       similar matters, and Mitchell using its reasonable best efforts to effect
       any such divestitures, licenses, hold separate arrangements or similar
       matters as Devon may request, if such actions are contingent on the
       consummation of the merger;

     - Devon's ability to enter into agreements with respect to other business
       combinations, except where those agreements would not be reasonably
       likely to prevent or delay the satisfaction of any of the conditions to
       the merger;

     - public announcements;

     - the listing on the American Stock Exchange of the Devon common stock to

     - if requested by either Devon or Mitchell, the delivery of "comfort
       letters" from Devon's and Mitchell's independent accountants;

     - actions or omissions that would result in the merger not qualifying as a
       reorganization under section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code; and

     - the coordination of dividend record and payment dates so that Mitchell
       stockholders do not fail to receive a dividend in any calendar quarter or
       receive dividends on both Mitchell common stock and Devon common stock
       received in the merger in any calendar quarter.

     Employee Benefits.  The merger agreement provides that Devon will honor
Mitchell's employee benefit plans and commitments entered into prior to the date
of the merger agreement, provided that Devon may modify any such plan or
commitment in accordance with its terms, subject to some exceptions.
Specifically, Devon has agreed to, among other things:

     - continue retiree medical benefits for former Mitchell employees receiving
       such benefits at the effective time of the merger and provide
       substantially equivalent retiree medical benefits, upon termination, for
       Mitchell employees that become or remain full-time employees of Devon,
       referred to as continuing employees, who have attained the age of 55 and
       have had 10 years of service with Mitchell at the effective time of the
       merger;

     - for at least one year after the effective time of the merger, provide to
       continuing employees severance benefits at least as favorable as those
       provided by Mitchell; and

     - for at least one year after the effective time of the merger, either (1)
       continue Mitchell's defined benefit pension plan and supplemental
       retirement plans for continuing employees or (2) provide benefits under
       another Devon defined benefit pension plan, and for at least 13 months
       after the effective time of the merger, not amend the form of payment
       provisions in Mitchell's supplemental retirement plans.

     In addition, if Devon materially modifies the benefits of continuing
employees within two years of the effective time of the merger, Devon has agreed
to provide those employees for the remainder of such two-year period with
benefits, other than stock options and stock appreciation rights, no less
favorable than those provided to similarly situated Devon employees. Mitchell
employees that become participants in Devon's employee benefit plans will be
given credit under the plans for their prior service with Mitchell for purposes
of eligibility, vesting and benefit determination.

     Affiliate Agreements.  Mitchell has agreed to use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its affiliates, as defined by Rule 145 under the Securities Act
of 1933, to enter into written agreements prior to the effective time of the
merger that restrict their ability to sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise
dispose of any shares of Devon common stock issued to them in connection with
the merger, except:

     - in compliance with Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933;

     - pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act
       of 1933; or

     - in reliance upon a written opinion of counsel delivered to Devon, in a
       form and substance reasonably acceptable to Devon, to the effect that
       such sale, pledge, transfer or other disposition is exempt from
       registration under the Securities Act of 1933.

     Indemnification and Insurance.  For a period of six years after the merger,
Devon will cause the surviving corporation to indemnify and hold harmless to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable law each person who is, or has been at
any time prior to the effective time of the merger, an officer or director of
Mitchell and each person who served at the request of Mitchell as a director,
officer, trustee or fiduciary of another entity. Those persons will be
indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by law against all losses, including
fees and expenses of counsel, arising out of or pertaining to actions taken by
them, or failures to act, while serving in those capacities, whether claimed
before or after the effective time of the merger.

     The surviving corporation will maintain directors' and officers' liability
insurance for six years after the effective time of the merger to cover persons
who are or were covered by Mitchell's existing directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies at any time before the effective time of the
merger. The terms of the insurance will be substantially no less advantageous to
such persons than the existing insurance with respect to acts or omissions prior
to the effective time of the merger. However, the surviving corporation will not
be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 250% of the last annual premium
paid by Mitchell, but will be required to purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for such amount. Devon has the right to cause Mitchell's
directors and officers liability insurance to be extended by obtaining a
six-year "tail" policy on terms no less advantageous than Mitchell's existing
directors and officers liability insurance.

     Other Acquisition Proposals.  In the merger agreement, Mitchell has agreed
that it and its subsidiaries:

     - will not, and will not permit any of their officers, directors,
       employees, agents or representatives to, solicit, initiate or encourage
       any inquiry, proposal or offer for a third-party tender offer, merger,
       consolidation, business combination or similar transaction involving 10%
       or more of Mitchell's assets or capital stock, taken as a whole, or
       participate in any discussions or negotiations concerning such an
       acquisition proposal; and

     - will immediately cease any existing negotiations with any third parties
       with respect to any of the above transactions, except that Mitchell or
       its board of directors may respond publicly to a third-party tender offer
       as required by the federal securities laws or provide information prior
       to the vote of its stockholders on a confidential basis to any person, or
       have negotiations or discussions with any person, who makes an
       unsolicited bona fide acquisition proposal, provided that:

      - Mitchell (1) provides notice to Devon within 24 hours that it has
        received the unsolicited request for information or an acquisition
        proposal identifying the person requesting the information or making the
        acquisition proposal and stating the material terms and conditions of
        the acquisition proposal, and (2) continues to provide updates as to
        material developments within 24 hours;

      - Mitchell's board of directors in good faith (1) after consultation with
        its financial advisors and taking into account the likelihood of
        consummation, determines that the acquisition proposal is reasonably
        likely to result in a transaction that is more favorable from a
        financial point of view to Mitchell stockholders than the merger, and
        (2) after consultation with its outside legal counsel, determines that
        the failure to respond to the information request or to engage in
        discussions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under
        applicable law; and

      - Mitchell may not enter into any agreement with respect to an acquisition
        proposal prior to the termination of the merger agreement.

     Prior to the effective time of the merger, the board of directors of Devon
or Mitchell may withdraw or change its original recommendation to stockholders
to vote for the merger, or recommend that stockholders vote instead for a
superior acquisition proposal, but only if the board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable law.

TERMINATION

     Before the effective time of the merger, the merger agreement may be
terminated:

     - by mutual written consent of Devon and Mitchell;

     - by either Devon or Mitchell, in either case upon payment, if applicable,
       of the termination fee described below, if:

      - the merger is not consummated by March 13, 2002, so long as the party
        seeking to terminate did not prevent the merger from occurring by
        failing to perform or observe its obligations under the merger agreement
        in any material respect;

      - 20 days elapse after the meeting of the Mitchell stockholders at which
        the stockholders fail to approve the merger agreement; or

      - 20 days elapse after the meeting of the Devon stockholders at which the
        stockholders fail to approve the issuance of shares of Devon common
        stock in the merger.

     - by either Devon or Mitchell, if there is a legal prohibition to closing
       the merger that has become final and non-appealable, so long as the party
       seeking termination has used its reasonable best efforts to remove the
       prohibition;

     - by Mitchell, after consultation with its legal advisors, if:

      - Devon breaches any of its representations, warranties or agreements in
        the merger agreement or if any representation or warranty of Devon
        becomes untrue resulting in a condition of the merger not being
        satisfied, and the breach is not cured within 30 days, provided that
        Mitchell is not also in material breach of the merger agreement; or

      - Devon's board of directors withdraws, modifies or changes, in a manner
        adverse to Mitchell, its approval or recommendation of the merger, or
        resolves to do so; or

     - by Devon, after consultation with its legal advisors, if:

      - Mitchell breaches any of its representations, warranties or agreements
        in the merger agreement or if any representation or warranty of Mitchell
        becomes untrue resulting in a condition of the merger not being
        satisfied, and the breach is not cured within 30 days, provided that
        Devon is not also in material breach of the merger agreement; or

      - Mitchell's board of directors withdraws, modifies or changes, in a
        manner adverse to Devon, its approval or recommendation of the merger or
        recommends an acquisition proposal, or resolves to do so.

TERMINATION FEES AND EXPENSES

     Termination Fees and Expenses Potentially Payable by Mitchell.  Mitchell
has agreed to pay Devon a $100 million termination fee and to reimburse Devon
for expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement up to a maximum of
$10 million if either of the following circumstances occurs:

     - Devon terminates the merger agreement after Mitchell's board of directors
       has (1) withdrawn, modified or changed, in a manner adverse to Devon, its
       approval or recommendation of the merger or (2) recommended an
       acquisition proposal, or resolves to do either; or

     - Devon or Mitchell terminates the merger agreement after a person publicly
       makes, or publicly announces an intention to make, an acquisition
       proposal for Mitchell prior to or at the time of the Mitchell meeting
       and, at the time of such termination, (1) the Devon stockholders have
       approved the issuance of Devon common stock in the merger and (2) the
       Mitchell stockholders have not approved the merger agreement.

     Termination Fees and Expenses Potentially Payable by Devon.  Devon has
agreed to pay Mitchell a $100 million termination fee and reimburse Mitchell for
expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement up to a maximum of $10
million if either of the following circumstances occurs:

     - Mitchell terminates the merger agreement after Devon's board of directors
       has withdrawn, modified or changed, in a manner adverse to Mitchell, its
       approval or recommendation of the merger, or resolves to do so; or

     - Devon or Mitchell terminates the merger agreement after a person publicly
       makes, or publicly announces an intention to make, an acquisition
       proposal for Devon prior to or at the time of the Devon meeting and, at
       the time of such termination, (1) the Mitchell stockholders have approved
       the merger agreement and (2) the Devon stockholders have not approved the
       issuance of Devon common stock in the merger.

     If either company fails to promptly pay any termination fee due and, in
order to obtain payment, the other party commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the party owing the termination fee, the party owing the
termination fee must pay to the other party its costs and expenses in connection
with the suit, together with interest on the termination fee from the date
payment was required until the date such payment is made at the annual prime
lending rate of The Chase Manhattan Bank in effect on the date the payment was
required to be made, plus 1%.

     Other Expenses.  All costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
merger agreement and related transactions will be paid by the party incurring
them, except that termination fees and expenses will be paid as described above.

AMENDMENT; EXTENSION AND WAIVER

     Amendment.  Subject to the next sentence, the merger agreement may be
amended at any time with the consent of Devon's board of directors and
Mitchell's board of directors. If the merger agreement has been approved by the
Devon stockholders and the Mitchell stockholders, then no amendment can be made

that by law requires the further approval of stockholders without obtaining such
further stockholder approval.

     Extension and Waiver.  At any time prior to the effective time of the
merger, each of Devon and Mitchell may, to the extent permitted by law, (1)
grant the other party additional time to perform its obligations under the
merger agreement, (2) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other party and (3) waive compliance with any agreements or
conditions for the benefit of that party.

     AGREEMENTS AMONG DEVON, GEORGE P. MITCHELL AND CYNTHIA WOODS MITCHELL

     The following is a summary of the material terms of the agreements that
Devon entered into with George P. Mitchell and Cynthia Woods Mitchell in
connection with the merger agreement. This summary is qualified in its entirety
by reference to those agreements, copies of which are attached as Annexes B and
C. You should read those agreements because they, and not this document, are the
legal documents that govern the matters described in this section. Mr. and Mrs.
Mitchell collectively beneficially own approximately 47% of the outstanding
shares of Mitchell common stock, including shares covered by outstanding
options.

PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT CONTAINING A VOTING AGREEMENT AND AN
IRREVOCABLE PROXY

     Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell have agreed, among other things, to vote, and have
granted Devon an irrevocable proxy to vote, the shares of Mitchell common stock
beneficially owned by them in favor of the approval of the merger agreement and
against any action that would result in a breach of any covenant, representation
or warranty or any other obligation of Mitchell in the merger agreement or of
Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell in the principal shareholders agreement. Mr. and Mrs.
Mitchell have also agreed, except as otherwise agreed to in writing by Devon, to
vote, and have granted Devon an irrevocable proxy to vote, against:

     - any extraordinary corporate transactions involving Mitchell, including
       any merger, consolidation or other business combination;

     - any sale, lease or transfer of a significant part of Mitchell's assets,
       or any reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution or liquidation of
       Mitchell;

     - any change in the persons that comprise Mitchell's board of directors,
       unless approved in advance by at least a majority of Mitchell's directors
       who were directors on August 13, 2001;

     - any change in Mitchell's capitalization or any amendment to Mitchell's
       articles of incorporation or bylaws;

     - any other material change in Mitchell's corporate structure or business;
       and

     - any other action or proposal involving Mitchell that is intended or
       expected to prevent, impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or adversely
       affect the merger.

     Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell have also agreed that, except for pledges in
existence on August 13, 2001 and transfers to any trust, estate, family
partnership, foundation or charitable organization that agrees to be bound by
the terms of the principal shareholders agreement, not to sell, transfer,
tender, pledge, encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of the shares of Mitchell
common stock beneficially owned by them.

     The voting agreement and irrevocable proxy granted to Devon by Mr. and Mrs.
Mitchell will terminate on the earliest to occur of: (1) August 13, 2003; (2)
the termination of the agreement with the mutual consent of Devon and Mr. and
Mrs. Mitchell; (3) the effective time of the merger; and (4) the termination of
the merger agreement (A) by Devon for any reason or (B) by Mitchell because any
of the conditions to Mitchell's obligation to complete the merger is not and
cannot be satisfied, other than the condition that the merger agreement be
approved by the required vote of Mitchell stockholders.

     The principal shareholders agreement was entered into as an inducement to
Devon to enter into the merger agreement and as a condition to Devon's
willingness to do so. Together with the termination fees provided for in the
merger agreement, the principal shareholders agreement may have the effect of
discouraging a third party from proposing a competing transaction, including one
that might be more favorable than the merger to Mitchell stockholders.

INVESTOR RIGHTS AGREEMENT

     The investor rights agreement contains restrictions on Mr. and Mrs.
Mitchell's ability to sell or otherwise dispose of the Devon common stock that
they will receive in the merger. Specifically, Mr. and

Mrs. Mitchell have agreed not to sell, other than pursuant to an underwritten
registered offering or to certain permitted transferees, the Devon common stock
that they will receive in the merger for nine months after the effective time of
the merger. After that date, Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell have agreed not dispose of
more than 1,000,000 shares of Devon common stock in any calendar quarter,
subject to the same exceptions.

     In the investor rights agreement, Devon has granted Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell
the right to demand registration on two separate occasions of the shares of
Devon common stock that they will receive in the merger and the right to
"piggyback" registration of those shares in the event that Devon effects a
registration for other reasons. Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell's registration rights are
subject to customary restrictions such as blackout periods and limitations on
the number of shares to be included in any underwritten offering imposed by the
managing underwriter. All registration expenses, other than underwriting
discounts, selling commissions, stock transfer taxes and Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell's
legal fees, will be paid by Devon.

            DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE COMBINED COMPANY

DIRECTORS

     Devon's charter divides Devon's board of directors into three classes. At
each annual meeting, Devon stockholders elect the members of one of the three
classes to three-year terms. Immediately following the merger, Devon expects
that the board of directors of the combined company will consist of the
following 10 members:

                                                                CURRENT BOARD   EXPIRATION

                   CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

     The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger. This summary is based on the current provisions of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), its legislative
history, administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and Treasury
regulations, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive
effect. This summary does not purport to be a complete discussion of all U.S.
federal income tax considerations relating to the merger and does not address
the tax consequences of the merger under state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. In
addition, this summary may not apply, in whole or in part, to particular
categories of holders of Mitchell common stock, such as financial institutions,
dealers in securities, insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, investment
companies, foreign taxpayers, domestic stockholders whose "functional currency"
is not the U.S. dollar, holders holding Mitchell common stock as a part of a
hedging, conversion or straddle transaction, individuals who acquired Mitchell
common stock pursuant to employee stock options and other special status
taxpayers. Moreover, Mitchell stockholders should be aware that the Code
contains limitations on the extent to which a holder may deduct capital losses
from ordinary income, and the federal income tax rate for individual holders on
long-term capital gains may be significantly lower than the rate imposed on
ordinary income or short-term capital gains. Finally, a tax ruling from the
Internal Revenue Service has not been requested. THIS SUMMARY IS INCLUDED FOR
GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY. ALL HOLDERS OF MITCHELL COMMON STOCK ARE URGED TO
CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS TO DETERMINE THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE
MERGER, INCLUDING ANY ESTATE, GIFT, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES.

     It is a condition to closing of the merger that each of Devon and Mitchell
receive an opinion as of the closing from its respective tax counsel that the
merger will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a reorganization
within the meaning of sections 368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(2)(D) of the Code. The
tax opinions will be based in part on factual representations made by Devon,
Devon NewCo Corporation and Mitchell. If those representations are inaccurate,
the tax opinions could become invalid. Although Devon and Mitchell expect, based
on conditions as they exist as of the date of this document, to be able to
obtain the tax opinions, there can be no assurance that they will be able to do
so. The tax opinions will not be binding on the Internal Revenue Service, and
there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service will not contest the
conclusions expressed in the tax opinions. The discussion below assumes that the
merger will be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of sections
368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(2)(D) of the Code. In general, based on that assumption,
Mitchell stockholders will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income
tax purposes as a result of the merger, except to the extent of cash received in
the merger.

TAX TREATMENT OF THE COMPANIES AND MITCHELL STOCKHOLDERS

     No gain or loss will be recognized by Devon, Devon NewCo Corporation or
Mitchell as a result of the merger. Mitchell stockholders, who will receive a
combination of Devon common stock and cash in exchange for Mitchell common stock
in the merger, will not be permitted to recognize any loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. Holders will recognize gain, if any, equal to the lesser of
(1) the amount of cash received or (2) the amount of gain "realized" in the
transaction. The amount of gain a holder "realizes" will equal the amount by
which (1) the cash plus the fair market value at the effective time of the
merger of the Devon common stock received exceeds (2) the holders' basis in the
Mitchell common stock to be surrendered in exchange therefor. The tax treatment
of recognized gain is described under the next heading below. The tax basis of
the shares of Devon common stock received by a holder will be the same as the
basis of the shares of Mitchell common stock surrendered in exchange therefor,
increased by the amount of gain recognized in the merger and decreased by the
amount of cash received in the merger. The holding period for shares of Devon
common stock received by the holder will include the holder's holding period for
the Mitchell common stock surrendered in exchange therefor, provided that such
shares were held as capital assets of the holder at the effective time of the
merger.

     A holder's U.S. federal income tax consequences will also depend on whether
his or her shares of Mitchell common stock were purchased at different times at
different prices. If they were, the holder could realize gain with respect to
some of the shares of Mitchell common stock and loss with respect to other
shares. Such holder would have to recognize gain to the extent that the holder
receives cash with respect to those shares in which the holder's adjusted tax
basis is less than the amount of cash plus the fair market value at the
effective time of the merger of the Devon common stock received, but could not
recognize loss with respect to those shares in which the holder's adjusted tax
basis is greater than the amount of cash plus the fair market value at the
effective time of the merger of the Devon common stock received. Any disallowed
loss would be included in the adjusted basis of the Devon common stock. Such a
holder is urged to consult his or her own tax advisor respecting the tax
consequences of the merger to that holder.

TREATMENT OF CASH

     The character of income of a holder of Mitchell common stock attributable
to cash received in the merger is determined by reference to the rules of
sections 356(a)(2) and 302 of the Code and, except in atypical circumstances, it
is expected under these rules that holders will recognize capital gain rather
than dividend income. Under section 356(a)(2) of the Code, each holder of
Mitchell common stock will be treated for tax purposes as if such holder had
received only Devon common stock in the merger and, immediately thereafter,
Devon had redeemed an appropriate portion of Devon common stock in exchange for
the cash actually distributed to the holder in the merger. Under section 302 of
the Code, all of the cash representing gain recognized by a holder on the
exchange will be taxed as capital gain if the deemed redemption from the holder
(1) is a "substantially disproportionate redemption" of stock with respect to
the holder or (2) is "not essentially equivalent to a dividend" taking into
account, in either case, certain constructive ownership rules described below
and all other deemed redemptions. Under section 318 of the Code, a holder may be
considered to constructively own, after the merger, Devon common stock owned
(and in some cases constructively owned) by certain members of the holder's
family or certain entities in which the holder has an ownership or beneficial
interest and Devon common stock that the holder (or such individuals or
entities) has the right to acquire upon the exercise of options. This gain or
loss will be a long-term capital gain or loss if the holder's holding period is
more than twelve months at the effective time of the merger. Under current law,
the maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains realized by an individual is
20%.

     The deemed redemption of a holder's Devon common stock will be a
"substantially disproportionate redemption" if, as a result of the deemed
redemption, there is a greater than 20% reduction in (1) the percentage of all
then-outstanding shares of Devon common stock then owned by the holder and (2)
the percentage of the voting power of all then-outstanding shares of Devon
common stock represented by all Devon common stock then owned by the holder.

     The deemed redemption of a holder's Devon common stock will be "not
essentially equivalent to a dividend" if the holder experiences a "meaningful
reduction" in his or her proportionate equity interest in Devon by reason of the
deemed redemption. In general, there are no fixed rules for determining when a
"meaningful reduction" has occurred. However, based on a published ruling of the
Internal Revenue Service, the receipt of cash in the merger would not be
characterized as a dividend if the holder's percentage stock ownership interest
in Devon and Mitchell prior to the merger is minimal, the holder exercises no
control over the affairs of Devon or Mitchell, and the holder's percentage
equity interest in Devon is reduced in the deemed redemption to any extent.

     If neither of the redemption tests described above is satisfied, a holder
will be treated as having received a dividend equal to the amount of the
holder's recognized gain (as described in the preceding heading), assuming that
the holder's ratable share of the accumulated earnings and profits of Mitchell
(or possibly the total earnings and profits of Mitchell and Devon) equals or
exceeds such recognized gain.

EXERCISE OF DISSENTERS' RIGHTS OF APPRAISAL

     The transaction will be a taxable event for a holder who perfects his or
her dissenters' rights of appraisal under Texas law and receives solely cash in
exchange for his or her shares. Such a holder should generally recognize capital
gain or loss, provided that the holder's shares were held by the holder as
capital assets at the effective time of the merger, equal to the difference
between the amount of cash received and the holder's tax basis in the shares
surrendered.

BACKUP WITHHOLDING; INFORMATION REPORTING

     The cash payments due to a holder on the exchange of Mitchell common stock
in the merger, other than certain exempt persons or entities, will be subject to
"backup withholding" for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless certain
requirements are met. Devon or a third-party paying agent, as the case may be,
must withhold approximately 30% of the cash payments to a holder, unless the
holder (1) is a corporation or comes within certain other exempt categories and,
when required, demonstrates this fact, or (2) provides Devon or a third-party
paying agent, as the case may be, with his or her taxpayer identification number
and completes a form in which he or she certifies that he or she has not been
notified by the IRS that he or she is subject to backup withholding as a result
of a failure to report interest and dividends. The taxpayer identification
number of an individual is his or her Social Security number. Any amount paid as
backup withholding will be credited against the holder's U.S. federal income tax
liability. On account of receiving Devon common stock in the merger, holders
must also comply with the information reporting requirements of the Treasury
regulations under section 368 of the Code. Appropriate documentation for the
foregoing purposes will be provided to holders by the exchange agent.

          COMPARISON OF THE RIGHTS OF MITCHELL AND DEVON STOCKHOLDERS

     The rights of Mitchell stockholders are currently governed by Texas law,
Mitchell's restated articles of incorporation, as amended, and Mitchell's
bylaws. Upon completion of the merger, Mitchell stockholders will become Devon
stockholders and their rights as Devon stockholders will be governed by Delaware
law, Devon's restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, Devon's amended
and restated bylaws and Devon's rights plan, dated as of August 17, 1999, as
amended, between Devon and BankBoston, N.A. (now known as EquiServe Trust
Company, N.A.) relating to the rights to purchase shares of Devon common stock.

     The following is a summary of material differences between the rights of
Mitchell stockholders and the rights of Devon stockholders. It is not a complete
summary of the provisions affecting, and the differences between, the rights of
Mitchell stockholders and Devon stockholders. The identification of specific
differences is not meant to indicate that other equally or more significant
differences do not exist. The summary is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the Texas Business Corporation Act; the Delaware General Corporation Law;
Mitchell's restated articles of incorporation, as amended; Mitchell's bylaws;
Devon's restated certificate of incorporation, as amended; Devon's amended and
restated bylaws; and Devon's rights plan. We refer to Devon's restated
certificate of incorporation, as amended, as "Devon's charter," and to
Mitchell's restated articles of incorporation, as amended, as "Mitchell's
charter" in the summary.

                                   STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mitchell                                       Devon

 Mitchell does not have a rights plan.          Under Devon's rights plan, holders of Devon
                                                common stock have one right with respect to
                                                each share of Devon common stock held. The
                                                certificates representing outstanding shares
                                                of Devon common stock also evidence one right
                                                for each share. Currently, the rights trade
                                                with the shares of Devon common stock. Upon
                                                the occurrence of events generally associated
                                                with an unsolicited takeover attempt of Devon
                                                or transactions involving a change of
                                                control, the rights will be distributed, will
                                                become exercisable and will be tradeable
                                                separately from Devon common stock.
                                                If a person or group becomes the beneficial
                                                owner of, or commences a tender or exchange
                                                offer for, 15% or more of the voting shares
                                                of Devon, then each right would entitle the
                                                holders other than the acquiring person or
                                                group to purchase Devon common stock having a
                                                market value equal to twice the applicable
                                                purchase price.
                                                The rights do not become exercisable as a
                                                result of a stock acquisition by a tender or
                                                exchange offer for all outstanding shares of
                                                Devon common stock that is determined by the
                                                independent directors of Devon to be fair,
                                                not inadequate and otherwise in the best
                                                interest of Devon and its stockholders.
                                                The rights have some anti-takeover effects.
                                                They will cause substantial dilution to a
                                                person or group that attempts to acquire
                                                Devon in a manner that causes the rights to
                                                become exercisable. The rights may be
                                                redeemed by Devon's board of directors for
                                                $0.01 per right. The terms of the rights plan
                                                may be amended by Devon's board of directors
                                                without the consent of the holders of the
                                                Devon common stock or the rights.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

     Devon and Mitchell have made forward-looking statements in this document
and in the documents incorporated by reference into this document, which are
subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are based on the beliefs
and assumptions of our managements and on the information currently available to
them.

     Statements and calculations concerning oil and natural gas reserves and
their present value also are forward-looking statements in that they reflect the
determination, based on estimates and assumptions, that oil and natural gas
reserves may be profitably exploited in the future. When used or referred to in
this document or the documents incorporated by reference into this document,
these forward-looking statements may be preceded by, followed by or otherwise
include the words "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans,"
"estimates," "projects" or similar expressions, or statements that certain
events or conditions "will" or "may" occur. Forward-looking statements in this
document also include:

     - statements regarding Devon's expectation that the merger will be
       accretive to its reserves per share, production per share, cash margin
       per share and earnings per share;

     - statements relating to the cost savings that Devon anticipates from the
       merger;

     - statements regarding the number and location of undrilled well locations
       and planned wells;

     - statements relating to future reserve replacement;

     - statements with respect to various actions to be taken or requirements to
       be met in connection with completing the merger or integrating Devon and
       Mitchell after the merger; and

     - statements relating to revenue, income and operations of the combined
       company after the merger.

     These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of factors and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
described in the forward-looking statements. The

following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially
from those described in the forward-looking statements:

     - expected cost savings from the merger may not be fully realized or
       realized within the expected time frame;

     - revenue of the combined company following the merger may be lower than
       expected;

     - assumptions about energy markets, production levels, reserve levels,
       operating results, competitive conditions, technology, the availability
       of capital resources and capital expenditure obligations may prove to be
       incorrect;

     - changes may occur in the supply and demand for oil, natural gas, NGLs and
       the other products or services provided or consumed by our companies;

     - changes may occur in the price of oil, natural gas, NGLs and the other
       products or services provided or consumed by our companies;

     - costs or difficulties related to obtaining regulatory approvals for
       completing the merger and, following the merger, to the integration of
       the businesses of Devon and Mitchell, may be greater than expected;

     - general economic conditions, either internationally or nationally or in
       the jurisdictions in which Devon or Mitchell is doing business, may be
       less favorable than expected;

     - legislative or regulatory changes, including changes in environmental
       regulation, may adversely affect the businesses in which Devon and
       Mitchell are engaged;

     - there may be environmental risks and liability under federal, state and
       foreign environmental laws and regulations; and

     - changes may occur in the securities or capital markets.

     Except for its ongoing obligations to disclose material information as
required by the federal securities laws, neither Devon nor Mitchell has any
intention or obligation to update these forward-looking statements after it
distributes this document.

                        COMMONLY USED OIL AND GAS TERMS

     The following are abbreviations and definitions of terms commonly used in
the oil and gas industry and in this document:

     "Bbl" means one stock tank barrel, or 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume of oil
or NGLs.

     "Bcf" means one billion cubic feet.

     "Boe" means barrel of oil equivalent, determined by using the ratio of one
Bbl of oil or NGLs to six Mcf of natural gas.

     "gross acres" or "gross wells" means the total acres or number of wells in
which a working interest is owned.

     "MBbls" means one thousand Bbls.

     "MBoe" means one thousand Boe.

     "Mcf" means thousand cubic feet.

     "Mcfe" means one thousand cubic feet equivalent of natural gas, determined
using the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of oil or NGLs.

     "MMBbls" means one million Bbls.

     "MMBoe" means one million Boe.

     "MMcf" means one million cubic feet.

     "MTBE" means methyl tertiary butyl ether.

     "net acres" or "net wells" means the sum of the fractional working
interests owned in gross acres or gross wells.

     "NGL" or "NGLs" means natural gas liquids.

     "oil" includes crude oil and condensate.

     "Proved reserves" are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas
and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable
certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing
economic and operating conditions (i.e., prices and costs as of the date the
estimate is made). Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices
provided only by contractual arrangements, but not on escalations based on
future conditions.

          (1) Reservoirs are considered proved if economic producibility is
     supported by either actual production or conclusive formation test. The
     area of a reservoir considered proved includes:

             (A) that portion delineated by drilling and defined by gas-oil
        and/or oil-water contacts, if any; and

             (B) the immediately adjoining portions not yet drilled, but which
        can be reasonably judged as economically productive on the basis of
        available geological and engineering data. In the absence of information
        on fluid contacts, the lowest known structural occurrence of
        hydrocarbons controls the lower proved limit of the reservoir.

          (2) Reserves that can be produced economically through application of
     improved recovery techniques (such as fluid injection) are included in the
     "proved" classification when successful testing by a pilot project, or the
     operation of an installed program in the reservoir, provides support for
     the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based.

          (3) Estimates of proved reserves do not include the following:

             (A) oil that may become available from known reservoirs but is
        classified separately as "indicated additional reserves;"

             (B) crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, the recovery of which is
        subject to reasonable doubt because of uncertainty as to geology,
        reservoir characteristics or economic factors;

             (C) crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, that may occur in undrilled
        prospects; and

             (D) crude oil, natural and NGLs, that may be recovered from oil
        shales, coal, gilsonite and other such sources.

     "Tcfe" means one trillion cubic feet equivalent of natural gas, determined
by using the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of oil or NGLs.

               UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     The following unaudited pro forma combined financial information has been
prepared to assist in your analysis of the financial effects of the merger. This
pro forma information is based on the historical financial statements of Devon
and Mitchell and should be read in conjunction with those historical financial
statements and related notes, which are incorporated by reference into this
document.

     The pro forma information is based on the estimates and assumptions set
forth in the notes to such information. The pro forma information is preliminary
and is being furnished solely for information purposes and, therefore, is not
necessarily indicative of the results of operations or financial position that
might have been achieved for the dates or periods indicated, nor is it
necessarily indicative of the results of operations or financial position that
may occur in the future.

     The information was prepared based on the following:

     - Devon uses the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas
       activities, while Mitchell uses the successful efforts method. Pro forma
       adjustments have been made to estimate the effect of converting
       Mitchell's successful efforts method to Devon's full cost method.

     - Devon will account for the merger using the purchase method of
       accounting.

     - The unaudited pro forma balance sheet has been prepared as if the merger
       occurred on June 30, 2001. The unaudited pro forma statements of
       operations have been prepared as if the merger occurred on January 1,
       2000.

     - In the six-month period ended June 30, 2001, Devon recognized a $49.5
       million after-tax gain from the cumulative effect of a change in
       accounting principle. This related to Devon's adoption, as of January 1,
       2001, of a new accounting principle related to accounting for derivative
       financial instruments. The $49.5 million gain is not included in the
       unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations for the six months
       ended June 30, 2001.

     - We have not reflected as an adjustment to the historical data annual cost
       savings of approximately $20 million that Devon expects to result from
       the elimination of duplicate expenses after the merger.

     No pro forma adjustments have been made with respect to the following
unusual items. These items are reflected in the historical results of Devon or
Mitchell, as applicable, and should be considered when making period-to-period
comparisons:

     - In 2000, Devon recognized $60.4 million of expenses related to its merger
       with Santa Fe Snyder Corporation. Devon accounted for the Santa Fe Snyder
       merger using the pooling-of-interests method of accounting and,
       therefore, the expenses incurred related to the merger were expensed. The
       after-tax effect of these expenses in 2000 was $37.2 million.

     - In 2000, Mitchell realized income tax savings of $12.8 million related to
       prior years' Section 29 tax credits and $6.3 million related to the
       reversal of prior years' deferred income taxes.

     - In 2000, Mitchell recognized a $4.8 million gain from the exchange of
       certain gas services assets. Also in 2000, Mitchell recognized a $10.8
       million impairment expense related to other gas services assets. Net of
       tax, these two events reduced Mitchell's 2000 net earnings by $3.8
       million.

     - During the second quarter of 2001, Devon elected to discontinue
       operations in Malaysia, Qatar and on certain properties in Brazil.
       Accordingly, during the second quarter of 2001, Devon recorded a $76.9
       million charge associated with the impairment of those properties. The
       after-tax effect of this reduction was $62.1 million.

     - Mitchell has incentive compensation plans pursuant to which it has
       periodically issued awards referred to as "bonus units" under which
       employees can earn compensation based on increases in the market price of
       Mitchell common stock. Mitchell generally awards these bonus units in
       lieu of stock option grants. Pro forma general and administrative
       expenses reported in the accompanying

       unaudited pro forma statements of operations for the year 2000 include
       $21.3 million of expense related to these plans, while pro forma general
       and administrative expenses for the first six months of 2001 include a
       credit in the amount of $4.1 million related to these plans. After taxes,
       these plans had the effect of decreasing 2000 unaudited pro forma net
       earnings by $13.8 million and increasing net earnings for the first half
       of 2001 by $2.7 million. Devon will not issue such bonus units after the
       merger.

     - Devon's historical results of operations for the year 2000 and the first
       half of 2001 include $41.3 million and $16.9 million, respectively, of
       amortization expense for goodwill related to previous mergers. As of
       January 1, 2002, in accordance with new accounting pronouncements
       recently issued, such goodwill will cease to be amortized and, instead,
       will be tested for impairment at least annually. No goodwill amortization
       expense has been recognized in the pro forma statements of operations for
       the goodwill related to the merger.

          NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
                      DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND JUNE 30, 2001

1. METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR THE MERGER

     Devon will account for the merger using the purchase method of accounting
for business combinations. Accordingly, Mitchell's assets acquired and
liabilities assumed by Devon will be revalued and recorded at their estimated
"fair values." In the merger, Devon will pay $31.00 in cash and issue 0.585 of a
share of Devon common stock for each outstanding share of Mitchell common stock.
On a pro forma basis, assuming that the merger had occurred on June 30, 2001,
this would have resulted in Devon paying approximately $1.5 billion in cash and
issuing approximately 29.2 million shares of its common stock to Mitchell
stockholders.

     The purchase price of Mitchell's net assets acquired will be based on the
total value of the cash paid and the Devon common stock issued to the Mitchell
stockholders. The value of the Devon common stock issued is based on the average
closing price of Devon's common stock for a period of three days before and
after the public announcement of the merger. This average closing price equaled
$50.95 per share.

2. PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE MERGER

     The unaudited pro forma balance sheet includes the following adjustments:

          (a) This entry adjusts the historical book values of Mitchell's assets
     and liabilities to their estimated fair values as of June 30, 2001. The
     calculation of the total purchase price and the preliminary allocation to
     assets and liabilities are shown below.

                                                                (IN THOUSANDS,

   NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION -- (CONTINUED)

     The total purchase price includes the value of the cash and Devon common
stock to be issued to Mitchell stockholders. The total purchase price also
includes:

     - $90.0 million of estimated merger costs. These costs include investment
       banking expenses, severance, legal and accounting fees, printing expenses
       and other merger-related costs. These costs have been added to current
       liabilities in the unaudited pro forma balance sheet.

     - $76.5 million of Devon employee stock options to be issued in exchange
       for existing vested Mitchell employee stock options. The value of these
       options is added to additional paid-in capital in the unaudited pro forma
       balance sheet.

     The purchase price allocation is preliminary and is subject to change due
to several factors, including: (1) changes in the fair values of Mitchell's
assets and liabilities as of the effective time of the merger; (2) the actual
merger costs incurred; (3) the number of Mitchell shares and stock options
outstanding as of the effective time of the merger; and (4) changes in Devon's
valuation estimates that may be made between now and the effective time of the
merger. These changes will not be known until after the effective time of the
merger. However, Devon does not believe that the final purchase price allocation
will differ materially from the estimated allocation presented herein.

          (b) This adjustment includes a $5.4 million reduction of common stock,
     a $149.3 million reduction of additional paid-in capital, a $752.9 million
     reduction of retained earnings, an $8.9 million reduction of accumulated
     other comprehensive loss and an $87.1 million reduction of treasury stock.
     These adjustments eliminate the historical book value of Mitchell's
     stockholders' equity.

          (c) This adjustment increases long-term debt by $1.5 billion to
     include the long-term debt that Devon expects to issue to fund the cash
     portion of the merger consideration. It also includes $14.9 million of
     costs estimated to be incurred in connection with issuing this debt.

     The unaudited pro forma statements of operations include the following
adjustments:

          (d) This adjustment increases historical depreciation, depletion and
     amortization to reflect the adjustment of Mitchell's assets from historical
     book value to fair value and a change to the full cost accounting method
     from the successful efforts method.

          (e) This adjustment increases interest expense due to the $1.5 billion
     of long-term debt that Devon expects to issue to fund the cash portion of
     the merger consideration. This adjustment has been calculated using an
     estimated interest rate on the debt of 7.08%, plus the amortization of
     estimated financing costs to be incurred. This assumed interest rate is
     based on quotes obtained from financial advisors of the current rate that
     would apply to the debt based on Devon's current credit rating.

          (f) This adjustment eliminates historical amounts recognized by
     Mitchell under the successful efforts accounting method that are not
     recognized as expenses under the full cost accounting method.

          (g) This adjustment records the income tax impact of all pro forma
     adjustments at an effective tax rate of approximately 38%.

4. GOODWILL

     The preliminary allocation of the purchase price includes approximately
$1.2 billion of goodwill. In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Statement No. 141, "Business Combinations," and Statement No. 142,
"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." As a result of these two recent
pronouncements, goodwill recorded in connection with business combinations
completed after June 30, 2001 (including the merger) will not be amortized but,
instead, will be tested for impairment at least annually. Accordingly, the
accompanying unaudited pro forma statements of operations include no
amortization of the goodwill to be recorded in the merger.

     Statement No. 142 will be adopted by Devon as of January 1, 2002. Until
that date, goodwill recognized from business combinations completed prior to
June 30, 2001 must continue to be amortized. Therefore, Devon's historical
goodwill amortization related to previous mergers has not been reversed in the
accompanying unaudited pro forma statements of operations. As of January 1,
2002, goodwill related to these previous mergers will no longer be amortized
but, instead, will be tested for impairment at least annually. The accompanying
unaudited pro forma statements of operations for the year ended December 31,
2000 and the six months ended June 30, 2001 include amortization of goodwill
related to previous mergers of $41.3 million and $16.9 million, respectively.

     As indicated in Note 2, the allocation of the purchase price presented is
preliminary. At the effective time of the merger, or shortly thereafter, Devon
will finalize the purchase price allocation. Prior to that time, Devon may
determine that there are intangible assets acquired in the merger separate and
apart from goodwill. To the extent that such intangible assets, if any, have
definite useful lives, the value assigned to those intangible assets would be
amortized over such lives. Although the amount allocated to such intangible
assets, if any, will not be known until the effective time of the merger, Devon
does not believe that any such value, or the related amortization, would have a
material effect on the unaudited pro forma financial information presented
herein.

5. DEVON AND MITCHELL HISTORICAL AND RECLASSIFIED BALANCES

     Devon and Mitchell record certain revenue and expenses differently in their
respective consolidated financial statements. To make the unaudited pro forma
financial information consistent, we have reclassified certain of Devon's and
Mitchell's balances to conform presentation.

     Devon's historical balances for other revenue have been reclassified to
include separate line items for gas services revenue and gas services costs and
expenses to conform to Mitchell's presentation and Devon's expected presentation
subsequent to the merger.

     The following tables present Mitchell's balances as presented in its
historical financial statements and the reclassified balances that are included
in the accompanying unaudited pro forma statements of operations.

     Natural gas gathering and marketing margins (natural gas gathering and
marketing revenue less natural gas gathering and marketing costs and expenses)
were unusually high in the periods presented in the above table. After the
merger, Devon expects the combined company's natural gas gathering and marketing
margin to approximate between $30 million and $40 million per year.
