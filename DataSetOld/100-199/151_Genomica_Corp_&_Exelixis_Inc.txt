[EXELIXIS LOGO]                  EXELIXIS, INC.

                               OFFER TO EXCHANGE
                       OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

                                       OF

                              GENOMICA CORPORATION
                                      FOR

                             SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

                                       OF

                                 EXELIXIS, INC.
     THE EXCHANGE OFFER AND WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS WILL EXPIRE AT 12:00 MIDNIGHT, NEW
YORK CITY TIME, ON FRIDAY, DECEMBER 28, 2001, UNLESS THE EXCHANGE OFFER IS
EXTENDED. SHARES TENDERED PURSUANT TO THE EXCHANGE OFFER MAY BE WITHDRAWN AT ANY
TIME BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER, BUT NOT DURING ANY SUBSEQUENT
OFFERING PERIOD.
     On November 19, 2001, we entered into a merger agreement with Genomica
Corporation. We are making this offer as part of the proposed merger with
Genomica. The Genomica board of directors has unanimously approved the merger
agreement, determined that the exchange offer and the merger together are fair
to, and in the best interests of, Genomica stockholders and recommends that
Genomica stockholders accept the exchange offer and tender their shares pursuant
to the exchange offer.
     Through our wholly owned subsidiary Bluegreen Acquisition Sub, Inc., we are
hereby offering, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
document and in the enclosed letter of transmittal, to exchange a portion of a
share of Exelixis common stock determined pursuant to an exchange ratio,
described below, for each outstanding share of Genomica common stock that is
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn on or before the expiration date of
the exchange offer.
     The exchange ratio is a number equal to the quotient obtained by dividing
the Genomica common stock value, determined as described below, by the greater
of (i) $13.30285 or (ii) the average closing sales price of Exelixis common
stock on the Nasdaq National Market during the 18 trading-day period ending two
trading days before the initial expiration of the exchange offer (as reported in
The Wall Street Journal, or if not reported in The Wall Street Journal, any
other authoritative source). The Genomica common stock value will be determined
by dividing $110.0 million by the sum of the number of shares of Genomica common
stock and Genomica preferred stock plus the number of shares of Genomica common
stock issuable upon the exercise of all stock options and warrants with a per
share exercise price of $5.00 or less, each as outstanding as of the date that
we first accept shares of Genomica common stock for payment pursuant to the
exchange offer.

     On December 26, 2001, we fixed the Exelixis common stock price for use in
computing the exchange ratio. The exact exchange ratio will be calculated based
upon $15.88556, the average closing sales price of Exelixis common stock on the
Nasdaq National Market during the 18 trading-day period ended on December 26,
2001.

     Our obligation to exchange Exelixis common stock for Genomica common stock
in the exchange offer is subject to the conditions listed in the section
entitled "Certain Terms of the Merger Agreement -- Conditions to the Exchange
Offer."
     If the exchange offer is consummated, it will be followed by a merger of
Bluegreen Acquisition Sub into Genomica in which shares of Genomica common stock
not tendered in the exchange offer will be converted into the right to receive
shares of Exelixis common stock at the same exchange ratio as used in the
exchange offer, unless the holder properly perfects his or her appraisal rights,
if available, under Delaware law. After completion of the merger, Genomica will
be a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelixis.
     Exelixis common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the
symbol "EXEL," and Genomica common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market
under the symbol "GNOM."
     SEE "RISK FACTORS" BEGINNING ON PAGE 17 FOR A DISCUSSION OF IMPORTANT
FACTORS THAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER IN CONNECTION WITH THE EXCHANGE OFFER.
     WE ARE NOT ASKING YOU FOR A PROXY NOR SHOULD YOU SEND US A PROXY.  Any
request for proxies will be made only pursuant to separate proxy solicitation
materials complying with the requirements of Section 14(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.

commission has approved or disapproved of the securities to be issued under this

              QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION

 1.  Q:  WHAT ARE EXELIXIS AND GENOMICA PROPOSING?

     A:  Exelixis proposes to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Genomica
         common stock, including the associated preferred stock purchase rights.
         Currently, there are no shares of Genomica preferred stock outstanding.
         We have entered into a merger agreement with Genomica in which we are
         offering to exchange shares of Exelixis common stock for all of the
         outstanding shares of Genomica common stock, including the associated
         preferred stock purchase rights. If the exchange offer is completed,
         Bluegreen Acquisition Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelixis, will
         merge with Genomica. As a result of the exchange offer and the merger,
         Genomica will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelixis.

 2.  Q:  WHAT WILL I RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY SHARES OF GENOMICA COMMON STOCK?

     A:  You will be entitled to receive a portion of a share of Exelixis common
         stock in exchange for each share of Genomica common stock that you
         validly tender in the exchange offer based on an exchange ratio
         described below. The exchange offer will be followed by a merger in
         which Exelixis common stock will be issued at the same exchange ratio.
         For a complete description of the exchange ratio, see "The
         Transaction -- The Exchange Ratio" on page 30.

 3.  Q:  HOW CAN I FIND OUT THE FINAL EXCHANGE RATIO?

     A:  The final exchange ratio is a number equal to the quotient obtained by
         dividing the Genomica common stock value, determined as described
         below, by the greater of (i) $13.30285 or (ii) the average closing
         sales price of Exelixis common stock on the Nasdaq National Market
         during the 18 trading-day period ending two trading days before the
         initial expiration of the exchange offer (as reported in The Wall
         Street Journal, or if not reported in The Wall Street Journal, any
         other authoritative source). The Genomica common stock value will be
         determined by dividing $110.0 million by the sum of the number of
         shares of Genomica common stock and Genomica preferred stock plus the
         number of shares of Genomica common stock issuable upon the exercise of
         all stock options and warrants with a per share exercise price of $5.00
         or less, each as outstanding as of the date that we first accept shares
         of Genomica common stock for payment pursuant to the exchange offer. We
         will notify you of the final exchange ratio by issuing a press release
         announcing the final exchange ratio and filing that press release with
         the Securities and Exchange Commission. Genomica stockholders can also
         call our information agent, Mellon Investor Services LLC, at any time
         toll free at (866) 323-8159 for the Exelixis average closing sales
         price for the preceding 18 trading days and the exchange ratio that
         would be in effect based on that price. On December 26, 2001, we fixed
         the Exelixis common stock price for use in computing the exchange
         ratio. The exact exchange ratio will be calculated based upon
         $15.88556, the average closing sales price of Exelixis common stock on
         the Nasdaq National Market during the 18 trading-day period ended on
         December 26, 2001. For a table illustrating examples of Exelixis
         average closing sales prices, the resulting exchange ratios and
         illustrations of the approximate value you would receive for your
         Genomica shares, see "The Transaction -- Illustrative Table of Exchange
         Ratios and Value of Exchange Offer/Merger Consideration" beginning on
         page 30.

 4.  Q:  IS THE EXCHANGE OFFER BEING MADE BY EXELIXIS OR BLUEGREEN ACQUISITION
SUB?

     A:  The exchange offer is technically being made by Bluegreen Acquisition
         Sub, which we formed specifically for the purpose of making the
         exchange offer and otherwise facilitating the transaction. Because
         Bluegreen Acquisition Sub is our wholly owned subsidiary, all of the
         shares of Genomica common stock acquired by Bluegreen Acquisition Sub
         in the exchange offer will actually be beneficially owned and
         controlled by Exelixis. Therefore, although Bluegreen Acquisition Sub
         is technically making the exchange offer and will be a party to the
         merger, when we discuss the exchange offer and the merger, we generally
         refer only to Exelixis.

 5.  Q:  HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO COMPLETE THE EXCHANGE OFFER AND THE MERGER?

     A:  We hope to complete the exchange offer by December 28, 2001. However,
         we may extend the exchange offer if the conditions to the exchange
         offer have not been satisfied at the scheduled expiration date or if we
         are required to extend the exchange offer by the rules of the
         Securities and Exchange Commission. We expect to complete the merger
         shortly after we complete the exchange offer, or, if adoption of the
         merger agreement by Genomica stockholders is required, shortly after
         the special meeting of Genomica stockholders to adopt the merger
         agreement.

 6.  Q:  WILL I HAVE TO PAY ANY BROKERAGE FEES OR COMMISSIONS?

     A:  If you are the record owner of your shares of Genomica common stock and
         you tender your shares in the exchange offer directly to the exchange
         agent, you will not incur any brokerage fees or commissions. If you own
         your shares through a broker or other nominee who tenders the shares on
         your behalf, your broker may charge you a commission for doing so. You
         should consult with your broker or nominee to determine whether any
         charges will apply.

 7.  Q:  DOES GENOMICA SUPPORT THE EXCHANGE OFFER AND THE MERGER?

     A:  Yes. Genomica's board of directors has unanimously determined that the
         exchange offer and the merger are fair to, and in the best interests
         of, Genomica and Genomica stockholders and recommends that Genomica
         stockholders accept the exchange offer and tender their shares pursuant
         to the exchange offer. Genomica's board of directors has also approved
         the merger agreement and the merger. Information about the
         recommendation of Genomica's board of directors is more fully set forth
         under "The Transaction -- Reasons for the Exchange Offer and the
         Merger" beginning on page 36.

 8.  Q:  HOW DO I PARTICIPATE IN THE EXCHANGE OFFER?

     A:  You are urged to read this entire prospectus carefully, and to consider
         how the exchange offer and the merger affect you. Then, if you wish to
         tender your shares of Genomica common stock, you should do the
         following:

         - If you hold your shares in your own name, complete and sign the
           enclosed letter of transmittal and return it with your stock
           certificates to Mellon Investor Services LLC, the exchange agent for
           the exchange offer, at the appropriate address specified on the back
           cover of this prospectus before the expiration date of the exchange
           offer.

         - If you hold your shares in "street name" through a broker, ask your
           broker to tender your shares before the expiration date.

           Alternatively, you may comply with the guaranteed delivery procedures
           set forth in "The Transaction -- Guaranteed Delivery" on page 49.
           Read this prospectus carefully for more information about procedures
           for tendering your shares, the timing of the exchange offer,
           extensions of the exchange offer period and your rights to withdraw
           your shares from the exchange offer before the expiration date.

 9.  Q:  WHEN AND HOW CAN I WITHDRAW TENDERED SHARES?

      A:  You may withdraw any shares you have tendered at any time before the
          time we accept the shares.

          For a withdrawal to become effective, our exchange agent must receive
          a written or facsimile transmission notice of withdrawal before the
          time we accept the shares. In a notice of withdrawal you must specify
          your name, the number of shares to be withdrawn and the name in which
          the certificates are registered, if different from your name. If you
          have delivered to our exchange agent certificates for shares to be
          withdrawn, you must also indicate the serial numbers shown on the
          particular certificates evidencing the shares to be withdrawn.

                                        v

10.  Q:  WHAT ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CONDITIONS TO THE EXCHANGE OFFER?

      A:  Our obligation to accept shares of Genomica common stock for exchange
          in the exchange offer is subject to several conditions, including:

           - a number of shares of Genomica common stock equal to at least the
             sum of a majority of the total number of shares of Genomica common
             stock plus the total number of shares of Genomica common stock
             issuable upon exercise of options to acquire Genomica common stock,
             each as outstanding immediately before the expiration of the
             exchange offer, as it may be extended pursuant to the merger
             agreement, having been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn,
             which is referred to in this prospectus as the "minimum tender
             condition";

           - the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
             Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, or the HSR Act, must have
             expired or been terminated;

           - the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part must
             have been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange
             Commission; and

           - Genomica must have cash, cash equivalents and short-term and
             long-term investments, net of all current liabilities of Genomica,
             totaling at least $108,750,000.

           These and other conditions to the exchange offer are discussed in
           this prospectus in the section entitled "Certain Terms of the Merger
           Agreement -- Conditions to the Exchange Offer" beginning on page 68.

12.  Q:  WHAT HAPPENS IF I DO NOT TENDER MY SHARES OF GENOMICA COMMON STOCK?

      A:  If, after completion of the exchange offer, we own a majority of the
          outstanding shares of Genomica common stock, we intend to complete a
          merger of our wholly owned subsidiary, Bluegreen Acquisition Sub, with
          Genomica. Upon completion of the merger, each share of Genomica common
          stock that has not been tendered and accepted for exchange in the
          exchange offer will be converted into the right to receive a portion
          of a share of Exelixis common stock at the same exchange ratio used in
          the exchange offer, unless you properly perfect your appraisal rights,
          if available, under Delaware law. The appraisal process is discussed
          more fully in the section of this prospectus entitled "The
          Transaction -- Appraisal Rights," beginning on page 56.

13.  Q:  ARE EXELIXIS' BUSINESS, PROSPECTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION RELEVANT TO
         MY DECISION TO TENDER MY SHARES IN THE EXCHANGE OFFER?

      A:  Yes. Shares of Genomica common stock accepted in the exchange offer
          will be exchanged for Exelixis common stock, and therefore, you should
          consider our business and financial condition before you decide to
          tender your shares in the exchange offer. In considering our business
          and financial condition, you should review the documents incorporated
          by reference in this prospectus because they contain detailed
          business, financial and other information about us.

14.  Q:  WILL I BE TAXED ON THE EXELIXIS SHARES I RECEIVE?

      A:  Your receipt of shares of Exelixis common stock in the transaction
          will be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes (except for
          taxes, if any, resulting from the receipt of cash instead of
          fractional shares of Exelixis common stock) if: (i) the transaction is
          completed under the current terms of the merger agreement; (ii) the
          minimum tender condition to the exchange offer is satisfied; and (iii)
          the merger is completed promptly after the exchange offer. Because
          only the satisfaction of the minimum tender condition will be known at
          the time the exchange offer closes, the tax opinions required by
          Exelixis and Genomica will assume that the other conditions will be
          met. If they are not met, the closing of the exchange offer could be
          taxable to you. We urge you to read the information regarding material
          U.S. federal income tax consequences contained in this prospectus
          carefully. Because tax matters are very complicated and because the
          tax consequences will depend on the facts of your own situation, you
          should consult with your tax advisor regarding the consequences of
          participation in the exchange offer and the merger.
                                        vi

15.  Q:  HAS THE EXCHANGE OFFER COMMENCED?

      A:  Yes. The exchange offer commenced on November 29, 2001. At the same
          time we commenced the exchange offer, we filed a registration
          statement covering the shares of Exelixis common stock to be issued in
          exchange for shares of Genomica common stock. You may now tender
          shares of Genomica common stock in accordance with the procedures
          outlined in this prospectus. We cannot, however, accept for exchange
          and pay for any shares tendered in the exchange offer until the
          registration statement is declared effective by the Securities and
          Exchange Commission and the other conditions to the exchange offer
          have been satisfied or, where permissible, waived.

16.  Q:  WHERE CAN I FIND MORE INFORMATION ABOUT EXELIXIS AND GENOMICA?

      A:  You can find more information about Exelixis and Genomica as described
          in the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information"
          beginning on page 102 of this prospectus.

involuntary termination of a significant portion of its workforce.

     Genomica common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the
symbol "GNOM." Genomica maintains a site on the world wide web at
"genomica.com"; however, information found on Genomica's website is not part of

THE TRANSACTION (PAGE 29)

     Exelixis and Genomica are proposing a two-part business combination
transaction, in which Exelixis intends to acquire all of the outstanding shares
of Genomica common stock. In the exchange offer, we are offering to exchange a
portion of a share of Exelixis common stock, as calculated below, for each
outstanding share of Genomica common stock that is validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn on or before the expiration date of the exchange offer. If we
complete the exchange offer, it will be followed by a merger of Bluegreen
Acquisition Sub into Genomica.

     The exchange ratio is a number that is equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing the Genomica common stock value, determined as described below, by the
greater of (i) 13.30285 or (ii) the average closing sales price of Exelixis
common stock on the Nasdaq National Market during the 18 trading-day period
ending two trading days before the initial expiration of the exchange offer (as
reported in The Wall Street Journal, or if not reported in The Wall Street
Journal, any other authoritative source). The Genomica common stock value is
determined by dividing $110.0 million by the sum of the number of shares of
Genomica common stock and Genomica preferred stock plus the number of shares of
Genomica common stock issuable upon the exercise of all stock options and
warrants with a per share exercise price of $5.00 or less, each as outstanding
as of the date that we first accept shares of Genomica common stock for payment
pursuant to the exchange offer. On December 26, 2001, we fixed the Exelixis
common stock price for use in computing the exchange ratio. The exact exchange
ratio will be calculated based upon $15.88556, the average closing sales price
of Exelixis

common stock on the Nasdaq National Market during the 18 trading-day period
ended on December 26, 2001. We will announce the final exchange ratio by issuing
a press release and filing that press release with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Genomica stockholders can also call our information agent, Mellon
Investor Services LLC, at any time toll free at (866) 323-8159 to request
information about the exchange ratio.

     The exchange offer is conditioned on a number of shares of Genomica common
stock equal to at least the sum of a majority of the total number of shares of
Genomica common stock plus the total number of shares of Genomica common stock
issuable upon exercise of options to acquire Genomica common stock, each as
outstanding immediately before the expiration of the exchange offer, as it may
be extended pursuant to the merger agreement, having been validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn. We may not waive this condition without Genomica's
consent. In addition, our obligation to consummate the exchange offer and
deliver shares of Exelixis common stock in exchange for shares of Genomica
common stock pursuant to the exchange offer is subject to several other
conditions referred to below in the section entitled "Certain Terms of the
Merger Agreement -- Conditions to the Exchange Offer" beginning on page 68.

     Promptly after completion of the exchange offer, we intend to merge our
wholly owned subsidiary, Bluegreen Acquisition Sub, with Genomica. Each share of
Genomica common stock which has not been tendered and accepted for exchange in
the exchange offer will be converted in the merger into the right to receive
shares of Exelixis common stock at the same exchange ratio used in the exchange
offer, unless the holder properly perfects his or her appraisal rights, if
available, under Delaware law. We seek to acquire ownership of 100% of the
outstanding shares of Genomica common stock through the exchange offer and the
merger. The exchange offer and the merger are sometimes collectively referred to
in this prospectus as the "transaction."

     We will not issue any fractional shares of common stock in connection with
the exchange offer or the merger. Genomica stockholders will instead receive
cash for any fractional shares otherwise issuable to them.

MARKET PRICE AND DIVIDEND INFORMATION (PAGE 9)

     Exelixis common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the
symbol "EXEL," and Genomica common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market

the public announcement of the exchange offer and the merger, the closing sales

Nasdaq National Market was $3.38. On December 26, 2001, the most recent
practicable date before the filing of this prospectus, the closing sales price
per share of Exelixis common stock on the Nasdaq National Market was $15.50, and

National Market was $4.45.

REASONS FOR THE EXCHANGE OFFER AND THE MERGER (PAGE 36)

     GENOMICA.  Genomica's board of directors believes that the transaction
could result in a number of benefits to Genomica and its stockholders, including
the following:

     - the opportunity for Genomica stockholders to participate in a
       significantly larger and more diversified company and, as stockholders of
       the combined company, to have greater liquidity in their shares and to
       benefit from any future growth of the combined company;

     - the opportunity for Genomica stockholders to receive shares of Exelixis
       common stock in a tax-free exchange at approximately a 33% premium over
       the prevailing market price for shares of Genomica common stock
       immediately before the announcement of the exchange offer;

     - enabling the combined company to benefit from the depth and experience of
       Exelixis' management team and board of directors; and

     - enabling the combined company to benefit from Genomica's software
       products to enhance the effectiveness of Exelixis' research and
       development efforts.

     See the section entitled "The Transaction -- Reasons for the Exchange Offer
and the Merger; Recommendation of Genomica's Board of Directors" beginning on
page 36 of this prospectus, as well as Genomica's Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9, which is being mailed to you together with this
prospectus.

     EXELIXIS.  Our board of directors believes that the transaction could
result in a number of benefits to Exelixis and our stockholders, including the
following:

     - access to additional cash enabling us to fund our research and
       development programs at a higher level to enhance our core technologies
       and expand product development;

     - the opportunity to leverage our infrastructure and technologies to create
       additional corporate collaborations to diversify our business risk and
       increase our future revenue stream; and

     - access to complementary technology and expertise to advance the drug
       discovery and development process at Exelixis.

RECOMMENDATION TO GENOMICA STOCKHOLDERS

     Genomica's board of directors has unanimously approved the merger
agreement, determined that the exchange offer and the merger together are
advisable and fair to and in the best interests of, Genomica and its
stockholders and unanimously recommends that Genomica stockholders accept the
exchange offer and tender their shares pursuant to the exchange offer.
Information about the unanimous recommendation of Genomica's board of directors
is more fully described in Genomica's Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9, which is being mailed to you together with this prospectus.

OPINION OF GENOMICA'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     Genomica's board of directors has received a written opinion, dated
November 19, 2001, from CIBC World Markets Corp., Genomica's exclusive financial
advisor in connection with the exchange offer and the merger, to the effect
that, as of the date of the opinion and based on and subject to the matters
described in its opinion, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of Genomica common stock (other than Exelixis and its
affiliates). The full text of CIBC World Markets' written opinion dated November
19, 2001, which describes the assumptions made, matters considered and
limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as Schedule II to Genomica's
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, which is being mailed
to you together with this prospectus. THE OPINION IS ADDRESSED TO THE GENOMICA
BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION TO ANY STOCKHOLDER
REGARDING WHETHER STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD EXCHANGE SHARES PURSUANT TO THE EXCHANGE
OFFER, OR HOW STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD VOTE OR ACT ON ANY MATTER RELATING TO THE
EXCHANGE OFFER OR THE MERGER.

TIMING OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER

     The exchange offer commenced on November 29, 2001 and is currently
scheduled to expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on December 28, 2001.
However, under certain circumstances the exchange offer may be extended. If we
decide to extend the exchange offer, we will make an announcement regarding that
extension as described under "The Transaction -- Extension, Termination and
Amendment" beginning on page 45.

EXTENSION, TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT (PAGE 45)

     Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, we may extend the exchange
offer for successive extension periods not in excess of 10 business days per
extension if, at the scheduled expiration date of the exchange offer, any
condition to the exchange offer has not been satisfied or, where permissible,
waived. In addition, we are entitled to extend the exchange offer if required by
the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission or the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc. We are not giving any assurance that we will
exercise our right to extend our exchange offer, although we currently intend to
do so until all conditions have been satisfied or, where permissible, waived.
During an extension, all shares of Genomica common stock previously

tendered and not properly withdrawn will remain subject to the exchange offer,
subject to your right to withdraw your shares of Genomica common stock. An
extension of the exchange offer is different than a subsequent offering period.
The effects of a subsequent offering period are described below.

     We reserve the right to make any changes in the terms and conditions of the
exchange offer by giving oral or written notice of the changes to the exchange
agent and by making a public announcement of the changes. However, we cannot
make certain changes that might be adverse to Genomica or its stockholders
without the prior written consent of Genomica.

     We are required to follow any extension, termination, amendment or delay,
as promptly as practicable, with a public announcement. Any announcement about
an extension is required to be issued no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City
time, on the next business day after the previously scheduled expiration date of
the exchange offer. Subject to applicable law, and without limiting the manner
in which we may choose to make any public announcement, we assume no obligation
to publish, advertise or otherwise communicate the public announcement other
than by making a release to the Dow Jones News Service.

SUBSEQUENT OFFERING PERIOD (PAGE 46)

     We may elect to provide a subsequent offering period of not less than three
nor more than 20 business days after the acceptance of shares of Genomica common
stock in the exchange offer if the requirements of Rule 14d-11 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 have been met. You will not have the right to
withdraw any shares of Genomica common stock that you tender during the
subsequent offering period. We are required to accept for exchange, and to
deliver shares of Exelixis common stock in exchange for, shares of Genomica
common stock that are validly tendered promptly after they are tendered during
any subsequent offering period. If we elect to provide a subsequent offering
period, we are required to make a public announcement to that effect no later
than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the next business day after the
previously scheduled expiration date of the exchange offer.

EXCHANGE OF SHARES OF GENOMICA COMMON STOCK; DELIVERY OF SHARES OF EXELIXIS
COMMON STOCK (PAGE 46)

     We are required to accept for exchange, and to deliver shares of Exelixis
common stock in exchange for, shares of Genomica common stock validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn, promptly after the expiration date, upon the terms
and conditions to the exchange offer, including the terms and conditions of any
extension or amendment. In addition, we are required to accept for exchange, and
to deliver shares of Exelixis common stock in exchange for, shares of Genomica
common stock promptly after they are validly tendered during any subsequent
offering period, upon the terms and conditions to the exchange offer, including
the terms and conditions of any extension or termination.

WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS (PAGE 47)

     Your tender of shares of Genomica common stock pursuant to the exchange
offer is irrevocable, except that shares of Genomica common stock tendered
pursuant to the exchange offer may be withdrawn at any time before the time we
first accept tendered shares of Genomica common stock for exchange pursuant to
the exchange offer. Once we have accepted shares of Genomica common stock for
purchase pursuant to the exchange offer, all tenders are irrevocable.

     If we elect to provide a subsequent offering period pursuant to Rule 14d-11
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, you will not have the right to
withdraw shares of Genomica common stock that you tender in the subsequent
offering period.

PROCEDURE FOR TENDERING (PAGE 48)

     The method of tendering your shares in the exchange offer will depend on
whether the shares are held in certificate or book-entry form.

     - If your shares are held in certificate form, you must deliver the
       certificates, a properly completed and duly executed letter of
       transmittal, or a manually executed facsimile of that document, and any
       other required documents to the exchange agent at one of its addresses
       set forth on the back cover of this prospectus. In the circumstances
       detailed in the letter of transmittal, the signatures on the letter of
       transmittal must be guaranteed.

     - If your shares of Genomica common stock are held in book-entry form, the
       shares must be tendered in accordance with the procedures for book-entry
       tender, and the exchange agent must receive a so-called "agent's message"
       and a confirmation of receipt of the tender. The procedures for
       book-entry transfer are described under "The Transaction -- Procedure for
       Tendering" beginning on page 48.

     - If you hold your shares in "street name" through a broker, ask your
       broker to tender your shares before the expiration date.

     In all cases, deliveries to the exchange agent must be made before the
expiration of the exchange offer.

     If your shares are not currently available and you cannot now comply with
the preceding requirements, you can still participate in the exchange offer by
complying with the guaranteed delivery procedures set forth under "The
Transaction -- Guaranteed Delivery" on page 49.

A STOCKHOLDER VOTE MAY BE REQUIRED TO ADOPT THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     If, after completion of the exchange offer, as it may be extended and
including any subsequent offering period, we own 90% or more of the outstanding
shares of Genomica common stock, the merger can be accomplished without a vote
of Genomica stockholders. If, on the other hand, after completion of the
exchange offer, as it may be extended and including any subsequent offering
period, we own more than 50% but less than 90% of the outstanding shares of
Genomica common stock, a meeting of Genomica stockholders and the affirmative
vote by the holders of at least a majority of the shares of Genomica common
stock outstanding on the record date for such meeting will be needed to complete
the merger. If we complete the exchange offer, we will own a majority of the
shares of Genomica common stock outstanding on the record date for the merger,
so adoption of the merger agreement by Genomica stockholders will be assured.

THE STOCKHOLDER TENDER AGREEMENTS (PAGE 73)

     Genomica's directors, officers and affiliated stockholders who have
beneficial ownership of 6,061,663 shares of Genomica common stock in the
aggregate have agreed to tender and not withdraw their shares of Genomica common
stock in the exchange offer. In addition, if certain conditions are met, the
officers, directors and affiliated stockholders of Genomica who are parties to
the stockholder tender agreements may be obligated to exercise options and
warrants to purchase up to 1,114,587 shares of Genomica common stock in the
aggregate and tender the shares issued upon exercise of the options and warrants
if and to the extent necessary to satisfy the minimum tender condition for the
exchange offer.

INTERESTS OF GENOMICA'S OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE TRANSACTION (PAGE 50)

     When you consider Genomica's board of directors' unanimous recommendation
that Genomica stockholders accept the exchange offer and tender their shares in
the exchange offer, you should be aware that some Genomica officers and
directors may have interests in the transaction that may be different from, or
in addition to, their interests as stockholders of Genomica. See the section
entitled "The Transaction -- Interests of Genomica's Officers and Directors in
the Transaction" beginning on page 50 of this prospectus, as well as Genomica's
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, which is being mailed
to you together with this prospectus.

TREATMENT OF GENOMICA STOCK OPTIONS BY EXELIXIS (PAGE 64)

     We are not assuming any outstanding options to purchase Genomica common
stock. Pursuant to the terms of Genomica's stock option plans, all outstanding
options to purchase Genomica common stock that are not assumed in connection
with the consummation of the exchange offer will accelerate and become fully

vested and exercisable. All options to purchase Genomica common stock that are
not exercised on or before the day we accept shares of Genomica common stock for
payment pursuant to the exchange offer will terminate.

LIMITATION ON GENOMICA'S ABILITY TO CONSIDER OTHER ACQUISITION PROPOSALS (PAGE
65)

     Genomica has agreed not to solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action
to encourage or discuss any proposal for a business combination or other similar
transaction involving the acquisition or purchase of (i) more than 20% of any
class of voting securities of Genomica or any of its subsidiaries or (ii)
businesses or assets that account for 20% or more of Genomica's consolidated
assets or involving the liquidation or dissolution of Genomica or any of its
subsidiaries, before completion of the merger unless the other party has made a
written proposal to Genomica, not solicited in violation of the merger
agreement, for a transaction which Genomica's board of directors believes in
good faith, after consultation with a nationally recognized independent
financial advisor, is reasonably likely to be consummated and would, if
consummated, be more favorable to Genomica's stockholders than the transaction
described in this prospectus, provided that a number of other conditions are
satisfied.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT (PAGE 70)

     Exelixis and Genomica can terminate the merger agreement under certain
circumstances, including if the exchange offer is not consummated by March 1,
2002.

EXPENSES (PAGE 72)

     The merger agreement provides that all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement are to be paid by the party incurring such expenses. However,
if the merger agreement is terminated for any reason other than a material
breach of the merger agreement by us, Genomica is required to pay us $750,000
for reimbursement of our fees and expenses.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES (PAGE 52)

     The transaction will qualify as an integrated tax-free reorganization for
U.S. federal income tax purposes if: (i) the transaction is completed under the
current terms of the merger agreement; (ii) the minimum tender condition to the
exchange offer is satisfied; and (iii) the merger is completed promptly after
the exchange offer. If the transaction is a reorganization for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, your receipt of Exelixis common stock in the transaction
will be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes (except for taxes, if any,
resulting from the receipt of cash instead of fractional shares of Exelixis
common stock).

     The above-described tax treatment of the exchange offer and the merger to
Genomica stockholders depends on, among other things, some facts that will not
be known before the completion of the merger. Genomica stockholders are urged to
carefully read the discussion in the section entitled "The Transaction --
Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" beginning on page 52 of
this prospectus. That discussion includes a summary of the material U.S. federal
income tax consequences of participation in the exchange offer and the merger in
the event that the conditions described above are not satisfied.

     TAX MATTERS ARE COMPLICATED, AND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER
AND THE MERGER TO YOU WILL DEPEND ON FACTS OF YOUR OWN SITUATION. YOU SHOULD
CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISORS TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE
EXCHANGE OFFER AND THE MERGER TO YOU.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT (PAGE 55)

     We will account for the merger as a purchase for financial reporting
purposes.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS (PAGE 56)

     Genomica stockholders are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection
with the exchange offer. If, after completion of the exchange offer, as it may
be extended and including any subsequent offering period, we own a majority but
less than 90% of the outstanding shares of Genomica common stock, we have agreed
to effect a long-form merger as permitted under Delaware law, which would
require notice to and adoption of the merger agreement by Genomica stockholders.
Genomica stockholders who have not exchanged their shares of Genomica common
stock in the exchange offer will not have appraisal rights in connection with a
long-form merger unless, on the date fixed to determine stockholders entitled to
vote on the merger agreement, the shares of Genomica common stock are (i) not
listed on a national securities exchange or designated as a national market
system security on an interdealer quotation system by the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc. and (ii) held of record by fewer than 2,000 holders.

     If, however, after completion of the exchange offer, as it may be extended
and including any subsequent offering period, we own 90% or more of the
outstanding shares of Genomica common stock, we have agreed to effect a
short-form merger as permitted under Delaware law. In the event that we complete
the transaction through a short-form merger, stockholders who did not tender, or
who tendered and withdrew, their shares of Genomica common stock in the exchange
offer would have the right under Delaware law to demand appraisal of their
shares of Genomica common stock, but only if they comply with certain statutory
requirements. Stockholders who comply with the applicable statutory procedures
will be entitled to receive a judicial determination of the fair value of their
shares of Genomica common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from
the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, and to receive payment of this
fair value in cash, together with a fair rate of interest. In the event of a
short-form merger, information regarding these requirements will be provided to
Genomica stockholders who have not exchanged their shares of Genomica common
stock in the exchange offer.

REGULATORY APPROVALS (PAGE 55)

     Transactions such as the merger are subject to review by the Department of
Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, to determine whether they
comply with applicable antitrust laws. Under the provisions of the HSR Act the
merger may not be consummated until the specified waiting period requirements of
the HSR Act have been satisfied. Exelixis and Genomica filed premerger
notification reports, together with requests for early termination of the
waiting period, with the Department of Justice and the FTC under the HSR Act on
November 23, 2001, and the waiting period will terminate on December 26, 2001.

     As of December 26, 2001, there were approximately 527 record holders of
Exelixis common stock. As of December 26, 2001, there were approximately 168
record holders of Genomica common stock. Neither Exelixis nor Genomica has ever
paid cash dividends on their respective common stock. Exelixis and Genomica
intend to retain earnings, if any, to support the development of their
respective businesses, and neither anticipates paying cash dividends for the
foreseeable future.

     The following table presents:

     - the closing sales price or the 18 trading-day average closing sales
       price, as indicated, of Exelixis' common stock, as reported on the Nasdaq
       National Market;

     - the closing sales price of Genomica's common stock, as reported on the
       Nasdaq National Market; and

     - the market value based on the closing sales price or the 18 trading-day
       average closing sales price of the fraction of a share of Exelixis common
       stock to be received in exchange for one share of Genomica common stock
       in the exchange offer

in each case as if the exchange ratio had been determined on (i) November 19,
2001, the last full trading day before the public announcement of the proposed
transaction, (ii) December 26, 2001, the last full trading day for which such
information could be practicably calculated before the date of the prospectus
and (iii) December 26, 2001 using the average closing sales price of Exelixis
common stock for the 18 trading days ended on December 26, 2001. The numbers
have been calculated assuming that (i) as of November 19, 2001, the Genomica
common stock value would have been $4.49, the closing sales price of Exelixis
common stock would have been $15.24 and the exchange ratio would have been
 .29490, (ii) as of December 26, 2001, the Genomica common stock value would have
been $4.49, the closing sales price of Exelixis common stock would have been
$15.50 and the exchange ratio would have been .29010 and (iii) as of December
26, 2001, the Genomica common stock value would have been $4.49, the average
closing sales price of Exelixis common stock for the 18 trading days ended on
December 26, 2001 would have been $15.88556 and the exchange ratio would have
been .28306. The assumed Genomica common stock value as of November 19, 2001 is
based on the quotient obtained by dividing $110.0 million by 24,475,490, which
equals the total number of shares of Genomica common stock outstanding as of
November 19, 2001 plus the number of shares of Genomica common stock issuable
upon the exercise of stock options and warrants with a per share exercise price
of $5.00 or less that were outstanding as of November 19, 2001. The assumed
Genomica common stock value as of

December 26, 2001 is based on the quotient obtained by dividing $110.0 million
by 24,463,141, which equals the total number of shares of Genomica common stock
outstanding as of December 26, 2001 plus the number of shares of Genomica common
stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants with a per share
exercise price of $5.00 or less that were outstanding as of December 26, 2001.

             SELECTED HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     The following information is being provided to assist you in analyzing the

normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial
condition at such date and the results of operations for such periods. The
following selected historical consolidated financial data should be read in
conjunction with Exelixis' consolidated financial statements and related notes
incorporated by reference in this prospectus. Historical results are not

(1) Genomica's restructuring plan was adopted subsequent to September 30, 2001,
    and, therefore, Genomica's financial position as of September 30, 2001, and
    its results of operations for the nine months then ended do not reflect the
    effects of this restructuring plan. In its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for
    the three and nine months ended September 30, 2001, Genomica estimated that,
    without regard to any adjustments that would be required by the transaction
    contemplated by this prospectus, it would record charges in the fourth
    quarter of approximately $4.3 million, including $2.6 million of liabilities
    and $1.7 million of asset impairments. For a more detailed description of
    Genomica's restructuring plan and its effect on Genomica's results of
    operations since September 30, 2001, please see "Information Relating to
    Genomica" beginning on page 74, as well as Note 8 to Genomica's Consolidated
    Interim Financial Statements, beginning on page F-32.

      SUMMARY SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

     Exelixis acquired a majority of the outstanding capital stock of Artemis
Pharmaceuticals GmbH and all of the capital stock of Agritope, Inc. on May 14,
2001 and December 8, 2000, respectively. These transactions were accounted for
as purchases. The following unaudited selected pro forma combined financial
information of Exelixis, Genomica, Artemis and Agritope has been derived from
the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, which give
effect to the proposed merger of Exelixis and Genomica and the acquisitions of
Artemis and Agritope as purchases and should be read in conjunction with such
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and the notes
thereto which are included elsewhere in this prospectus.

     For pro forma purposes, (i) Exelixis' unaudited consolidated balance sheet
as of September 30, 2001 has been combined with Genomica's unaudited
consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2001 as if the merger had
occurred on September 30, 2001, (ii) Exelixis' consolidated audited statement of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2000, which includes the results of
Agritope subsequent to the acquisition date of December 8, 2000, has been
combined with Agritope's unaudited consolidated statement of operations for the
period from January 1, 2000 to December 7, 2000 and with Artemis' audited
statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000, (iii) Exelixis'
unaudited consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended
September 30, 2001, which includes the results of operations of Artemis
subsequent to the acquisition date of May 14, 2001, has been combined with
Artemis' unaudited statement of operations for the period from January 1, 2001
to May 13, 2001 and (iv) the Exelixis/Agritope/Artemis unaudited pro forma
condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000,
and the Exelixis/Artemis unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of
operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2001, have been combined with
Genomica's audited consolidated statement of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2000 and unaudited consolidated statement of operations for the
nine months ended September 30, 2001, respectively, as if each merger had
occurred on the first day of each period presented.

     The pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes only and
is not necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial position
that would have occurred if the merger had been consummated on January 1, 2000
or September 30, 2001, respectively, nor is it necessarily indicative of future
operating results or financial position.

(1) Genomica's restructuring plan was adopted subsequent to September 30, 2001,
    and, therefore, Genomica's financial position as of September 30, 2001, and
    its results of operations for the nine months then ended do not reflect the
    effects of the restructuring plan. In its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for
    the three and nine months ended September 30, 2001, Genomica estimated that,
    without regard to any adjustments that would be required by the transaction
    contemplated by this prospectus, it would record charges in the fourth
    quarter of approximately $4.3 million, including $2.6 million of liabilities
    and $1.7 million of asset impairments. For a more detailed description of
    Genomica's restructuring plan and its effect on Genomica's results of
    operations since September 30, 2001, please see "Information Regarding
    Genomica" beginning on page 74 as well as Note 8 to Genomica's Consolidated
    Interim Financial Statements beginning on page F-32.

                       COMPARATIVE PER SHARE INFORMATION

     The information below reflects:

     - the historical net loss and the September 30, 2001 book value per share
       of Exelixis common stock and the historical net loss and the September
       30, 2001 book value per share of Genomica common stock in comparison with
       the unaudited pro forma net loss and the September 30, 2001 book value
       per share after giving effect to the proposed merger of Exelixis with
       Genomica; and

     - the equivalent historical net loss and the September 30, 2001 book value
       per share attributable to an assumed .33784 of a share of Exelixis common
       stock which will be received for each share of Genomica common stock. The
       exchange ratio of .33784 is based on an assumed Genomica common stock
       value of $4.49 and an assumed Exelixis average closing sales price per
       share of $13.30285.

     You should read the following tables in conjunction with the unaudited pro

(1) The historical tangible book value per share is computed by dividing
    stockholders' equity, less goodwill and other intangible assets, by the
    number of common shares outstanding at the end of each period presented.

(2) The Genomica equivalent pro forma combined per share amounts are calculated
    by multiplying the Exelixis combined pro forma share amounts by an assumed
    exchange ratio of .33784. The exchange ratio of .33784 assumes a Genomica
    common stock value of $4.49 and an assumed Exelixis average closing sales
    price per share of $13.30285.

(3) The pro forma combined tangible book value per share is computed by dividing
    pro forma stockholders' equity, less goodwill and other intangible assets,
    by the pro forma number of shares outstanding at the end of the period.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     Genomica stockholders should consider the following matters in deciding
whether to tender shares of Genomica common stock in the exchange offer.
Genomica stockholders should consider these matters in connection with the other
information that we have included or incorporated by reference into this
prospectus.

RISKS RELATED TO THE TRANSACTION

THE SHARES OF EXELIXIS COMMON STOCK TO BE RECEIVED BY GENOMICA STOCKHOLDERS IN
THE TRANSACTION MAY DECREASE IN VALUE AFTER THE EXCHANGE RATIO IS FIXED.

     The exchange ratio is a number equal to the quotient obtained by dividing
the Genomica common stock value, determined as described below, by the greater
of (i) $13.30285 or (ii) the average closing sales price of Exelixis common
stock on the Nasdaq National Market during the 18 trading-day period ending two
trading days before the initial expiration of the exchange offer (as reported in
The Wall Street Journal, or if not reported in The Wall Street Journal, any
other authoritative source). On December 26, 2001, we fixed the Exelixis common
stock price for use in computing the exchange ratio. The exact exchange ratio
will be calculated based upon $15.88556, the average closing sales price of
Exelixis common stock on the Nasdaq National Market during the 18 trading-day
period ended on December 26, 2001. The Genomica common stock value will be
determined by dividing $110.0 million by the sum of the number of shares of
Genomica common stock and Genomica preferred stock plus the number of shares of
Genomica common stock issuable upon the exercise of all stock options and
warrants with a per share exercise price of $5.00 or less, each as outstanding
as of the date that we first accept shares of Genomica common stock for payment
pursuant to the exchange offer. For more information, see the section entitled
"The Transaction -- Illustrative Table of Exchange Ratios and Value of
Offer/Merger Consideration" beginning on page 30.

     After the exchange ratio is fixed, the number of shares that Genomica
stockholders will receive in the transaction will not change, even if the market
price of Exelixis common stock changes. There will be no adjustment to the
exchange ratio or right to terminate the merger agreement, the exchange offer or
the merger based solely on fluctuations in the price of Exelixis common stock
after the exchange ratio has been fixed. In recent years, the stock market has
experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These market fluctuations may
adversely affect the market price of Exelixis common stock. The market price of
Exelixis common stock upon and after completion of the exchange offer or the
merger could be lower than the market price on the date of the merger agreement
or the current market price. You should obtain recent market quotations of
Exelixis common stock before you tender your shares.

IF EXELIXIS AND GENOMICA ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN INTEGRATING THEIR ORGANIZATIONS,
THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE TRANSACTION MAY NOT BE REALIZED.

     If Exelixis and the stockholders of the combined company are to realize the
anticipated benefits of the transaction, the operations of Exelixis and Genomica
must be integrated and combined efficiently. We cannot assure you that the
integration will be successful or that the anticipated benefits of the merger
will be fully realized. Similarly, we cannot guarantee that Genomica
stockholders will achieve greater value through their ownership of Exelixis
common stock than they would have achieved as stockholders of Genomica as a
separate entity. The dedication of our management resources to integration
activities may detract attention from the day-to-day business of the combined
company. This integration may also be more difficult due to our integration
challenges as a result of our recently completed acquisitions or any future
acquisitions. We cannot assure you that there will not be substantial costs
associated with the integration process, that integration activities will not
result in a decrease in revenues or a decrease in the value of Exelixis common
stock or that there will not be other material adverse effects from our
integration efforts.

     In response to recent changes in the market environment for life science
informatics products, Genomica recently adopted a new corporate strategy that
resulted in a restructuring of its operations and a significant workforce
reduction. As a result of this new corporate strategy, Genomica's ability to
develop new and competitive software products may be limited, and Genomica may
not be able to meet the needs of new and existing customers. Because Genomica's
operating history under the new corporate strategy is limited, we

cannot be certain that Genomica will be able to implement it successfully or
that we will be able to integrate our operations and Genomica's operations
efficiently or effectively.

THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE AFFECTED BY FACTORS DIFFERENT FROM
THOSE AFFECTING THE MARKET PRICE OF GENOMICA'S COMMON STOCK.

     Upon completion of the exchange offer and the merger, holders of Genomica
common stock will become holders of our common stock. Our business differs from
that of Genomica, and our results of operations, as well as the market price of
our common stock, may be affected by factors different from those affecting
Genomica's results of operations and the market price of Genomica's common
stock. For a discussion of Exelixis' and Genomica's business and information to
consider in evaluating such businesses, you should review our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended on December 31, 2000, our subsequent
quarterly and current reports, incorporated by reference into this prospectus,
and Genomica's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2000 and its unaudited consolidated interim financial statements for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2001, both of which are included elsewhere
in this prospectus.

SALES OF SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF EXELIXIS COMMON STOCK IN THE OPEN MARKET BY
GENOMICA STOCKHOLDERS COULD DEPRESS EXELIXIS' STOCK PRICE.

     Other than shares held by affiliates of Genomica or Exelixis, shares of
Exelixis common stock that are issued to stockholders of Genomica, including
those shares issued upon the exercise of options, will be freely tradable
without restrictions or further registration under the Securities Act. If the
exchange offer and subsequent merger with Genomica closes and if Genomica
stockholders sell substantial amounts of Exelixis common stock in the public
market following the transaction, the market price of Exelixis common stock
could fall. These sales might also make it more difficult for us to sell equity
or equity-related securities at a time and price that we otherwise would deem
appropriate. Based on an assumed exchange ratio of .28306, calculated using the
average closing sales price of Exelixis common stock during the 18 trading days
ended on December 26, 2001, we will issue up to approximately 6,924,536 shares
of Exelixis common stock in the transaction, of which 2,029,038 are expected to
be issued in exchange for shares, including shares issuable upon exercise of
options and warrants, to stockholders that are subject to a lock-up agreement.
The lock-up agreement provides that the stockholder will not sell or otherwise
transfer or dispose of Exelixis common stock for up to 90 days following the
date we accept shares for payment pursuant to the exchange offer.

THE RECEIPT OF SHARES OF EXELIXIS COMMON STOCK COULD BE TAXABLE TO YOU,
DEPENDING ON FACTS SURROUNDING THE TRANSACTION.

     Exelixis and Genomica have structured the transaction to qualify as an
integrated tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes. As a
condition to the completion of the exchange offer, Exelixis and Genomica are
required to obtain opinions of Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe LLP and Cooley
Godward LLP, respectively, that the transaction will be treated for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as an integrated reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 if: (i) the transaction is
completed under the current terms of the merger agreement; (ii) the minimum
tender condition for the exchange offer is satisfied; and (iii) the merger is
completed promptly after the exchange offer. However, the ability to satisfy
these factual assumptions, and therefore the federal income tax consequences of
the transaction, depends in part on facts that will not be available before the
completion of the transaction. If these factual assumptions are not satisfied, a
Genomica stockholder's exchange of shares of Genomica common stock for shares of
Exelixis common stock in the exchange offer or conversion of shares in the
merger could be a taxable transaction.

RISKS RELATED TO EXELIXIS' BUSINESS

EXELIXIS HAS A HISTORY OF NET LOSSES. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR NET LOSSES,
AND WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE OR MAINTAIN PROFITABILITY.

     We have incurred net losses each year since our inception, including a net
loss of approximately $52.9 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2001. As of that date, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $183.0
million. We expect these losses to continue and anticipate negative cash flow
for the foreseeable future. The size of these net losses will depend, in part,
on the rate of growth, if any, in our license and contract revenues and on the
level of our expenses. Our research and development expenditures and general and
administrative costs have exceeded our revenues to date, and we expect to spend
significant additional amounts to fund research and development in order to
enhance our core technologies and undertake product development. As a result, we
expect that our operating expenses will increase significantly in the near term
and, consequently, we will need to generate significant additional revenues to
achieve profitability. Even if we do increase our revenues and achieve
profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability.

WE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US.

     Our future capital requirements will be substantial and will depend on many
factors including:

     - payments received under collaborative agreements;

     - the progress and scope of our collaborative and independent research and
       development projects;

     - our ability to successfully continue development of a recently acquired
       cancer compound;

     - our need to expand our other proprietary product development efforts as
       well as develop manufacturing and marketing capabilities to commercialize
       products; and

     - the filing, prosecution and enforcement of patent claims.

     We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments and funding to be received from collaborators will enable us to
maintain our currently planned operations for at least the next two years.
Changes to our current operating plan may require us to consume available
capital resources significantly sooner than we expect. For example, our newly
acquired cancer product from our recent relationship with Bristol-Myers Squibb
will require significant resources for development that were not in our
operational plans before acquiring the cancer product. We may be unable to raise
sufficient additional capital when we need it, on favorable terms, or at all. If
our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements, we
will have to raise additional funds. The sale of equity or convertible debt
securities in the future may be dilutive to our stockholders, and debt financing
arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets and enter into covenants
that would restrict our ability to incur further indebtedness. If we are unable
to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms, we may be required to curtail
operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into financing, supply
or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms.

DIFFICULTIES WE MAY ENCOUNTER MANAGING OUR GROWTH MAY DIVERT RESOURCES AND LIMIT
OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS.

     We have experienced a period of rapid and substantial growth that has
placed, and anticipated growth in the future will continue to place, a strain on
our administrative and operational infrastructure. As our operations expand, we
expect that we will need to manage multiple locations, including additional
locations outside of the United States, and additional relationships with
various collaborative partners, suppliers and other third parties. Our ability
to manage our operations and growth effectively requires us to continue to
improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems
and procedures. We may not be able to successfully implement improvements to our
management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and
may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. In addition,
acquisitions involve the integration of different financial and management
reporting systems. We may not be able to successfully integrate the
administrative and operational infrastructure without significant additional
improvements and investments in management systems and procedures.

WE ARE DEPENDENT ON OUR COLLABORATIONS WITH MAJOR COMPANIES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO
ACHIEVE MILESTONES, DEVELOP PRODUCTS OR RENEW OR ENTER INTO NEW COLLABORATIONS,
OUR REVENUES MAY DECREASE AND OUR ACTIVITIES MAY FAIL TO LEAD TO COMMERCIALIZED
PRODUCTS.

     Substantially all of our revenues to date have been derived from
collaborative research and development agreements. Revenues from research and
development collaborations depend upon continuation of the collaborations, the
achievement of milestones and royalties derived from future products developed
from our research. If we are unable to achieve milestones or our collaborators
fail to develop successful products, we will not earn the revenues contemplated
under such collaborative agreements. In addition, some of our collaborations are
exclusive and preclude us from entering into additional collaborative
arrangements with other parties in the area or field of exclusivity.

     We currently have continuing collaborative research agreements with Bayer,
Bristol-Myers Squibb, Dow AgroSciences, Aventis CropSciences, Protein Design
Labs, Elan Pharmaceuticals and Scios. Our current collaborative agreement with
Bayer is scheduled to expire in 2008, after which it will automatically be
extended for one-year terms unless terminated by either party upon 12-month
written notice. Our agreement permits Bayer to terminate the collaborative
activities before 2008 upon the occurrence of specified conditions, such as the
failure to agree on key strategic issues after a period of years or the
acquisition of Exelixis by certain specified third parties. In addition, our
agreements with Bayer are subject to termination at an earlier date if two or
more of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Scientific Officer, Agricultural
Biotechnology Program Leader and Chief Informatics Officer cease to have a
relationship with us within six months of each other and we are unable to find
replacements acceptable to Bayer. We have two collaborative agreements with
Bristol-Myers Squibb. The first of our collaborative agreements with
Bristol-Myers Squibb expires in September 2002. The funded research term of the
second arrangement, entered into in July 2001, expires in July 2005. Our
collaborative agreement with Dow AgroSciences is scheduled to expire in July
2003, after which Dow AgroSciences has the option to renew on an annual basis.
Our collaborative research arrangement with Aventis is scheduled to expire in
June 2004. Aventis has the right to terminate the research arrangement before
the expiration date, provided that it pays the annual research funding amount
due for the year following termination. Thereafter, the arrangement renews
annually unless Aventis terminates automatic renewal before the scheduled date
of renewal. The Aventis arrangement is conducted through a limited liability
company, Agrinomics, which is owned equally by Aventis and Exelixis. Aventis may
surrender its interest in Agrinomics and terminate the related research
collaboration before the scheduled expiration upon the payment of the subsequent
year's funding commitment. Bayer and Aventis recently announced an agreement for
Bayer to acquire Aventis. The acquisition is expected to close during the first
quarter of 2002. Our agreement with Protein Design Labs is scheduled to expire
in May 2003. Protein Design Labs has a unilateral right to renew for additional
12 and six month periods thereafter. The five-year term of the convertible
promissory note entered into as part of this arrangement is unaffected by
whether or not Protein Design Labs renews. If these existing agreements are not
renewed or if we are unable to enter into new collaborative agreements on
commercially acceptable terms, our revenues and product development efforts may
be adversely affected. In August and October of 2002, we signed agreements to
deliver high-throughput screening compounds with Elan Pharmaceuticals and Scios,
respectively, which have terms of three and four years, respectively. These
agreements are subject to early termination if we fail to achieve certain
quality and quantity commitments.

     We recently announced the reacquisition, effective February 2002, of future
rights to research programs in metabolism and Alzheimer's disease previously
licensed exclusively to Pharmacia Corporation. An existing agreement with
Pharmacia will terminate as of that date. Pharmacia will retain rights to
targets under the existing agreement selected before the reacquisition date,
subject to the payment of milestones for certain of those targets selected and
royalties for future development of products against or using those targets but
will have no other obligations to make payments to us, including approximately
$9.0 million in annual funding that would otherwise be payable for two years if
we had not elected to reacquire rights to the research at this time. Although we
anticipate entering into future collaborations involving either or both of these
programs, there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into new
collaborative agreements or that such collaborations will provide revenues equal
to or exceeding those otherwise obtainable under the Pharmacia collaboration.

CONFLICTS WITH OUR COLLABORATORS COULD JEOPARDIZE THE OUTCOME OF OUR
COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OUR ABILITY TO COMMERCIALIZE PRODUCTS.

     We intend to conduct proprietary research programs in specific disease and
agricultural product areas that are not covered by our collaborative agreements.
Our pursuit of opportunities in agricultural and pharmaceutical markets could,
however, result in conflicts with our collaborators in the event that any of our
collaborators takes the position that our internal activities overlap with those
areas that are exclusive to our collaborative agreements, and we should be
precluded from such internal activities. Moreover, disagreements with our
collaborators could develop over rights to our intellectual property. In
addition, our collaborative agreements may have provisions that give rise to
disputes regarding the rights and obligations of the parties. Any conflict with
our collaborators could lead to the termination of our collaborative agreements,
delay collaborative activities, reduce our ability to renew agreements or obtain
future collaboration agreements or result in litigation or arbitration and would
negatively impact our relationship with existing collaborators.

     We have limited or no control over the resources that our collaborators may
choose to devote to our joint efforts. Our collaborators may breach or terminate
their agreements with us or fail to perform their obligations under these
agreements. Further, our collaborators may elect not to develop products arising
out of our collaborative arrangements or may fail to devote sufficient resources
to the development, manufacture, market or sale of such products. Certain of our
collaborators could also become our competitors in the future. If our
collaborators develop competing products, preclude us from entering into
collaborations with their competitors, fail to obtain necessary regulatory
approvals, terminate their agreements with us prematurely or fail to devote
sufficient resources to the development and commercialization of our products,
our product development efforts could be delayed and may fail to lead to
commercialized products.

WE ARE DEPLOYING UNPROVEN TECHNOLOGIES, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DEVELOP
COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS.

     You must evaluate us in light of the uncertainties and complexities
affecting a biotechnology company. Our technologies are still in the early
stages of development. Our research and operations thus far have allowed us to
identify a number of product targets for use by our collaborators and our own
internal development programs. We are not certain, however, of the commercial
value of any of our current or future targets, and we may not be successful in
expanding the scope of our research into new fields of pharmaceutical or
pesticide research, or other agricultural applications such as enhancing plant
traits to produce superior crop yields, disease resistance or increased
nutritional content. Significant research and development, financial resources
and personnel will be required to capitalize on our technology, develop
commercially viable products and obtain regulatory approval for such products.

WE HAVE NO EXPERIENCE IN DEVELOPING, MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING PRODUCTS AND
MAY BE UNABLE TO COMMERCIALIZE PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS.

     We recently acquired a development compound, an analog to rebeccamycin
("Rebeccamycin"), directed against cancer under our recent collaborative
arrangement with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Clinical development of Rebeccamycin to
date has been conducted by the National Cancer Institute, or NCI, and
manufacturing of this product has been the responsibility of Bristol-Myers
Squibb. Rebeccamycin has recently completed Phase I clinical studies and is in
Phase I and early Phase II clinical trials being conducted by the NCI. We have
an agreement with the NCI to use the results of the clinical studies they have
conducted or are conducting in order to determine what additional studies, if
any, will be conducted by the NCI or us. There can be no assurance that we and
the NCI will successfully agree upon further development plans, the respective
rights and obligations of the parties to conduct additional clinical studies or
the timing of these studies. In addition, there can be no assurance that the
clinical studies conducted to date will support further clinical development or
be accepted by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in conjunction with any
application for product approval submitted to the FDA for Rebeccamycin.
Moreover, although Bristol-Myers Squibb has provided the NCI with sufficient
quantities of Rebeccamycin to complete the existing Phase I and II clinical
studies, development necessary for further clinical studies and product approval
will require us to either develop internal manufacturing capabilities or retain
a third party to manufacture the product. In

addition, we have recently hired a new Senior Vice President responsible for
clinical development of this product, as well as any new potential products that
we may develop. As a result, we have limited experience in clinical development
and no experience in manufacturing potential drug products. Accordingly, the
development of Rebeccamycin is subject to significant risk and uncertainty,
particularly with respect to our ability to successfully develop, manufacture
and market Rebeccamycin as a product.

     With respect to products developed against our proprietary drug targets, we
will rely on our collaborators to develop and commercialize products based on
our research and development efforts. We have limited or no experience in using
the targets that we identify to develop our own proprietary products. Our recent
success in applying our drug development capabilities to our proprietary targets
in cancer are subject to significant risk and uncertainty, particularly with
respect to our ability to meet currently estimated timelines and goals for
completing preclinical development efforts and filing an Investigational New
Drug Application, or IND, for compounds developed. In order for us to
commercialize products, we would need to significantly enhance our capabilities
with respect to product development, and establish manufacturing and marketing
capabilities, either directly or through outsourcing or licensing arrangements.
We may not be able to enter into these outsourcing or licensing agreements on
commercially reasonable terms, or at all.

SINCE OUR TECHNOLOGIES HAVE MANY POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS AND WE HAVE LIMITED
RESOURCES, OUR FOCUS ON A PARTICULAR AREA MAY RESULT IN OUR FAILURE TO
CAPITALIZE ON MORE PROFITABLE AREAS.

     We have limited financial and managerial resources. This requires us to
focus on product candidates in specific industries and forego opportunities with
regard to other products and industries. For example, depending on our ability
to allocate resources, a decision to concentrate on a particular agricultural
program may mean that we will not have resources available to apply the same
technology to a pharmaceutical project. While our technologies may permit us to
work in both areas, resource commitments may require trade-offs resulting in
delays in the development of certain programs or research areas, which may place
us at a competitive disadvantage. Our decisions impacting resource allocation
may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert
resources from more profitable market opportunities. Moreover, our recent
acquisition of Rebeccamycin will require that resources and management time be
directed to clinical development and manufacturing of this potential product.
There can be no assurance that allocating resources and time to these efforts
will allow us to remain competitive in existing programs and potential areas of
future research. The resources dedicated to the development of Rebeccamycin may
limit or hinder our ability to meet currently estimated timelines and goals for
completing preclinical development efforts and filing an IND for our proprietary
compounds.

OUR COMPETITORS MAY DEVELOP PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT MAKE OUR PRODUCTS AND
TECHNOLOGIES OBSOLETE.

     The biotechnology industry is highly fragmented and is characterized by
rapid technological change. In particular, the area of gene research is a
rapidly evolving field. We face, and will continue to face, intense competition
from large biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic
research institutions, clinical reference laboratories and government agencies
that are pursuing research activities similar to ours. Some of our competitors
have entered into collaborations with leading companies within our target
markets, including some of our existing collaborators. Our future success will
depend on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to
technological advances.

     Any products that are developed through our technologies will compete in
highly competitive markets. Furthermore, our competitors may be more effective
at using their technologies to develop commercial products. Many of the
organizations competing with us have greater capital resources, larger research
and development staffs and facilities, more experience in obtaining regulatory
approvals and more extensive product manufacturing and marketing capabilities.
As a result, our competitors may be able to more easily develop technologies and
products that would render our technologies and products, and those of our
collaborators, obsolete and noncompetitive.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, THIRD PARTIES
MAY BE ABLE TO USE OUR TECHNOLOGY, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO
COMPETE IN THE MARKET.

     Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and
maintain adequate protection of the intellectual property related to our
technologies and products. The patent positions of biotechnology companies,
including our patent position, are generally uncertain and involve complex legal
and factual questions. We will be able to protect our intellectual property
rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our
technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively
maintained as trade secrets. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect
intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., and
many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending
these rights in foreign jurisdictions. We will continue to apply for patents
covering our technologies and products as and when we deem appropriate. However,
these applications may be challenged or may fail to result in issued patents.
Our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently
broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing
competing products. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar or
alternative technologies or design around our patents. In addition, our patents
may be challenged, invalidated or fail to provide us with any competitive
advantages.

     We rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary
information. We have taken security measures to protect our proprietary
information and trade secrets, but these measures may not provide adequate
protection. While we seek to protect our proprietary information by entering
into confidentiality agreements with employees, collaborators and consultants,
we cannot assure you that our proprietary information will not be disclosed, or
that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets. In addition, our competitors
may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or
may otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.

LITIGATION OR THIRD PARTY CLAIMS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT COULD
REQUIRE US TO SPEND SUBSTANTIAL TIME AND MONEY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY
TO DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE PRODUCTS.

     Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to avoid infringing
patents and proprietary rights of third parties, and not breaching any licenses
that we have entered into with regard to our technologies. Other parties have
filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications covering genes
and gene fragments, techniques and methodologies relating to model systems, and
products and technologies that we have developed or intend to develop. If
patents covering technologies required by our operations are issued to others,
we may have to rely on licenses from third parties, which may not be available
on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.

     Third parties may accuse us of employing their proprietary technology
without authorization. In addition, third parties may obtain patents that relate
to our technologies and claim that the use of our technologies infringes on
their patents. Regardless of their merit, these claims could require us to incur
substantial costs, including the diversion of management and technical
personnel, in defending ourselves against these claims or enforcing our patents.
In the event that a successful claim of infringement is brought against us, we
may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third
parties. We may not be able to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost, or at
all. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses could
adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products.

THE LOSS OF KEY PERSONNEL OR THE INABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN ADDITIONAL
PERSONNEL COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS.

     We are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and
scientific staff, the loss of whose services might adversely impact the
achievement of our objectives and the continuation of existing collaborations.
In addition, recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel to perform
future research and development work will be critical to our success. We do not
currently have sufficient executive management and technical personnel to fully
execute our business plan. There is currently a shortage of skilled executives
and employees with technical expertise, and this shortage is likely to continue.
As a result,

competition for skilled personnel is intense and turnover rates are high.
Although we believe we will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified
personnel, competition for executives and experienced scientists from numerous
companies, academic and other research institutions may limit our ability to do
so.

     Our business operations will require additional expertise in specific
industries and areas applicable to products identified and developed through our
technologies. These activities will require the addition of new personnel,
including management and technical personnel and the development of additional
expertise by existing employees. The inability to attract such personnel or to
develop this expertise could prevent us from expanding our operations in a
timely manner, or at all.

OUR COLLABORATIONS WITH OUTSIDE SCIENTISTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTION AND
CHANGE.

     We work with scientific advisors and collaborators at academic and other
institutions that assist us in our research and development efforts. These
scientists are not our employees and may have other commitments that would limit
their availability to us. Although our scientific advisors and collaborators
generally agree not to do competing work, if a conflict of interest between
their work for us and their work for another entity arises, we may lose their
services. In addition, although our scientific advisors and collaborators sign
agreements not to disclose our confidential information, it is possible that
valuable proprietary knowledge may become publicly known through them.

OUR POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO A LENGTHY AND UNCERTAIN
REGULATORY PROCESS THAT MAY NOT RESULT IN THE NECESSARY REGULATORY APPROVALS,
WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMMERCIALIZE PRODUCTS.

     The FDA must approve any drug or biologic product before it can be marketed
in the U.S. Any products resulting from our research and development efforts
must also be approved by the regulatory agencies of foreign governments before
the product can be sold outside the U.S. Before a new drug application or
biologics license application can be filed with the FDA, the product candidate
must undergo extensive clinical trials, which can take many years and may
require substantial expenditures. The regulatory process also requires
preclinical testing. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are
susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent
regulatory approval. In addition, delays or rejections may be encountered based
upon changes in regulatory policy for product approval during the period of
product development and regulatory agency review. The clinical development and
regulatory approval process is expensive and time consuming. Any failure to
obtain regulatory approval could delay or prevent us from commercializing
products.

     Our efforts to date have been primarily limited to identifying targets.
Significant research and development efforts will be necessary before any
products resulting from such targets can be commercialized. If regulatory
approval is granted to any of our products, this approval may impose limitations
on the uses for which a product may be marketed. Further, once regulatory
approval is obtained, a marketed product and its manufacturer are subject to
continual review, and discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or
manufacturer may result in restrictions and sanctions with respect to the
product, manufacturer and relevant manufacturing facility, including withdrawal
of the product from the market.

SOCIAL ISSUES MAY LIMIT THE PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED
PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS.

     Although our technology is not dependent on genetic engineering, genetic
engineering plays a prominent role in our approach to product development. For
example, research efforts focusing on plant traits may involve either selective
breeding or modification of existing genes in the plant under study. Public
attitudes may be influenced by claims that genetically engineered products are
unsafe for consumption or pose a danger to the environment. Such claims may
prevent our genetically engineered products from gaining public acceptance. The
commercial success of our future products will depend, in part, on public
acceptance of the use of genetically engineered products including drugs and
plant and animal products.

     The subject of genetically modified organisms has received negative
publicity, which has aroused public debate. For example, certain countries in
Europe are considering regulations that may ban products or require express
labeling of products that contain genetic modifications or are "genetically
modified." Adverse publicity has resulted in greater regulation internationally
and trade restrictions on imports of genetically altered products. If similar
action is taken in the U.S., genetic research and genetically engineered
products could be subject to greater domestic regulation, including stricter
labeling requirements. To date, our business has not been hampered by these
activities. However, such publicity in the future may prevent any products
resulting from our research from gaining market acceptance and reduce demand for
our products.

LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO SELL GENETICALLY ENGINEERED
PRODUCTS THAT WE OR OUR COLLABORATORS DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE.

     We or our collaborators may develop genetically engineered agricultural and
animal products. The field-testing, production and marketing of genetically
engineered products are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and
foreign governments. Regulatory agencies administering existing or future
regulations or legislation may prevent us from producing and marketing
genetically engineered products in a timely manner or under technically or
commercially feasible conditions. In addition, regulatory action or private
litigation could result in expenses, delays or other impediments to our product
development programs and the commercialization of products. The FDA has released
a policy statement stating that it will apply the same regulatory standards to
foods developed through genetic engineering as it applies to foods developed
through traditional plant breeding. Genetically engineered food products will be
subject to premarket review, however, if these products raise safety questions
or are deemed to be food additives. Our products may be subject to lengthy FDA
reviews and unfavorable FDA determinations if they raise questions regarding
safety or our products are deemed to be food additives.

     The FDA has also announced that it will not require genetically engineered
agricultural products to be labeled as such, provided that these products are as
safe and have the same nutritional characteristics as conventionally developed
products. The FDA may reconsider or change its policies, and local or state
authorities may enact labeling requirements, either of which could have a
material adverse effect on our ability or the ability of our collaborators to
develop and market products resulting from our efforts.

WE USE HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS AND RADIOACTIVE AND BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS IN OUR
BUSINESS. ANY CLAIMS RELATING TO IMPROPER HANDLING, STORAGE OR DISPOSAL OF THESE
MATERIALS COULD BE TIME CONSUMING AND COSTLY.

     Our research and development processes involve the controlled use of
hazardous materials, including chemicals, radioactive and biological materials.
Our operations produce hazardous waste products. We cannot eliminate the risk of
accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these
materials. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use,
manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials. We may be
sued for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by
third parties of these materials, and our liability may exceed our insurance
coverage and our total assets. Compliance with environmental laws and
regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental regulations
may impair our research, development and production efforts.

     In addition, our collaborators may use hazardous materials in connection
with our collaborative efforts. To our knowledge, their work is performed in
accordance with applicable biosafety regulations. In the event of a lawsuit or
investigation, however, we could be held responsible for any injury caused to
persons or property by exposure to, or release of, these hazardous materials use
by these parties. Further, we may be required to indemnify our collaborators
against all damages and other liabilities arising out of our development
activities or products produced in connection with these collaborations.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH
ACQUISITIONS, WHICH COULD THREATEN OUR FUTURE GROWTH.

     We have made, and may in the future make, acquisitions of, or significant
investments in, businesses with complementary products, services and
technologies. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including, but not limited
to:

     - difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the
       personnel, operations, technologies and products of acquired companies;

     - diversion of management's attention from other operational matters;

     - the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies;

     - the potential loss of key collaborators of acquired companies;

     - lack of synergy, or the inability to realize expected synergies,
       resulting from the acquisition;

     - exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency;

     - differences in foreign laws, business practices, statutes, regulations
       and tax provisions; and

     - acquired intangible assets becoming impaired as a result of technological
       advancements or acquired companies performing below expectations.

     Mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky, and the inability to
effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

IF PRODUCT LIABILITY LAWSUITS ARE SUCCESSFULLY BROUGHT AGAINST US, WE COULD FACE
SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITIES THAT EXCEED OUR RESOURCES.

     We may be held liable if any product we or our collaborators develop causes
injury or is found otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing,
marketing or sale. Although we intend to obtain general liability and product
liability insurance, this insurance may be prohibitively expensive, or may not
fully cover our potential liabilities. Inability to obtain sufficient insurance
coverage at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect ourselves against
potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the
commercialization of products developed by our collaborators or us.

OUR HEADQUARTERS ARE LOCATED NEAR KNOWN EARTHQUAKE FAULT ZONES, AND THE
OCCURRENCE OF AN EARTHQUAKE OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC DISASTER COULD CAUSE DAMAGE TO
OUR FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT, WHICH COULD REQUIRE US TO CEASE OR CURTAIL
OPERATIONS.

     Given the location of our headquarters in South San Francisco, California,
those facilities are vulnerable to damage from earthquakes. In addition, all of
our facilities are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters,
including fire, floods, power loss, communications failures and similar events.
If any disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our business at our
facilities would be seriously, or potentially completely, impaired. In addition,
the unique nature of our research activities could cause significant delays in
our programs and make it difficult for us to recover from a disaster. The
insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from
disasters or other business interruptions. Accordingly, an earthquake or other
disaster could materially and adversely harm our ability to conduct business.

SOME OF OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS CAN EXERT CONTROL OVER US AND THEIR INTERESTS
COULD CONFLICT WITH THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR OTHER STOCKHOLDERS.

     Due to their combined holdings, our officers, directors and stockholders
holding more than 5% of Exelixis common stock, or principal stockholders, acting
together, may be able to exert significant influence over all matters requiring
stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of
significant corporate transactions. In addition, this concentration of ownership
may delay or prevent a change in control of Exelixis, even when a change may be
in the best interests of our stockholders. In addition, the interests of these

stockholders may not always coincide with our interests as a company or the
interests of other stockholders. Accordingly, these stockholders could cause us
to enter into transactions or agreements that our other stockholders would not
approve.

ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS IN OUR CHARTER DOCUMENTS AND DELAWARE LAW COULD
DISCOURAGE, DELAY OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL THAT OUR STOCKHOLDERS MAY
FAVOR.

     Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law
could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if an acquisition
would be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions could discourage
potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of
Exelixis common stock. These provisions:

     - prohibit stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all
       stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;

     - limit the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of
       stockholders;

     - authorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue
       up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock that could be issued by our
       board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and
       discourage a takeover attempt; and

     - prohibit us from engaging in mergers and other business combinations with
       stockholders that beneficially own 15% or more of our voting stock, or
       with their affiliates, for three years unless our directors or
       stockholders approve the business combination in the prescribed manner or
       certain other requirements are satisfied.

RISKS RELATED TO EXELIXIS COMMON STOCK

WE EXPECT THAT OUR QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL FLUCTUATE, AND THIS
FLUCTUATION COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE, CAUSING INVESTOR LOSSES.

     Our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely
to fluctuate in the future. A number of factors, many of which we cannot
control, could subject our operating results and stock price to volatility,
including:

     - recognition of license, milestone or other revenues;

     - payments of licensing fees to third parties;

     - acceptance of our technologies and platforms;

     - the success rate of our discovery efforts leading to milestones and
       royalties;

     - the introduction of new technologies or products by our competitors;

     - the timing and willingness of collaborators to commercialize our
       products;

     - our ability to enter into new collaborative relationships;

     - the termination or non-renewal of existing collaborations;

     - general and industry-specific economic conditions that may affect our
       collaborators' research and development expenditures; and

     - exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency.

     A large portion of our expenses, including expenses for facilities,
equipment and personnel, are relatively fixed in the short term. In addition, we
expect operating expenses to increase significantly during the next year.
Accordingly, if our revenues decline or do not grow as anticipated due to the
expiration of existing contracts or our failure to obtain new contracts, our
inability to meet milestones or other factors, we may not be able to
correspondingly reduce our operating expenses. Failure to achieve anticipated
levels of revenues could therefore significantly harm our operating results for
a particular fiscal period.

     Due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenues and expenses, we
believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a
good indication of our future performance. As a result, in some future quarters,
our operating results may not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and
investors, which could result in a decline in the price of Exelixis common
stock.

OUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE EXTREMELY VOLATILE, WHICH COULD SUBJECT US TO SECURITIES
LITIGATION, WHICH IS EXPENSIVE AND COULD DIVERT OUR RESOURCES.

     We believe the trading price of Exelixis common stock will remain highly
volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to factors such as the following:

     - the announcement of new products or services by us or our competitors;

     - quarterly variations in our or our competitors' results of operations;

     - failure to achieve operating results projected by securities analysts;

     - changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;

     - developments in the biotechnology industry;

     - acquisitions of other companies or technologies; and

     - general market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated
       to our operating performance or the operating performance of our
       competitors.

     These factors and fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and
market conditions, may materially adversely affect the market price of Exelixis
common stock.

     In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a
company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been
instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in
substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources, which could
have a material and adverse effect on our business.

FUTURE SALES OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY DEPRESS OUR STOCK PRICE.

     If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock (including
shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants) in the
public market, the market price of our common stock could fall. These sales also
might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities
in the future at a time and price that we deemed appropriate. In addition, in
connection with our recent acquisitions and corporate collaborations, we issued
and registered for sale a significant number of shares of common stock. Sales of
these shares and other shares of common stock held by existing stockholders
could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.

                                THE TRANSACTION

GENERAL

     This section of the document describes aspects of the proposed exchange
offer and merger that we consider to be important. The discussion of the
exchange offer and merger in this prospectus and the description of the
principal terms of the exchange offer and merger agreement are only summaries of
the material features of the proposed exchange offer and merger. You can obtain
a more complete understanding of the exchange offer and merger by reading the
merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this prospectus as Annex A. You
are encouraged to read the merger agreement and the other annexes to this
prospectus in their entirety.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER AND THE MERGER

     On November 19, 2001, we entered into a merger agreement with Genomica,
providing for a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelixis, Bluegreen Acquisition Sub,
to offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Genomica common stock by
means of an exchange offer and a subsequent merger.

     Exelixis, through Bluegreen Acquisition Sub, is offering to exchange a
portion of a share of Exelixis common stock determined pursuant to an exchange
ratio, described below, for each outstanding share of Genomica common stock that
is validly tendered and not properly withdrawn on or prior to the expiration
date of the exchange offer.

     If completed, the exchange offer will be followed by a merger of Bluegreen
Acquisition Sub into Genomica in which shares of Genomica common stock will be
converted into the right to receive shares of Exelixis common stock at the same
exchange ratio used in the exchange offer, unless the holder properly perfects
appraisal rights, if available, under Delaware law. After completion of the
merger, Genomica will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelixis.

     The expiration date of the exchange offer is 12:00 midnight, New York City
time, on Friday, December 28, 2001, unless we extend the period of time for
which the exchange offer is open, in which case the term "expiration date" means
the latest time and date on which the exchange offer, as so extended, expires.

     If you are the record owner of your shares of Genomica common stock and you
tender those shares directly to the exchange agent, you will not incur any
brokerage fees or commissions. If you own your shares of Genomica common stock
through a broker or other nominee, and your broker tenders those shares on your
behalf, your broker may charge you a commission for doing so. You should consult
with your broker or nominee to determine whether any charges will apply. We will
be responsible for any transfer taxes on the exchange of shares of Genomica
common stock pursuant to the exchange offer that are imposed on the acquiror of
the shares of Genomica common stock. You will be responsible for any transfer
taxes that are imposed on the transferor.

     The exchange offer is conditioned on the tender of at least the sum of a
majority of the total number of shares of Genomica common stock plus the total
number of shares of Genomica common stock issuable upon exercise of options to
acquire Genomica common stock, each as outstanding immediately before the
expiration of the exchange offer, as it may be extended pursuant to the merger
agreement. We may not waive this condition without Genomica's consent. In
addition, our obligation to deliver shares of Exelixis common stock in exchange
for shares of Genomica common stock pursuant to the exchange offer is subject to
several other conditions referred to below in the section entitled "Certain
Terms of the Merger Agreement -- Conditions to the Exchange Offer."

     Genomica's board of directors unanimously approved the merger agreement,
determined that the exchange offer and the merger together are fair to, and in
the best interests of, Genomica stockholders and recommends that Genomica
stockholders accept the exchange offer and tender their shares pursuant to the
exchange offer.

THE EXCHANGE RATIO

     The exchange ratio is a number computed as the quotient of the following
two items:

     - the numerator is equal to the Genomica common stock value, determined by
       dividing $110.0 million by the sum of the number of shares of Genomica
       common stock and Genomica preferred stock outstanding as of the date that
       we first accept shares of Genomica common stock for payment pursuant to
       the exchange offer plus the number of shares of Genomica common stock
       issuable upon the exercise of all stock options and warrants with a per
       share exercise price of $5.00 or less that are outstanding as of the date
       that we first accept shares of Genomica common stock for payment pursuant
       to the exchange offer; and

     - the denominator is equal to the greater of the following two numbers:

      - $13.30285, or

      - the average closing sales price of Exelixis common stock during the 18
        trading days ending two trading days before the initial expiration of
        the exchange offer (as reported in The Wall Street Journal or, if not
        reported in The Wall Street Journal, any other authoritative source).

     On December 26, 2001, we fixed the Exelixis common stock price for use in
computing the exchange ratio. The exact exchange ratio will be calculated based
upon $15.88556, the average closing sales price of Exelixis common stock on the
Nasdaq National Market during the 18 trading-day period ended on December 26,
2001.

     As of December 26, 2001, the last practicable date before the date of this
prospectus, (i) the number of shares of Genomica common stock and Genomica
preferred stock outstanding plus the number of shares of Genomica common stock
issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants with a per
share exercise price of $5.00 or less was 24,463,141; and (ii) the Genomica
common stock value was approximately $4.49. Currently there are no shares of
preferred stock of Genomica outstanding and no such shares are expected to be
outstanding as of the expiration of the exchange offer. Pursuant to the terms of
the merger agreement, Genomica has agreed not to issue any rights to acquire
Genomica common stock or any additional shares of Genomica common stock, except
issuances of Genomica common stock upon exercise of existing options or warrants
to acquire Genomica common stock. We do not expect that the Genomica common
stock value will be materially different from the Genomica common stock value as
computed on December 26, 2001. Please see the section of this prospectus
entitled "The Transaction -- Interests of Genomica's Officers and Directors in
the Transaction" beginning on page 50 for a description of the treatment of
stock options held by Genomica employees.

     We will notify you by issuing a press release announcing the final exchange
ratio and filing that press release with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Genomica stockholders can call our information agent, Mellon Investor Services
LLC, at any time toll-free at (866) 323-8159 to request information about the
exchange ratio and any adjustment to the exchange ratio.

ILLUSTRATIVE TABLE OF EXCHANGE RATIOS AND VALUE OF OFFER/MERGER CONSIDERATION

     The columns in the following table present:

     - illustrative values of the exchange ratios (the portion of a share of our
       common stock that would be issued for one share of Genomica common stock)
       that would result if the Exelixis 18 trading-day average closing sales
       price ending two trading days before the initial expiration of the
       exchange offer were within a range of $8.00 to $20.00 per share; and

     - the illustrative values of the approximate consideration that would be

     THE VALUES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE TABLE ABOVE ARE ILLUSTRATIVE ONLY AND
DO NOT REPRESENT THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS PER SHARE OF GENOMICA COMMON STOCK THAT
MIGHT BE REALIZED BY ANY GENOMICA STOCKHOLDER ON OR AFTER CONSUMMATION OF THE
EXCHANGE OFFER OR THE MERGER. THE AMOUNT ANY GENOMICA STOCKHOLDER MIGHT REALIZE
UPON SALE IN THE MARKET OF OUR COMMON STOCK RECEIVED BY THE STOCKHOLDER IN THE
EXCHANGE OFFER OR THE MERGER WILL DEPEND UPON THE MARKET PRICE PER SHARE OF OUR
COMMON STOCK AT THE TIME OF SALE, WHICH WILL FLUCTUATE DEPENDING UPON ANY NUMBER
OF REASONS, INCLUDING THOSE SPECIFIC TO US AND THOSE THAT INFLUENCE THE TRADING
PRICES OF EQUITY SECURITIES GENERALLY.

PURPOSE OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER AND THE MERGER

     We are making the exchange offer in order to acquire all of the outstanding
shares of Genomica common stock. We intend, as soon as practicable after
completion of the exchange offer, to have our wholly owned subsidiary, Bluegreen
Acquisition Sub, the purchaser in the exchange offer, merge with Genomica. The
purpose of the merger is to acquire all shares of Genomica common stock not
tendered and exchanged pursuant to the exchange offer. In the merger, each
then-outstanding share of Genomica common stock, except for shares held by
Genomica and shares that Exelixis or Bluegreen Acquisition Sub hold for their
own accounts, and, if applicable, shares of Genomica common stock held by
stockholders exercising appraisal rights, will be converted into the right to
receive shares of Exelixis common stock at the same exchange ratio used in the
exchange offer. Assuming the minimum tender condition is satisfied and we
complete our exchange offer, we will have sufficient voting power to effect the
merger without the vote of any other stockholder of Genomica.

BACKGROUND

     Beginning in April 2001, Genomica's board of directors recognized that the
market for Genomica's software products had not developed and grown as planned.
At a meeting held on April 3, 2001, the board established a special committee
consisting of Teresa W. Ayers, Genomica's chief executive officer and a member
of the board of directors, Thomas G. Marr, Genomica's president, chief scientist
and a member of the board of directors, James L. Rathmann, Genomica's chairman
of the board of directors and Robert T. Nelsen,

a member of the board of directors (who was subsequently replaced by Michael J.
Savage on July 18, 2001), to explore Genomica's strategic and financial
alternatives, including a possible sale of Genomica, and authorized the special
committee to engage a financial advisor to assist in the process. Thereafter,
Genomica retained CIBC World Markets Corp. as its financial advisor.

     From April 2001 through October 2001, approximately 40 companies were
contacted to determine their interest in engaging in a strategic or business
combination transaction with Genomica. Sixteen of these companies conducted
preliminary due diligence investigations. By September 2001, seven of these
companies, including Exelixis, submitted preliminary indications of interest.
Genomica, with the assistance of CIBC World Markets, evaluated the strategic,
business and financial merits of each of the potential strategic partners and
potential acquirors. Genomica subsequently decided to pursue discussions with
five potential acquirors, three of which were public companies and two of which
were private companies.

     Between April 5 and September 11, 2001, the special committee met with
Genomica's management, representatives of CIBC World Markets and Cooley Godward
LLP, Genomica's outside legal counsel, six times to consider the status of
Genomica's efforts to identify potential strategic partners or acquirors, and to
receive updates on the status of discussions with certain parties that had
expressed an interest in a strategic or business combination transaction.

     At the September 11, 2001 meeting of the special committee, one potential
acquiror made a presentation to the special committee. Presentations by several
other potential acquirors, including Exelixis, that had been scheduled for that
day and the next day were cancelled due to the September 11th terrorist attacks.

     Because Exelixis had been unable to meet with the special committee on
September 12, 2001, as originally planned, a telephone conference was held on
September 13, 2001 between members of Genomica's management and Glen Sato,
Exelixis' chief financial officer and vice president of legal affairs. During
this telephone conference, Genomica's management presented Mr. Sato with a
strategic overview of Genomica and discussed the possibility of a business
combination between the two companies. Genomica's management was represented by
Ms. Ayers and Daniel R. Hudspeth, Genomica's chief financial officer, vice
president of finance, treasurer and secretary.

     Between September 13 and September 24, 2001, Genomica continued to pursue
discussions with Exelixis and the other four potential acquirors and continued
its legal and financial due diligence investigation of these parties.

     On September 19, 2001, Genomica received a written expression of interest
from Exelixis in acquiring Genomica in a stock-for-stock transaction. Exelixis'
initial proposal contemplated a stock-for-stock merger in which Exelixis would
issue 6,406,150 shares of common stock, having an aggregate market value as of
that date of approximately $71.5 million, in exchange for all outstanding shares
of Genomica common stock. Exelixis' proposal was subject to various conditions,
including the satisfactory completion of Exelixis' ongoing due diligence
investigation of Genomica.

     On September 20, 2001, Genomica received a written expression of interest
from one of the other potential bidders ("Bidder A"). Bidder A's proposal
contemplated a stock-for-stock merger in which Bidder A would issue a fixed
number of shares of its common stock having a market value as of that date of
approximately $61.7 million in exchange for all outstanding shares of Genomica
common stock.

     On September 24, 2001, the special committee met with Genomica's management
and legal and financial advisors to consider the status of discussions with the
five remaining potential acquirors. Genomica's management reviewed the status of
discussions with each potential acquiror and informed the special committee that
one of the private companies had withdrawn from the process. The special
committee then decided to eliminate the other private company from consideration
and focus on the potential acquirors which were already publicly traded.
Genomica's management also informed the special committee that three public
companies, including Exelixis and Bidder A, remained actively involved in
discussions regarding a potential business combination transaction. Genomica's
management and financial advisor then reviewed the written proposals that had
been received from Exelixis and Bidder A, and an oral proposal from the third
potential acquiror ("Bidder B"), with the special committee. A representative of
Cooley Godward also outlined the special committee's fiduciary duties and other
legal principles applicable to consideration of a business

combination transaction. The special committee concluded that, in light of
financial market conditions following the September 11th terrorist attacks, none
of the proposals was acceptable at that time. The special committee further
decided that the proposals would be reevaluated once the markets stabilized, and
instructed CIBC World Markets to so inform each potential acquiror.

     Between September 24 and October 2, 2001, in accordance with the special
committee's instructions, CIBC World Markets contacted each of the three
potential acquirors to inform them that their proposals were not acceptable in
light of existing market conditions, but that their proposals would be
reevaluated once the markets stabilized.

     On October 2, 2001, Genomica's board met with its management and legal and
financial advisors to receive an update on the status of discussions with the
remaining potential acquirors. Genomica's management, legal counsel and
financial advisor reviewed the terms of the proposals received from the
potential acquirors, including valuation, deal structure and conditions to
closing. Genomica's management also described the objectives of each potential
acquiror with respect to Genomica, including possible areas of synergy between
Genomica and each potential acquiror. Ms. Ayers reported that the special
committee had recommended that no action be taken with respect to any of the
proposals pending stabilization of the financial markets at which point the
proposals would be reevaluated. Ms. Ayers then described efforts to identify
other potential acquirors. The board also discussed other strategic
alternatives, including expanding the range of potential acquirors to include
companies in different industries as well as the payment of a liquidating
dividend. Following extensive discussion regarding the advantages and
disadvantages of the available alternatives, Genomica's board directed
management to continue to negotiate with Exelixis and Bidder A. The board
decided to discontinue negotiations with Bidder B because of its failure to
submit a formal offer in writing.

     On October 11, 2001, Mr. Sato met with Ms. Ayers and Mr. Hudspeth at
Genomica's offices in Boulder, Colorado to review background historical
information on Genomica's strategy, products and financial and operational
performance. Mr. Sato also visited the offices of Cooley Godward to begin
Exelixis' due diligence review of Genomica, which continued through the signing
of the merger agreement.

     On October 12, 2001, Exelixis revised its proposal to provide for a
stock-for-stock merger in which Exelixis would issue 8,000,000 shares of common
stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of Genomica common stock, and would
pay Genomica's stockholders an "earnout" if Genomica's Discovery Manager(TM)
product line were licensed or sold for at least $10.0 million. Also on October
12, 2001, Bidder A submitted a letter reiterating its interest in pursuing a
stock-for-stock merger on the terms previously proposed in its September 20,
2001 expression of interest.

     On October 15, 2001, the special committee met with Genomica's management
and legal and financial advisors to receive an update on the status of
discussions with Exelixis and Bidder A and to reevaluate their proposals.
Genomica's management and legal and financial advisors reviewed Exelixis'
revised proposal and Bidder A's proposal with the special committee and
discussed the strategic, business and financial merits and the timing of a
possible transaction with each of the potential acquirors. The special committee
concluded that, because the financial markets had not significantly improved
since the October 2, 2001 meeting of Genomica's board, neither Exelixis' nor
Bidder A's proposal was acceptable at that time. The special committee directed
management to continue to negotiate with both of the potential acquirors.

     Between October 15 and October 31, 2001, representatives of Genomica and
Exelixis, their respective outside legal counsel, and CIBC World Markets
participated in various telephone conferences to discuss the proposed financial
terms and legal structure of a business combination transaction and to continue
their respective due diligence investigations. Specifically, on October 26,
2001, members of Exelixis' management and Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe LLP,
Exelixis' outside legal counsel, proposed that a transaction be structured
involving a stock-for-stock exchange offer, followed by a second step
stock-for-stock merger. On October 30, 2001, representatives of Genomica agreed
that this structure was preferable to other structures discussed for a number of
reasons, including the relative speed of its expected completion. During this
period, representatives of Genomica also had several telephone conversations
with representatives of Bidder A to advise Bidder A of the status of Genomica's
consideration of Bidder A's proposal.

     On November 1, 2001, the special committee met with Genomica's management
and legal and financial advisors to review the status of discussions with
Exelixis and Bidder A and to reevaluate their proposals. Genomica's management
and legal and financial advisors reviewed each proposal with the special
committee and discussed the strategic, business and financial merits and the
timing of a possible transaction with each potential acquiror. Ms. Ayers
informed the special committee that Exelixis had submitted a revised proposal
following the last meeting of the special committee on October 15, 2001. The
special committee discussed Exelixis' revised proposal, as well as the proposal
of the other potential acquiror. The special committee also discussed Genomica's
other potential strategic alternatives. Ms. Ayers then outlined the proposed
process for the board's consideration of the proposals from Exelixis and Bidder
A, including arrangements for the November 12, 2001 meeting of the board and for
distribution of information to the board in advance of that meeting, and the
special committee approved these arrangements.

     Between November 1 and November 12, 2001, Genomica's management and
financial advisor had several telephone conversations with each of Exelixis and
Bidder A to update them on the process for Genomica's consideration of their
respective proposals and to arrange for both potential acquirors to make
presentations at the November 12, 2001 meeting of the board. Genomica continued
to pursue discussions with Exelixis and Bidder A, and all three parties
continued their respective legal and financial due diligence investigations.

     On November 6, 2001, Exelixis and Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe LLP
submitted a proposed form of merger agreement to Genomica and Cooley Godward.
The form of merger agreement contemplated the two-step merger structure
previously discussed by Genomica and Exelixis. Under the terms of the proposed
agreement, Exelixis would deliver shares of common stock with a fixed value and
an exchange ratio that would float based on Exelixis' average stock price over
a period of time before the expiration of the exchange offer. In addition, the
proposed agreement contemplated a cap on the maximum number of shares of
Exelixis common stock issuable to Genomica's stockholders based on the trading
price of Exelixis common stock during a period of time before the signing of
the merger agreement.

     On November 8, 2001, the Exelixis board of directors met to review the
status of Exelixis' due diligence investigation, the current financial terms,
timing of the proposed transaction, and the open issues remaining in the
negotiation of the merger agreement.

     On November 9, 2001, Exelixis' management canvassed certain members of the
Exelixis board of directors on pricing calculations and other financial terms.

     Between November 9 and November 15, 2001, Mr. Sato and George Scangos,
Ph.D., Exelixis' president and chief executive officer, had several
conversations with the individual members of the Exelixis board of directors
regarding the proposed business combination with Genomica, including the
strategic rationale for the transaction and the proposed financial and other
transaction terms.

     On November 12, 2001, Genomica's board of directors met to consider the
Exelixis' and Bidder A's proposals. Representatives of Cooley Godward outlined
the board's fiduciary duties and other legal principles applicable to
consideration of a business combination transaction. Genomica's management and
financial advisor reviewed the background and status of negotiations with
Exelixis and Bidder A and reviewed the financial terms of their respective
proposals. In addition, the board met separately with representatives of
Exelixis and Bidder A, each of which made presentations to the board regarding
their respective strategic and business plans, and discussed the potential
benefits to Genomica's stockholders of their respective proposals. Each of
Exelixis and Bidder A confirmed their interest in pursuing further discussions
regarding a possible business combination transaction with Genomica. At the
meeting, Bidder A presented a revised proposal for a stock-for-stock merger in
which Bidder A would issue shares of its common stock with an implied value of
up to an aggregate of $120.0 million, based on the average stock price of Bidder
A's common stock over a period prior to the time the registration statement for
the shares issued by Bidder A was declared effective by the SEC, in exchange for
all outstanding shares of Genomica common stock, subject to a cap on the maximum
number of shares of Bidder A's common stock issuable to Genomica's stockholders
in the transaction. In addition, Bidder A would agree to file a registration
statement on form S-3 to register for resale shares of Bidder A's common stock
received by certain of Genomica's stockholders in the merger. Bidder A's
proposal

was subject to certain conditions, including approval of Bidder A's and
Genomica's stockholders. According to this proposal, Genomica's obligation to
complete the transaction would be conditioned on the shares delivered by Bidder
A having a value of at least $106.0 million at the time the registration
statement for the shares issued by Bidder A was declared effective by the SEC.
Following a discussion of the strategic, business and financial merits of the
two prospective acquirors and based on consideration of a number of factors,
including the factors described under "-- Reasons for the Exchange Offer and the
Merger" below, Genomica's board unanimously directed management to negotiate
exclusively with Exelixis toward the signing of a definitive merger agreement.
Later that evening, Cooley Godward sent to Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe LLP
its comments in the form of merger agreement that had been previously submitted
by Exelixis and Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe LLP.

     From November 12 through November 18, 2001, negotiations on the terms of
the merger agreement and related agreements continued among Exelixis, Genomica
and their respective legal counsel. These negotiations covered all aspects of
the transaction, including, among other things, the representations and
warranties made by the parties, the restrictions on the conduct of their
businesses, the conditions to completion of the exchange offer and the merger,
the provisions regarding termination, the details of the "no shop" clause, the
amount and circumstances requiring reimbursement of Exelixis' expenses, and the
delivery and terms of the stockholder tender agreements.

     On November 16, 2001, the Exelixis board of directors met with
representatives of Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe LLP and reviewed the proposed
terms of this transaction and the results of Exelixis' due diligence
investigation. On November 19, 2001, the Exelixis board of directors met and
reviewed the final terms of the merger agreement. Representatives of Heller
Ehrman White & McAuliffe LLP reviewed the proposed terms of the merger agreement
and outlined the legal principles applicable to the Exelixis board of directors'
consideration and approval of the proposed transaction. The Exelixis board of
directors, by unanimous vote of all directors present, authorized Exelixis to
enter into a merger agreement with Genomica in substantially the form proposed
at the meeting, consistent with the Exelixis board of directors' guidance on
certain open issues, including pricing, loans for the exercise of stock options
and the calculation of shares outstanding.

     On November 18, 2001, Genomica's board of directors held a special meeting
to review the status of negotiations and discussions with Exelixis since its
November 12, 2001 meeting. Genomica's management and legal and financial
advisors also participated. Representatives of Cooley Godward reviewed certain
legal matters applicable to the proposed business combination transaction,
including the structure and timing of the proposed transaction and the board's
fiduciary duties in considering the transaction. Representatives of Cooley
Godward also reviewed in detail the principal terms of the proposed merger
agreement and related agreements, and responded to questions from the board. The
board reviewed and discussed the principal terms of the proposed transaction,
including the exchange ratio, closing conditions, termination rights, the amount
and circumstances requiring reimbursement of Exelixis' expenses, the stockholder
tender agreements and Genomica's ability to consider alternative proposals. The
board provided Genomica's management with directions regarding the resolution of
open items relating to pricing, stock option loans and the calculation of shares
outstanding. Also at this meeting CIBC World Markets reviewed with the board the
financial terms of the transaction, including its financial analysis of the
proposed exchange ratio, and indicated to the Board that, assuming no material
changes in the terms of the transaction and subject to review of the final
merger agreement, it believed it would be in a position, at the time of
execution of the merger agreement, to deliver an opinion as to the fairness,
from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio to be provided for in the
transaction.

     After further deliberation, the Genomica board, by unanimous vote:

     - determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by
       the merger agreement, including the exchange offer and the merger, were
       fair to, and in the best interests of, Genomica and its stockholders;

     - approved and adopted the merger agreement and the transactions
       contemplated by the merger agreement, including the exchange offer and
       the merger, and the stockholder tender agreements and the transactions
       contemplated by the stockholder tender agreements;

     - resolved to recommend acceptance of the exchange offer and approval and
       adoption of the merger agreement by Genomica's stockholders; and

     - authorized Ms. Ayers to execute, on behalf of Genomica, the merger
       agreement and such other documents that certain of Genomica's officers
       find necessary or advisable in their sole discretion, all subject to the
       resolution of several outstanding items in accordance with the board's
       instructions and to the receipt of an opinion of CIBC World Markets as to
       the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the final exchange
       ratio.

     On November 19, 2001, the special committee met with Genomica's management
and legal and financial advisors. Ms. Ayers informed the special committee that
the several remaining open items as of the previous day's board meeting had been
resolved in accordance with the board's directions, and that the merger
agreement, with the changes directed to be made by Genomica's board of
directors, had been agreed to by Exelixis. CIBC World Markets rendered its oral
opinion, which opinion was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated
November 19, 2001, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject
to certain matters described in its opinion, the exchange ratio was fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of Genomica common stock, other than
Exelixis and its affiliates. The special committee unanimously directed Ms.
Ayers to execute the merger agreement and related documents in accordance with
the resolutions of the board adopted on November 18, 2001.

     Following the close of trading on the Nasdaq National Market on November
19, 2001, Exelixis and Genomica entered into the merger agreement and issued a
joint press release announcing the transaction.

     Also, on November 19, 2001, the directors and certain officers and
stockholders of Genomica entered into the stockholder tender agreements with
Exelixis, pursuant to which they agreed to tender their shares of Genomica
common stock in the exchange offer and vote their shares in favor of the
approval and adoption of the merger agreement. In addition, the directors and
certain officers and stockholders of Genomica entered into lock-up agreements
with Exelixis, agreeing not to sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of their
shares of Exelixis common stock for 90 days following the date Exelixis accepts
for payment shares pursuant to the exchange offer.

     On November 26, 2001, Genomica, Exelixis and certain officers of Genomica
entered into agreements which provide that, if requested by the officers,
Genomica will loan money to these officers, on terms similar to those otherwise
commercially available from third parties, in order to enable them to pay for
the exercise of specified options to acquire Genomica common stock. On this same
date, Exelixis also waived the provisions of the lock-up agreement with these
officers to enable them to sell a sufficient number of shares of Exelixis common
stock to cover any tax obligations they incurred as a result of exercises of
options to acquire Genomica common stock.

     On November 29, 2001, Exelixis commenced the exchange offer.

CERTAIN LITIGATION

     On December 5, 2001, Genomica was served with a complaint filed in state
court in Colorado by Rudolf Liedtke, on behalf of himself and purportedly on
behalf of all others similarly situated, against Genomica, each of the current
members of Genomica's board of directors and one former Genomica director. The
complaint alleges a breach of fiduciary duty by the board of directors of
Genomica in connection with entering into the merger agreement. The action seeks
to enjoin the defendants from agreeing to Exelixis' offer to acquire all of the
outstanding shares of Genomica common stock and to order the defendants to
implement a fair and objective process to sell Genomica. The complaint is
pending in the District Court, County of Boulder. Genomica has not yet responded
to the complaint.

REASONS FOR THE EXCHANGE OFFER AND THE MERGER

     The following discussion of the parties' reasons for the exchange offer and
the merger contains a number of forward-looking statements that reflect the
current views of Exelixis or Genomica with respect to future events that may
have an effect on their future financial performance. Forward-looking statements
are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results and outcomes may differ
materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking
statements. Cautionary statements that identify important factors that could

cause or contribute to differences in results and outcomes include those
discussed in "Summary -- Forward-Looking Information" and "Risk Factors."

 GENOMICA'S REASONS FOR THE EXCHANGE OFFER AND THE MERGER; RECOMMENDATION OF
 GENOMICA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     Beginning in April 2001, Genomica's board of directors recognized that the
market for Genomica's software products had not developed and grown as planned.
In an effort to determine a business strategy that would generate appropriate
returns to Genomica's stockholders, Genomica's management, with the assistance
of Genomica's financial advisor, implemented a process that extended over seven
months, and involved the evaluation of approximately 70 opportunities,
discussions with approximately 40 different companies, extensive discussions and
meetings regarding business combination transactions with approximately 16
different companies, and resulted in offers from seven different companies.
Genomica's board of directors also gave consideration to acquiring other public
or private companies as well as paying stockholders a liquidating dividend. Upon
completion of this process, Genomica's board of directors identified several
potential benefits for Genomica stockholders that it believes could result from
a combination with Exelixis. The potential benefits include, among other things:

     - the opportunity for Genomica stockholders to participate in a
       significantly larger and more diversified company and, as stockholders of
       the combined company, to have greater liquidity in their shares and to
       benefit from any future growth of the combined company;

     - the opportunity for Genomica stockholders to receive shares of Exelixis
       common stock in a tax-free exchange at approximately a 33% premium over
       the prevailing market price for shares of Genomica common stock
       immediately before the announcement of the merger agreement;

     - enabling the combined company to leverage the depth and experience of
       Exelixis' management team and board of directors; and

     - enabling the combined company to leverage Genomica's software products to
       enhance the effectiveness of Exelixis' research and development efforts.

     In the course of its deliberations during board meetings, Genomica's board
of directors reviewed with Genomica's management and outside advisors a number
of factors relevant to the transaction. Genomica's board of directors considered
the following potentially positive factors, among others, in connection with its
review and analyses of the transaction. The conclusions reached by Genomica's
board of directors with respect to each of these factors supported its
determination that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, including the exchange offer and the merger, were fair to, and
in the best interests of, Genomica and its stockholders:

     - Genomica's management's view regarding the financial condition, results
       of operations, businesses and prospects of Genomica, Exelixis and Bidder
       A, both before and after giving effect to a business combination, based
       upon management's due diligence and publicly available financial
       information and earnings estimates. Among other things, the board
       considered market and industry conditions, the respective business plans
       and business models of Genomica, Exelixis and Bidder A, and each party's
       financial strength. The board also compared the financial position,
       results of operations, business and prospects of Genomica both on a
       stand-alone basis and assuming a business combination with Exelixis or
       Bidder A;

     - the exchange ratio for the exchange offer and the merger, which
       represented an implied premium of approximately 33% over the closing
       sales price of Genomica's common stock on the Nasdaq National Market on
       November 19, 2001, the last full trading day before the public
       announcement of the merger agreement, as well as an implied premium of
       approximately 47% and 58% premiums over the average of the closing sales
       prices for the ten and 30 trading-day periods, respectively, ending on
       November 19, 2001;

     - the financial and other terms of the exchange offer, the merger and the
       merger agreement, including the benefits of the transaction being
       structured as a first-step exchange offer and second-step merger, which
       may provide Genomica's stockholders with an opportunity to receive shares
       of Exelixis common stock on an accelerated basis compared with the longer
       period of time associated with the merger structure contemplated by
       Bidder A's stock-for-stock proposal. In particular, the board noted that
       Exelixis' proposed structure did not require the approval of Bidder A's
       stockholders, whereas Bidder A's proposal would have required the
       approval of Bidder A's stockholder;

     - historical information concerning Exelixis', Bidder A's and Genomica's
       respective businesses, financial performance and condition, operations,
       technology, management and competitive position, including public reports
       filed with the SEC;

     - reports from management, legal advisors and financial advisors as to the
       results of their due diligence investigations of Exelixis;

     - the number and quality of the strategic collaborations between Exelixis
       and Bidder A and their respective strategic partners, and the magnitude
       and predictability of future revenue streams under those collaborations;

     - the belief that, based on a review of Genomica's strategic alternatives
       and the process described in "The Transaction -- Background" above, it
       was unlikely that any party would propose an alternative transaction that
       would be more favorable to Genomica and its stockholders than the
       exchange offer and the merger;

     - the strengths and weaknesses of Exelixis', Bidder A's and Genomica's
       businesses and the key attributes and opportunities of the combined
       company in terms of, among other things, technology, products, prospects,
       management, and financial and competitive position;

     - the trading markets for the common stock of Genomica, Exelixis and Bidder
       A, both on a historical basis and assuming a business combination between
       Genomica and Exelixis or Bidder A. Among other things, the board
       considered the market capitalization, trading volume, stock price
       volatility, institutional ownership and analyst coverage for each of
       Genomica, Exelixis and Bidder A;

     - the absence of any pending legal proceedings involving Exelixis and the
       fact that Bidder A was a party to legal proceedings which created some
       uncertainty regarding one aspect of its business;

     - the presentation of CIBC World Markets regarding the financial terms of
       the proposed transaction, including its opinion dated November 19, 2001
       as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of
       the opinion, of the exchange ratio to the holders of Genomica common
       stock, other than Exelixis and its affiliates (see "Reasons for the
       Board's Recommendation -- Opinion of Genomica's Financial Advisor" in
       Genomica's Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, which
       is being mailed to you together with this prospectus); and

     - the belief that the terms of the merger agreement, including the parties'
       representations, warranties and covenants, and the conditions to the
       parties' respective obligations, are reasonable.

     Genomica's board of directors also identified and considered a number of
potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the exchange offer
and the merger, including, but not limited to:

     - the risk that, because the exchange ratio is based on the price of
       Exelixis common stock over the 18 trading days ending two trading days
       before the expiration of the offer, changes in the market price of
       Exelixis common stock might cause the per share value of the
       consideration to be received by Genomica stockholders to be less than the
       per share price implied by the exchange ratio immediately before the
       announcement of the proposed transaction;

     - the possibility that the market value of the shares to be issued by
       Bidder A under its revised proposal might exceed the market value of the
       shares to be issued by Exelixis;

     - the risk that the potential benefits sought in the exchange offer and the
       merger might not be fully realized;

     - certain risks applicable to Exelixis' business (see the information
       contained under the caption "Risk Factors -- Risks Related to Exelixis'
       Business" beginning on page 18);

     - the possibility that the exchange offer and the merger might not be
       completed and the effect of public announcement of the exchange offer and
       the merger on Genomica's sales and operating results, and its ability to
       attract and retain key technical and management personnel;

     - the risk that the terms of the transaction could be dilutive to Exelixis'
       earnings and that such potential dilution could negatively impact the
       trading price of Exelixis common stock;

     - the substantial charges to be incurred in connection with the exchange
       offer and the merger, including costs of integrating the businesses and
       transaction expenses arising from the exchange offer and the merger; and

     - the risk that despite the efforts of the combined company, key technical
       and management personnel might not remain employed by the combined
       company.

     Genomica's board of directors believed that these risks were outweighed by
the potential benefits of the exchange offer and the merger.

     The above discussion of the information and factors considered by
Genomica's board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed
to include the material factors considered by the board. In view of the wide
variety of factors, both positive and negative, considered by Genomica's board
of directors, the board did not find it practicable to quantify or otherwise
assign relative weights to the specific factors considered. In addition, the
board did not reach any specific conclusion on each factor considered, or any
aspect of any particular factor, but conducted an overall analysis of these
factors. Individual members of Genomica's board of directors may have given
different weights to different factors. However, after taking into account all
of the factors described above, the board unanimously approved the merger
agreement, and determined that the exchange offer and the merger are fair to and
in the best interests of Genomica and its stockholders and recommended that
Genomica stockholders accept the offer and tender their shares of Genomica
common stock pursuant to the exchange offer.

  Opinion of Genomica's Financial Advisor

     Genomica engaged CIBC World Markets to act as its exclusive financial
advisor in connection with the exchange offer and the merger. In connection with
this engagement, Genomica requested that CIBC World Markets evaluate the
fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Genomica common
stock (other than Exelixis and its affiliates) of the exchange ratio provided
for in the exchange offer and the merger. On November 19, 2001, at a meeting of
the Genomica special committee held to authorize the exchange offer and the
merger in accordance with the instructions of Genomica's board of directors,
CIBC World Markets rendered an oral opinion, which opinion was confirmed by
delivery to Genomica's board of directors of a written opinion dated November
19, 2001, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to the
matters described in its opinion, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial
point of view, to holders of Genomica common stock (other than Exelixis and its
affiliates).

     The full text of CIBC World Markets' written opinion dated November 19,
2001, which describes the assumptions made, matters considered and limitations
on the review undertaken, is attached as Schedule II to Genomica's
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, which is being mailed
to you together with this prospectus. CIBC WORLD MARKETS' OPINION IS ADDRESSED
TO GENOMICA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND RELATES ONLY TO THE FAIRNESS, FROM A
FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW, OF THE EXCHANGE RATIO PROVIDED FOR IN THE EXCHANGE
OFFER AND THE MERGER. THE OPINION DOES NOT ADDRESS ANY OTHER ASPECT OF THE
EXCHANGE OFFER OR THE MERGER OR ANY RELATED TRANSACTION AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE
A RECOMMENDATION TO ANY HOLDER OF GENOMICA COMMON STOCK AS TO WHETHER SUCH
STOCKHOLDER SHOULD EXCHANGE SHARES OF GENOMICA COMMON STOCK IN THE EXCHANGE
OFFER OR HOW SUCH STOCKHOLDER SHOULD VOTE OR ACT WITH RESPECT TO ANY MATTERS
RELATING TO THE

EXCHANGE OFFER OR THE MERGER. THE SUMMARY OF CIBC WORLD MARKETS' OPINION
DESCRIBED BELOW IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL TEXT OF
THE OPINION. YOU ARE ENCOURAGED TO READ THE OPINION CAREFULLY IN ITS ENTIRETY.

     In arriving at its opinion, CIBC World Markets:

     - reviewed the merger agreement;

     - reviewed audited financial statements of Genomica and Exelixis for the
       fiscal year ended December 31, 2000;

     - reviewed unaudited financial statements of Genomica and Exelixis for the
       six months ended June 30, 2001 and a draft of certain financial data
       relating to Genomica and Exelixis for the three months ended September
       30, 2001 prepared by the managements of Genomica and Exelixis;

     - reviewed financial forecasts and other information relating to Genomica
       and Exelixis prepared by the managements of Genomica and Exelixis;

     - reviewed historical market prices and trading volume for Genomica common
       stock and Exelixis common stock;

     - held discussions with the senior managements of Genomica and Exelixis
       with respect to the businesses and prospects for future growth of
       Genomica and Exelixis;

     - performed a liquidation analysis of Genomica using certain assumptions
       and estimates provided to or discussed with CIBC World Markets by
       Genomica's management as to the current market value of Genomica's
       assets, the amount of Genomica's current liabilities and the potential
       amount of expenses associated with a liquidation;

     - reviewed and analyzed certain publicly available financial data for
       certain companies CIBC World Markets deemed comparable to Exelixis;

     - performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Exelixis using certain
       assumptions of future performance provided to or discussed with CIBC
       World Markets by the management of Exelixis;

     - reviewed public information concerning Genomica and Exelixis;

     - at the request of Genomica, approached and held discussions with certain
       third parties to solicit indications of interest in the possible
       acquisition of Genomica; and

     - performed such other analyses and reviewed such other information as CIBC
       World Markets deemed appropriate.

     In rendering its opinion, CIBC World Markets relied upon and assumed,
without independent verification or investigation, the accuracy and completeness
of all of the financial and other information that Genomica, Exelixis and their
respective employees, representatives and affiliates provided to or discussed
with CIBC World Markets. With respect to forecasts relating to Genomica and
Exelixis provided to or discussed with CIBC World Markets by the managements of
Genomica and Exelixis, CIBC World Markets assumed, at the direction of the
managements of Genomica and Exelixis, without independent verification or
investigation, that the forecasts were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting
the best available information, estimates and judgments of the managements of
Genomica and Exelixis as to the future financial condition and operating results
of Genomica and Exelixis. CIBC World Markets assumed, with Genomica's consent,
that the exchange offer and the merger would be treated as an integrated
transaction and as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes.
CIBC World Markets also assumed, with Genomica's consent, that the exchange
offer and the merger would be consummated in all material respects in accordance
with their terms, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material
term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary
regulatory or third party consents and approvals for the exchange offer and the
merger, no limitations, restrictions or conditions would be imposed that would
have a material adverse effect on Genomica, Exelixis or the contemplated
benefits of the exchange offer and the merger. CIBC World Markets relied, at the
direction the managements of Genomica and Exelixis, without independent
verification

or investigation, upon the assessments of the management of Exelixis as to the
existing and future technology and products of Exelixis and the risks associated
with such technology and products.

     CIBC World Markets did not make or obtain any independent evaluations or
appraisals of the assets or liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of Genomica or
Exelixis. CIBC World Markets did not express any opinion as to the underlying
valuation, future performance or long-term viability of Genomica or Exelixis,
the price at which Genomica common stock would trade after announcement or upon
consummation of the exchange offer or the merger, or the price at which Exelixis
common stock would trade at any time in the future. CIBC World Markets expressed
no view as to, and CIBC World Markets' opinion does not address, the underlying
business decision of Genomica to effect the exchange offer or the merger, and
CIBC World Markets was not requested to consider the relative merits of the
exchange offer and merger as compared to any alternative business strategies
that might exist for Genomica or the effect of any other transaction in which
Genomica might engage. CIBC World Markets' opinion was necessarily based on the
information available to CIBC World Markets and general economic, financial and
stock market conditions and circumstances as they existed and could be evaluated
by CIBC World Markets as of the date of its opinion. Although subsequent
developments may affect its opinion, CIBC World Markets does not have any
obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. Genomica imposed no other
instructions or limitations on CIBC World Markets with respect to the
investigations made or the procedures followed by CIBC World Markets in
rendering its opinion.

     This summary is not a complete description of CIBC World Markets' opinion
to Genomica's board of directors or the financial analyses performed and factors
considered by CIBC World Markets in connection with its opinion. The preparation
of a fairness opinion is a complex analytical process involving various
determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial
analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances
and, therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to summary
description. CIBC World Markets believes that its analyses and this summary must
be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors
or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all
analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create
a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying CIBC World Markets'
analyses and opinion.

     In performing its analyses, CIBC World Markets considered industry
performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and
other matters existing as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond
the control of Genomica and Exelixis. No company or business used in the
analyses as a comparison is identical to Genomica or Exelixis, and an evaluation
of the results of those analyses is not entirely mathematical. Rather, the
analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and
operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition,
public trading or other values of the companies or business segments analyzed.

     The estimates contained in CIBC World Markets' analysis and the ranges of
valuations resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative
of actual values or future results, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those suggested by its analyses. In addition, analyses relating
to the value of businesses or securities do not necessarily purport to be
appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually
may be sold. Accordingly, CIBC World Markets' analyses and estimates are
inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

     The type and amount of consideration payable in the exchange offer and the
merger was determined through negotiation between Genomica and Exelixis and the
decision to enter into the exchange offer and the merger was solely that of
Genomica's board of directors. CIBC World Markets' opinion and financial
analyses were only one of many factors considered by Genomica's board of
directors in its evaluation of the exchange offer and the merger and should not
be viewed as determinative of the views of Genomica's board of directors or
Genomica's management with respect to the exchange offer and the merger or the
exchange ratio provided for in the exchange offer and the merger.

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses underlying
CIBC World Markets' opinion to Genomica's board of directors with respect to the
exchange offer and the merger. THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES SUMMARIZED BELOW INCLUDE
INFORMATION PRESENTED IN TABULAR FORMAT. IN ORDER TO FULLY UNDERSTAND CIBC

WORLD MARKETS' FINANCIAL ANALYSES, THE TABLES MUST BE READ TOGETHER WITH THE
TEXT OF EACH SUMMARY. THE TABLES ALONE DO NOT CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION
OF THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES. CONSIDERING THE DATA IN THE TABLES BELOW WITHOUT
CONSIDERING THE FULL NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES, INCLUDING
THE METHODOLOGIES AND ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE ANALYSES, COULD CREATE A
MISLEADING OR INCOMPLETE VIEW OF CIBC WORLD MARKETS' FINANCIAL ANALYSES.

  Implied Exchange Ratio Analysis.

     Using a "Liquidation Analysis" for Genomica and a "Selected Companies
Analysis" and "Discounted Cash Flow Analysis" for Exelixis, CIBC World Markets
derived an implied equity reference range from each analysis as described below.
Based on these implied equity reference ranges, CIBC World Markets then
calculated implied exchange ratio reference ranges for Genomica common stock and
Exelixis common stock. The results of this implied exchange ratio analysis were
then compared with the exchange ratio provided for in the exchange offer and the
merger. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied exchange ratio
reference ranges, as compared to the exchange ratio provided for in the exchange
offer and the merger of 0.3000 based on the closing prices of Genomica common
stock and Exelixis common stock on November 16, 2001:

                                                              IMPLIED EXCHANGE RATIO
                                                                 REFERENCE RANGE
                                                              ----------------------

Genomica Liquidation Analysis/Exelixis Selected Companies
  Analysis..................................................     0.1765 - 0.2352
Genomica Liquidation Analysis/Exelixis Discounted Cash Flow
  Analysis..................................................     0.2359 - 0.2952

     The "Liquidation Analysis" for Genomica and the "Selected Companies
Analysis" and "Discounted Cash Flow Analysis" for Exelixis performed by CIBC
World Markets for purposes of its "Implied Exchange Ratio Analysis" are
described below:

  Genomica

     Liquidation Analysis.  CIBC World Markets performed a liquidation analysis
of Genomica's assets to calculate the potential range of net proceeds available
for distribution upon an orderly liquidation of Genomica, based on internal
estimates of Genomica's management as to the potential market value of
Genomica's assets, the amount of Genomica's current liabilities and the
potential amount of expenses associated with a liquidation. The potential range
of net proceeds that would be available for distribution from an orderly
liquidation of Genomica was derived by applying a range of assumed liquidation
percentages to Genomica's estimated net asset value for the fourth quarter of
fiscal year 2001. This analysis resulted in an implied equity reference range
for Genomica of approximately $4.40 to $4.43 per share.

  Exelixis

     Selected Companies Analysis.  CIBC World Markets compared financial and
stock market information for Exelixis and the following six selected publicly
held companies in the early stage of development in the biotechnology industry:

     - Applera Corporation -- Celera Genomics Group
     - Lexicon Genetics Incorporated
     - CuraGen Corporation
     - Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
     - Human Genome Sciences, Inc.
     - Myriad Genetics, Inc.

     CIBC World Markets reviewed enterprise values, calculated as equity value,
plus debt, less cash, as a multiple of latest 12 months and estimated calendar
years 2001 and 2002 revenue. All multiples were based on closing stock prices on
November 16, 2001. Estimated financial data for the selected companies were
based on publicly available research analysts' estimates. CIBC World Markets
then applied a range of selected multiples of calendar years 2001 and 2002
revenue derived from the selected companies to corresponding

financial data of Exelixis in order to derive an implied equity reference range
for Exelixis. This analysis indicated an implied equity reference range for
Exelixis of approximately $18.85 to $24.93 per share.

     Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.  CIBC World Markets performed a discounted
cash flow analysis of Exelixis to calculate the present value of the unlevered,
after-tax free cash flows that Exelixis could generate from the fourth quarter
of fiscal year 2001 to fiscal year 2004, based on internal estimates of
Exelixis' management. CIBC World Markets calculated a range of terminal values
for Exelixis' estimated revenue by applying terminal value multiples ranging
from 18.0x to 22.0x to Exelixis' projected fiscal year 2004 revenue. The present
value of the cash flows and terminal values were calculated using a discount
rate of 22.5%. This analysis indicated an implied equity reference range for
Exelixis of approximately $15.02 to $18.66 per share.

  Other Factors.

     In rendering its opinion, CIBC World Markets also reviewed and considered
other factors, including:

     - a comparison of the average daily closing prices of Genomica common stock
       and Exelixis common stock during the one year period preceding November
       16, 2001;

     - historical market prices and trading volumes for Genomica common stock
       and Exelixis common stock;

     - the relationship between movements in Genomica common stock and Exelixis
       common stock and movements in the S&P Biotech Index and NASDAQ Biotech
       Index; and

     - selected research analysts' reports for Genomica and Exelixis, including
       stock price estimates of those analysts.

  Miscellaneous.

     Genomica selected CIBC World Markets as its exclusive financial advisor in
connection with the exchange offer and the merger based on CIBC World Markets'
reputation, expertise and familiarity with Genomica and its business. CIBC World
Markets is an internationally recognized investment banking firm and, as a
customary part of its investment banking business, is regularly engaged in
valuations of businesses and securities in connection with acquisitions and
mergers, underwritings, secondary distributions of securities, private
placements and valuations for other purposes.

     Genomica has agreed to pay CIBC World Markets' customary fees for its
financial advisory services. In addition, Genomica has agreed to reimburse CIBC
World Markets for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable
fees and expenses of its legal counsel, and to indemnify CIBC World Markets and
related parties against liabilities, including liabilities under the federal
securities laws, relating to, or arising out of, its engagement. CIBC World
Markets in the past has provided services to Genomica unrelated to the exchange
offer and the merger, for which services CIBC World Markets has received
compensation. In the ordinary course of business, CIBC World Markets and its
affiliates may actively trade the securities of Genomica and Exelixis for their
own account and for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, may at any time
hold a long or short position in such securities.

  EXELIXIS' REASONS FOR THE EXCHANGE OFFER AND THE MERGER

     Our primary reasons for seeking to consummate a business combination with
Genomica are the beliefs of our board of directors and management that a
business combination would result in a number of benefits, including:

     - access to additional cash enabling us to fund our research and
       development programs at a higher level to enhance our core technologies
       and expand product development;

     - the opportunity to leverage our infrastructure and technologies to create
       additional corporate collaborations to diversify our business risk and
       increase our future revenue stream; and

     - access to complementary technology and expertise to advance the drug
       discovery and development process at Exelixis.

     The Exelixis board of directors has determined that the exchange offer and
merger are in the best interests of Exelixis. In reaching its determination, the
Exelixis board of directors considered a number of factors, including the
factors discussed above and listed below. The conclusions of the Exelixis board
of directors with respect to each of these factors supported its determination
that the merger and the issuance of shares of Exelixis common stock in the
exchange offer and the merger are in the best interests of Exelixis. The most
relevant information reviewed and factors considered are set forth below:

     - the opportunity to obtain additional cash to fund existing and new
       research and development programs to enhance our core technologies and
       expand product development;

     - the strategic benefits of the merger to Exelixis associated with the
       integration of Genomica's intellectual property and expertise in drug
       discovery and development processes;

     - the judgment, advice and analyses of our management with respect to the
       potential strategic, financial and operational benefits of the merger,
       including our management's favorable recommendation of the merger, based
       in part on the business, technical, financial, scientific, accounting and
       legal due diligence investigations performed with respect to Genomica;

     - the complementary fit between Exelixis' and Genomica's research
       expertise, which should facilitate integration of the two companies; and

     - the terms of the merger agreement and related agreements, including price
       and structure, which were considered by both the board of directors and
       management of Exelixis to provide a fair and equitable basis for the
       merger.

     The Exelixis board of directors also considered a number of potentially
negative factors in its deliberations concerning the exchange offer and the
merger. The negative factors considered by the Exelixis board of directors
included:

     - the risk that the merger might not be completed in a timely manner or at
       all and the expense and time associated with this risk;

     - the negative impact of any corporate partner confusion or concern
       regarding ongoing research programs after announcement of the proposed
       merger;

     - the potential negative effect on the Exelixis common stock price if
       revenue from new or existing collaborations of the combined company are
       not met;

     - the general difficulties of integrating research programs, research
       collaborations, technologies and companies; and

     - the other risks and uncertainties discussed above under "Risk Factors."

     The above discussion of information and factors considered by the Exelixis
board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive but we believe it includes
all material factors considered by the board. In view of the wide variety of
factors considered by the Exelixis board of directors, the Exelixis board of
directors did not find it practicable to quantify or otherwise assign relative
weights to the specific factors considered. In addition, the board of directors
did not reach any specific conclusion on each factor considered, or any aspect
of any particular factor, but conducted an overall analysis of these factors.
Individual members of the Exelixis board of directors may have given different
weights to different factors. After taking into account all of the factors set
forth above, however, the Exelixis board of directors unanimously agreed that
the merger agreement and the exchange offer and merger are in the best interests
of Exelixis and that we should proceed with the exchange offer and merger.

     There can be no assurance that the benefits of the potential growth,
synergies or opportunities considered by the Exelixis board of directors will be
achieved through consummation of the merger. For additional information, see the
section of this prospectus entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on page 17.

THE MINIMUM TENDER CONDITION

     Our obligation to accept for exchange and to deliver shares of Exelixis
common stock in exchange for shares of Genomica common stock is subject to the
condition that the total number of shares of Genomica common stock validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn, when added to any shares of Genomica common
stock owned by Exelixis and Bluegreen Acquisition Sub, is equal to at least the
sum of a majority of the total number of shares of Genomica common stock plus
the total number of shares of Genomica common stock issuable upon exercise of
options to acquire Genomica common stock, each as outstanding immediately before
the expiration date of the exchange offer, as it may be extended pursuant to the
merger agreement. For purposes of computing the minimum tender condition, we
will not take into account any shares of Genomica common stock tendered into the
exchange offer pursuant to a Notice of Guaranteed Delivery unless stock
certificates or book-entry confirmations are actually received by the exchange
agent.

     Based on information supplied to us by Genomica, the number of shares
needed to satisfy the minimum tender condition as of December 26, 2001, would
have been 13,104,251.

     Our obligation to accept shares of Genomica common stock for exchange in
the exchange offer is also subject to several other conditions referred to in
the section entitled "Certain Terms of the Merger Agreement -- Conditions to the
Exchange Offer" beginning on page 68.

EXTENSION, TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

     Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, we may extend the exchange
offer for successive periods not in excess of 10 business days per extension if,
at the scheduled expiration date of the exchange offer, any condition to the
exchange offer has not been satisfied or, where permissible, waived. In
addition, we are entitled to extend the exchange offer if required by the rules
of the Securities and Exchange Commission or the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. We are not making any assurance that we will exercise
our right to extend our exchange offer, although we currently intend to do so
until all conditions have been satisfied or if permissible, waived. During an
extension, all shares of Genomica common stock previously tendered and not
properly withdrawn will remain subject to the exchange offer, subject to your
right to withdraw your shares of Genomica common stock. You should read the
discussion below in the section entitled "Withdrawal Rights" for more details.

     We reserve the right to make any changes in the terms and conditions of the
exchange offer by giving oral or written notice of the change to the exchange
agent and by making a public announcement. However, without the prior written
consent of Genomica, we cannot:

     - decrease the number of shares of Genomica common stock sought in the
       exchange offer;

     - make any changes to the form or amount of consideration to be issued or
       paid for shares of Genomica common stock in the exchange offer;

     - impose any additional conditions on the exchange offer other than those
       already described in the merger agreement;

     - amend or waive the minimum tender condition or other specified conditions
       as described in the merger agreement in any manner which is adverse to
       Genomica stockholders;

     - extend the initial expiration date of the exchange offer, except under
       circumstances described in the merger agreement; or

     - make any other change to the terms and conditions of the exchange offer
       which is adverse to Genomica stockholders.

     We are required to follow any extension, termination, amendment or delay,
as promptly as practicable, with a public announcement. In the case of an
extension, the announcement is required to be issued no later than 9:00 a.m.,
New York City time, on the next business day after the previously scheduled
expiration date. Subject to applicable law, including Rules 14d-4(d) and
14d-6(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which require that any
material change in the information published, sent or given to stockholders in

connection with the exchange offer be promptly sent to stockholders in a manner
reasonably designed to inform stockholders of the change, and without limiting
the manner in which we may choose to make any public announcement, we assume no
obligation to publish, advertise or otherwise communicate any public
announcement other than by making a release to the Dow Jones News Service.

     If we make a material change in the terms of the exchange offer or the
information concerning the exchange offer, or if we waive a material condition
of the exchange offer, we will extend the exchange offer to the extent required
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If, before the expiration date and
after obtaining Genomica's prior written consent, we change the percentage of
shares of Genomica common stock being sought or the consideration offered to
you, that change will apply to all stockholders whose shares of Genomica common
stock are accepted for exchange pursuant to the exchange offer. If at the time
notice of that change is first published, sent or given to you, the exchange
offer is scheduled to expire at any time earlier than the tenth business day
from and including the date that the notice is first so published, sent or
given, we are required to extend the exchange offer until the expiration of that
10 business day period. For purposes of the exchange offer, a "business day"
means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or federal holiday and consists of
the time period from 12:01 a.m. through 12:00 midnight, New York City time.

SUBSEQUENT OFFERING PERIOD

     We may elect to provide a subsequent offering period of not less than three
nor more than 20 business days after the acceptance of shares of Genomica common
stock in the exchange offer if the requirements of Rule 14d-11 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 have been met. You will not have the right to
withdraw any shares of Genomica common stock that you tender during the
subsequent offering period. We are required to accept for exchange, and to
deliver shares of Exelixis common stock in exchange for, shares of Genomica
common stock that are validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, promptly
after they are tendered during any subsequent offering period. If we elect to
provide a subsequent offering period, we are required to make a public
announcement to that effect no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the
next business day after the previously scheduled expiration date.

EXCHANGE OF SHARES OF GENOMICA COMMON STOCK; DELIVERY OF SHARES OF EXELIXIS
COMMON STOCK

     We are required to accept for exchange, and to deliver shares of Exelixis
common stock in exchange for, shares of Genomica common stock that are validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn, promptly after the expiration date, upon
the terms and conditions to the exchange offer including the terms and
conditions of any extension or amendment. In addition, we are required to accept
for exchange, and to deliver shares of Exelixis common stock in exchange for,
shares of Genomica common stock promptly after they are validly tendered during
any subsequent offering period, upon the terms and conditions to the exchange
offer, including the terms and conditions of any extension or termination.
Subject to applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, we
reserve the right to delay acceptance for exchange, or the exchange of, shares
of Genomica common stock in order to comply with any applicable law. In all
cases, exchange of shares of Genomica common stock tendered and accepted for
exchange pursuant to the exchange offer will be made only after timely receipt
by the exchange agent of:

     - certificates for the shares of Genomica common stock (or a confirmation
       of a book-entry transfer of the shares of Genomica common stock in the
       exchange agent's account at The Depository Trust Company, which we refer
       to in this prospectus as "DTC");

     - a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal or a
       manually signed facsimile of that document; and

     - any other required documents.

     For purposes of the exchange offer, we will be deemed to have accepted for
exchange shares of Genomica common stock validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn if and when we notify the exchange agent of our acceptance of the
tenders of those shares of Genomica common stock pursuant to the exchange offer.
The exchange agent is required to then deliver shares of Exelixis common stock
and cash instead of fractional shares of Exelixis common stock in exchange for
the shares of Genomica common stock promptly after receipt of our notice. The
exchange agent will act as agent for tendering stockholders for the purpose of
receiving

shares of Exelixis common stock and any cash to be paid instead of any
fractional shares of Exelixis common stock and transmitting a certificate or
certificates for Exelixis common stock and cash, if any, to you. You will not
receive any interest on any cash that we pay you, even if there is a delay in
making the exchange.

     If we do not accept any tendered shares of Genomica common stock for
exchange pursuant to the terms and conditions of the exchange offer for any
reason, or if certificates are submitted for more shares of Genomica common
stock than are accepted, we are required to return certificates for the
unexchanged shares of Genomica common stock to the tendering stockholder. In the
case of shares of Genomica common stock tendered by book-entry transfer of such
shares of Genomica common stock into the exchange agent's account at one of the
addresses on the back page of this prospectus, pursuant to the procedures
described below in the section entitled "-- Procedure for Tendering," those
shares of Genomica common stock will be credited to an account maintained within
DTC, as soon as practicable following expiration or termination of the exchange
offer.

     If we increase the consideration offered to Genomica stockholders in the
exchange offer before the expiration date, such increased consideration will be
given to all stockholders whose shares of Genomica common stock are tendered
pursuant to the exchange offer, whether or not such shares of Genomica common
stock were tendered or accepted for exchange before such increase in
consideration.

CASH INSTEAD OF FRACTIONAL SHARES OF EXELIXIS COMMON STOCK

     We will not issue fractional shares of our common stock in the exchange
offer. Instead, each tendering stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to a
fraction of a share of Exelixis common stock (after aggregating all fractional
shares of Exelixis common stock that otherwise would be received by the holder)
will receive cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal
to the product obtained by multiplying:

     - that fraction of a share of Exelixis common stock to which this
       stockholder is entitled (after aggregating all fractional shares of
       Exelixis common stock that otherwise would be received by this
       stockholder), by

     - the closing sales price of one share of Exelixis common stock on the
       Nasdaq National Market (as reported in The Wall Street Journal or, if not
       reported in The Wall Street Journal, any other authoritative source) on
       the date we first accept shares for exchange in the exchange offer.

WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS

     Your tender of shares of Genomica common stock pursuant to the exchange
offer is irrevocable, except that, shares of Genomica common stock tendered
pursuant to the exchange offer may be withdrawn at any time before our
acceptance of them for exchange pursuant to the exchange offer. If we elect to
provide a subsequent offering period in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, you will not have the right to withdraw shares
of Genomica common stock that you tender during the subsequent offering period.
Once we accept shares of Genomica common stock pursuant to the exchange offer,
your tender is irrevocable.

     For your withdrawal to be effective, the exchange agent must receive from
you a written, telex or facsimile transmission notice of withdrawal at one of
its addresses on the back cover of this prospectus, and your notice must include
your name, address, social security number, the certificate number(s) and the
number of shares of Genomica common stock to be withdrawn as well as the name of
the registered holder, if it is different from that of the person who tendered
the shares of Genomica common stock.

     A financial institution must guarantee all signatures on the notice of
withdrawal unless the shares of Genomica common stock have been tendered for the
account of an eligible institution. Most banks, savings and loan associations
and brokerage houses are able to provide these signature guarantees for you. The
financial institution must be an "eligible institution" which means it is a
participant in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program.

     If shares of Genomica common stock have been tendered pursuant to the
procedures for book-entry tender discussed under the caption below entitled
"Procedure for Tendering," any notice of withdrawal must specify the name and
number of the account at DTC to be credited with the withdrawn shares of
Genomica common stock and must otherwise comply with DTC's procedures. If
certificates have been delivered or otherwise identified to the exchange agent,
the name of the registered stockholder and the serial numbers of the particular
certificates evidencing the shares of Genomica common stock withdrawn must also
be furnished to the exchange agent, as stated above, before the physical release
of the certificates. We will decide all questions regarding the form and
validity (including time of receipt) of any notice of withdrawal, in our sole
discretion, and our decision shall be final and binding.

     None of Exelixis, the exchange agent, the information agent nor any other
person will be under any duty to give notification of any defects or
irregularities in any notice of withdrawal or will incur any liability for
failure to give proper notification. Any shares of Genomica common stock
properly withdrawn will be deemed not to have been validly tendered for purposes
of the exchange offer. However, you may retender withdrawn shares of Genomica
common stock by following one of the procedures discussed below in the sections
entitled "Procedure for Tendering" or "Guaranteed Delivery" at any time before
the expiration date.

PROCEDURE FOR TENDERING

     For you to validly tender shares of Genomica common stock pursuant to the
exchange offer, (i) the enclosed letter of transmittal, properly completed and
duly executed or a manually executed facsimile of that document, along with any
required signature guarantees or an agent's message in connection with a
book-entry transfer and any other required documents must be transmitted to and
received by the exchange agent at one of the addresses on the back cover of this
prospectus and certificates for tendered shares of Genomica common stock must be
received by the exchange agent at that address or the shares of Genomica common
stock must be tendered pursuant to the procedures for book-entry tender
described below (and a confirmation of receipt of the tender received, which we
refer to below as a "book-entry confirmation"), in each case before the
expiration date, or (ii) you must comply with the guaranteed delivery procedures
described below in the section entitled "Guaranteed Delivery."

     The term "agent's message" means a message, transmitted by DTC to, and
received by, the exchange agent and forming a part of a book-entry confirmation,
which states that DTC has received an express acknowledgment from the
participant in DTC tendering the shares of Genomica common stock which are the
subject of the book-entry confirmation, the participant has received and agrees
to be bound by the terms of the letter of transmittal and we may enforce that
agreement against the participant.

     The exchange agent is required to establish accounts with respect to the
shares of Genomica common stock at DTC for purposes of the exchange offer by
November 29, 2001, and any financial institution that is a participant in DTC
may make book-entry delivery of the shares of Genomica common stock by causing
DTC to transfer tendered shares of Genomica common stock into the exchange
agent's account in accordance with DTC's procedure for the transfer. However,
although delivery of shares of Genomica common stock may be effected through
book-entry transfer at DTC, the letter of transmittal (or a manually signed
facsimile of the letter of transmittal) with any required signature guarantees
or an agent's message in connection with a book-entry transfer and any other
required documents must, in any case, be transmitted to and received by the
exchange agent at one of the addresses on the back cover of this prospectus
before the expiration date, or the guaranteed delivery procedures described
below must be followed.

     Signatures on all letters of transmittal must be guaranteed by an eligible
institution, except in cases in which shares of Genomica common stock are
tendered either by a registered holder of shares of Genomica common stock who
has not completed the box entitled "Special Issuance Instructions" or the box
entitled "Special Delivery Instructions" on the letter of transmittal or for the
account of an eligible institution.

     If the certificates for shares of Genomica common stock are registered in
the name of a person other than the person who signs the letter of transmittal
or if certificates for unexchanged shares of Genomica common stock are to be
issued to a person other than the registered holder(s), the certificates must be
endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers in either case signed
exactly as the name or names of the registered

owner or owners appear on the certificates, with the signature(s) on the
certificates or stock powers guaranteed in the manner we have described above.

     The method of delivery of Genomica stock certificates and all other
required documents, including delivery through DTC, is at your option and risk,
and the delivery will be deemed made only when actually received by the exchange
agent. If delivery is by mail, we recommend registered mail with return receipt
requested, properly insured. In all cases, you should allow sufficient time to
ensure timely delivery.

GUARANTEED DELIVERY

     If you wish to tender shares of Genomica common stock pursuant to the
exchange offer and your certificates are not immediately available or you cannot
deliver the certificates and all other required documents to the exchange agent
before the expiration date or cannot complete the procedure for book-entry
transfer on a timely basis, your shares of Genomica common stock may
nevertheless be tendered, so long as all of the following conditions are
satisfied:

     - you make your tender by or through an eligible institution;

     - the enclosed notice of guaranteed delivery, properly completed and duly
       executed, substantially in the form enclosed with this prospectus, is
       received by the exchange agent as provided below on or before the
       expiration date; and

     - the certificates for all tendered shares of Genomica common stock (or a
       confirmation of a book-entry transfer of tendered securities into the
       exchange agent's account at DTC as described above), in proper form for
       transfer, together with a properly completed and duly executed letter of
       transmittal or a manually signed facsimile thereof, with any required
       signature guarantees (or, in the case of a book-entry transfer, an
       agent's message), and all other documents required by the letter of
       transmittal are received by the exchange agent within three Nasdaq
       National Market trading days after the date of execution of the notice of
       guaranteed delivery.

     You may deliver the notice of guaranteed delivery by hand or transmit it by
facsimile transmission or mail it to the exchange agent, and you must include a
signature guarantee by an eligible institution in the form provided in that
notice.

     In all cases, we are required to exchange shares of Genomica common stock
tendered and accepted for exchange pursuant to the exchange offer only after
timely receipt by the exchange agent of certificates for shares of Genomica
common stock (or timely confirmation of a book-entry transfer of tendered
securities into the exchange agent's account at DTC as described above),
properly completed and duly executed letter(s) of transmittal (or manually
signed facsimile(s) thereof) or an agent's message in connection with a
book-entry transfer, and any other required documents.

EFFECT OF TENDER

     By executing a letter of transmittal as described above, you irrevocably
appoint our designees as your attorneys-in-fact and proxies, each with full
power of substitution, to the full extent of your rights with respect to your
shares of Genomica common stock tendered and accepted for exchange by Exelixis
and with respect to any and all other shares of Genomica common stock and other
securities (other than the shares of Exelixis common stock) issued or issuable
in respect of the shares of Genomica common stock on or after December 28, 2001.
That appointment is effective if and when, and only to the extent that, we
accept the shares of Genomica common stock for exchange pursuant to the exchange
offer. All of these proxies shall be considered coupled with an interest in the
tendered shares of Genomica common stock and therefore shall not be revocable.
Upon the effectiveness of the appointment, all prior proxies that you have given
will be revoked, and you may not give any subsequent proxies (and, if given,
they will not be deemed effective). Our designees will, with respect to the
shares of Genomica common stock for which the appointment is effective, be
empowered, among other things, to exercise all of your voting and other rights
as they, in their sole discretion, deem proper at any annual, special or
adjourned meeting of Genomica stockholders or otherwise. We reserve the right to
require that, in order for shares of Genomica common stock to be deemed validly
tendered, immediately upon our exchange of the shares, we must be able to
exercise full voting rights with respect to the tendered shares of Genomica
common stock.

     We will determine questions regarding the validity, form, eligibility
(including time of receipt) and acceptance for exchange of any tender of shares
of Genomica common stock, in our sole discretion, and our determination shall be
final and binding. We reserve the absolute right to reject any and all tenders
of shares of Genomica common stock that we determine are not in proper form or
the acceptance of or exchange for which may, in the opinion of our counsel, be
unlawful. We also reserve the absolute right to waive any defect or irregularity
in the tender of any shares of Genomica common stock. No tender of shares of
Genomica common stock will be deemed to have been validly made until all defects
and irregularities in tenders of shares of Genomica common stock have been cured
or waived. None of Exelixis, the exchange agent, the information agent nor any
other person will be under any duty to give notification of any defects or
irregularities in the tender of any shares of Genomica common stock or will
incur any liability for failure to give notification. Our interpretation of the
terms and conditions of the exchange offer (including the letter of transmittal
and instructions thereto) will be final and binding.

     The tender of shares of Genomica common stock pursuant to any of the
procedures described above will constitute a binding agreement between us and
you upon the terms and subject to the conditions to the exchange offer.

INTERESTS OF GENOMICA'S OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE TRANSACTION

     Certain of Genomica's directors and officers may have interests in the
exchange offer and the merger that may be different from, or in addition to,
their interest as Genomica stockholders. You should be aware of those interests
when considering the unanimous recommendation of the Genomica board that
Genomica stockholders accept the exchange offer.

  Treatment of Stock Options

     The merger agreement provides that Exelixis will not assume any Genomica
stock options. Under Genomica's option plans, the vesting of all Genomica stock
options that are not assumed in connection with a change in control (such as the
consummation of the exchange offer) automatically accelerates and the options
become fully vested and exercisable immediately upon the consummation of the
change in control. As a result, all options held by employees or non-employee
directors of Genomica will become fully vested and exercisable immediately upon
the time Exelixis accepts shares of Genomica common stock in the exchange offer.
Also, all of Genomica's options that are not exercised at or before the closing
of the exchange offer will terminate. Genomica officers and directors hold
options to purchase Genomica common stock as set forth below:

                                                                                NUMBER OF

                                                       SHARES SUBJECT TO     OPTIONS SUBJECT

(1) Assumes the closing of the exchange offer occurs on December 28, 2001.

  Treatment of Shares Subject to Repurchase

     Teresa W. Ayers and Daniel R. Hudspeth each own shares of Genomica common
stock that were issued upon the early exercise of certain of their stock options
and which are subject to repurchase by Genomica if Ms. Ayers or Mr. Hudspeth are
no longer employed by Genomica.

     At the time of the closing of the exchange offer, Genomica's option to
repurchase such shares of Genomica common stock from Ms. Ayers and Mr. Hudspeth
will terminate and 137,500 shares held by Ms. Ayers and 65,444 shares held by
Mr. Hudspeth will be released from the repurchase option.

  Exercise Agreements

     Under Genomica's option plans, the exercise price of an option may be
satisfied with a promissory note or other means of compensation or deferred
payment. Ms. Ayers, Dr. Marr and Messrs. Rubin, Hudspeth and Cohn have each
entered into exercise agreements with Genomica dated as of November 26, 2001 and
approved by Genomica's compensation committee. Under the terms of these exercise
agreements, Ms. Ayers, Dr. Marr and Messrs. Rubin, Hudspeth and Cohn may receive
a loan from Genomica in an amount equal to the total exercise price of specified
options. The exercise agreements provide that such loans will:

     - bear a market rate of interest determined at the time the loan is made;

     - be secured by the Genomica common stock issued upon exercise of the
       options and, following the tender of Genomica common stock pursuant to
       the exchange offer, by the Exelixis common stock received in exchange for
       the tendered shares of Genomica common stock;

     - be full recourse as to the executive; and

     - be payable 45 days following expiration of the 90-day lock-up period
       described below.

In accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, Exelixis has consented to
these agreements. A complete form of the agreement regarding stock option
exercise is attached as Annex D to this prospectus and is incorporated into this
prospectus by reference.

     In connection with the merger agreement, the directors, officers and
certain affiliates of Genomica have agreed not to sell or otherwise dispose of
Exelixis common stock for 90 days following the date we first accept for payment
shares in the exchange offer. We have agreed to waive the provisions of the
lock-up agreements for Ms. Ayers, Dr. Marr and Messrs. Rubin, Hudspeth and Cohn
to enable them to sell the number of shares of Exelixis common stock necessary
to satisfy any tax obligations that they may incur as a result of exercises of
options to acquire Genomica common stock. A form of the partial waiver of the
lock-up agreement is attached as Annex E to this prospectus and is incorporated
into this prospectus by reference.

INDEMNIFICATION

     The merger agreement provides that all rights to indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses existing in favor of individuals who, on
or before the date of completion of the merger, were officers or directors of
Genomica and any of its subsidiaries, as provided in Genomica's certificate of
incorporation or bylaws, or in an agreement between one of the above parties and
Genomica, as in effect November 19, 2001, will survive the merger and continue
in full force and effect for a period of five years from the effective time of
the merger.

     After completion of the merger, Exelixis is required to indemnify and hold
harmless the individuals who on or before the completion of the merger were
officers or directors of Genomica and any of its subsidiaries to the same extent
as set forth in the preceding paragraph.

     The merger agreement also provides that for five years after completion of
the Merger, Genomica, as the surviving corporation in the merger, will provide
officers' and directors' liability insurance with respect to acts or omissions
occurring before completion of the merger, covering each Genomica officer and
director covered by Genomica's officers' and directors' liability insurance
policy as of November 19, 2001, on terms at least as favorable as those of the
policy in effect on November 19, 2001. However, Genomica is not required to pay
annual premiums in excess of 150% of current annual premiums paid by Genomica to
maintain or procure insurance coverage.

MANAGEMENT OF EXELIXIS AFTER THE TRANSACTION

     The management of Exelixis after the transaction will remain unchanged.
Information about the current directors and executive officers of Exelixis can
be found in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000 which is
incorporated by reference into this prospectus. See the section of this
prospectus entitled "Where You Can Find More Information" beginning on page 102
for information on where these additional documents may be found.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

     The following discussion sets forth the material U.S. federal income tax
considerations of the transaction generally applicable to holders of shares of
Genomica common stock who exchange their shares of Genomica common stock for
shares of Exelixis common stock in the exchange offer or have their shares of
Genomica common stock converted into shares of Exelixis common stock in the
merger. This discussion and the tax opinions described below are based on the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (also referred to in this discussion as the
"Code"), applicable Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations and
court decisions in effect as of the date of this prospectus, all of which may
change, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change could alter the tax
consequences described in this summary and the tax opinions.

     This discussion of material federal income tax consequences of the
transaction is not intended to provide a complete analysis or description of all
potential federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer or the merger.
It does not address all aspects of federal income taxation that may be important
to a holder of shares of Genomica common stock in light of that stockholder's
particular circumstances or to a stockholder subject to special rules, such as:

     - a foreign entity or an individual stockholder who is not a citizen or
       resident of the U.S.;

     - a financial institution or insurance company;

     - a tax-exempt organization;

     - a dealer or broker in securities;

     - a stockholder who is subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of
       the Code;

     - a stockholder whose shares are qualified small business stock for
       purposes of Section 1202 of the Code;

     - a stockholder who holds shares of Genomica common stock as part of a
       hedge, appreciated financial position, straddle, constructive sale,
       conversion transaction or other risk reduction transaction;

     - a stockholder who acquired shares of Genomica common stock pursuant to
       the exercise of incentive stock options, or who holds shares of Genomica
       common stock that are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture;

     - a stockholder who exercises appraisal rights; or

     - a stockholder who does not hold shares of Genomica common stock as
       capital assets.

     In addition, this discussion does not address any state, local or foreign
income tax or non-income tax consequences of the exchange offer or the merger or
of any transactions other than the exchange offer and the merger. EXELIXIS AND
GENOMICA URGE HOLDERS OF SHARES OF GENOMICA COMMON STOCK TO CONSULT THEIR OWN
TAX ADVISORS TO DETERMINE THE PARTICULAR FEDERAL INCOME TAX OR OTHER TAX
CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF PARTICIPATION IN THE EXCHANGE OFFER OR THE MERGER.

     Qualification of the Exchange Offer and the Merger as a
Reorganization.  Based on the representations of Exelixis and Genomica and
subject to the assumptions and limitations discussed in such opinions, Heller
Ehrman White & McAuliffe LLP, counsel to Exelixis, and Cooley Godward LLP,
counsel to Genomica, have provided opinions that the transaction will be treated
for federal income tax purposes as an integrated

reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code if all of the
following factual assumptions (also referred to as the "supporting conditions")
are met:

     - the exchange offer and the merger are completed under the current terms
       of the merger agreement;

     - the minimum tender condition for the exchange offer is satisfied; and

     - the merger is completed promptly after the exchange offer.

     The completion of the exchange offer is conditioned upon these opinions
having been given and not withdrawn. These opinions are based upon
representations and covenants made by Exelixis and Genomica, including
representations in certificates of officers of Exelixis and Genomica to be
delivered to tax counsel before completion of the exchange offer, and upon
certain assumptions, including the absence of changes in facts or in law between
the date of the completion of the exchange offer and the completion of the
merger. If any of those representations, covenants or assumptions is inaccurate,
the tax consequences of the transaction could differ materially from those
summarized below. In addition, the ability to satisfy the supporting conditions
depends in part on facts that will not be available before the completion of the
merger. There can be no assurance that the merger will be completed, or that the
supporting conditions will be satisfied. If the supporting conditions are not
satisfied, the opinions of Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe LLP and Cooley
Godward LLP described above may not be relied upon. Furthermore, Heller Ehrman
White & McAuliffe LLP's and Cooley Godward LLP's opinions represent only their
best judgment of the tax consequences of the exchange offer and the merger. Such
opinions neither bind the Internal Revenue Service nor preclude the Internal
Revenue Service or the courts from adopting a contrary position. No ruling has
been or will be requested from the Internal Revenue Service in connection with
the transaction. Accordingly, it is possible that the exchange offer or the
merger may not qualify as a reorganization, and the tax consequences of the
transaction could differ materially from those summarized below. For a further
discussion, see the section entitled "U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences if
the Exchange Offer and the Merger Do Not Qualify as a Reorganization" below.

     The opinions referred to above provide that if the transaction qualifies as
an integrated tax-free reorganization, for federal income tax purposes:

     - A holder of shares of Genomica common stock will not recognize any gain
       or loss on the exchange in the exchange offer or the conversion in the
       merger of shares of Genomica common stock for Exelixis shares.

     - If a holder of shares of Genomica common stock receives cash instead of
       fractional shares of Exelixis common stock, the stockholder will be
       required to recognize capital gain or loss, measured by the difference
       between the amount of cash received instead of that fraction of a share
       and the portion of the tax basis of that holder's shares of Genomica
       common stock allocable to that fraction of a share. This gain or loss
       will be long-term capital gain or loss if the holder of shares of
       Genomica common stock has held the shares of Genomica common stock
       exchanged for that fraction of a Exelixis share for more than one year at
       the time the shares of Genomica common stock are accepted in the exchange
       offer or converted at the completion of the merger, as the case may be.
       The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations for both
       individuals and corporations.

     - A holder of shares of Genomica common stock will have a tax basis in the
       shares of Exelixis common stock received in the exchange offer or the
       merger equal to (i) the tax basis in the shares of Genomica common stock
       surrendered by that stockholder in the exchange offer or the merger,
       reduced by (ii) any tax basis in the shares of Genomica common stock that
       is allocable to a fraction of a share of Exelixis common stock for which
       cash is received.

     - The holding period for shares of Exelixis common stock received in
       exchange for shares of Genomica common stock in the exchange offer or the
       merger will include the holding period for shares of Genomica common
       stock surrendered in the exchange offer or the merger.

     - Genomica will not recognize gain or loss as a result of the transaction.

     U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences if the Exchange Offer and the Merger
Do Not Qualify as a Reorganization.  The tax consequences described above are
based on factual assumptions, representations and covenants, including the
satisfaction of the supporting conditions. If any of those factual assumptions,
representations or covenants are not satisfied or observed, or in the event of a
contrary ruling by the Internal Revenue Service or a court, the federal income
tax consequences of the transaction to holders of shares of Genomica common
stock could differ materially from those summarized above in the section
entitled "Qualification of the Exchange Offer and the Merger as a
Reorganization." In that event, exchanges by Genomica stockholders pursuant to
the exchange offer or the conversion of Genomica shares in the merger could be
taxable transactions for federal income tax purposes depending on the particular
facts surrounding the exchange offer or the merger, some of which may not be
known until after completion of the merger.

     If the exchange offer or the merger, or both, are taxable, each Genomica
stockholder participating in the exchange offer or the merger, as applicable,
will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the fair market value of the
Exelixis shares (together with any cash instead of fractional shares of Exelixis
common stock) received by the stockholder less the stockholder's tax basis in
the shares of Genomica common stock surrendered. This gain or loss will be
long-term capital gain or loss if the stockholder had held the shares of
Genomica common stock for more than one year at the time the shares of Genomica
common stock are accepted in the exchange offer or converted at the completion
of the merger, as applicable.

     U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences if the Merger is Not Completed.  No
opinion has been given concerning any tax consequences of the exchange offer if
the merger is not completed, or if the merger is not completed promptly after
the exchange offer. Except as described under this heading, if the merger is not
completed, exchanges pursuant to the exchange offer generally will be taxable
transactions for federal income tax purposes with the consequences described
above in the section entitled "U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences if the
Exchange Offer and the Merger Do Not Qualify as a Reorganization."

     Even if the merger is not completed, the exchange offer will still be
treated for federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code so long as the following conditions are met:

     - Exelixis acquires at least 80% of the shares of Genomica common stock in
       the exchange offer;

     - any acquisition of additional shares of Genomica common stock by Exelixis
       is not for consideration other than Exelixis voting stock; and

     - the other representations and covenants made by Exelixis and Genomica in
       the merger agreement and in their respective tax representation letters
       delivered to Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe LLP and Cooley Godward LLP
       pursuant to the merger agreement remain accurate.

     Whether these conditions will be satisfied will not be known at the time of
the exchange offer, and there can be no assurances that the conditions will be
satisfied.

     We urge each holder of shares of Genomica common stock to consult his or
her own tax advisor to determine the particular U.S. federal, state or local or
foreign income or other tax consequences of participation in the exchange offer
or the merger.

     U.S. Federal Backup Withholding; Reporting.  To prevent backup federal
income tax withholding with respect to cash, if any, received pursuant to the
exchange offer or the merger, you must either provide the exchange agent with
your correct taxpayer identification number and certify whether you are subject
to backup withholding of federal income tax by completing the substitute Form
W-9 included in the letter of transmittal or establish a basis for exemption
from backup withholding. Some stockholders (including, among others, all
corporations and some foreign individuals) are not subject to these backup
withholding and reporting requirements. In order for a foreign person to qualify
as an exempt recipient, the stockholder must generally submit a Form W-8BEN,
W-8ECI, W-8EXP or W-8IMY, as appropriate, signed under penalty of perjury,
attesting to that person's exempt status. Genomica stockholders who fail to
provide their correct taxpayer identification numbers and the appropriate
certifications or to establish an exemption as described above will be subject
to backup withholding on cash amounts received in the exchange offer or the
merger (at

a withholding rate of 30.5% for amounts received in 2001 and 30% for amounts
received in 2002) and may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the Internal
Revenue Service. If Exelixis withholds on a payment to you and the withholding
results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained from the Internal
Revenue Service. Cash amounts paid pursuant to the exchange offer or the merger
will be reported to Genomica stockholders and the Internal Revenue Service.

     Each Genomica stockholder who receives shares of Exelixis common stock in
the exchange offer or the merger is required to file a statement with his, her
or its federal income tax return setting forth the stockholder's basis in the
shares of Genomica common stock surrendered and the fair market value of
Exelixis common shares and the proceeds from the cash in lieu of fractional
shares received in the exchange offer and the merger and is required to retain
permanent records of these facts relating to the transaction.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     The transaction described in this prospectus will be accounted for as a
"purchase," as that term is used under generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States for accounting and financial reporting purposes. Genomica
will be treated as the acquired corporation for these purposes. Under the
purchase method of accounting, the aggregate consideration paid is allocated to
the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
on the basis of their respective fair values on the transaction date. The final
allocation of such consideration may differ from that reflected in the unaudited
pro forma condensed combined financial information. Exelixis does not expect
that the final allocation of the aggregate purchase price for the merger will
differ materially from the preliminary allocations. For more information, see
the section of the prospectus entitled "Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Combined Financial Statements" beginning on page 90.

REGULATORY APPROVALS

     Other than clearance under the antitrust laws applicable to the exchange
offer and merger which are described below, the Securities and Exchange
Commission declaring the registration statement on Form S-4 relating to this
transaction effective and the filing of a certificate of merger, or a
certificate of ownership and merger, as the case may be, under Delaware law with
respect to the merger, we do not believe that any additional material
governmental filings are required with respect to the exchange offer and merger.

APPROVAL OF THE MERGER

     Under Section 251 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware,
the approval of the board of directors of a company is required to approve a
merger agreement. Exelixis', Bluegreen Acquisition Sub's and Genomica's boards
of directors have unanimously approved the merger agreement.

     Under Section 251 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware,
except in certain circumstances, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least
a majority of a company's outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon is
required for stockholders to adopt a merger agreement. Exelixis, as the sole
stockholder of Bluegreen Acquisition Sub, has adopted the merger agreement.
Under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, Exelixis
stockholders are not required to approve the merger of Bluegreen Acquisition Sub
into Genomica.

     If, after completion of the exchange offer, we own more than 50% but less
than 90% of the outstanding shares of Genomica common stock, we will complete
the acquisition of the remaining outstanding shares of Genomica common stock
through a vote of Genomica stockholders with respect to the merger. Since we
will own a majority of the outstanding shares of Genomica common stock on the
record date, we will have a sufficient number of shares of Genomica common stock
to adopt the merger agreement without the affirmative vote of any other holder
of shares of Genomica common stock, and therefore, adoption of the merger
agreement by Genomica stockholders will be assured. Completion of the
transaction in this manner is referred to in this prospectus as a "long-form"
merger.

     Under Section 253 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware,
we can effect a merger without a vote of Genomica stockholders if, after
completion of the exchange offer, as it may be extended and including any
subsequent offering period, we own at least 90% of the outstanding shares of
Genomica common stock. Completion of the transaction in this manner is referred
to in this prospectus as a "short-form" merger.

AMENDMENT TO GENOMICA'S STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

     In connection with the approval of the merger agreement, the exchange offer
and the merger by the board of directors of Genomica, Genomica amended its
rights agreement, dated as of October 2, 2001, with Computershare Trust Company,
Inc. as rights agent. According to the amendment, none of the transactions
contemplated in the merger agreement, including the exchange offer and the
merger, will trigger any of the anti-takeover mechanisms in the rights plan. The
preferred stock purchase rights issued under this agreement currently are not
separately transferable and will be automatically tendered along with the shares
of common stock of Genomica in the exchange offer.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Genomica stockholders do not have appraisal rights in connection with the
exchange offer.

     If we complete the exchange offer but, upon completion of the exchange
offer, as it may be extended and including any subsequent offering period, we
own less than 90% of the outstanding shares of Genomica common stock, we have
agreed to effect a long-form merger, as described above. Assuming that the
shares of Genomica common stock remain listed on a national securities exchange
or designated as a national market system security on an interdealer quotation
system by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or are held of
record by more than 2,000 holders, Genomica stockholders who have not exchanged
their shares of Genomica common stock in the exchange offer will not have
appraisal rights in connection with a long-form merger. However, if a long-form
merger is consummated, and if, on the date fixed to determine stockholders
entitled to vote on the merger, the shares of Genomica common stock are not
listed on a national securities exchange or designated as a national market
system security on an interdealer quotation system by the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc. and are held of record by less than 2,000 holders,
you will have appraisal rights pursuant to the provisions of Section 262 of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as described below.

     If we complete the exchange offer and, upon completion of the exchange
offer, as it may be extended and including any subsequent offering period, we
own at least 90% of the outstanding shares of Genomica common stock, we have
agreed to effect a short-form merger, as described above. Genomica stockholders
at the time of a short-form merger will have the right under Section 262 of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware to demand appraisal of their
shares of Genomica common stock. Under Section 262, stockholders who comply with
the applicable statutory procedures under the Delaware General Corporation Law
will be entitled to receive a judicial determination of the fair value of their
shares of Genomica common stock (exclusive of any element of value arising from
the accomplishment or expectation of the merger) and to receive payment of this
fair value in cash, together with a fair rate of interest, if any. In Cede & Co.
and Cinerama, Inc. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Supreme Court of the State of
Delaware construed Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware and held that the "accomplishment or expectation" exclusion from the
calculation of fair value described in the preceding sentence is narrow and is
designed to eliminate use of pro forma data and projections of a speculative
variety relating to the completion of a merger. The court held that it is
appropriate to include in the calculation of fair value any known elements of
value. We cannot assure you what methodology a court would use to determine fair
value or how a court would select which elements of value are to be included in
its determination.

     If Genomica stockholders have appraisal rights in connection with the
merger, they will have to comply with specific statutory provisions under
Delaware law. The following is a brief summary of the statutory procedures that
must be followed by a Genomica stockholder in order to perfect appraisal rights
under Delaware law.

     THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS NOT A COMPLETE STATEMENT OF THE DELAWARE LAW
PERTAINING TO APPRAISAL RIGHTS AND IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY THE FULL TEXT
OF SECTION 262 OF THE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WHICH IS
ATTACHED TO THIS PROSPECTUS AS ANNEX F. BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF SECTION 262
AND THE NEED TO STRICTLY COMPLY WITH VARIOUS TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS, YOU SHOULD
READ ANNEX F IN ITS ENTIRETY. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES OF
GENOMICA COMMON STOCK HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A
BROKER OR NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW THE
STEPS SUMMARIZED BELOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER TO PERFECT APPRAISAL
RIGHTS.

     Under Section 262, where a merger is to be submitted for approval at a
meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days before the
meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to appraisal rights that
such appraisal rights are available and include in such notice a copy of Section
262.

     A holder of shares of Genomica common stock wishing to exercise such
holder's appraisal rights:

     - must deliver to Genomica, before the vote on the adoption of the merger
       agreement at the special meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of
       his or her shares; and

     - must not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement.

In order not to vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, a
stockholder must either:

     - not return a proxy card and not vote in person in favor of the adoption
       of the merger agreement,

     - return a proxy card with the "Against" or "Abstain" box checked,

     - vote in person against the adoption of the merger agreement, or

     - register in person an abstention from the proposal to adopt the merger
       agreement.

     ALL WRITTEN DEMANDS FOR APPRAISAL PURSUANT TO SECTION 262 SHOULD BE SENT OR
DELIVERED TO GENOMICA CORPORATION AT 1715 38TH STREET, BOULDER, COLORADO 80301,
ATTENTION: DANIEL R. HUDSPETH.

     A holder of shares of Genomica common stock wishing to exercise the
holder's appraisal rights must hold of record these shares on the date the
written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold these shares of
record through the effective time of the merger. A vote against the adoption of
the merger agreement will not in and of itself constitute a written demand for
appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The demand must reasonably
inform Genomica of the identity of the holder as well as the intention of the
holder to demand an appraisal of the "fair value" of the shares held by the
holder. A stockholder's failure to make the written demand before the taking of
the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting of
Genomica stockholders will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.

     Only a holder of record of shares of Genomica common stock is entitled to
assert appraisal rights for the shares of Genomica common stock registered in
that holder's name. The demand for appraisal in respect of shares of Genomica
common stock must be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, fully and
correctly, as the holder's name appears on the holder's stock certificates, and
must state that the holder intends by the demand for appraisal to demand
appraisal of the holder's shares of Genomica common stock in connection with the
merger. If the shares of Genomica common stock are owned of record in a
fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, the demand
should be executed in that capacity, and if the shares of Genomica common stock
are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in
common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An
authorized agent, including two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for
appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the
record owner or owners and expressly disclose the fact that in executing the
demand, the agent is acting as agent for the owner or owners. A record holder,
such as a broker who holds shares of Genomica common stock as nominee for
several beneficial owners, may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the
shares of Genomica common stock held for one or more beneficial owners while not
exercising such rights with respect to the shares of Genomica common stock held
for other beneficial owners. In this case, however, the written demand should
set forth the number of shares of Genomica common stock as to which appraisal is
sought, and if no number of shares of Genomica common stock is expressly
mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of Genomica common
stock held in the name of

the record owner. Stockholders who hold their shares of Genomica common stock in
brokerage accounts or other nominee forms and who wish to exercise appraisal
rights are urged to consult with their brokers to determine the appropriate
procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such a nominee.

     Within 10 days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving
corporation must notify each holder of Genomica common stock who has complied
with Section 262 and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement of the date that the merger has become effective. Within 120 days
after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation or any holder
of Genomica common stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to
appraisal rights under Section 262 may file a petition in the Delaware Court of
Chancery demanding a determination of the fair value of the holder's shares of
Genomica common stock. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to and
has no present intention to file such a petition. Accordingly, it is the
obligation of the holders of Genomica common stock to initiate all necessary
action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of Genomica
common stock within the time prescribed in Section 262.

     Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any holder of
Genomica common stock who has complied with the requirements for exercise of
appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the
surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares
not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, the aggregate number
of shares with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the
aggregate number of holders of these shares. This statement must be mailed
within 10 days after a written request for the statement has been received by
the surviving corporation or within 10 days after the expiration of the period
for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.

     If a petition for an appraisal is timely filed by a holder of shares of
Genomica common stock and a copy of the petition is served upon the surviving
corporation, the surviving corporation will then be obligated within 20 days to
file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded an appraisal of their
shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been
reached. After notice to these stockholders as required by the court, the
Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on such petition to
determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have
become entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262. The Delaware Court of
Chancery may require the holders of shares of Genomica common stock who demanded
payment for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Delaware
Register in Chancery for notation on the certificate of the pendency of the
appraisal proceeding. If any stockholder fails to comply with such direction,
the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to this
stockholder.

     After determining the holders of Genomica common stock entitled to
appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will appraise the "fair value" of
their shares of Genomica common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising
from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger. The Delaware Court of
Chancery will also determine the amount of interest, if any, to be paid upon the
amount determined to be the fair value. Holders of Genomica common stock
considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their
shares of Genomica common stock as so determined could be more than, the same as
or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they
did not seek appraisal of their shares of Genomica common stock and that
investment banking opinions as to fairness from a financial point of view are
not necessarily opinions as to fair value under Section 262. The Delaware
Supreme Court has stated that proof of value by any techniques or methods which
are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise
admissible in court should be considered in the appraisal proceedings. In
addition, Delaware courts have decided that the statutory appraisal remedy,
depending on factual circumstances, may or may not be a dissenter's exclusive
remedy. The costs of the action may be determined by the court and taxed upon
the parties as the court deems equitable. The court may also order that all or a
portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with an
appraisal, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and the
fees and expenses of experts utilized in the appraisal proceeding, be charged
pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised.

     Any holder of shares of Genomica common stock who has duly demanded an
appraisal in compliance with Section 262 will not, after the effective time of
the merger, be entitled to vote the shares of Genomica common stock subject to
this demand for any purpose. In addition, the shares subject to the demand will
not be entitled to the payment of dividends or other distributions on those
shares of Genomica common stock, except dividends or other distributions payable
to holders of record of Genomica common stock as of a record date before the
effective time of the merger.

     If any stockholder who demands appraisal of the holder's shares of Genomica
common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or effectively withdraws or
loses, the holder's right to appraisal, the shares of Genomica common stock of
the stockholder will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time of
the merger into the right to receive the merger consideration, without interest.
The number of shares of Exelixis common stock, and cash in lieu of a fraction of
a share of Exelixis common stock, delivered to the stockholder will be based on
the same exchange ratio utilized in the exchange offer and the merger,
regardless of the market price of Exelixis common stock at the time of delivery.
A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the
holder's right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120
days after the effective time of the merger, or if the stockholder delivers to
the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the holder's demand for
appraisal and an acceptance of the merger, except that any attempt to withdraw
made more than 60 days after the effective time of the merger will require the
written approval of the surviving corporation and, once a petition for appraisal
is filed, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to any holder absent
court approval.

     FAILURE TO FOLLOW THE STEPS REQUIRED BY SECTION 262 OF THE GENERAL
CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE FOR PERFECTING APPRAISAL RIGHTS MAY
RESULT IN THE LOSS OF THESE RIGHTS.

POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER

     Reduced Liquidity of Genomica Common Stock; Possibly No Longer Included for
Quotation.  The tender and exchange of shares of Genomica common stock pursuant
to the exchange offer will reduce the number of holders of shares of Genomica
common stock and the number of shares of Genomica common stock that might
otherwise trade publicly and could adversely affect the liquidity and market
value of the remaining shares of Genomica common stock held by the public.
Shares of Genomica common stock are included for listing and principally traded
on the Nasdaq National Market, or Nasdaq. Depending on the number of shares of
Genomica common stock acquired pursuant to the exchange offer, following
completion of the exchange offer, shares of Genomica common stock may no longer
meet the requirements of Nasdaq for continued listing. The requirements for
continued inclusion in Nasdaq, among other things, require that an issuer have
either:

     - at least 750,000 publicly held shares, held by at least 400 stockholders
       of round lots, with a market value of at least $5.0 million and net
       tangible assets of at least $4.0 million and at least two registered and
       active market makers for the shares; or

     - at least 1,100,000 publicly held shares, held by at least 400
       stockholders of round lots, with a market value of at least $15.0 million
       and at least four registered and active market markers, and either:

      - a market capitalization of at least $50.0 million; or

      - total assets and total revenue of at least $50.0 million each for the
        most recently completed fiscal year or two of the last three most
        recently completed fiscal years.

     Even if the requirements for continued inclusion in Nasdaq are not
satisfied, the shares might nevertheless continue to be included in a different
tier of Nasdaq with quotations published in the Nasdaq "additional list" or in
one of the "local lists," but if the number of holders of the shares fall below
300, the number of publicly held shares fall below 500,000 or there are not at
least two registered and active market makers for the shares, applicable Nasdaq
rules provide that the shares are no longer "qualified" for Nasdaq reporting and
Nasdaq would cease to provide any quotations. Shares held directly or indirectly
by directors, officers or beneficial owners of more than 10% of the shares are
not considered as being publicly held for this purpose. If, following the
completion of the exchange offer, the shares of Genomica no longer meet the

requirements for continued inclusion in the Nasdaq National Market or in any
other tier of Nasdaq and the shares are no longer included in the Nasdaq
National Market or in any other tier of Nasdaq, the market for shares of
Genomica common stock could be adversely affected.

     If the shares of Genomica common stock no longer meet the requirements for
continued inclusion in any tier of the Nasdaq, it is possible that the shares
would continue to trade in the over-the-counter market and that price quotations
would be reported by other sources. The extent of the public market for the
shares of Genomica common stock and the availability of quotations for shares of
Genomica common stock would, however, depend upon the number of holders or the
aggregate market value of the shares remaining at that time, the interest in
maintaining a market in shares of Genomica common stock on the part of
securities firms, the possible termination of registration of the shares under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as described below, and other factors. We
cannot predict whether the reduction in the number of shares of Genomica common
stock that might otherwise trade publicly would have an adverse or beneficial
effect on the market price for, or marketability of, the shares of Genomica
common stock.

     According to Genomica, as of December 26, 2001, there were approximately
23,065,643 shares of Genomica common stock outstanding.

     Status as "Margin Securities."  Shares of Genomica common stock are
presently "margin securities" under the regulations of the Federal Reserve
Board, which has the effect, among other things, of allowing brokers to extend
credit on the collateral of shares of Genomica common stock. Depending on
factors similar to those described above with respect to market quotations,
following completion of the exchange offer, the shares of Genomica common stock
may no longer constitute "margin securities" for the purposes of the Federal
Reserve Board's margin regulations, in which event the shares of Genomica common
stock would not be eligible as collateral for margin loans made by brokers.

     Registration under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Shares of Genomica
common stock are currently registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Genomica can terminate that registration upon application to the Securities and
Exchange Commission if the outstanding shares are not listed on a national
securities exchange or if there are fewer than 300 holders of record of shares
of Genomica common stock. After completion of the merger, Exelixis intends to
cause Genomica to terminate the registration of Genomica common stock under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Termination of registration of the shares of
Genomica common stock under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 would reduce the
information that Genomica must furnish to its stockholders and to the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN EXELIXIS AND GENOMICA

     Except for the Stockholder Tender Agreements or as otherwise described in
this prospectus, neither Exelixis nor, to the best of our knowledge, any of our

any of our directors, executive officers or other affiliates, on the one hand,

     Neither Exelixis nor, to the best of our knowledge, any of our directors,
executive officers or other affiliates beneficially owns or has any right to

executive officers or other affiliates has effected any transaction in shares of
Genomica common stock during the past 60 days.

                     CERTAIN TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The following description of the merger agreement describes the material
terms of the merger agreement. The complete text of the merger agreement is
attached as Annex A to this prospectus and is incorporated into this prospectus
by reference. We encourage all stockholders to read the entire merger agreement
carefully.

THE EXCHANGE OFFER

     Generally.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, we have begun an
exchange offer for all outstanding shares of Genomica common stock. In the
exchange offer, we are offering to exchange a portion of a share of Exelixis
common stock computed through an exchange ratio for each share of Genomica
common stock that is validly tendered and not properly withdrawn. For a
description of the exchange ratio, see the section entitled "The
Transaction -- The Exchange Ratio." The initial expiration date of the exchange
offer is December 28, 2001, the twentieth business day following its
commencement. The initial expiration date may be extended under certain
circumstances.

     Optional Extensions of the Exchange Offer.  If any condition to the
exchange offer is not satisfied or, if permissible, waived on any scheduled
expiration date of the exchange offer, we may extend the expiration date of the
exchange offer for successive extension periods of not more than 10 business
days per extension, until all conditions to the exchange offer are satisfied or,
if permissible, waived, or until the merger agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms. We also have the right to extend the exchange offer
to the extent required by the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission or the National Association of Securities Dealers.

     Subsequent Offering Period.  We may elect to provide a subsequent offering
period of not less than three nor more than 20 business days after the
acceptance of shares of Genomica common stock in the exchange offer if the
requirements of Rule 14d-11 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 have been
met. You will not have the right to withdraw any shares of Genomica common stock
that you tender during any subsequent offering period. During any subsequent
offer period, we are required to accept for exchange, and to deliver shares of
Exelixis common stock in exchange for, shares of Genomica common stock that are
validly tendered promptly after the tender of such shares. If we elect to
provide a subsequent offering period, we are required to make a public
announcement to that effect no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the
next business day after the previously scheduled expiration date of the exchange
offer.

     Prompt Payment for Shares of Genomica Common Stock in the Exchange
Offer.  Subject to the terms of the exchange offer and the merger agreement and
the satisfaction, or waiver to the extent permitted, of the conditions to the
exchange offer, we are required to accept for exchange all shares of Genomica
common stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the
exchange offer as soon as practicable after the applicable expiration date of
the exchange offer, as it may be extended pursuant to the merger agreement, and
are required to exchange all accepted shares of Genomica common stock promptly
after acceptance.

     We will not issue certificates representing fractional shares of our common
stock in the exchange offer. Instead, each tendering stockholder who would
otherwise be entitled to a fractional share (after aggregating all fractional
shares of Exelixis common stock that otherwise would be received by the holder)
will receive cash (rounded up to the nearest whole cent), without interest,
equal to the product obtained by multiplying:

     - that fraction of a share of Exelixis common stock to which the
       stockholder is entitled (after aggregating all fractional shares of
       Exelixis common stock that otherwise would be received by the
       stockholder), by

     - the closing sales price of one share of Exelixis common stock on the
       Nasdaq National Market (as reported in The Wall Street Journal or, if not
       reported in The Wall Street Journal, any other authoritative source) on
       the date we first accept shares for exchange in the exchange offer.

COMPOSITION OF GENOMICA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AFTER THE EXCHANGE OFFER

     Upon the acceptance for payment of shares of Genomica common stock pursuant
to the exchange offer, we will be entitled to designate four directors of
Genomica. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Genomica has agreed to take
all action necessary to cause Exelixis designees to be elected or appointed to
Genomica's board of directors. Until the completion of the merger, Genomica's
board of directors is required to include at least three members, referred to in
this prospectus as the "continuing directors," who were directors of Genomica
before the completion of the exchange offer. If, at any time before the
completion of the merger, the number of continuing directors is reduced to fewer
than three for any reason, the remaining and departing continuing directors will
be entitled to designate a person or persons to fill any vacancy with the
consent of Exelixis. If, however, we purchase 85% or more of Genomica common
stock in the exchange offer, the number of continuing directors will be one.

     The merger agreement provides that if our designees are elected to
Genomica's board of directors before the completion of the merger, the
affirmative vote of a majority of the continuing directors will be required for
Genomica to:

     - amend or terminate the merger agreement or agree or consent to any
       amendment or termination of the merger agreement;

     - waive any of Genomica's rights, benefits or remedies under the merger
       agreement;

     - extend the time for performance of our obligations under the merger
       agreement; or

     - approve any other action by Genomica that is likely to adversely affect
       the interests of the Genomica stockholders with respect to the
       transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

THE MERGER

     Generally.  The merger agreement provides that after completion of the
exchange offer, Bluegreen Acquisition Sub will be merged into Genomica. Upon
completion of the merger, Genomica will continue as the "surviving corporation"
and will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelixis.

     The Completion of the Merger.  The merger will become effective when the
certificate of merger or certificate of ownership and merger, as the case may
be, is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. Exelixis and
Genomica anticipate that the merger will be completed no later than the second
business day after all of the conditions to the merger contained in the merger
agreement are satisfied or, where permissible, waived, and have agreed to use
all reasonable efforts to complete the merger within 40 days after the date we
accept shares for exchange pursuant to the exchange offer.

     Upon completion of the merger, the directors and officers of Bluegreen
Acquisition Sub will become the officers and directors of the surviving
corporation, the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation will
be amended to be substantively identical to the certificate of incorporation of
Bluegreen Acquisition Sub, and the bylaws of Bluegreen Acquisition Sub will be
the bylaws of the surviving corporation.

     Manner and Basis of Converting Shares of Genomica Common Stock in the
Merger.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, upon completion of the merger,
each share of Genomica common stock will be converted into the right to receive
a portion of a share of Exelixis common stock at the same exchange ratio used in
the exchange offer. The merger consideration will not be payable in respect of
shares of Genomica common stock held by Genomica immediately before completion
of the merger, shares of Genomica common stock owned by Exelixis, Bluegreen
Acquisition Sub or any other subsidiary of Exelixis immediately before the
completion of the merger or shares of Genomica common stock for which appraisal
rights are exercised under Delaware law.

     We will not issue fractional shares of our common stock in the merger.
Instead, each stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share
(after aggregating all fractional shares of Exelixis common

stock that otherwise would be received by the stockholder) will receive cash
(rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product
obtained by multiplying:

     - that fraction of a share of Exelixis common stock to which the
       stockholder is entitled (after aggregating all fractional shares of
       Exelixis common stock that otherwise would be received by such
       stockholder), by

     - the closing sales price of one share of Exelixis common stock on the
       Nasdaq National Market (as reported in The Wall Street Journal or, if not
       reported in The Wall Street Journal, any other authoritative source) on
       the day of completion of the merger.

     The merger agreement provides that, as soon as reasonably practicable after
the date of completion of the merger, the exchange agent will mail to each
record holder of a certificate or certificates that represented shares of
Genomica common stock before the merger, a letter of transmittal and
instructions for use in exchanging Genomica common stock certificates for
Exelixis common stock certificates. In addition, the merger agreement
contemplates that, as soon as reasonably practicable after the exchange agent
receives back from the record holder the Genomica common stock certificate, the
letter of transmittal and any other documents that are reasonably required by
the exchange agent or Exelixis, the exchange agent will mail to the record
holder a certificate or certificates representing the appropriate number of
shares of Exelixis common stock and an amount of cash for any fractional share.
Additionally, record holders of Genomica common stock certificates may, at their
option after the completion of the merger, physically surrender their Genomica
common stock certificates in person at the offices of the exchange agent listed
on the back of this prospectus for Exelixis common stock certificates and cash
for any fractional share.

     After the completion of the merger, until it is surrendered and exchanged,
each certificate that previously evidenced Genomica common stock will be deemed
to evidence the right to receive shares of Exelixis common stock and the right
to receive cash instead of fractional shares of Exelixis common stock. We will
not pay dividends or other distributions on any shares of Exelixis common stock
to be issued in exchange for any Genomica common stock certificate that is not
surrendered until the Genomica common stock certificate is properly surrendered,
as provided in the merger agreement.

TREATMENT OF GENOMICA STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

     Under the terms of the merger agreement, we will not assume any option to
purchase Genomica common stock. Pursuant to Genomica's stock option plans, the
vesting of all Genomica stock options that are not assumed in connection with a
change in control (such as the consummation of the exchange offer) will
accelerate and all options held by employees or non-employee directors of
Genomica will become fully vested and exercisable immediately at the time we
accept the shares of Genomica common stock for payment in the exchange offer.
All Genomica stock options that are not exercised on or before the date we
accept shares of Genomica common stock for payment pursuant to the exchange
offer will terminate pursuant to the terms of the Genomica stock option plan
under which the Genomica stock option was issued. In addition, certain employees
of Genomica own stock acquired upon their exercise of Genomica stock options
that is subject to a repurchase right of Genomica. These repurchase rights will
not be assigned to Exelixis and, under the terms of the agreements giving rise
to the repurchase rights, will terminate upon the closing of the exchange offer.

     Under the terms of the merger agreement, upon the completion of the
exchange offer, we will automatically assume each outstanding warrant to acquire
shares of Genomica common stock. Each Genomica warrant that we assume will be
converted into a right to acquire the number of shares of Exelixis common stock
equal to the product of the number of shares of Genomica common stock that were
issuable upon the conversion of the Genomica warrant immediately before the
completion of the exchange offer, multiplied by the exchange ratio (rounded down
to the nearest whole number of shares of Exelixis common stock). The exercise
price per share of Exelixis common stock issuable under each assumed Genomica
warrant will be the per share exercise price at which the Genomica warrant was
exercisable immediately before the completion of the exchange offer, divided by
the exchange ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent).

LOCK-UP

     In connection with the merger agreement, the directors, officers and
affiliates of both Genomica and Exelixis have agreed not to sell or otherwise
transfer or dispose of Exelixis common stock for 90 days following the date we
first accept for payment shares pursuant to the exchange offer. A complete form
of the lock-up agreement is attached as Annex C to this prospectus and is
incorporated into this prospectus by reference.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     The merger agreement contains a number of customary representations and
warranties relating to, among other things, certain aspects of the respective
businesses and assets of each of the parties and their ability to complete the
transaction. The representations and warranties of each party will expire upon
completion of the merger.

CONDUCT OF BUSINESS BEFORE COMPLETION OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER

     The merger agreement contemplates that, until the completion of the merger,
Genomica will conduct its operations in substantially the manner as conducted
before the merger and will use all reasonable efforts to preserve its current
business organization and its relationships with customers, suppliers and
others. The merger agreement also expressly restricts Genomica's ability to
engage in certain material transactions without Exelixis' prior written consent.
Among other things, Genomica has agreed that it will not:

     - pay any dividend or repurchase, redeem or otherwise reacquire any
       outstanding shares of its capital stock;

     - issue any shares of capital stock, options or warrants (except that,
       before the completion of the exchange offer, Genomica may issue shares of
       common stock upon the valid exercise of outstanding Genomica stock
       options and warrants);

     - amend its certificate of incorporation, bylaws or similar organizational
       documents, or effect or become a party to any acquisition transaction;

     - enter into any material transaction or take any other material action
       outside the ordinary course of business or inconsistent with past
       practices; or

     - take or omit to take any action which would make any of the
       representations and warranties of Genomica contained in the merger
       agreement untrue or incorrect, prevent Genomica from performing or cause
       Genomica not to perform its covenants under the merger agreement or cause
       any of the conditions set forth in the merger agreement from being
       satisfied.

     We have agreed that, until the completion of the merger, we will conduct
our operations substantially as conducted before the merger, and will not
without Genomica's prior written consent, among other things, pay dividends,
amend any of our corporate documents or become party to any other merger
agreement.

REASONABLE EFFORTS TO COMPLETE THE TRANSACTION

     Exelixis and Genomica will make all filings required under antitrust laws
applicable to the transaction and use reasonable efforts to take all actions
necessary to complete the transaction.

LIMITATION ON GENOMICA'S ABILITY TO CONSIDER OTHER ACQUISITION PROPOSALS

     Genomica has agreed that, except in the circumstances described below, it
will not, directly or indirectly:

     - solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to encourage, induce or
       facilitate the making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition
       Proposal (as defined below);

     - knowingly furnish any information about Genomica to any person (other
       than Exelixis or any designee of Exelixis) in connection with or in
       response to an Acquisition Proposal or an inquiry or indication of
       interest that could lead to an Acquisition Proposal;

     - engage in discussions or negotiations with any person (other than
       Exelixis or any designee of Exelixis) with respect to an Acquisition
       Proposal;

     - approve, endorse or recommend an Acquisition Proposal; or

     - enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract
       contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

     However, Genomica or Genomica's board of directors is permitted to furnish
nonpublic information about Genomica to, or enter into discussions or
negotiations with, any third party in response to an Acquisition Proposal if:

     - Genomica and its representatives have not breached or taken any action
       inconsistent with the merger agreement;

     - Genomica's board of directors concludes in good faith, after consultation
       with Genomica's outside legal counsel, that the Acquisition Proposal is
       reasonably likely to result in a Superior Offer (as defined below) and
       that this action is required in order for Genomica's board of directors
       to comply with its fiduciary obligations to Genomica's stockholders under
       applicable law;

     - at least two business days before furnishing any nonpublic information
       to, or entering into discussions with, the third party, Genomica gives us
       written notice of the identity of the party making the Acquisition
       Proposal and of Genomica's intention to furnish nonpublic information to,
       or enter into discussions with, this party, and Genomica receives from
       this party a signed confidentiality agreement; and

     - at least two business days before furnishing any nonpublic information to
       the party making the Acquisition Proposal, Genomica furnishes this
       nonpublic information to us (to the extent Genomica has not already
       furnished this nonpublic information to us).

     Genomica must, within one day after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry or indication of interest that Genomica reasonably believes could lead
to an Acquisition Proposal, advise us orally and in writing of the proposal,
inquiry or request, the identity of the party making the proposal, inquiry or
request and the terms of the Acquisition Proposal. Genomica must keep us fully
informed as to the status of any Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of
interest or request and any modification or proposed modification to any
Acquisition Proposal.

     In addition, at any time before our acceptance of the shares of Genomica
common stock pursuant to the exchange offer, Genomica's board of directors may
withhold, withdraw or modify its recommendations that Genomica stockholders
accept the exchange offer and approve and adopt the merger agreement if it
determines, in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that withholding, withdrawing or modifying the recommendations is required in
order for Genomica's board of directors to comply with its fiduciary obligations
to Genomica stockholders, or if:

     - a bona fide written offer, not solicited in violation of the merger
       agreement, is made to Genomica by a third party for a merger,
       consolidation, business combination, sale of substantial assets, sale of
       shares of capital stock or similar transaction, and the offer is not
       withdrawn;

     - Genomica's board of directors determines in good faith (after
       consultation with a nationally recognized independent banking firm) that
       the offer constitutes a Superior Offer;

     - Genomica's board of directors determines in good faith, based upon the
       advice of Genomica's outside legal counsel, that, in light of the
       Superior Offer, the withdrawal or modification of the recommendations is
       required in order for Genomica's board of directors to comply with its
       fiduciary obligations to Genomica's stockholders;

     - the recommendations are not withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to
       us at any time before two business days after we receive written notice
       from Genomica confirming that Genomica's board of

       directors has determined that the offer is a Superior Offer and providing
       us with a copy of the Superior Offer; and

     - neither Genomica nor any of its representatives shall have violated any
       of the restrictions set forth above.

     An "Acquisition Proposal" means any offer or proposal made by a third party
(other than an offer or proposal by us) contemplating any of the following:

     - any merger, consolidation, amalgamation, share exchange, business
       combination, issuance of securities, acquisition of securities, tender
       offer, exchange offer or other similar transaction in which any person or
       "group" (as defined in the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated under
       the Exchange Act) of persons directly or indirectly acquires beneficial
       or record ownership of securities representing more than 20% of the
       outstanding securities of any class of voting securities of Genomica or
       Genomica issues securities representing more than 20% of the outstanding
       securities of any class of its voting securities;

     - any sale, lease, exchange, transfer, license, acquisition or disposition
       of any business or businesses or assets or rights that constitute or
       account for 20% or more of the consolidated assets of Genomica; or

     - any liquidation or dissolution of Genomica.

     A "Superior Offer" means a bona fide written offer, not solicited in
violation of the merger agreement, made by a third party after the date of the
merger agreement for a merger, consolidation, business combination, sale of
substantial assets, sale of shares of capital stock or similar transaction with
respect to Genomica on terms that the board of directors of Genomica determines,
after consultation with a nationally recognized independent financial advisor,
if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated, taking into account all
legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the offer and the person making the
offer, and would be, if consummated, more favorable to Genomica's stockholders,
from a financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement. However, any offer shall not be deemed to be a "Superior Offer" if
any financing required to consummate the transaction contemplated by the offer
is not committed.

     The terms of the merger agreement do not prohibit Genomica or Genomica's
board of directors from taking and disclosing to Genomica stockholders a
position with respect to a tender offer or an exchange offer by a third party,
or from making any disclosure required by applicable law. However, in connection
with any Acquisition Proposal, Genomica's board of directors may not withhold,
withdraw, modify or change in a manner adverse to us, or fail to make, a
recommendation that Genomica stockholders accept the exchange offer and approve
and adopt the merger agreement, and Genomica's board of directors may not
approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, unless the conditions
described above under the caption "Limitation on Genomica's Ability to Consider
Other Acquisition Proposals" are satisfied.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

     Under the terms of the merger agreement, for a period of one year following
the completion of the merger, we are required, at our election, either to
continue Genomica's employee benefit plans or to arrange for each Genomica
employee who becomes or continues as an employee of Exelixis or any of our
subsidiaries to be eligible to participate in any similar plans or programs of
Exelixis on terms no less favorable than those offered to similarly situated
newly hired employees of Exelixis. We are also required to continue Genomica's
medical insurance plan for a period of three months after the date we accept for
payment shares pursuant to the exchange offer. After the completion of the
merger, Genomica employees who become and remain employees of Exelixis or any of
our subsidiaries will be treated no less favorably than similarly situated newly
hired employees of Exelixis or any of our subsidiaries with respect to
compensation, employee benefits and terms and conditions of employment. No later
than one year from the completion of the merger, we will arrange for all
employees not then participating to become eligible to be participants in all
Exelixis employee benefit plans on terms no less favorable than those offered to
similarly situated newly hired employees of Exelixis. If, within one year
following the completion of the merger, the surviving corporation terminates the
employment of any employee (other than certain executive officers of Genomica)
who was employed on the date we accepted shares of Genomica common stock for
payment pursuant to the exchange offer, we will

cause the surviving corporation to provide severance benefits to this employee
equivalent to those previously provided to Genomica employees terminated in
Genomica's reduction in force on October 4, 2001. Please see the section of this
prospectus entitled "The Transaction -- Interests of Genomica's Officers and
Directors in the Transaction," beginning on page 50, for a discussion of
employee benefits and option agreements applicable to Genomica's directors and

CONDITIONS TO THE EXCHANGE OFFER

     Our obligation to accept for exchange, and to deliver shares of Exelixis
common stock in exchange for, shares of Genomica common stock that are validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn, is subject to the satisfaction or, where
permissible, the waiver of the conditions described in the merger agreement. All
conditions to the exchange offer must be satisfied or waived before the exchange
offer expires. The conditions to the exchange offer include the following:

     The Minimum Tender Condition.  Before the expiration date of the exchange
offer, as it may be extended pursuant to the merger agreement, there must be
validly tendered, in accordance with the terms of the exchange offer, and not
properly withdrawn a number of shares of Genomica common stock that, when added
to any shares of Genomica common stock owned by Exelixis and Bluegreen
Acquisition Sub, is equal to at least the sum of a majority of the total number
of shares of Genomica common stock plus the total number of shares of Genomica
common stock issuable upon exercise of options to acquire Genomica common stock,
each as outstanding immediately before the expiration date of the exchange
offer, as it may be extended pursuant to the merger agreement.

     Based on information supplied to us by Genomica, the number of shares
needed to have been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn in order to
satisfy the minimum tender condition as of December 26, 2001, would have been
13,104,251.

     Other Conditions to the Exchange Offer.  The exchange offer is also subject
to the conditions that, before the expiration of the exchange offer, as it may
be extended pursuant to the merger agreement:

     - the applicable waiting period under United States antitrust laws must
       have expired or been terminated;

     - any applicable waiting periods under foreign antitrust laws must have
       expired or been terminated and any required consents or clearances must
       have been obtained;

     - the registration statement on Form S-4 relating to this transaction must
       have been declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, and must
       not be the subject of any stop order or proceedings seeking a stop order;

     - the shares of Exelixis common stock that are to be issued in the
       transaction must have been approved for listing on the Nasdaq National
       Market;

     - Exelixis and Genomica must have received opinions of counsel to the
       effect that, based on certain customary assumptions, the transaction will
       be a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes, and the
       respective opinions must not have been subsequently rescinded;

     - there must not have been any action taken or be pending any legal
       proceeding in which a governmental body is:

        by the merger agreement;

      - seeking to prohibit or limit in any material respect our ability to
        vote, receive dividends with respect to or otherwise exercise ownership
        rights with respect to the shares of Genomica common stock to be
        acquired in the exchange offer or with respect to the stock of the
        surviving corporation;

      - seeking to materially and adversely affect the right of Exelixis, the

        merger agreement, a material adverse effect on us; or

      - no temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or
        other court order preventing the consummation of the exchange offer or
        the merger shall have been issued by any court of competent jurisdiction
        and remain in effect, or there shall be any applicable legal requirement
        enacted or deemed applicable to the exchange offer or the merger that
        makes consummation of the offer or the merger illegal;

     - Genomica must have not have materially breached any of its covenants,

       on and as of the date of the expiration of the exchange offer, as it may
       be extended pursuant to the merger agreement, with the same force and
       effect as if made as of this date except:

      - for changes contemplated by the merger agreement; and

      - for those representations and warranties which address matters only as
        of a particular date, which representations must have been true in all
        material respects as of such particular date;

     - there must not have been any material adverse effect on Genomica and no
       event or circumstance shall have occurred that would reasonably be
       expected to have a material adverse effect on Genomica;

     - Genomica must have cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term
       investments, net of all current liabilities of Genomica, totaling at
       least $108,750,000;

     We reserve the absolute right, in our sole discretion, subject to the terms
of the merger agreement, to waive, in whole or in part, any of the conditions to
the exchange offer. However, we may not waive the minimum tender condition or
any of the conditions to the exchange offer in any manner which is adverse to
the Genomica Stockholders, without Genomica's consent.

     As used in the merger agreement, "material adverse effect" as it relates to
Genomica means an event that has a material adverse effect on or change in the
capitalization, assets and liabilities taken as a whole or cash balance of
Genomica, the ability of Genomica to consummate the exchange offer or the
merger, or Exelixis' ability to exercise ownership rights with respect to the
stock of the surviving corporation.

CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER

     The obligations of Exelixis and Genomica to complete the merger are subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions:

     - if required by Delaware law, the merger agreement must have been adopted
       and approved by Genomica stockholders;

     - we must have accepted for exchange, and delivered shares of Exelixis
       common stock in exchange for, all shares of Genomica common stock that
       are validly tendered in the exchange offer;

     - no provision of any applicable law or regulation and no judgment,
       injunction, order or decree prohibits the completion of the merger or the
       other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and

     - the registration statement on Form S-4 relating to the transaction,
       including any post-effective amendment to the registration statement must
       have become effective, and must not be the subject of any stop order or

       state securities laws applicable to the registration and qualification of
       shares of Exelixis common stock must have been complied with.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     Termination by Mutual Agreement.  Exelixis and Genomica may terminate the
merger agreement at any time before the completion of the merger by mutual
written consent.

     Termination by Either Exelixis or Genomica.  Either Exelixis or Genomica
may terminate the merger agreement at any time before the completion of the
merger if:

     - the exchange offer has not been completed on or before March 1, 2002,
       unless the failure to complete the exchange offer is attributable to a
       failure of the party seeking to terminate the agreement to perform any
       material obligation under the merger agreement;

     - the exchange offer expires or terminates in accordance with the terms of
       the merger agreement without our having accepted for exchange any shares
       of Genomica common stock pursuant to the exchange offer, unless the
       expiration or termination of the exchange offer is attributable to a
       failure on the part of the party seeking to terminate the agreement to
       perform a material obligation under the merger agreement; or

     - there is any final and nonappealable judgment, injunction or order that
       prohibits the completion of the exchange offer or the merger.

     Termination by Exelixis.  We may terminate the merger agreement at any time
before the acceptance for exchange of shares of Genomica common stock pursuant
to the exchange offer, if any of the following occurs:

     - Genomica's board of directors fails to recommend that Genomica
       stockholders accept the exchange offer and vote to approve the merger
       agreement;

     - Genomica's board of directors withdraws or modifies in any manner adverse
       to Exelixis its recommendation that Genomica stockholders accept the

       or

     - any representation or warranty of Exelixis is materially inaccurate when
       made or becomes materially inaccurate after the date of the merger
       agreement.

     If, however, the breach of the covenant or agreement by Exelixis, or the
inaccuracy of the representation or warranty of Exelixis, is reasonably curable
by us, then Genomica may not terminate the merger agreement on account of this
breach until 30 days after the date that the breach becomes known to Genomica or
us.

     In addition, Genomica may terminate the merger agreement at any time before
the acceptance for exchange shares of Genomica common stock pursuant to the
exchange offer in order to enter into a letter of intent or similar document or
any agreement, contract, or commitment with respect to an Acquisition Proposal,
if:

     - Genomica has complied with its obligations discussed in "Limitations on
       Genomica's Ability to Consider Other Acquisition Proposals" above.

     - Genomica's board of directors has authorized, subject to complying with

       written agreement for a transaction that constitutes a Superior Offer;

     - Genomica notifies us in writing that it has received a Superior Offer,
       intends to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to the Superior
       Offer and attaches the most current version of the agreement to such
       notice;

     - Exelixis does not make, within five business days after receipt of
       Genomica's written notice of its intention to enter into a definitive
       agreement for a Superior Offer, any offer that Genomica's board of

       directors in good faith determines, after consultation with a financial
       advisor of nationally recognized standing and its outside legal counsel,
       is at least as favorable to Genomica stockholders as the Superior Offer;

     - during such period Genomica has fully cooperated with Exelixis,
       including, without limitation, informing Exelixis of the terms and
       conditions of the Superior Offer and the identity of the person making
       the Superior Offer, with the intent of enabling both parties to agree to
       a modification of the terms and conditions of the merger agreement so
       that the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement may be
       effected; and

     - immediately following the termination of the merger agreement, Genomica
       enters into a definitive agreement to effect the Superior Offer.

     If the merger agreement is terminated pursuant to any of the provisions
described above in this section, the merger agreement will become void and of no
effect, with no liability on the part of us or Genomica, unless certain
circumstances exist pursuant to which reimbursement of expenses described below
may become payable or there is an intentional or willful breach of the merger
agreements by one of us.

EXPENSES

     The merger agreement provides that all expenses incurred in connection with
the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
are to be paid by the party incurring such expenses. However, if the merger
agreement is terminated by either party for any reason other than a material
breach by us, then Genomica is required to pay us $750,000 for reimbursement of
our fees and expenses (including all attorneys' fees, accountants' fees,
financial advisory fees and filing fees) that have been paid or that may become
payable by or on behalf of Exelixis in connection with the preparation and
negotiation of the merger agreement and otherwise in connection with the
exchange offer and the merger.

AMENDMENTS TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The merger agreement may be amended, modified or waived by Exelixis' or
Genomica's board of directors at any time (whether before or after adoption of
the merger agreement by Genomica stockholders) if the amendment or waiver is in
writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by Genomica and Exelixis or, in
the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective.
However, after the adoption of the merger agreement by the stockholders of
Genomica, if necessary, no amendment shall be made which by law requires further
approval of Genomica stockholders without the further approval of Genomica
stockholders. See the section entitled "Conditions to the Exchange Offer" above
for information regarding our right to waive conditions to the exchange offer.

                       THE STOCKHOLDER TENDER AGREEMENTS

     The following description of the stockholder tender agreements describes
the material terms of the stockholder tender agreements. A complete form of the
stockholder tender agreement is attached as Annex B to this prospectus and is
incorporated into this prospectus by reference. All stockholders are urged to
read the form of the stockholder tender agreement carefully.

PARTIES TO THE STOCKHOLDER TENDER AGREEMENTS

     As an inducement for us to enter into the merger agreement, Genomica's
directors, officers and certain affiliated stockholders have entered into
stockholder tender agreements with us and granted us an irrevocable proxy with
respect to the shares of Genomica common stock, and options and warrants to
acquire shares of Genomica common stock, beneficially owned by them.

     Genomica's directors, officers and affiliated stockholders who have
beneficial ownership of 6,070,133 shares of Genomica common stock in the
aggregate have agreed to tender and not withdraw their shares of Genomica common
stock in the exchange offer. In addition, if certain conditions are met, the
officers, directors and affiliated stockholders of Genomica who are parties to
the stockholder tender agreements may be obligated to exercise "in the money"
options and warrants and tender the shares issued upon exercise of such options
and warrants to the extent necessary to satisfy the minimum tender condition for
the exchange offer. Assuming that all options and warrants with a per share
exercise price of $5.00 or less are "in the money", then this obligation may
apply to options and warrants to purchase up to approximately 1,098,094 shares
of Genomica common stock. If any party to a stockholder tender agreement is
obligated by the terms of those agreements to exercise options or warrants,
Exelixis has agreed that, if requested by the stockholder, it or its designee
will provide a loan to that party for the aggregate exercise price on
commercially reasonable terms.

AGREEMENT TO TENDER

     Each stockholder who has signed a stockholder tender agreement has agreed
that, unless we request otherwise, the stockholder will tender his or her shares
of Genomica common stock in the exchange offer within 10 business days after the
commencement of the exchange offer and will not withdraw the shares so tendered.

AGREEMENT TO VOTE

     Each stockholder who has signed a stockholder tender agreement has agreed
that, until the earlier of the day when the merger is completed or the day when
the merger agreement is validly terminated pursuant to its terms, the
stockholder will vote, or cause his or her shares of Genomica common stock to be
voted:

     - against any action or agreement that would result in a breach of any
       representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of Genomica in the
       merger agreement;

     - against any action or agreement that would cause any of the conditions to
       the exchange offer or the merger to not be satisfied; and

     - against the following actions (other than the exchange offer, the merger
       and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement): (i) any
       Acquisition Proposal; (ii) any change in a majority of the members of the
       board of directors of Genomica, other than any change contemplated by the
       merger agreement; or (iii) any other action which is intended to, or
       could reasonably be expected to, impede, delay, discourage or adversely
       affect the consummation of the exchange offer, the merger or any of the
       other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or the
       stockholder tender agreement.

     By their terms, the stockholder tender agreements have no effect on the
signing stockholder's rights or obligations in his or her capacity as a director
or officer of Genomica.

TERMINATION

     All obligations under the stockholder tender agreements terminate upon the
termination of the merger agreement pursuant to its terms.

                        INFORMATION RELATING TO GENOMICA

OVERVIEW

     Genomica is a provider of innovative software products and services that
are designed to enable pharmaceutical and biotechnology researchers to
accelerate the drug discovery and development process. Discovery Manager(TM)
software, Genomica's first product, is used for genomics research, including
genetic research, gene discovery and pharmacogenomics. This product allows
researchers to turn the vast volumes of gene, SNP, protein and patient data from
diverse sources into information useful for drug discovery. Genomica licenses
Discovery Manager to leading genomics-based research organizations, including
AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline and the National Cancer Institute. Genomica has a
strategic alliance with Applied Biosystems to license software products to be
used with Applied Biosystems' industry-leading hardware and software systems for
drug discovery.

CHANGE IN BUSINESS STRATEGY

     On October 2, 2001 Genomica's board of directors approved a cost reduction
plan resulting in a restructuring of its operations and consolidation of its
facilities, including the involuntary termination of a significant portion of
its workforce. This plan included the immediate termination of 101 employees,
including 91 located in Genomica's Boulder, Colorado office, three employees
located in its United Kingdom office and seven employees located elsewhere
throughout the United States.

DISCOVERY MANAGER

     Discovery Manager is Genomica's core bioinformatics product. It is an
integrated suite of software tools and a database template for genomics
research. The database can be filled with genomic data from the user's own
research as well as publicly available and other sources. Genomica's tools
include sophisticated scientific algorithms designed for easy use by genomic
researchers without the assistance of bioinformaticists. Discovery Manager
enables individual or collaborating researchers to access, store, manipulate,
analyze, annotate and integrate genomic data from a variety of sources.

     Supported Disciplines.  Genomica develops Discovery Manager to be used by
researchers in a broad range of disciplines, including:

     - Clinical genetics.  Clinical geneticists identify patients and collect
       their medical data. Discovery Manager allows these researchers to store
       and view patient information in a simple graphical format, which can show
       the medical and genetic data of each patient as well as parent and
       sibling genetic relationships among family members, called pedigrees.

     - Epidemiology.  Epidemiologists study the genetic and environmental causes
       for disease. Discovery Manager helps these researchers analyze and
       determine how a genetic trait or environmental factor is distributed
       among people in a population.

     - Statistical genetics.  Statistical geneticists identify the regions of
       DNA that determine a particular trait. Discovery Manager helps these
       researchers group individuals together and test various hypotheses
       regarding the portion of DNA to which a trait is linked.

     - Human genetics.  Human geneticists identify the location of genes using a
       variety of sophisticated analytical approaches. Discovery Manager helps
       these researchers study the specific genes of each family member.

     - Molecular biology.  Molecular biologists determine the function of genes.
       Discovery Manager helps these researchers organize and analyze genetic
       map and sequence data to isolate genes and determine their function.

     - Pharmacogenomics.  Pharmacogenomics researchers determine the genetic
       basis for why a drug works for some people but not others. Discovery
       Manager helps these researchers examine the genetic variations of a group
       of patients with similar drug responses.

     Key Tools.  Discovery Manager provides three key tool sets that are used by
different types of researchers to facilitate the interpretation of data relevant
to the drug discovery and development process:

     - Sequence analysis tools.  Sequence analysis is the examination of a
       specific DNA sequence to understand the structure and function of the
       sequence. Discovery Manager provides tools for finding genes in human DNA
       sequences and comparing two or more sequences for similarity.

     - Genetic analysis tools.  Genetic analysis is the isolation and analysis
       of DNA variations in families and unrelated populations. Discovery
       Manager provides tools to integrate, manipulate, edit and analyze genetic
       data.

     - Map analysis tools.  Map analysis is the construction and comparison of
       maps containing different representations of genetic information.
       Discovery Manager provides tools that support the graphical viewing,
       manipulation and comparison of maps that are created using well-known
       algorithms.

     Discovery Manager Database.  A key component of Discovery Manager is a
central repository of genomic data compiled from many sources:

     - Legacy data.  Data that researchers have previously accumulated on
       various systems and in various formats.

     - New data.  Results from experiments performed using Discovery Manager.

     - Other public data.  If a customer wishes to incorporate data from sources
       other than those in the Reference Database, the customer can convert it
       into a common format and import it into Discovery Manager. Customers can
       also access the National Center for Biotechnology Information and other
       websites of interest directly from Discovery Manager. Researchers use
       information from these websites to annotate their database.

     Reference Database.  Genomica offers its proprietary database, the
Reference Database, as an option to licensees of Discovery Manager. This
Reference Database compiles into one database and in one common format all of
the information from 13 publicly available databases.

     Common User Interface.  Discovery Manager addresses many important aspects
of genomics research from a common user interface. This interface permits
researchers to access, use and compare data from a single database. With simple
point-and-click operations, researchers can map, compare, query and graphically
display data in formats commonly used in the industry. Using annotation tools,
researchers may enrich data with additional information, such as experiment
details, literature references and direct links to websites of interest. The
common user interface also enables many different types of researchers to use
the same data and system to do their part of the analysis.

     Security.  Because of the potential value of proprietary genomic
information, security is important to Genomica's customers. Discovery Manager
provides security and access features that enable system administrators to
assign user accounts and passwords, provides users with access to authorized
projects and allows management to review the work progress within the genomic
project while insuring the privacy of sensitive project data.

LINKMAPPER(TM) SOFTWARE

     Linkmapper is Genomica's first product resulting from a development and
distribution alliance with Applied Biosystems. Genomica completed development
and delivered the Linkmapper product to Applied Biosystems in October 2000.
Applied Biosystems began marketing this product along with its own hardware and
software product lines in 2001. Linkmapper offers reduced functionality from our
Discovery Manager product and it was developed on Genomica's Java and Oracle
technology platform. Applied Biosystems will pay Genomica a royalty payment for
each unit licensed to its customers. Genomica also will share in any revenues
received by Applied Biosystems from entering into customer software support and
maintenance agreements related to Linkmapper. Applied Biosystems is not expected
to meet the minimum sales milestones required to maintain its exclusive right to
license and re-sell Linkmapper.

     Linkmapper provides researchers with a powerful set of software
applications for manipulating, organizing, and analyzing genetic data that is
generated from genotyping hardware systems manufactured and sold by Applied
Biosystems. Linkmapper enables researchers, who are customers of Applied
Biosystems, to perform allele-calling functionality, quality checking of data
and genetic data management and analysis in one integrated system. This
end-to-end connectivity from the hardware instrumentation and software
applications is expected to significantly enhance downstream data analysis for
creating genetic maps.

32% of its revenue, GlaxoSmithKline accounted for 21% of its revenue, Oxagen
accounted for 15% of its revenue and Pfizer accounted for 11% of its revenue.
Genomica expects that these four customers will continue to account for a high
percentage of its total revenue for the immediate future.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

     The research and development for Genomica's products takes place at
Genomica's headquarters in Boulder, Colorado and at Genomica's facility in
Sacramento, California.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS AND LICENSES

     Genomica believes that patents are not generally a significant factor in
Genomica's business and that the success of Genomica depends primarily on the
technical competence, and managerial and marketing ability of Genomica's
personnel.

     GENOMICA(TM), Discovery Manager(TM) and Linkmapper(TM) are trademarks owned
by Genomica.

     Genomica is the exclusive, worldwide licensee of the Genome Topographer
technology owned by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Genome Topographer is a
general-purpose computer system useful for studying complex, genetic diseases
and serves as the intellectual property foundation of Discovery Manager. The
Genome Topographer technology includes the patented Chang/Marr algorithm, which
incorporates, either in hardware or software form, an algorithm for analyzing

EMPLOYEES

     As of December 26, 2001 Genomica had 46 full-time employees, including 6
employees primarily engaged in research and development, 29 in engineering and
11 in general and administration. None of Genomica's employees are currently
represented under collective bargaining agreements and Genomica considers its
employee relations to be good.

PROPERTIES

     Genomica's headquarters and principal executive offices are located at 1715
38th Street, Boulder, Colorado under a lease that provides approximately 42,000
square feet for Genomica's operations. Following the adoption of Genomica's
restructuring plan on October 2, 2001, Genomica subleased 24,000 square feet of
the available space, leaving Genomica with approximately 18,000 square feet for
its operations. This facility serves as the base for Genomica's research and
development and product support operations.

     Genomica leases approximately 2,200 square feet in Sacramento, California,
that serves as a software engineering and development office.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     Genomica is not currently involved in any legal proceedings that are
expected to have a material adverse effect on its business or consolidated
financial position.

                 GENOMICA MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements. A variety of factors
could cause Genomica's actual results to differ from the anticipated results
expressed in such forward-looking statements. These include, among others,
failure to manage the recently completed restructuring to achieve its financial
goals, Genomica's reliance on a limited number of customers for a majority of
its revenue, failure by Genomica to meet financial expectations of investors,
potential defects associated with Genomica's product, activities by Genomica and
others regarding protection of intellectual property, and Genomica's reliance on
key personnel. For more information, please review Genomica's periodic reports
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including, without limitation, the
investment considerations set forth in Genomica's annual report on form 10-K and
other publicly filed documents. The safe harbor provided in the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, by its terms, does not apply to the
exchange offer.

OVERVIEW

     Genomica is a provider of innovative software products and services that
are designed to enable pharmaceutical and biotechnology researchers to
accelerate the drug discovery and development process. Discovery Manager,
Genomica's primary product, is used for genomics research, including genetic
research, gene discovery and pharmacogenomics. This product allows researchers
to turn the vast volumes of gene, SNP and patient data from diverse sources into
information useful for drug discovery. Genomica's current customers include
leading genomics-based research organizations such as AstraZeneca,
GlaxoSmithKline and the National Cancer Institute. Genomica has a strategic
alliance with Applied Biosystems to license and market certain components of its
software technology and products for use with Applied Biosystems' industry-
leading systems for drug discovery. Currently, however, Applied Biosystems is
not expected to meet the minimum sales milestones required to maintain its
exclusive right to license and re-sell Linkmapper.

     Genomica has sold its products directly to customers since June 1998.
Genomica derives revenue primarily from granting licenses to the Discovery
Manager products and the Reference Database to pharmaceutical, biotechnology and
academic research organizations. Genomica's software license agreements are
typically one year or longer in length, and include support and maintenance. The
price for each agreement depends upon the number of users licensed by Genomica's
customers, the duration of the agreement and which of its product components and
services the customer purchases. Genomica typically invoices its customers on an
annual or quarterly basis at the commencement of the software license agreement
and on each subsequent anniversary date. Genomica records deferred revenue at
the time it invoices and it recognizes the associated revenue ratably over the
related period. For products sold through Genomica's relationship with Applied
Biosystems, Genomica recognizes revenue on the license fee royalty and records
deferred revenue for the support and maintenance, which is recognized over the
annual support period.

     Genomica has incurred losses since its inception. As of September 30, 2001,
Genomica had an accumulated deficit of $74.7 million. The deficit includes
stock-based non-cash compensation charges of $22.1 million, including $5.8
million recognized in 2001, and a $17.1 million non-cash deemed dividend for the
difference between the deemed fair value of Genomica's common stock and the
price at which its Series C preferred stock and Series D preferred stock issued
in 2000 were convertible. The remainder of the accumulated deficit, $35.5
million, resulted from the significant costs incurred in the development of
Genomica's technology platform and the establishment of relationships with its
customers. In addition, as a result of option grants made prior to Genomica's
initial public offering with exercise prices below their deemed fair market
value for financial reporting purposes, Genomica will incur approximately $9.6
million in additional non-cash compensation charges to earnings in future
periods. This amount is subject to reduction for stock option forfeitures, such
as the October 2001 terminations discussed below.

CHANGE IN BUSINESS STRATEGY

     On October 2, 2001 Genomica's Board of Directors approved a cost reduction
plan resulting in a restructuring of Genomica's operations and consolidation of
its facilities, including the involuntary termination of a significant portion
of Genomica's workforce. The plan included the immediate termination of 101
employees, including 91 located in Genomica's Boulder, Colorado office, three
employees located in the United Kingdom office, and seven employees located
elsewhere throughout the United States. Genomica currently has 42 employees.

     On October 4, 2001 Genomica announced its new product and corporate
strategy that required restructuring its operations and a workforce reduction.
This change in strategy was based on Genomica's belief that the initial target
market for third-party enterprise software is not developing fast enough to
build stockholder value within a reasonable timeframe.

     As a result of the restructuring announced on October 4, 2001, Genomica
anticipates recording a restructuring charge during the fourth quarter totaling
approximately $4.3 million, including charges totaling $1.9 million for
involuntary termination benefits, $1.7 million for asset impairments, and $0.7
million for lease and contract termination fees. Termination benefits were paid
at the time the plan was implemented. In conjunction with the restructuring,
Genomica has closed its office in the United Kingdom and the Boulder, Colorado
office was consolidated from 42,000 square feet to 18,000 square feet. The
remaining 24,000 square feet of Genomica's facilities in Boulder have been
subleased. Losses relating to subleases are included in the $4.3 million
restructuring charge. Genomica's asset impairments were primarily due to the
consolidation of operations, facilities closures and excess equipment that was
taken out of service or disposed of.

     Genomica may institute additional cost reduction initiatives. As a result,
there could be additional charges related to severance liabilities and asset
impairments.

     Genomica's restructuring plan was adopted subsequent to September 30, 2001,
and, therefore, its financial position as of September 30, 2001 and the results
of operations for the nine months then ended do not reflect the effects of the
charges discussed above. The following summarizes Genomica's financial
statements had these charges been included as of and for the nine months ended
September 30, 2001.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2001 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER
  30, 2000

     Total Revenue.  Total revenue increased to $1.3 million from $1.2 million
for the same period of 2000. The revenue growth is primarily due to $57,000 of
consulting fees and $64,000 of royalty fees from Genomica's Linkmapper product
sold through Applied Biosystems. The consulting fees were from two

consulting projects, one completed in April 2001 and the other completed in
September 2001. Grant revenues of $27,000 were recognized for the first quarter
of 2000; there were no grant revenues in 2001 as the grant was completed in
February of 2000. Revenue from Genomica's Discovery Manager software may
decrease in the future if current customers decide not to renew their contracts.

     Costs of Revenue.  Costs of revenue increased to $286,000 in 2001 from
$281,000 for the same period of 2000. The increase is primarily due to increased
customer support costs and costs associated with Genomica's consulting fee
revenue, partially offset by decreased costs of research grants. Genomica
expects its costs of revenue to decrease substantially due to its change in
strategy.

     Research and Development.  Research and development expenses increased to
$10.8 million in 2001 from $8.9 million for the same period of 2000. Excluding
non-cash compensation charges of $1.2 million in 2001 and $3.4 million in 2000,
research and development expenses increased $4.1 million. The increase in costs
is primarily due to increased salaries, recruiting, and other personnel costs
associated with Genomica's hiring additional software developers and scientists
to develop scientific applications using Java technology and Oracle
Corporation's relational database management system in early 2001. Genomica has
substantially reduced its research and development activity by terminating 75 of
its 108 employees; Genomica expects research and development expenses will
decrease significantly due to its change in corporate strategy.

     Selling and Marketing.  Selling and marketing expenses increased to $5.9
million in 2001 from $5.1 million for the same period of 2000. Excluding
non-cash compensation charges of $2.2 million in 2001 and $2.8 million in 2000,
selling and marketing costs increased $1.4 million. Additional salaries, other
personnel costs, consulting, travel, advertising, and exhibition costs comprised
the majority of the increase for the period. Selling and marketing expenses will
decrease significantly as Genomica terminated all 16 of its employees in the
sales and marketing departments due to its change in corporate strategy.
Genomica is not currently marketing any of its existing products and has no
plans to do so in the immediate future.

     General and Administrative.  General and administrative expenses decreased
to $5.8 million in 2001 from $7.0 million for the same period of 2000. Excluding
non-cash compensation charges of $2.5 million in 2001 and $5.2 million in 2000,
general and administrative costs increased $1.5 million. The cost increase for
the period is primarily related to salaries, and other personnel costs, investor
relations and reporting costs associated with being a public company. Genomica
expects general and administrative expenses will decrease in the immediate
future as Genomica terminated ten of its 18 general and administrative employees
and due to its change in corporate strategy.

     Non-cash Stock-based Compensation.  Non-cash charges representing the
amortization of deferred stock compensation totaled $5.8 million for the period
in 2001 compared to $11.4 million for the comparative period in 2000. The
decrease in non-cash compensation expense is due to the method of amortizing
Genomica's deferred compensation, which results in the recognition of a larger
portion of expense in the initial periods after grant, and due to employees who
left the company. Genomica expects non-cash compensation expense to decrease in
the future due to the termination of employees resulting from its change in
strategic direction.

     Interest Income.  Interest income increased to $5.0 million in 2001 from
$617,000 in the same period of 2000. The increase is due to Genomica's higher
cash and investment balances resulting from the proceeds of its initial public
offering. The proceeds from Genomica's initial public offering have been
invested in investment grade securities to be used as needed. Genomica expects a
lower average rate of return on its investment portfolio in the future as
securities mature and are reinvested into lower interest bearing securities
caused by current market conditions. Due to Genomica's cost reduction plan,
Genomica will significantly reduce the amount of cash used to fund its operating
losses in future periods.

     Other Expense.  Other expense increased $518,000 in 2001 from $0 in 2000
because Genomica reserved for the uncollectability of a note receivable during
the quarter. The impairment of the note was due to unfavorable changes in market
conditions in the financing industry, which prevented the issuer of the note
from obtaining sufficient capital to fund its operations at a level which would
have indicated that this note would be repaid. The initial investment in the
note receivable was made in the first quarter of 2001.

     Deemed Dividend Related to Beneficial Conversion Feature of Preferred
Stock.  In 2000, Genomica incurred charges of approximately $17.1 million
related to the issuance of its Series C and Series D preferred stock. All of
Genomica's preferred stock converted to common stock upon the closing of its
initial public offering on October 4, 2000. There was no comparable charge for
the same period in 2001.

  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999

     Total Revenue.  Total revenue increased to $1,642,000 in 2000 from $781,000
for the same period of 1999. The revenue growth was due primarily to licensing
Genomica's software to an increased number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology
organizations. Genomica recognized revenue from consulting services of $23,000
in 2000; no such revenue was recognized in 1999. Grant revenue of $27,000 was
recognized in 2000 compared to $159,000 in 1999. Grant revenue decreased for the
year 2000 due to the completion of the grant in February 2000.

     Costs of Revenue.  Costs of revenue decreased to $384,000 in 2000 from
$447,000 in 1999. The decrease was due primarily to decreased costs of research
grants in 2000. Genomica's research grants paid for Genomica's direct costs of
performing specified research projects and a portion of its other operating
expenses.

     Research and Development.  Research and development expenses increased to
$12.0 million in 2000 from $4.9 million in 1999. Nearly $4.4 million of the
increase was attributable to non-cash compensation expense from options for
common stock issued to employees, as discussed below. There was $846,000 of non-
cash compensation expense in 1999. The remainder of the increase is primarily
due to increased salaries, recruiting, and other personnel costs associated with
Genomica's engaging additional software developers.

     Selling and Marketing.  Selling and marketing expenses increased to $7.2
million in 2000 from $1.7 million in 1999. Approximately $4.0 million of the
increase was related to non-cash compensation expense from options for common
stock issued to employees, as discussed below. There was $85,000 of non-cash
compensation expense in 1999. The remaining increase is primarily attributable
to additional salaries, consulting, other personnel costs and travel associated
with the expansion of Genomica's selling and marketing team.

     General and Administrative.  General and administrative expenses increased
to $9.0 million in 2000 from $1.7 million in 1999. Approximately $6.3 million of
the increase is attributable to non-cash compensation expense from options for
common stock issued to employees, as discussed below. There was only $738,000 of
non-cash compensation expense in 1999.

     Non-cash Stock-based Compensation.  In connection with the grant of stock
options to employees at exercise prices between $0.75 and $10.02 per share,
Genomica recorded deferred stock compensation of $25.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2000. In addition, Genomica recorded approximately $200,000
of deferred compensation in connection with the issuance of options for common
stock to certain advisors of the company. Amortization of deferred stock
compensation totaled $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.

     Interest Income.  Interest income increased to $2.6 million in 2000 from
$419,000 in 1999. The increase was attributable to Genomica's higher cash and
investment balances in these periods resulting from the proceeds of sales of
preferred stock and Genomica's initial public offering.

     Interest Expense.  Interest expense increased to $45,000 in 2000 compared
to $18,000 in 1999. The increase was attributable to higher average outstanding
debt related to capital leases for equipment. These capital leases were repaid
in the fourth quarter of 2000 with a portion of the proceeds from Genomica's
initial public offering.

  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998

     Total Revenue.  Total revenue increased to $781,000 in 1999 from $197,000
in 1998. This increase was due primarily to licensing Genomica's software to an
increased number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology

organizations. Genomica also recognized revenue from research grants of $159,000
in 1999; no such revenue was recognized in 1998.

     Costs of Revenue.  Costs of revenue increased to $447,000 in 1999 from
$141,000 in 1998. This increase was due to approximately $90,000 from additional
customer service and support costs, $57,000 from software royalty payments for
third-party software licenses and $159,000 from costs associated with research
grants.

     Research and Development.  Research and development expenses increased to
$4.9 million in 1999 from $2.3 million in 1998. The increase was primarily
related to an increase in salaries and other personnel costs in 1999 related to
engaging additional software developers. Genomica also incurred non-cash
compensation expense of $846,000 in 1999 from options for common stock issued
with exercise prices below the deemed market value of the common stock for
financial reporting purposes, as discussed below.

     Selling and Marketing.  Selling and marketing expenses increased to $1.7
million in 1999 from $634,000 in 1998. The increase was due primarily to
increases in personnel and travel costs from the expansion of Genomica's selling
and marketing team. Genomica also increased its product marketing expenses to
enhance the visibility of its product. Genomica incurred non-cash compensation
expense of $85,000 in 1999 for options for common stock issued to employees, as
discussed below.

     General and Administrative.  General and administrative expenses increased
to $1.7 million in 1999 from $884,000 in 1998, an increase of $839,000. The
increase was due primarily to additions to Genomica's management team. Genomica
incurred non-cash compensation expense of $738,000 in 1999 from options for
common stock issued to employees, as discussed below.

     Non-cash Stock-based Compensation.  In connection with the grant of stock
options to employees, Genomica recorded deferred stock compensation of $7.4
million during the year ended December 31, 1999, of which $1.7 million was
expensed in 1999.

     Interest Income.  Interest income increased to $419,000 in 1999 from
$90,000 in 1998. The increase was due primarily to Genomica's higher average
cash and investment balances during 1999 as a result of a private placement of
equity securities in February 1999 and December 1998.

     Interest Expense.  Interest expense decreased to $18,000 in 1999 from
$55,000 in 1998 due primarily to lower average debt outstanding during 1999
following the conversion of a note payable to equity in 1998.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     As of September 30, 2001, Genomica had cash, cash equivalents and
investments of approximately $110.8 million, down from $123.9 million of cash,
cash equivalents and investments at December 31, 2000.

     During the nine months ended September 30, 2001, Genomica used cash of
approximately $10.3 million to fund its net losses of $17.0 million. Genomica's
investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2001 used cash of
$11.9 million and consisted of $8.4 million in net purchases and maturities of
investments and $3.5 million in purchases of leasehold improvements, property
and equipment primarily related to increasing our staff levels.

     Genomica's financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2000
generated $130.5 million comprised primarily of $112.5 million in net proceeds
from its initial public offering and $18.0 million in net proceeds from sales of
preferred stock. Genomica's financing activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2001 consisted only of the exercise of stock options. These stock
option exercises accounted for $162,399 in proceeds during that period.

     During the year ended December 31, 2000, Genomica used cash of
approximately $10.4 million to fund its net losses of $24.4 million. Genomica's
investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2000 used cash of $97.8
million, and consisted of $95.0 million in net purchases and maturities of
investments and $2.8 million in purchases of property and equipment used in its
business.

     Following the cash effects of Genomica's restructuring changes, Genomica
expects its usage of cash to decrease significantly to near break-even. Genomica
believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are
sufficient to fund its working capital requirements for the foreseeable future.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     The primary objective of Genomica's investment activities is to preserve
principal while at the same time maximize the income Genomica receives from its
investments without significantly increasing risk. Some of the securities that
Genomica invests in may have market risk. This means that a change in prevailing
interest rates or a change in the credit of any companies represented by such
securities may cause the market value of the investment to fluctuate. For
example, if Genomica holds a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate
at the then-prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the
market value of Genomica's investment will probably decline. For investments
held at September 30, 2001, a 1% change in the interest rate would change the
value of Genomica's investments by approximately $1 million. In addition, if
Genomica holds a security that was rated on the credit risk of certain companies
and any of these company's credit is downgraded, the market value of Genomica's
investment will probably decline. To minimize this risk in the future, Genomica
intends to maintain its portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments
in a variety of securities, including commercial paper, money market funds,
government and non-government debt securities. Set forth below is quantitative,
tabular disclosure relating to Genomica's investments, as of September 30, 2001:

          SECURITY OWNERSHIP BY CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF GENOMICA

     The following table sets forth certain information regarding the beneficial
ownership of Genomica's common stock as of December 26, 2001 by: (i) each
director of Genomica; (ii) the chief executive officer and the four other most
highly compensated executive officers of Genomica for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2000, whose salary and incentive compensation for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2000 exceeded $100,000; (iii) all directors and executive
officers of Genomica as a group; and (vi) all those known by Genomica to be
beneficial owners of more than 5% of its outstanding common stock. The table is
based on information supplied by each stockholder or contained in filings made
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Beneficial ownership is determined
according to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and generally
means that a person has beneficial ownership of a security if the person has
voting or investment power over that security, and includes any shares of
Genomica common stock which the individual or entity has the right to acquire
within 60 days of November 19, 2001 through the exercise of any stock option or
other right. Except as otherwise indicated, Genomica believes that the
beneficial owners of the common stock listed below, based on the information
each of them has given to Genomica, have sole investment and voting power with
respect to their shares.

     This table lists applicable percentage ownership based on 23,065,643 shares
of common stock outstanding as of December 26, 2001. Options and warrants to
purchase shares of Genomica's common stock that are exercisable within 60 days
of December 26, 2001 are deemed to be beneficially owned by the persons holding
these options and warrants for the purpose of computing percentage ownership of
that person, but are not treated as outstanding for the purpose of computing any
other person's ownership percentage. Shares underlying options and warrants that
are deemed beneficially owned are listed in this table separately in the column
labeled "Shares Subject to Options and Warrants." These shares are included in
the number of shares listed in the column labeled "Total Number." Unless
otherwise indicated, the address of each person or entity named below is c/o
Genomica Corporation, 1715 38th Street, Boulder, Colorado 80301.

             UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL DATA

     The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements
give effect to the proposed merger of Exelixis and Genomica, the 2001
acquisition of a majority of the outstanding capital stock of Artemis and the
2000 acquisition of Agritope, applying the purchase method of accounting in each
transaction. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet gives
effect to the merger of Exelixis and Genomica as if it had occurred on September
30, 2001. The acquisitions of Artemis and Agritope occurred on May 14, 2001 and
December 8, 2000, respectively; accordingly, the unaudited consolidated balance
sheet of Exelixis at September 30, 2001 reflects the acquisitions of Artemis and
Agritope. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations
give effect to the proposed merger of Exelixis and Genomica, and the
acquisitions of Artemis and Agritope, as if they had all occurred on the first
day of each period presented.

     For pro forma purposes, (i) Exelixis' unaudited consolidated balance sheet
as of September 30, 2001 has been combined with Genomica's unaudited
consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2001, (ii) Exelixis' audited
consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000, which
includes the results of Agritope subsequent to the acquisition date of December
8, has been combined with Agritope's unaudited statement of operations for the
period from January 1, 2000 to December 7, 2000 and with Artemis' audited
statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000, (iii) Exelixis'
unaudited consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended
September 30, 2001, which includes the results of operations of Artemis
subsequent to the acquisition date of May 14, 2001, has been combined with
Artemis' unaudited statement of operations for the period from January 1, 2001
to May 13, 2001 and (iv) the Exelixis/Agritope/Artemis unaudited pro forma
condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000,
and the Exelixis/Artemis unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of
operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2001, have been combined with
Genomica's audited consolidated statement of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2000 and unaudited consolidated statement of operations for the
nine months ended September 30, 2001, respectively.

     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been
prepared on the basis of assumptions described in the notes thereto and includes
assumptions relating to the allocation of the consideration paid for the assets
and liabilities of Genomica based on management's preliminary estimates of their
fair value. Under the purchase method of accounting, the aggregate consideration
paid is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired
and liabilities assumed on the basis of their respective fair values on the
transaction date. As the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds
the estimated purchase price, the estimated fair values of all long term assets
were reduced to zero for purchase accounting purposes. After such a reduction in
values, and in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
141, "Business Combinations," estimated negative goodwill of approximately
$808,000 will be recorded as an extraordinary gain in Exelixis' statement of
operations upon consummation of the merger. The extraordinary gain has been
excluded from the pro forma statements of operations due to its non-recurring
nature. The final allocation of such consideration may differ from that
reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.
Exelixis does not expect that the final allocation of the aggregate purchase
price for the merger will differ materially from the preliminary allocations. In
the opinion of Exelixis, all adjustments necessary to present fairly such
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information have been made
based on the proposed terms and structure of the merger.

     The unaudited pro forma information has been prepared in accordance with
the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and is
presented for illustrative purposes only. Such information is not necessarily
indicative of the operating results or financial position that would have
occurred if the merger had been consummated on the first day of each period
presented or September 30, 2001, respectively, nor is it necessarily indicative
of future operating results or financial position.

     These pro forma condensed combined financial statements are qualified in
their entirety by reference to and should be read in conjunction with the
historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and
"Exelixis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations" incorporated by reference into this prospectus and
"Genomica Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations" included elsewhere in this prospectus.

                         COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION

  GENOMICA

     On November 19, 2001, Exelixis entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
and Reorganization to acquire all the outstanding shares of Genomica. Pursuant
to the terms of the merger agreement, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial information reflects the issuance of approximately 8.2 million shares
of Exelixis common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of
Genomica common stock. The assumed number of shares of Exelixis common stock to
be issued is based on Genomica's capitalization at October 31, 2001 and assumes
an exchange ratio of 0.33582 of a share of Exelixis common stock for each
outstanding share of Genomica common stock. For pro forma purposes, the exchange
ratio was calculated by dividing $13.30285, which equals 95% of the average
closing sales price of Exelixis, as reported on the Nasdaq National Market, for
the ten trading days ending on and including November 16, 2001, into the
quotient of $110.0 million divided by the outstanding Genomica common stock and
vested Genomica stock options and warrants with exercise prices less than $5.00
per share as of October 31, 2001. Certain warrants to purchase approximately
53,000 shares of Genomica common stock will be assumed by Exelixis pursuant to
the merger and converted into warrants to purchase approximately 18,000 shares
of Exelixis common stock. The actual exchange ratio will be determined by
dividing $13.30285, or if greater than $13.30285, the average closing sales
price of Exelixis, as reported on the Nasdaq National Market, for the 18 trading
days ending two trading days before the expiration of the initial offering
period, into the quotient of $110.0 million divided by the sum of the number of
shares of Genomica common stock and Genomica preferred stock plus the number of
shares of Genomica common stock issuable upon the exercise of all Genomica stock
options and warrants with per share exercise prices of $5.00 or less, each as
outstanding as of the date Exelixis first accepts shares of Genomica common
stock for payment pursuant to the exchange offer.

     Total estimated consideration for the proposed merger, assuming an October
31, 2001 measurement date, is approximately $108.5 million which consists of
Exelixis common stock and warrants valued at $107.7 million and estimated
Exelixis transaction costs of $800,000. Exelixis transaction costs include
legal, accounting and other fees.

     The preliminary allocation of the aggregate purchase price to the tangible
and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in
connection with this acquisition was based on estimated fair values as
determined by management. The preliminary purchase price allocation is
summarized below (in thousands):

Tangible assets acquired....................................  $113,741
Extraordinary gain -- negative goodwill.....................      (808)
Liabilities assumed.........................................    (4,461)
                                                              --------
                                                              $108,472
                                                              ========

     As the estimated fair value of the net assets exceeds the estimated
purchase price, the estimated fair values of all long-term assets were reduced
to zero for purchase accounting purposes. After such a reduction in values, and
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141,
"Business Combinations," estimated negative goodwill of approximately $808,000
will be recorded as an extraordinary gain in Exelixis' statement of operations
upon consummation of the merger. The extraordinary gain has been excluded from
the pro forma statements of operations due to its non-recurring nature.

     For pro forma purposes the estimated fair value of Exelixis common stock
was $13.30285 per share. The actual fair value of Exelixis common stock will be
either $14.78 per share, which represents the average closing sales price of
Exelixis common stock for the five day trading period surrounding November 19,
2001 (the day the merger was announced), or $13.30285 if the market value of
Exelixis common stock is below $13.30285 on the expiration date of the exchange
offer. If $14.78 had been used as the fair value per share of

                     NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED
                  COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

Exelixis common stock in the pro forma calculations as of October 31, 2001,
total estimated consideration would have been $121.1 million.

  ARTEMIS

     In May 2001, Exelixis acquired a majority of the outstanding capital stock
of Artemis Pharmaceuticals GmbH, a privately held genetics and functional
genomics company organized under the laws of Germany. The transaction, which was
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, was effected through the
exchange of shares of Exelixis common stock for DEM 1.00 of nominal value of
Artemis capital stock, using an exchange ratio of 4.064 to one. Approximately
1.6 million shares of Exelixis common stock were issued in exchange for 78% of
the outstanding capital stock of Artemis held by the Artemis stockholders. In
addition, Exelixis received a call option, or Call Option, from, and issued a
put option, or Put Option, to, certain stockholders of Artemis, or Option
Holders, for the issuance of approximately 480,000 shares of Exelixis common
stock in exchange for the remaining 22% of the outstanding capital stock of
Artemis held by the Artemis stockholders. Exelixis may exercise the Call Option
at any time from May 14, 2001 through January 31, 2002, and the Option Holders
may exercise their rights under the Put Option at any time from April 1, 2002
through May 15, 2002. In connection with the acquisition of Artemis, Exelixis
also issued fully vested rights to purchase approximately 187,000 additional
shares of Exelixis common stock to Artemis employees in exchange for such
employees' vested options formerly representing the right to purchase shares of
Artemis capital stock pursuant to an Employee Phantom Stock Option Program.

     The total consideration for the acquisition was approximately $22.3
million, which consisted of Exelixis common stock and options valued at $21.4
million and Exelixis transaction costs of $900,000. Exelixis' transaction costs
include financial advisory, legal, accounting and other fees.

     Based upon an independent valuation of the tangible and intangible assets
acquired, Exelixis management has allocated the total cost of the acquisition to
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows (in thousands):

Tangible assets acquired....................................  $ 6,848
In-process research and development.........................    6,673
Developed technology........................................    1,240
Assembled workforce.........................................    1,332
Goodwill....................................................    9,655
Patents/core technology.....................................      571
Liabilities assumed.........................................   (4,016)
                                                              -------
                                                              $22,303
                                                              =======

     Exelixis is amortizing the acquired intangible assets using the following
estimated useful lives:

Developed technology........................................   5 years
Patents/core technology.....................................  15 years
Assembled workforce.........................................   3 years
Goodwill....................................................  15 years

     The valuation of the purchased in-process research and development of $6.7
million was based upon the results of an independent valuation using the income
approach for each of the three significant in-process projects. The in-process
projects relate primarily to the development of technologies that use vertebrate
genetic model organisms, zebrafish and mice, to identify and functionally
validate novel genes in vivo. These genes can be used as novel screening targets
or as the basis for secreted proteins in clinically and commercially relevant
diseases. The in-process projects are expected to be completed over the next 18
months. The income approach estimates the value of each acquired in-process
project based on its expected future cash flows. The

                     NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED
                  COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

valuation analysis considered the contribution of the core technology as well as
the percent complete of each in-process research and development project. The
expected present value of the cash flows associated with the in-process research
and development projects was computed using a risk adjusted rate of return of
30%, which is considered commensurate with the overall risk and percent complete
of the in-process projects. The purchased in-process research and development
was not considered to have reached technological feasibility, and it has no
alternative future use, accordingly, it has been recorded as a component of
operating expense.

     The revenues, expenses, cash flows and other assumptions underlying the
estimated fair value of the acquired in-process research and development involve
significant risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties associated with
completing the acquired in-process projects include the ability to reach future
research milestones since the technologies being developed are unproven, the
ability to retain key personal, the ability to obtain licenses to key
technology, and the ability to avoid infringing on patents and propriety rights
of third parties.

  AGRITOPE

     On December 8, 2000, Exelixis completed its acquisition of Agritope, Inc.
("Agritope"). The transaction, which was accounted for under the purchase method
of accounting, was effected through the exchange of 0.35 of a share of Exelixis
common stock for each outstanding share of Agritope capital stock. Approximately
1.7 million shares of Exelixis common stock were issued in connection with the
transaction. In addition, unexpired and unexercised options and warrants to
purchase shares of Agritope capital stock were assumed by Exelixis pursuant to
the transaction and converted into fully vested options and warrants to purchase
approximately 880,000 shares of Exelixis common stock.

     The total consideration for the acquisition was approximately $93.5
million, which consists of Exelixis common stock, options and warrants valued at
$92.2 million and estimated Exelixis transaction costs of $1.3 million. Exelixis
transaction costs include financial advisory, legal, accounting and other fees.

     Based upon an independent valuation of the tangible and intangible assets
acquired, Exelixis management has allocated the total cost of the merger to the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows (in thousands):

     The valuation of the purchased in-process research and development of $38.1
million was based upon the results of an independent valuation using the income
approach for each of the ten projects in-process. The in-process projects relate
primarily to the development of disease and insect resistant fruits and
vegetables and are expected to be completed over approximately the next two to
five years. The income approach estimates the value of each acquired project
in-process based on its expected future cash flows. The valuation analysis

                     NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED
                  COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

considered the contribution of the core technology as well as the percent
complete of each in-process research and development project. The expected
present value of the cash flows associated with the in-process research and
development projects was computed using a risk adjusted rate of return of 35%
which is considered commensurate with the overall risk and percent complete of
the in-process projects. The purchased technology was not considered to have
reached technological feasibility, and it has no alternative future use,
accordingly, it has been recorded as a component of operating expense.

     The revenues, expenses, cash flows and other assumptions underlying the
estimated fair value of the acquired in-process research and development involve
significant risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties associated with
completing the acquired in-process projects include obtaining the necessary
regulatory approvals in a timely manner and being able to successfully and
profitably produce, distribute and sell products.

NOTE 3.  PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

     The following pro forma adjustments include management's preliminary
estimates of the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed in the Genomica merger which are subject to finalization.

     (A)  To reduce the carrying value of Genomica's long-term assets to zero
          due to the estimated fair value of the acquired net assets exceeding
          the estimated purchase price. As a result, no value has been assigned
          to developed technology acquired from Genomica. The estimated
          extraordinary gain of $808,000, resulting from negative goodwill, has
          been excluded from the pro forma statements of operations due to its
          non-recurring nature;

     (B)  Accrual of transaction related costs of approximately $800,000 for
          Exelixis and $3.3 million for Genomica;

     (C)  Elimination of the Genomica stockholder equity accounts;

     (D)  Issuance of Exelixis common stock, $0.001 par value, and warrants to
          purchase common stock, as discussed above;

     (E)  Elimination of Genomica's historical depreciation expense associated
          with the carrying value of the long-term assets that were reduced to
          zero due to the estimated fair value of the acquired net assets
          exceeding the estimated purchase price;

     (F)  Reduce deferred revenue to zero since future obligations are minimal;

     (G) Amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets acquired
         in the Agritope and Artemis mergers; and

     (H) Elimination of acquired in-process research and development acquired in
         the Agritope and Artemis mergers, which is considered non-recurring.

                     DESCRIPTION OF EXELIXIS CAPITAL STOCK

     The following description of our capital stock does not constitute a
complete description of all the terms of our capital stock and should be read in
conjunction with our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our
restated bylaws which we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
and are incorporated by reference herein. Our authorized capital stock consists
of 100,000,000 shares common stock, $0.001 par value, and 10,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, $0.001 par value.

     Exelixis Common Stock.  As of December 26, 2001, there were 49,660,178
shares of Exelixis common stock outstanding held of record by approximately 527
stockholders. The holders of Exelixis common stock are entitled to one vote for
each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the
stockholders. Accordingly, holders of a majority of the shares of common stock
entitled to vote in any election of directors may elect all of the directors
standing for election. Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any
preferred stock then outstanding, the holders of outstanding shares of common
stock are entitled to receive ratably any dividends out of assets legally
available therefor as the Exelixis board of directors may from time to time
determine. Upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Exelixis, holders of
common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment
of liabilities and the liquidation preference of any then outstanding shares of
preferred stock. Holders of common stock have no preemptive or conversion rights
or other subscription rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions
applicable to the common stock. All outstanding shares of Exelixis common stock
are fully paid and nonassessable.

     Exelixis Preferred Stock.  The Exelixis board of directors has the
authority to issue, subject to limitations prescribed by the rules and
regulations of the Nasdaq National Market, up to 10,000,000 shares of Exelixis
preferred stock, in one or more series and to determine the rights, preferences,
privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights,
conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preferences,
sinking fund terms and the number of shares constituting any series or the
destination of any series. The issuance of Exelixis preferred stock could
diminish the voting power of holders of Exelixis common stock, and the
likelihood that holders of Exelixis preferred stock will receive dividend
payments and payments upon liquidation may have the effect of delaying,
deferring or preventing a change in control of Exelixis. We have no present
plans to issue any shares of Exelixis preferred stock.

     Exelixis Warrants.  As of December 26, 2001, the following warrants to
purchase an aggregate of 496,220 shares of Exelixis common stock were
outstanding:

     - warrants to purchase 210,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price
       of $20.00 per share which expire on December 31, 2001;

     - warrants to purchase 29,167 shares of common stock at an exercise price
       of $20.98 per share which expire on December 31, 2001;

     - warrants to purchase 71,428 shares of common stock at an exercise price
       of $1.13 per share which expire on April 14, 2005;

     - warrants to purchase 106,875 shares of common stock at an exercise price
       of $4.00 per share which expire on April 14, 2005; and

     - warrants to purchase 78,750 shares of common stock at an exercise price
       of $13.00 per share which expire on April 14, 2005.

     The warrants contain provisions for the adjustment of the exercise price
and the aggregate number of shares that may be issued upon the exercise of the
warrants if a stock dividend, stock split, reorganization, reclassification or
consolidation occurs.

     General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and Certain Charter
Provisions.  In general, Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware prohibits a publicly held Delaware

corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested
stockholder for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder
became an interested stockholder unless:

     - before that time, the corporation's board of directors approved either
       the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the
       stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;

     - upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder
       becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at
       least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time
       the transaction commenced, excluding those shares owned by persons who
       are directors and also officers, and by employee stock plans in which
       employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially
       whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or
       exchange offer; or

     - on or after that time, the business combination is approved by the
       Exelixis board of directors and is authorized at an annual or special
       meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative
       vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock not owned by
       the interested stockholder.

     Section 203 defines "business combination" to include:

     - any merger or consolidation involving the corporation and the interested
       stockholder;

     - any sale, transfer, pledge or other disposition involving the interested
       stockholder of 10% or more of the assets of the corporation;

     - subject to exceptions, any transaction that results in the issuance or
       transfer by the corporation of any stock of the corporation to the
       interested stockholder; and

     - the receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit of any loans,
       advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits provided by or
       through the corporation.

     In general, Section 203 defines an interested stockholder as any entity or
person beneficially owning 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the
corporation and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or
controlled by the entity or person.

     Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires that any
action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at
a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be effected
by written consent. Additionally, our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation:

     - eliminates cumulative voting in the election of directors;

     - provides that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by
       resolution of our board of directors; and

     - authorizes our board of directors to issue 10,000,000 shares of preferred
       stock to increase the amount of outstanding shares.

     Our restated bylaws provide that candidates for director may be nominated
only by our board of directors or by a stockholder who gives us written notice
no later than 60 days prior nor earlier than 90 days before the first
anniversary of the last annual meeting of stockholders. The Exelixis board of
directors currently consists of ten members, divided into three classes. As a
result, a portion of the board of directors will be elected each year. The
Exelixis board of directors may appoint new directors to fill vacancies or newly
created directorships. The restated bylaws also limit who may call a special
meeting of stockholders.

     Delaware law and these charter provisions may have the effect of deterring
hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control of our management, which could
depress the market price of our common stock.

     Transfer Agent and Registrar.  The transfer agent and registrar for
Exelixis common stock is Mellon Investor Services LLC.

                 COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF EXELIXIS STOCKHOLDERS
                           AND GENOMICA STOCKHOLDERS

     Both Genomica and Exelixis are Delaware corporations and are governed by
Delaware law. In addition, the rights of Genomica stockholders are currently
governed by the Genomica restated certificate of incorporation and the Genomica
amended and restated bylaws, and the rights of Exelixis stockholders are
governed by the Exelixis amended and restated certificate of incorporation and
the Exelixis restated bylaws. After the effective time of the merger, the rights
of holders of Genomica capital stock who become holders of Exelixis common stock
will be governed by the Exelixis amended and restated certificate of
incorporation, the Exelixis restated bylaws and Delaware law. In most respects,
the rights of holders of Genomica capital stock are similar to the rights of
holders of Exelixis common stock. The following is a summary of the similarities
and material differences between such rights. This summary does not purport to
be a complete discussion of, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to,
