November 8, 2001

To the Stockholders of GlobeSpan, Inc. and Virata Corporation:

    The boards of directors of GlobeSpan, Inc. and Virata Corporation have
approved a "merger of equals" between the two companies, which will have the
effect of combining the businesses, stockholder groups and other constituencies
of GlobeSpan and Virata. The combined company, to be named GlobeSpan
Virata, Inc., is expected to be a leading provider of integrated circuits,
software and system designs for digital subscriber line (DSL) solutions. In
order to complete the merger, both companies must obtain the approval of their
stockholders. GlobeSpan and Virata believe that this merger will benefit the
stockholders of both companies and ask for your support in voting for the merger
proposals at the companies' respective meetings.

    Under the terms of the merger agreement, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
GlobeSpan will merge with and into Virata and Virata will become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of GlobeSpan. In the merger, each share of common stock of Virata
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be
converted into 1.02 shares of GlobeSpan common stock. In addition, outstanding
Virata stock options will be assumed by GlobeSpan. GlobeSpan common stock is
traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "GSPN."

    After careful consideration, the boards of directors of both GlobeSpan and
Virata have determined that the merger and the transactions associated with it,
including the issuance of GlobeSpan common stock in the merger, are advisable,
fair to and in the best interests of their respective stockholders and have
approved the merger agreement. The board of directors of Virata recommends that
their stockholders vote "FOR" the approval and adoption of the merger agreement
and the merger. The GlobeSpan board of directors recommends that their
stockholders vote "FOR" the issuance of GlobeSpan common stock in the merger and
"FOR" the amendment to GlobeSpan's certificate of incorporation to change the
name of GlobeSpan to "GlobeSpan Virata, Inc." at the effective time of the
merger.

    In order to consider the proposals relating to the merger, GlobeSpan and
Virata will hold separate special meetings of their stockholders at the Oyster
Point Hotel, 146 Bodman Place, Red Bank, New Jersey, on December 14, 2001, at
10:00 a.m. Eastern time. The boards of directors of both GlobeSpan and Virata
have fixed the close of business on November 2, 2001 as the record date for the
determination of the stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the
respective special meetings.

    YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE MATTERS DISCUSSED UNDER "RISK FACTORS" COMMENCING ON
PAGE 18 OF THE ENCLOSED JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS BEFORE VOTING. Please
carefully review the entire joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the
merger agreement, which is attached as Annex A.

    It is important that your shares be represented at the GlobeSpan special
meeting or Virata special meeting, whether or not you plan to attend the meeting
in person. Please complete, sign and date the enclosed proxy card and return in
the accompanying prepaid envelope to ensure that your shares will be represented

    We thank you for your support and interest.

                      QUESTIONS & ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q: WHY ARE GLOBESPAN AND VIRATA PROPOSING THE MERGER?

A: The telecommunications industry continues to change dramatically as a result
    of developments in technology, customer needs and the range of product
    offerings made possible by these changes. We believe that companies that
    offer a full range of integrated circuits and software products for
    telecommunications equipment manufacturers will be the most effective
    competitors in the rapidly developing telecommunications equipment industry.
    We believe that our merger will create a global leader that will provide a
    broad range of integrated circuits, semiconductors and software for DSL
    applications to telecommunications equipment manufacturers.

    To review the reasons for the merger in greater detail, see pages 33
    through 37.

Q: WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE MERGER?

A: In the merger, Virata will merge with a wholly-owned subsidiary of GlobeSpan
    and become a wholly-owned subsidiary of GlobeSpan. The merger agreement is
    attached to this joint proxy statement/ prospectus as Annex A. You are
    encouraged to read it carefully.

Q: WHAT WILL I RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?

A: GlobeSpan stockholders:
    Following the merger, each share of GlobeSpan common stock and each option
    and warrant to purchase GlobeSpan common stock will remain outstanding.

    Virata stockholders:
    Following the merger:

    - Virata stockholders will receive, in exchange for each of their Virata
      shares, 1.02 shares of GlobeSpan common stock. For example, if a
      stockholder owned 100 shares of Virata common stock, he or she would
      receive 102 shares of GlobeSpan common stock after the merger.

    - Instead of fractional shares of GlobeSpan common stock, Virata
      stockholders will receive cash.

    - Each option to purchase Virata common stock outstanding immediately before
      the completion of the merger will automatically become an option to
      purchase shares of GlobeSpan common stock, for an adjusted number of
      shares and with an adjusted exercise price based on the 1.02 exchange
      ratio. After the merger, a notice will be sent to each Virata optionholder
      specifying this adjustment.

Q: WHAT ARE THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER?

A: It is a condition to the merger that both GlobeSpan and Virata receive legal
    opinions from their respective tax counsel to the effect that the merger
    will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
    the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Assuming that the merger so
    qualifies, neither GlobeSpan nor Virata will recognize gain or loss for
    United States federal income tax purposes as a result of the merger. In
    addition, Virata stockholders will not recognize any gain or loss, except
    for gain or loss attributable to cash received by Virata stockholders
    instead of fractional shares of GlobeSpan common stock.

    The tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on your own situation.
    You should consult your tax advisors for a full understanding of these tax
    consequences.

Q: ARE THE UNITED KINGDOM TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER THE SAME AS THE UNITED
    STATES TAX CONSEQUENCES?

A: The tax considerations and consequences for persons who are resident or
    ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom for United Kingdom tax purposes
    and who hold Virata common stock beneficially as an investment and will hold
    GlobeSpan common stock received in exchange as an investment may be
    different from the tax considerations and consequences of a Virata
    stockholder in the United States.

    The tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on your own situation.
    You should consult your tax advisors for a full understanding of these tax
    consequences.

Q: SHOULD I SEND IN MY VIRATA STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW?

A: No. After the merger is completed Virata stockholders will receive written
    instructions for exchanging their stock certificates. Please do not send in
    your Virata stock certificates with your proxy.

Q: WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO COMPLETE THE MERGER?

A: We are working to complete the merger as quickly as practicable. In addition
    to the required stockholder approvals, we must also obtain certain
    regulatory approvals. We expect to complete the merger in the fourth quarter
    of 2001 or the first quarter of 2002.

Q: DO I HAVE APPRAISAL RIGHTS?

A: No. No rights of appraisal are available for any shares of stock.

Q: WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?

A: Carefully read and consider the information contained in this document. There
    are several ways your shares can be represented at your stockholder meeting.
    You can attend your stockholder meeting in person or you can indicate on the
    enclosed proxy card how you want to vote and then sign and mail the proxy
    card in the enclosed return envelope as soon as possible.

    Your vote is important regardless of the number of shares that you own.

Q: IF MY BROKER HOLDS MY SHARES IN "STREET NAME," WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY SHARES?

A: Your broker will not vote your shares unless you follow the voting directions
    your broker provides to you.

    GlobeSpan stockholders:
    If you fail to provide your broker with instructions, it will not affect the
    number of votes for or against the issuance of shares of GlobeSpan common
    stock in the merger, but it will have the same effect as a vote against the
    proposal to amend GlobeSpan's certificate of incorporation to change the
    name of GlobeSpan to "GlobeSpan Virata, Inc."

    Virata stockholders:

    If you fail to provide your broker with instructions, it will have the same
    effect as a vote against the merger.

Q: CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I HAVE DELIVERED MY PROXY?

A: Yes. You can change your vote by sending in a written notice of revocation or
    a later-dated, signed proxy card to your company's secretary before your
    stockholders meeting or by attending the meeting in person and voting.

Q: WHAT IF I DON'T VOTE?

A: GlobeSpan stockholders:

    If you do not vote it will not affect the number of votes for or against the
    issuance of shares of GlobeSpan common stock in the merger but it will have
    the same effect as a vote against the proposal to amend GlobeSpan's
    certificate of incorporation to change the name of GlobeSpan to "GlobeSpan
    Virata, Inc." An abstention will have the same effect as a vote against the
    issuance of shares of GlobeSpan common stock in the merger and a vote
    against the proposal to amend GlobeSpan's certificate of incorporation to
    change its name.

    Virata stockholders:

    If you do not vote or if you return your proxy marked "ABSTAIN," it will
    have the same effect as a vote against the merger.

WHAT YOU WILL RECEIVE IN THE MERGER (PAGE 54)

outstanding and each option and warrant to purchase GlobeSpan common stock will
also remain outstanding.

    In the merger, Virata stockholders will receive, in exchange for each of
their Virata shares, 1.02 shares of GlobeSpan common stock. In addition, Virata
stockholders will receive cash instead of any fractional shares of GlobeSpan
common stock to which they are otherwise entitled.

OUR REASONS FOR THE MERGER (PAGE 33)

    Our respective boards of directors have approved the merger agreement and
the transactions associated with it and have determined that they are advisable,
fair to and in the best interests of our respective stockholders. In reaching
their respective decisions, our boards of directors considered a number of
factors including that the combination of the companies would:

    - create a combined entity with the critical mass and global presence to
      better serve the needs of our customers and to compete with much larger
      industry participants;

    - expand the range of products and services that the combined company can
      offer to its customers, including the ability to offer end-to-end
      solutions covering DSL physical layer and communications processors for
      DSL applications;

    - facilitate faster introduction to the market of more integrated, lower
      cost products;

    - create a management team with industry experience which combines the
      strengths of both companies;

    - bring together the technical expertise of both companies' engineering
      teams;

    - combine our research and development efforts, thereby enhancing our
      ability to innovate in order to serve our customers' needs; and

    - create synergies through economies of scale, the combination of our sales
      and service forces and the integration of our complementary product lines.

CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS (PAGE 48)

    It is a condition to the merger that both GlobeSpan and Virata receive legal
opinions from their respective tax counsel to the effect that the merger will
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Assuming that the merger so
qualifies, Virata stockholders will not recognize any gain or loss except for
gain or loss, attributable to cash received by Virata stockholders instead of
fractional shares of GlobeSpan common stock. Stockholders should consult their
tax advisors for a full understanding of all of the tax consequences of the
merger to them.

CERTAIN UNITED KINGDOM TAX CONSIDERATIONS (PAGE 49)

    The tax considerations and consequences for persons who are resident or
ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom for United Kingdom tax purposes and
who hold Virata common stock beneficially as an investment and will hold
GlobeSpan common stock received in exchange as an investment may be different
from the tax considerations and consequences of a Virata stockholder in the
United States. Stockholders should consult their tax advisors for a full
understanding of all of the tax consequences of the merger to them.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT (PAGE 50)

    We will treat the merger as a purchase under generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States.

    Certain GlobeSpan and Virata directors, officers and stockholders have
interests in the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, those of
other stockholders. These interests include: (i) the acceleration of options
held by non-employee directors of Virata upon consummation of the transaction,
(ii) the payment of bonuses to Andrew Vought and Charles Cotton, officers of
Virata, upon consummation of the transaction, (iii) the post-merger membership
of the board of directors of the combined company, (iv) the indemnification of
directors and officers of Virata against certain liabilities both before and
after the merger, (v) new employment agreements between GlobeSpan and Armando
Geday and Charles Cotton, respectively and (vi) the agreement of the two
companies to use

reasonable commercial efforts to enter into employment arrangements with several
officers of GlobeSpan and Virata. The members of our respective boards of
directors knew about these interests and considered them, among other matters,
when they approved the merger agreement and the merger.

Virata, Inc.," although stockholder approval of the amendment to GlobeSpan's

           CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

    Any statements in this document about our expectations, beliefs, plans,
objectives, assumptions or future events or performance are not historical facts
and are forward-looking statements. These statements are often, but not always,
made through the use of words or phrases such as "believe," "will likely
result," "expect," "will continue," "anticipate," "estimate," "intend," "plan,"
"projection," "would" and "outlook." Accordingly, these statements involve
estimates, assumptions and uncertainties which could cause actual results to
differ materially from those expressed in them. Any forward-looking statements
are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed throughout
this document. The following cautionary statements identify important factors
that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in
the forward-looking statements made in this document. Among the key factors that
may have a direct bearing on our results of operations are the:

    - general economic and business conditions; the existence or absence of
      adverse publicity; changes in marketing and technology; changes in
      political, social and economic conditions and world events;

    - competition in the telecommunications equipment industry; general risks of
      the communications industry;

    - success of acquisitions and operating initiatives; changes in business
      strategy or development plans; management of growth;

    - dependence on senior management; business abilities and judgment of
      personnel; availability of qualified personnel; labor and employee benefit
      costs;

    - ability to integrate effectively the two companies' technology, operations
      and personnel in a timely and efficient manner;

    - ability of the combined company to retain and hire key executives,
      technical personnel and other employees;

    - ability of the combined company to manage its growth and the difficulty of
      successfully managing a larger, more geographically dispersed
      organization;

    - ability of the combined company to manage successfully its changing
      relationships with customers, suppliers, value added resellers and
      strategic partners;

    - ability of the combined company's customers to accept new product
      offerings; and

    - timing of, and regulatory and other conditions associated with, the
      completion of the merger and the ability of the combined company to
      combine operations and obtain revenue synergies or sales growth following
      the merger.

    These factors, the risk factors referred to below and the other risk factors
listed from time to time in the reports and other documents GlobeSpan or Virata
file with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results or
outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking
statements made by us, and you should not place undue reliance on any such
forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only
as of the date on which it is made and we undertake no obligation to update any
forward-looking statement or statements to reflect events or circumstances after
the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of
unanticipated events. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not
possible for us to predict which will arise. In addition, we cannot assess the
impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statements.

                                  RISK FACTORS

    STOCKHOLDERS OF GLOBESPAN AND VIRATA SHOULD CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS,
IN ADDITION TO OTHER RISK FACTORS OF THE TWO COMPANIES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE
INTO THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS AND THE OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED
IN THIS DOCUMENT, IN DECIDING WHETHER TO VOTE FOR APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE
MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER, IN THE CASE OF VIRATA STOCKHOLDERS, OR FOR
APPROVAL OF THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF GLOBESPAN COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER, IN
THE CASE OF GLOBESPAN STOCKHOLDERS. SEE "WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION" ON
PAGE 15 FOR WHERE YOU CAN FIND THE ADDITIONAL RISK FACTORS INCORPORATED BY
REFERENCE.

VIRATA STOCKHOLDERS WILL RECEIVE 1.02 SHARES OF GLOBESPAN COMMON STOCK IN
EXCHANGE FOR EACH SHARE OF VIRATA COMMON STOCK REGARDLESS OF CHANGES IN THE
RELATIVE MARKET VALUE OF VIRATA COMMON STOCK AND GLOBESPAN COMMON STOCK.

    Each share of Virata common stock will be exchanged for 1.02 shares of
GlobeSpan common stock upon completion of the merger. This exchange ratio is a
fixed number and the merger agreement does not contain any provision to adjust
this ratio for changes in the market price of either Virata common stock or
GlobeSpan common stock. Neither party is permitted to terminate the merger
agreement solely because of changes in the market price of GlobeSpan or Virata
common stock. Consequently, the specific dollar value of GlobeSpan common stock
to be received by Virata stockholders will depend on the market value of
GlobeSpan at the time of completion of the merger and may decrease from the date
of the special meeting or the date that you submit your proxy. You are urged to
obtain recent market quotations for GlobeSpan common stock and Virata common
stock. The companies cannot predict or give any assurances as to the market
price of GlobeSpan common stock or Virata common stock at any time before the
merger or the common stock of the combined company after the merger. The prices
of GlobeSpan common stock and Virata common stock may vary because of factors
such as:

    - changes in the business, operating results or prospects of GlobeSpan or
      Virata;

    - actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations;

    - market assessments of the likelihood that the merger will be completed;

    - the timing of the completion of the merger;

    - sales of GlobeSpan common stock or Virata common stock;

    - additions or departures of key personnel;

    - announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint
      ventures or capital commitments;

    - conditions or trends in the telecommunications industry;

    - announcements of technological innovations or the discontinuation of
      products or services by GlobeSpan, Virata, their competitors or their
      customers;

    - changes in market valuations of other telecommunications companies;

    - the prospects of post-merger operations;

    - regulatory considerations; and

    - general market and economic conditions.

    If the merger is successfully completed, holders of Virata common stock will
become holders of GlobeSpan common stock. GlobeSpan's business differs from
Virata's business, and GlobeSpan's results of operations, as well as the price
of GlobeSpan common stock, may be affected by factors different than those
affecting Virata's results of operations and the price of Virata common stock.

GLOBESPAN AND VIRATA MAY NOT ACHIEVE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS FROM THE MERGER,
WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMBINED COMPANY'S BUSINESS,
FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS.

    GlobeSpan and Virata entered into the merger agreement with the expectation
that the merger will result in benefits to the combined company arising out of
the creation of a global provider of a broad range of integrated circuits and
software for DSL applications to communications equipment manufacturers. To
realize any benefits or synergies from the merger, the combined company will
face the following post-merger challenges:

    - combining product and service offerings effectively and efficiently;

    - retaining and assimilating the management, employees and sales forces of
      each company;

    - selling the existing products of each company to the other company's
      customers;

    - retaining existing customers, strategic partners and suppliers of each
      company;

    - developing new products that utilize the assets and resources of both
      companies;

    - realizing expected cost savings and synergies from the merger; and

    - developing and maintaining consistent standards, controls, procedures,
      policies and information systems.

    If the combined company is not successful in addressing these and other
challenges, then the benefits of the merger will not be realized and, as a
result, the combined company's operating results and the market price of the
combined company's common stock may be adversely affected. Further, neither
GlobeSpan nor Virata can assure you that the growth rate of the combined company
will equal the historical growth rates experienced either by GlobeSpan or
Virata.

THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMBINED COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK MAY DECLINE AS A RESULT
OF THE MERGER.

    The market price of the combined company's common stock may decline as a
result of the merger for a number of reasons, including if:

    - the integration of GlobeSpan and Virata is not completed in a timely and
      efficient manner;

    - the combined company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the merger
      as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts;

    - the effect of the merger on the combined company's financial results is
      not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts; or

    - significant stockholders of GlobeSpan and Virata decide to dispose of
      their shares following completion of the merger.

GLOBESPAN'S AND VIRATA'S OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS HAVE INTERESTS DIFFERENT FROM
YOURS THAT MAY HAVE INFLUENCED THEM TO SUPPORT OR APPROVE THE MERGER.

    The directors and officers of GlobeSpan and Virata have entered into
arrangements which may create interests in the merger that are different from,
or in addition to, yours, including the following:

    - several non-employee directors of Virata hold stock options that will
      accelerate upon the merger;

    - some of Virata's officers have employment agreements that provide for
      bonus payments in the event of a transaction such as the merger;

    - GlobeSpan has agreed that its board of directors will take all action
      necessary so that as of the effective time, the board of directors of
      GlobeSpan will consist of eight members, four of whom will be designated
      by GlobeSpan and four of whom will be designated by Virata;

    - GlobeSpan and Virata have agreed and GlobeSpan has entered into contracts
      providing that Armando Geday will serve as the combined company's
      president and chief executive officer and that Charles Cotton will serve
      as the combined company's executive chairman of the board for one year
      following the merger and non-executive chairman afterwards;

    - GlobeSpan has agreed to indemnify each present and former Virata officer
      and director against liabilities arising out of such person's services as
      an officer or director;

    - GlobeSpan will maintain officers' and directors' liability insurance to
      cover any such liabilities for the next six years; and

    - GlobeSpan and Virata have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to
      enter into new employment arrangements with specified key employees.

    For the above reasons, the directors and officers of GlobeSpan and Virata
may have been more likely to support and recommend the approval of the merger
agreement than if they did not hold these interests. GlobeSpan stockholders and
Virata stockholders should consider whether these interests may have influenced
these directors and officers to support or recommend the merger. You should read
more about these interests under "The Merger--Interests of Certain Persons in
the Merger."

UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE MERGER AND THE EFFECTS OF THE MERGER COULD CAUSE EACH
COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS, STRATEGIC PARTNERS OR KEY EMPLOYEES TO DELAY OR DEFER
DECISIONS.

    GlobeSpan's and/or Virata's customers and strategic partners, in response to
the announcement of the merger, may delay or defer decisions, which could have a
material adverse effect on the business of the relevant company, regardless of
whether the merger is ultimately completed. Similarly, current and prospective
GlobeSpan and/or Virata employees may experience uncertainty about their future
roles with the combined company, which may adversely affect GlobeSpan's and/or
Virata's ability to attract and retain key management, sales, marketing and
technical personnel. Further, if the merger is terminated and either company's
board of directors determines to seek another merger or business combination,
there can be no assurance that it will be able to find a partner on terms
similar to those provided for in the merger agreement. While the merger
agreement is in effect, and subject to very narrowly defined exceptions, each
party is prohibited from soliciting, initiating, encouraging or entering into
certain extraordinary transactions, such as a merger, sale of assets or other
business combination with any third party which may discourage any other
strategic partner from making an offer for either company superior to the
proposed merger.

GLOBESPAN AND VIRATA MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE REQUIRED REGULATORY APPROVALS
FOR COMPLETION OF THE MERGER.

    GlobeSpan and Virata cannot complete the merger until they give notification
and furnish information to the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice and observe a statutory waiting period
requirement. GlobeSpan and Virata filed the required notification and report
forms with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division as of
October 15, 2001. At any time before or after the effective time of the merger,
the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division or any state or competition
authority of another country could take any action under the applicable
antitrust or competition laws as it deems necessary or desirable. Private
parties may also institute legal actions under the antitrust laws under some
circumstances. These actions could include seeking to enjoin the completion of
the merger.

REGULATORS MAY TAKE ACTION THAT COULD AFFECT, DELAY OR PROHIBIT THE MERGER OR
NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMBINED COMPANY AND STOCKHOLDERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO
CHANGE THEIR VOTE IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH ACTION.

    The statutory waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, has not expired and there can be no
assurance that regulators will terminate or allow the waiting period to expire
without seeking additional information, taking action to prohibit the merger or
conditioning the merger on restrictions that would negatively impact the
combined company. Any such action may have the effect of delaying, changing the
terms of or preventing the merger. In addition, if the necessary stockholder
approvals are obtained prior to any such regulatory action that could have an
effect on the merger or the combined company, stockholders may not have the
opportunity to re-vote or change their vote.

BECAUSE THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL HAVE LARGER REVENUES AND OPERATIONS, THIRD
PARTIES WITH POTENTIAL LITIGATION CLAIMS AGAINST EITHER GLOBESPAN OR VIRATA WHO
DECIDED NOT TO PURSUE THOSE CLAIMS AGAINST THE INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES MAY CONSIDER
ASSERTING THOSE CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMBINED COMPANY.

    We believe that the combined company will have significantly greater
revenues than either GlobeSpan or Virata individually, operations in more
countries than either GlobeSpan or Virata individually, and potentially more
employees than either GlobeSpan or Virata individually. As a result, it can be
expected that some third parties who believe that they have claims against one
or the other of GlobeSpan or Virata, but who chose not to assert those claims
because of the size of the individual companies, may now believe that those
claims against the larger combined company may be advantageous.

THE COMBINED COMPANY'S QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE BECAUSE OF MANY
FACTORS, WHICH WOULD CAUSE THE COMBINED COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE TO FLUCTUATE.

    Both GlobeSpan's and Virata's net revenues and operating results have
fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future
on a quarterly and annual basis due to a number of factors, many of which are
outside either company's control. Investors should not rely on the results of
any one quarter or series of quarters as an indication of the combined company's
future performance.

    It is likely that in some future quarter or quarters the combined company's
operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or
investors. In such event, the market price of the combined company's common
stock may decline significantly. Due to GlobeSpan's recent acquisitions
accounted for as purchases and the proposed merger, the combined company will
incur substantial non-cash compensation and amortization expenses associated
with those and, potentially, future transactions.

GLOBESPAN AND VIRATA BOTH HAVE A HISTORY OF LOSSES, AND THE COMBINED COMPANY IS
EXPECTED TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES IN THE FUTURE, WHICH MAY PREVENT THE
COMBINED COMPANY FROM ACHIEVING OR SUSTAINING PROFITABILITY OR POSITIVE CASH
FLOW.

    GlobeSpan incurred a net loss attributable to common stockholders of
$192.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2001, and $153.1 million,
$9.1 million and $7.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively. Virata has not reported a profit for any fiscal year since
its incorporation and has an accumulated deficit of $293.1 million at July 1,
2001. The combined company expects to continue to incur net losses, and these
losses may be substantial. Because of substantial operating expenses, the
combined company will need to generate significant quarterly revenues to achieve
profitability or positive cash flow. The combined company's failure to
significantly increase net revenues would result in continuing losses. Even if
the combined company does achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain
or increase profitability or cash flow on a quarterly or annual basis. We cannot
forecast with any degree of accuracy what the combined company's revenues will
be in future periods. The combined company's ability to continue to operate our
business and

implement our business strategy may thus be hampered, and the value of the
combined company's stock may decline.

THE LOSS OF ONE OR MORE OF GLOBESPAN'S OR VIRATA'S KEY CUSTOMERS WOULD RESULT IN
A LOSS OF A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE COMBINED COMPANY'S NET REVENUES.

    A relatively small number of customers account for a large percentage of
GlobeSpan's and Virata's net revenues. We expect this trend to continue. The
combined company's business will be seriously harmed if the combined company
does not generate as much revenue as we expect from these customers, experiences
a loss of any of our significant customers or suffers a substantial reduction in
orders from these customers. In the three months ended June 30, 2001,
GlobeSpan's three largest customers accounted for 62.7% of its net revenues and
the two customers who represented at least ten percent of its net revenues
during such period accounted for 32.2% and 26.4%, respectively, of its net
revenues. For the three months ended July 1, 2001, Virata's two customers who
represented at least ten percent of its total revenues during such period
accounted for 50.0% and 19.9%, respectively, of its total revenues. GlobeSpan's
and Virata's results in the first six months of 2001 were adversely affected by
reduced purchases by some of their customers, reflecting their reduced sales of
DSL equipment.

GLOBESPAN AND VIRATA HAVE ONLY LIMITED OPERATING HISTORIES AS INDEPENDENT
COMPANIES, AND THIS COMBINED LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO
EVALUATE THE COMBINED COMPANY'S PROSPECTS.

    GlobeSpan has only been operating as an independent company since
August 1996 and only began shipping chip sets in volume in January 1997.
GlobeSpan has not had a long history of generating significant net revenues.
Furthermore, Virata has not had a long history of selling its products to the
DSL market or generating significant revenues and many of its products have only
recently been introduced. As a result of each company's limited operating
history, we have limited historical financial data that can be used in
evaluating our combined business and our prospects and in projecting future
operating results. You must consider the combined company's prospects in light
of the risks, expenses and difficulties we might encounter because we are in a
rapidly evolving market.

THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL DEPEND ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS TO MANUFACTURE
PRODUCTS, AND ANY DISRUPTION IN ANY OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS COULD PREVENT US FROM
SELLING OUR PRODUCTS.

    Neither GlobeSpan nor Virata owns or operates a semiconductor fabrication
facility. The combined company intends to continue to rely on third-party
foundries and other specialist suppliers for all of our manufacturing, assembly
and testing requirements. However, these foundries are not obligated to supply
products to the combined company for any specific period, in any specific
quantity or at any specific price, except as may be provided in a particular
purchase order that has been accepted by one of them. As a result, we cannot
directly control semiconductor delivery schedules, which could lead to product
shortages, quality assurance problems and increases in the costs of the combined
company's products. The combined company may experience delays in the future and
we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain semiconductors within the time
frames and in the volumes required by us at an affordable cost or at all. Any
disruption in the availability of semiconductors or any problems associated with
the delivery, quality or cost of the fabrication assembly and testing of the
combined company's products could significantly hinder the combined company's
ability to deliver products to customers and may result in a decrease in the
sales of the combined company's products.

    If the combined company is required for any reason to seek a new
manufacturer of its products, a new manufacturer may not be available and, in
any event, switching to a new manufacturer would require six months or more and
would involve significant expense and disruption to the combined company's
business. From time to time there are shortages in worldwide foundry capacity.
Such shortages, if they occur, could make it more difficult for us to find a new
manufacturer of the combined company's products if the combined company's
relationship with any of our suppliers is terminated for any reason.

BECAUSE THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL COMPETE ARE HIGHLY
COMPETITIVE AND MANY OF THE COMBINED COMPANY'S COMPETITORS HAVE GREATER
RESOURCES, WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT THE COMBINED COMPANY'S PRODUCTS WILL BE
ACCEPTED IN THE MARKETPLACE OR CAPTURE MARKET SHARE.

    The market for software and communications semiconductor solutions is
intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, evolving
standards, short product life cycles and price erosion. We expect competition to
intensify as current competitors expand their product offerings and new
competitors enter the market. Given the highly competitive environment in which
we will operate, we cannot be sure that any competitive advantages enjoyed by
the combined company's products would be sufficient to establish and sustain the
combined company's products in the market. Any increase in price or other
competition, unforeseen technological changes or the widespread adoption of
standards incompatible with those on which the combined company's products are
predicated could result in the erosion of the combined company's market share,
to the extent we have obtained market share, and would have a negative impact on
the combined company's financial condition and results of operations. We cannot
be sure that the combined company will have the financial resources, technical
expertise or marketing and support capabilities to continue to compete
successfully.

BECAUSE GLOBESPAN AND VIRATA HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF
THE UNITED STATES, THE COMBINED COMPANY MAY BE SUBJECT TO POLITICAL, ECONOMIC
AND OTHER CONDITIONS AFFECTING SUCH COUNTRIES THAT COULD RESULT IN INCREASED
OPERATING EXPENSES AND REGULATION OF ITS PRODUCTS.

    Significant portions of GlobeSpan's and Virata's operations occur outside
the United States. The combined company will have subsidiaries in the United
Kingdom, France, Taiwan, Israel and India and sales offices in several other
countries. These international operations are subject to a number of risks,
including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; longer sales cycles;
multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations;
protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competition;
difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; and political and economic
instability. In addition, in September 1999, Taiwan was affected by a
significant earthquake. The risk of future earthquakes is significant due to the
proximity of major earthquake fault lines in the area. Taiwan has also suffered
from political unrest. Any future earthquakes, fire, flooding or other natural
disasters, political unrest, labor strikes or work stoppages in Taiwan likely
would result in the disruption of our operations at that facility. Further, the
combined company will be affected by the political, economic and military
conditions affecting Israel. Major hostilities involving Israel, including those
sparked by current events, could significantly harm our business. Israel's
economy has been and continues to be subject to numerous destabilizing factors,
including low foreign exchange reserves, fluctuations in world commodity prices,
military conflicts and civil unrest. We cannot predict whether or in what manner
these problems will be resolved. In addition, some of the officers and employees
of the Israeli subsidiary are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty
in the Israeli armed forces and are subject to being called to active duty at
any time under emergency circumstances. We cannot assess or predict the full
impact of these obligations on its workforce or business.

THE COMBINED COMPANY COULD BE SUBJECT TO CLASS ACTION LITIGATION DUE TO STOCK
PRICE VOLATILITY, WHICH, IF IT OCCURS, WILL DISTRACT MANAGEMENT AND RESULT IN
SUBSTANTIAL COSTS, AND COULD RESULT IN JUDGMENTS AGAINST THE COMBINED COMPANY.

    In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought
against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their
securities. The combined company may be the target of similar litigation in the
future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert
management's attention and resources, which could cause serious harm to the
combined company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

                         THE GLOBESPAN SPECIAL MEETING

    This joint proxy statement/prospectus is furnished in connection with the
solicitation of proxies from holders of GlobeSpan common stock by the GlobeSpan
board of directors for use at the special meeting of GlobeSpan stockholders.

TIME AND PLACE; PURPOSE

    The special meeting will be held at the Oyster Point Hotel, 146 Bodman
Place, Red Bank, New Jersey, on December 14, 2001, starting at 10:00 a.m.,
Eastern time. At the special meeting, GlobeSpan common stockholders will be
asked to consider and vote upon the following proposals:

    - to approve the issuance of shares of GlobeSpan common stock pursuant to
      the merger agreement; and

    - to approve an amendment to GlobeSpan's certificate of incorporation to
      change the name of GlobeSpan to "GlobeSpan Virata, Inc." at the effective
      time of the proposed merger with Virata.

    GlobeSpan stockholders also may be asked to vote upon a proposal to adjourn
or postpone the GlobeSpan special meeting. GlobeSpan could use any adjournment
or postponement of the GlobeSpan special meeting for the purpose, among others,
of allowing additional time for soliciting additional votes to approve the
issuance of the shares of GlobeSpan common stock pursuant to the merger
agreement.

RECORD DATE AND OUTSTANDING SHARES

    The GlobeSpan board of directors has fixed the close of business on
November 2, 2001, as the record date for purposes of voting at the special
meeting. Only holders of record of shares of common stock on the record date are
entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. On the record date,
there were 74,234,684 shares of GlobeSpan common stock outstanding and entitled
to vote at the special meeting held by 835 stockholders of record. The record
stockholder number does not include the number of persons whose stock is in
nominee or "street name" accounts through brokers.

VOTE AND QUORUM REQUIRED

    Each holder of record, as of the record date, of shares of common stock is
entitled to cast one vote per share. The presence, in person or by proxy, of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote
is necessary to constitute a quorum at the special meeting.

    The affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of at least a majority of the
votes properly cast, is required to approve the share issuance pursuant to the
merger agreement. The affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of a majority of
the shares outstanding as of the record date is required to approve the
amendment to GlobeSpan's certificate of incorporation to change its name.
GlobeSpan and Virata have agreed that the name of the combined company will be
"GlobeSpan Virata, Inc.," although the approval of the amendment to the
certificate of incorporation is not a condition to the merger. As of
November 2, 2001, directors and executive officers of GlobeSpan and their
affiliates beneficially owned an aggregate of 17,017,413 shares of GlobeSpan
common stock entitled to vote at the GlobeSpan special meeting, or approximately
22.9% of the shares of GlobeSpan common stock outstanding and entitled to vote
on such date.

    Some stockholders of GlobeSpan have entered into a stockholders agreement
with Virata. Under the stockholders agreement, the stockholders have agreed to
vote in favor of the issuance of the shares pursuant to the merger agreement and
the name change. The stock subject to this agreement represents approximately
10% of the voting power of GlobeSpan. See "Related Agreements--GlobeSpan
Stockholders Agreement."

HOW SHARES WILL BE VOTED AT THE SPECIAL MEETING

    All shares of common stock represented by properly executed proxies received
before or at the special meeting, and not revoked, will be voted as specified in
the proxies. Properly executed proxies

that do not contain voting instructions will be voted "FOR" the adoption of the
proposals set forth in the accompanying notice of special meeting.

    A properly executed proxy marked "ABSTAIN" with respect to any proposal will
be counted as present for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum at
the special meeting. Abstentions, however, will have the same effect as a vote
against the adoption of each of the proposals.

    In the event that a broker, bank, custodian, nominee or other record holder
of GlobeSpan's common stock indicates on a proxy that it does not have
discretionary authority to vote certain shares on a particular matter, which is
called a broker non-vote, those shares will not be considered for purposes of
determining the number of votes properly cast with respect to a particular
proposal on which the broker has expressly not voted, but will be counted for
purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction
of business. As a result, if you fail to provide your broker with instructions,
it will not affect the number of votes for or against the issuance of shares of
GlobeSpan common stock in the merger, but will have the same effect as a vote
against the adoption of the amendment to GlobeSpan's certificate of
incorporation.

    GlobeSpan's board of directors is not currently aware of any business to be
acted upon at the special meeting, other than the proposals described in the
accompanying notice of special meeting.

    The people named as proxies by a stockholder may propose and vote for one or
more adjournments of the special meeting to permit further solicitations of
proxies in favor of approval of the issuance of the shares of GlobeSpan common
stock in the merger and the amendment to GlobeSpan's certificate of
incorporation to change its name, except that no proxy which is voted against
the approval of these proposals will be voted in favor of any such adjournment.

METHODS OF VOTING

    All stockholders of record as of the record date may vote by mail by
signing, dating and mailing their proxies in the postage-paid envelope provided.

HOW TO REVOKE A PROXY

    A stockholder may revoke his or her proxy at any time before its use by
delivering to GlobeSpan's secretary a signed notice of revocation or a
later-dated signed proxy or by attending the special meeting and voting in
person. Attendance at the special meeting will not in itself constitute the
revocation of a proxy.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

    The cost of solicitation of proxies for the special meeting will be paid by
GlobeSpan. In addition to solicitation by mail, arrangements will be made with
brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to send proxy
material to beneficial owners; and GlobeSpan will, upon request, reimburse them
for their reasonable expenses in so doing. GlobeSpan has retained Innisfree M&A
Incorporated to aid in the solicitation of proxies. Innisfree M&A Incorporated
will receive a fee of $7,500 plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for such
services. GlobeSpan or its representatives may request by telephone, facsimile,
electronic mail, telegram or over the Internet the return of proxy cards in
order to ensure sufficient representation at the special meeting. The extent to
which this will be necessary depends entirely upon how promptly proxy cards are
returned. You are urged to send in your proxies without delay.

AMENDMENT TO CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO CHANGE THE NAME OF GLOBESPAN

    GlobeSpan's board of directors has approved an amendment to the certificate
of incorporation to change the name of the corporation upon consummation of the
merger with Virata to "GlobeSpan Virata, Inc." Under the amendment, Article I of
the amended and restated certificate of incorporation would be amended and
restated to read in its entirety as follows:

    "The name of the corporation is GlobeSpan Virata, Inc. (the "Corporation")."

DISSENTER'S OR APPRAISAL RIGHTS

    Stockholders of GlobeSpan will not be able to exercise any appraisal rights
in connection with the merger including approval of the issuance of the shares
or the amendment to GlobeSpan's certificate of incorporation.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE GLOBESPAN BOARD OF DIRECTORS

    The GlobeSpan board of directors believes that each of the proposals is
advisable, fair to and in the best interests of GlobeSpan and the stockholders
of GlobeSpan. GlobeSpan's board of directors has approved each of the proposals
and recommends that GlobeSpan stockholders vote "FOR" the issuance of the shares
of GlobeSpan common stock in the merger and "FOR" the amendment to GlobeSpan's
certificate of incorporation to change the name of GlobeSpan to "GlobeSpan
Virata, Inc." at the effective time of the merger.

to consider and vote upon:

    - a proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the
      merger; and

    - any other business as may properly come before the special meeting.

    Virata shareholders may also be asked to vote upon a proposal to adjourn or

allowing additional time for soliciting additional votes to approve and adopt
the merger agreement and approve the merger.

RECORD DATE AND OUTSTANDING SHARES

    The Virata board of directors has fixed the close of business on
November 2, 2001, as the record date for purposes of voting at the special
meeting. Only holders of record of shares of common stock on the record date are
entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. On the record date,
there were 64,137,337 shares of Virata common stock outstanding and entitled to
vote at the special meeting held by 306 stockholders of record. The record
stockholder number does not include the number of persons whose stock is in
nominee or "street name" accounts through brokers.

VOTE AND QUORUM REQUIRED

    Each holder of record, as of the record date, of shares of common stock is
entitled to cast one vote per share. The presence, in person or by proxy, of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote
is necessary to constitute a quorum at the special meeting.

    The affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of at least a majority of the
shares of Virata common stock outstanding on the record date is required to
approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. As of
November 2, 2001, directors and executive officers of Virata and their
affiliates beneficially owned an aggregate of 8,897,210 shares of Virata common
stock entitled to vote at the Virata special meeting or approximately 13.5% of
the shares of Virata common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on such date.

    Some stockholders of Virata have entered into a stockholders agreement with
GlobeSpan. Under the stockholders agreement, the stockholders have agreed to
vote in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the
approval of the merger. The stock subject to this agreement represents
approximately 10% of the voting power of Virata. See "Related Agreements--Virata
Stockholders Agreement."

HOW SHARES WILL BE VOTED AT THE SPECIAL MEETING

    All shares of common stock represented by properly executed proxies received
before or at the special meeting, and not revoked, will be voted as specified in
the proxies. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions
will be voted "FOR" the adoption of the proposals set forth in the accompanying

it will have the same effect as a vote against the merger.

    Virata's board of directors is not currently aware of any business to be
acted upon at the special meeting other than the proposal described in the
accompanying notice of special meeting. If, however, other matters are properly
brought before the special meeting, or any adjournments or postponements of the
meeting, the people appointed as proxies will have discretion to vote the shares
represented by duly executed proxies according to their best judgment.

    The people named as proxies by a stockholder may propose and vote for one or
more adjournments of the special meeting to permit further solicitations of
proxies in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the
approval of the merger, except that no proxy which is voted against the approval
and adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the merger will be
voted in favor of any such adjournment.

METHODS OF VOTING

    All stockholders of record as of the record date may vote by mail by
signing, dating and mailing their proxies in the postage-paid envelope provided.

HOW TO REVOKE A PROXY

    A stockholder may revoke his or her proxy at any time before its use by
delivering to Virata's secretary a signed notice of revocation or a later-dated
signed proxy or by attending the special meeting and voting in person.
Attendance at the special meeting will not in itself constitute the revocation
of a proxy.

DISSENTER'S OR APPRAISAL RIGHTS

    Dissenter's or appraisal rights are not available with respect to a merger
or consolidation by a corporation the shares of which are either listed on a
national securities exchange or the Nasdaq National Market or held of record by
more than 2,000 stockholders if such stockholders are required to receive only
shares of the surviving corporation, shares of any other corporation which are
either listed on a national securities exchange or the Nasdaq National Market or
held of record by more than 2,000 holders, cash in lieu of fractional shares or
a combination of the foregoing. Therefore, stockholders of Virata will not be
able to exercise any appraisal rights in connection with the merger.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE VIRATA BOARD OF DIRECTORS

    The Virata board of directors believes that the terms of the merger and the
merger agreement are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Virata and
the stockholders of Virata. Virata's board of directors has approved the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and
recommends that Virata stockholders vote "FOR" the approval and adoption of the
merger agreement and the approval of the the merger.

                                   THE MERGER

    THIS SECTION OF THE JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS DESCRIBES THE PROPOSED
MERGER. ALTHOUGH GLOBESPAN AND VIRATA BELIEVE THAT THE DESCRIPTION IN THIS
SECTION COVERS THE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE MERGER AND THE RELATED TRANSACTIONS,
THIS SUMMARY MAY NOT CONTAIN ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT IS IMPORTANT TO YOU.
YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY READ THE ENTIRE JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS FOR A MORE
COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE MERGER.

GENERAL

    The boards of directors of GlobeSpan and Virata have approved a "merger of
equals" between the two companies, which will have the effect of combining the
businesses, stockholder groups and other constituencies of GlobeSpan and Virata.
The combined company, to be named GlobeSpan Virata, Inc., is expected to be a
leading provider of integrated circuits, software and system designs for digital
subscriber line (DSL) solutions. In order to complete the merger, both companies
must obtain the approval of their stockholders.

    The merger agreement provides that, at the effective time of the merger,
Wine Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of GlobeSpan, will merge with
and into Virata, with Virata continuing in existence as the surviving
corporation. Each share of Virata common stock issued and outstanding at the
effective time of the merger will be converted into 1.02 shares of GlobeSpan
common stock. Upon completion of the merger, Virata will be a wholly-owned
subsidiary of GlobeSpan and market trading of Virata common stock will cease.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

    Both GlobeSpan and Virata regularly review their strategic alternatives with
respect to growing their respective businesses through the expansion of their
core technologies and product offerings, towards the goal of providing their
customers with a complete system solution in the form of semiconductor
components and software.

    On August 16, 1999, Armando Geday, the President, Chief Executive Officer
and a director of GlobeSpan, and Charles Cotton, the Chief Executive Officer and
a director of Virata, met in Virata's Santa Clara office to discuss the
possibility of a strategic transaction involving GlobeSpan and Virata.

    Between September 1999 and November 2000, Mr. Geday and Mr. Cotton had
intermittent conversations regarding a possible transaction involving the two
companies. Other members of senior management were sometimes present at these
meetings. No agreements were reached at any of these meetings.

    On May 1, 2001, Mr. Geday and Robert J. McMullan, the Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer of GlobeSpan, met with Mr. Cotton and Andrew Vought, the
Senior Vice President of Finance, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of
Virata, in New York. At this meeting it was agreed that the potential for a
strategic business combination would be discussed further.

    On May 11, 2001, the Virata board of directors held a meeting during which
the board briefly discussed the potential for a strategic transaction with
GlobeSpan, among other items, and authorized management to continue discussions.

    On May 29, 2001, Mr. Geday and Mr. Cotton met in Paris and discussed several
aspects of a potential business combination, including the potential business
objectives, synergies, organizational structures and locations, as well as an
overview of the companies' products and the perceived compatibility of the two
companies' managements.

    On June 19, 2001, the board of directors of GlobeSpan held a telephonic
board meeting and discussed the status of discussions with Virata and authorized
management to proceed with the discussions.

    On June 21, 2001, Mr. Geday and Mr. Cotton met in New York and agreed to
prepare a non-disclosure agreement and to have their respective financial
advisors discuss the potential business

combination. In early July 2001, GlobeSpan contacted Morgan Stanley & Co.
Incorporated concerning representation as its financial advisor on a possible
combination with Virata. Virata contacted Credit Suisse First Boston
Corporation, with which it had an ongoing financial advisory relationship.

    On July 19, 2001, Mr. Geday and Mr. McMullan met once again with Mr. Cotton
and Mr. Vought in New York to discuss the possibility of a business combination
between the two companies. Representatives of Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse
First Boston also participated in this meeting. At the start of the meeting, the
two companies executed a mutual confidentiality agreement. Both companies'
management teams presented an overview of their respective businesses, including
financial reports, and discussed their views on the potential fit between the
two businesses.

    On July 25, 2001, the executive committee of the board of directors of
GlobeSpan held a telephonic board meeting regarding the status of discussions
with Virata regarding a potential business combination, which was attended by
representatives of Morgan Stanley. The executive committee of the board of
directors authorized management to proceed with the discussions. Shortly after
this meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley, on behalf of GlobeSpan,
communicated to Credit Suisse First Boston, on behalf of Virata, GlobeSpan's
preliminary proposal that the relative ownership of Virata's stockholders in the
combined company would be in the range of 39%-41%.

    On July 26, 2001, the board of directors of Virata held a board meeting to
discuss, among other items, a potential business combination with GlobeSpan,
including, among other things, the proposed relative ownership by the Virata
stockholders of the combined company. During this meeting, Credit Suisse First
Boston reviewed with the board financial and business information relating to
the two companies and the potential combination. While the Virata board of
directors believed that GlobeSpan's preliminary relative ownership proposal was
likely below an acceptable range, it authorized management to continue to engage
in discussions regarding a strategic transaction with the management of
GlobeSpan.

    On August 6, 2001 a preliminary term sheet containing the key terms of a
proposed combination was prepared by Credit Suisse First Boston, on behalf of
Virata, and forwarded to Morgan Stanley. The preliminary term sheet proposed a
merger of equals transaction with a fixed, but unspecified exchange ratio, with
no collar or walk-away rights and a board of directors composed of three members
designated by GlobeSpan, three members designated by Virata and one newly
appointed unaffiliated director. However, it was communicated to Morgan Stanley
that, based on its preliminary analysis, Virata believed that the relative
ownership by the Virata stockholders of the combined company should be no less
than 45%. The term sheet also provided that Armando Geday would be the president
and chief executive officer of the combined company and Charles Cotton would
serve as executive chairman for one year and non-executive chairman thereafter
and that a transition committee would be established to oversee the transition.

    On GlobeSpan's behalf, Morgan Stanley sent a revised proposal to Credit
Suisse First Boston on August 7, 2001, reflecting an exchange ratio which would
provide Virata stockholders with 41%-45% of the combined company, a board of
directors composed of five members of the GlobeSpan board of directors and four
members of the Virata board of directors.

    On August 16, 2001, Mr. Geday and Mr. Cotton met in San Francisco, together
with GlobeSpan's and Virata's financial advisors, to discuss the potential
transaction structure. Key issues discussed at this meeting included the
relative interest each company's stockholders would have in the combined company
and the composition of the board of directors of the combined company. After the
discussion, GlobeSpan proposed a structure in which Virata stockholders would
receive 43% of the combined company and the board of directors of the combined
company would be composed of three members designated by GlobeSpan, three
members designated by Virata and one newly appointed unaffiliated director.
Alternatively, a structure was suggested in which Virata stockholders would
receive 45% of the combined company and the board of directors of the combined
company would include a majority of members designated by GlobeSpan. The parties
agreed to defer temporarily further discussion on these

issues and the proposed management of the combined company and proceed to
negotiate all other aspects of a possible transaction.

    On August 23, 2001, the boards of directors of both GlobeSpan and Virata
each separately reviewed the status of the negotiations and again authorized
their respective management teams to proceed with discussions.

    Discussions continued during late August and into the first week of
September 2001 between Mr. Geday and Mr. Cotton and their respective legal
counsel and financial advisors. The primary focus of the discussions concerned
the degree of mutual due diligence that would be conducted and the logistical
aspects of the negotiation process.

    From September 4, 2001 through September 7, 2001, the parties held due
diligence meetings in New York City. Mr. Geday, Mr. McMullan and several other
members of GlobeSpan's management team attended for GlobeSpan. Mr. Cotton,
Mr. Vought and several other members of Virata's management team attended for
Virata. Representatives of GlobeSpan's and Virata's respective legal counsel and
financial advisors were also present. At this time, due diligence requests were
exchanged by the parties.

    On the evening of September 4, 2001, GlobeSpan's legal counsel sent a draft
merger agreement to Virata's legal counsel and, shortly thereafter, GlobeSpan
and Virata and their respective legal counsels began negotiating the terms of
this proposed merger agreement.

    On September 5, 2001, GlobeSpan and Virata agreed that, until September 26,
2001, neither party would solicit any acquisition transaction or, subject to
limited exceptions, engage in any discussions with respect to any acquisition
transaction, other than a transaction with the other, and agreed to terminate
any such discussions with any third party.

    On September 6, 2001, Mr. Geday, Mr. McMullan, Mr. Cotton, Mr. Vought and
John Graham, the Vice President, Worldwide Human Resource Management of Virata,
discussed the potential integration of the two companies.

    On September 7, 2001, Mr. McMullan, Mr. Vought and Steven Moore, Vice
President, Finance of Virata, held further discussions concerning potential
costs savings and synergies that might be achieved as a result of the
combination of the two companies.

    On September 10, 2001, the parties commenced additional legal due diligence
at their respective outside counsels' offices in New York City. This diligence
was largely suspended on September 11, 2001 due to terrorist attacks in New York
City, but resumed on September 17 and continued through September 30, 2001.

    On September 12, 2001, Mr. Geday, James Coulter, John Marren, and Keith
Geeslin, each a member of GlobeSpan's board of directors, as well as
Mr. McMullan and Daniel Amrany, chief technology officer of GlobeSpan, met with
GlobeSpan's outside legal counsel and representatives of Morgan Stanley to
discuss the results of the meetings that had been held the previous week and the
parameters for the negotiation of the composition of the board of directors of
the combined company and the relative interest each company's stockholders would
have in the combined company.

    Between September 12, 2001 and September 19, 2001, the parties and their
respective legal counsel and financial advisors continued due diligence
investigations.

    On September 14, 2001 and again between September 18 and September 23, 2001,
Mr. Geday and Mr. Cotton held several telephonic discussions regarding the
diligence process, the potential management structure of the combined company
and logistical matters.

    Between September 25, 2001 and September 30, 2001, the parties met in New
York City with their respective legal counsel and financial advisors and
continued negotiations on the board composition and ownership split of the
combined company. These discussions included additional diligence as to each
party's respective financial performance, as well as a discussion of the current
relative market

capitalizations of each company. GlobeSpan and Virata and their respective legal
counsel and financial advisors also engaged in negotiations concerning the other
terms of the proposed combination.

    On September 26, 2001, the GlobeSpan board of directors met by telephone
conference call to discuss the proposed transaction and the results of
GlobeSpan's due diligence investigation. Morgan Stanley and outside counsel
discussed with the board the current transaction structure and the board
authorized the management to proceed with negotiations on the terms being
discussed.

    On September 27, 2001, the Virata board of directors met in person and
telephonically to discuss the current status of the negotiations, including the
two potential structures that had been proposed by GlobeSpan, one that would
give Virata stockholders 43% ownership of the combined company and have a board
of directors of the combined company comprised of an equal number of members
designated by each of GlobeSpan and Virata and the other that would give Virata
stockholders 45% of the combined company and have a board of directors of the
combined company comprised of a majority of its members designated by GlobeSpan.
At this meeting, representatives of Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed with the
board the financial aspects of the proposed transaction and the performance of
each company's stock price since Virata's last board meeting. After discussion,
the Virata board of directors determined that the relative ownership of Virata
stockholders of the combined company should be at the top of the range proposed
by GlobeSpan with equal representation on the board of directors of the combined
company and instructed management and Credit Suisse First Boston to continue to
negotiate with GlobeSpan management and Morgan Stanley.

    After the markets closed on September 28, 2001, and continuing through
September 29, 2001, the parties negotiated a final exchange ratio, taking into
account the respective prices of the GlobeSpan and Virata stock, and the parties
agreed, subject to approval by the boards of directors of the two companies, to
a structure in which Virata's stockholders would receive a 47.5% interest in the
combined company using the treasury stock method, GlobeSpan's stockholders would
retain a 52.5% interest in the combined company and each of Virata and GlobeSpan
would have equal representation on the combined company's board of directors.

    On September 30, 2001, the GlobeSpan board of directors met again by
telephone conference call. Two members of GlobeSpan's board, Federico Faggin and
Mr. Marren, were not present. GlobeSpan's outside counsel described the terms of
the proposed transaction with Virata. Also at the meeting, Morgan Stanley
rendered its opinion described below under the caption "--Opinion of GlobeSpan's
Financial Advisor." Following this discussion, the members of the GlobeSpan
board of directors present at the meeting unanimously determined that the merger
and the merger agreement were advisable, fair and in the best interest of
GlobeSpan's stockholders, approved the terms of the merger agreement, authorized
the execution of the merger agreement and related transaction documentation and
unanimously resolved to recommend that the GlobeSpan stockholders approve the
issuance of the shares of GlobeSpan common stock in the merger.

    On September 30, 2001, the entire Virata board of directors met in person
and telephonically, at noon. At this time, Virata's management, legal counsel
and financial advisor reviewed the results of the due diligence process. In
addition, representatives of Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed with the board
its financial analysis of the proposed exchange ratio, which would give the
Virata stockholders a 47.5% interest in the combined company using the treasury
stock method. The proposed composition of the combined company's board of
directors, which provided for equal representation of Virata and GlobeSpan, was
also discussed. The board of directors also held in-depth discussions regarding
the general terms of employment for Mr. Cotton and certain other officers and
executives. The meeting was then adjourned until 12:00 a.m. on October 1, 2001,
to give management more time to resolve other remaining issues.

    When the meeting was resumed on October 1, two members of Virata's board,
Peter Morris and Andrew Hopper, were not present. At the resumed meeting,
Mr. Cotton, with assistance from Virata's legal counsel and financial advisor,
reviewed with the Virata board of directors the negotiated terms of

the merger agreement between GlobeSpan and Virata, including the exchange ratio
and board representation discussed prior to the adjournment. Also at the resumed
meeting, Credit Suisse First Boston rendered to the board its opinion, described
below under the caption "--Opinion of Virata's Financial Advisor." The Virata
board, after thorough deliberation, determined that the merger and the merger
agreement were advisable, fair to and in the best interest of Virata's
stockholders, approved the terms of the merger agreement, authorized the
execution of the merger agreement and related transaction documentation and
resolved to recommend that the Virata stockholders adopt and approve the merger
agreement and the merger.

    Following further discussions among representatives of GlobeSpan and Virata,
the parties executed the merger agreement on October 1, 2001. On the morning of
October 1, 2001, GlobeSpan and Virata issued a joint press release announcing
the transaction.

OUR REASONS FOR THE MERGER

    Our respective boards of directors have approved the merger agreement and
the transactions associated with it and have determined that they are advisable,
fair to and in the best interest of our respective stockholders. In reaching
their respective decisions, our boards of directors considered a number of
factors, including that the combination of the companies has the potential to:

RECOMMENDATION OF THE GLOBESPAN BOARD; ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS OF THE
  GLOBESPAN BOARD

    The GlobeSpan board of directors has approved the merger agreement and the
transactions associated with it and has determined that they are advisable, fair
to and in the best interests of GlobeSpan and its stockholders. During the
course of its deliberations, the GlobeSpan board of directors considered, with
the assistance of management and its legal and financial advisors and
independent accountants, a number of material factors including the following:

    - the reasons described under "--Our Reasons for the Merger;"

    - the familiarity of GlobeSpan's board of directors and management with the
      business, properties and prospects of GlobeSpan, including the
      opportunities available to GlobeSpan other than the proposed merger;

    - current financial market conditions and historical market prices,
      volatility and trading information with respect to GlobeSpan common stock
      and Virata common stock;

    - Morgan Stanley's written opinion, dated September 30, 2001, described
      below under the caption "--Opinion of GlobeSpan's Financial Advisor;"

    - corporate governance arrangements for the combined company, which will
      have a board of directors composed of four members designated by Virata
      and four members designated by GlobeSpan;

    - the potential impact of the merger on GlobeSpan's customers and employees;

    - the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including:

       - the benefits to be received by GlobeSpan stockholders relative to the
         dilution to GlobeSpan's stockholders in the merger and a comparison of
         comparable merger transactions,

       - the parties' representations, warranties and covenants, and the
         conditions to their respective obligations,

       - the termination fee payable to GlobeSpan or Virata under specified
         circumstances, and

       - the ability of GlobeSpan to negotiate other unsolicited strategic
         transaction proposals if the GlobeSpan board of directors believes in
         good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that to
         do so would be required by the board of directors' fiduciary duties
         under applicable law and would, if consummated, result in a transaction
         that is more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the
         GlobeSpan stockholders than the merger and is reasonably capable of
         being completed;

    - the terms and conditions of voting agreements of Virata stockholders and
      GlobeSpan stockholders which require them to vote shares of Virata and
      GlobeSpan common stock in favor of the merger agreement;

    - the financial condition, results of operations, businesses and prospects
      of GlobeSpan and Virata before and after giving effect to the merger
      including the results of GlobeSpan's due diligence review of Virata's
      financial condition, results of operations, businesses and prospects;

    - historical information concerning GlobeSpan's and Virata's respective
      businesses, prospects, financial performance and condition, operations,
      technology, management and competitive position, including public reports
      concerning results of operations during the most recent fiscal year and
      fiscal quarter for each company as filed with the Securities and Exchange
      Commission;

    - the technical expertise and experience of Virata's employees; and

    - the depth of experience of the combined management.

    The GlobeSpan board of directors also identified and considered a number of
potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger,
including but not limited to:

    - the risk that the potential synergies and other benefits sought in the
      merger might not be fully realized;

    - the challenges of integrating the management teams, strategies, cultures
      and organizations of the companies;

    - the risk that key management and other personnel might not remain employed
      by GlobeSpan or the combined company;

    - risks associated with fluctuations in Virata's stock price and GlobeSpan's
      stock price prior to closing of the merger;

    - the risk of disruption of sales momentum as a result of uncertainties
      created by the announcement of the merger;

    - the possibility that the merger might not be consummated, even if approved
      by each company's stockholders, including the possible effect of the
      termination fee;

    - the effect of the public announcement of the merger and the possibility
      that the merger might not be consummated on (a) demand for GlobeSpan's
      products and services, GlobeSpan's

      relationships with strategic partners, GlobeSpan's operating results and
      GlobeSpan's stock price and (b) GlobeSpan's ability to attract and retain
      key management and engineering, marketing, sales, technical and other
      personnel;

    - the substantial charges to be incurred in connection with the merger,
      including costs of integrating the businesses and transaction expenses
      arising from the merger; and

    - other applicable risks described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus
      under the heading "Risk Factors."

    After due consideration, GlobeSpan's board of directors concluded that the
potential benefits of the merger to GlobeSpan and its stockholders outweighed
the risks associated with the merger.

    The foregoing discussion is not exhaustive of all factors considered by the
GlobeSpan board of directors. Each member of GlobeSpan's board of directors may
have considered different factors, and the GlobeSpan board of directors
evaluated these factors as a whole and did not quantify or otherwise assign
relative weights to factors considered. In addition, the GlobeSpan board of
directors did not reach any specific conclusion with respect to each of the
factors considered, or any aspect of any particular factor. Instead, the
GlobeSpan board of directors conducted an overall analysis of the factors
described above. The members of the board of directors were aware that, as
described below under "The Merger--Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger,"
certain directors and officers of GlobeSpan have interests in the merger in
addition to, or different from, their interests as stockholders in GlobeSpan,
and the board of directors considered this in deciding to recommend the
transaction.

    GlobeSpan cannot assure you that any of the expected results, synergies,
opportunities or other benefits described in this section will be achieved as a
result of the merger.

    RECOMMENDATION OF THE GLOBESPAN BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  After careful
consideration, the GlobeSpan board of directors has determined that the terms of
the merger agreement and the transactions associated with it are advisable, fair
to and in the best interests of the stockholders of GlobeSpan and recommends
that the stockholders of GlobeSpan vote "FOR" the issuance of shares of
GlobeSpan common stock pursuant to the merger agreement and "FOR" the amendment
to GlobeSpan's certificate of incorporation to change its name to "GlobeSpan
Virata, Inc." at the effective time of the merger. All of the GlobeSpan
directors who considered the merger agreement concur in the foregoing
determination and recommendation.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE VIRATA BOARD; ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS OF THE VIRATA
  BOARD

    The Virata board of directors has approved the merger agreement and the
transactions associated with it and has determined that they are advisable, fair
to and in the best interests of Virata and its stockholders. During the course
of its deliberations, the Virata board of directors considered, with the
assistance of management and its legal and financial advisors and independent
accountants, a number of material factors including the following:

    - the reasons described under "--Our Reasons for the Merger;"

    - the familiarity of Virata's board of directors and management with the
      business, properties and prospects of Virata, including the opportunities
      available to Virata other than the proposed merger;

    - the exchange ratio negotiated with GlobeSpan and the implied premium over
      recent and historical market prices of the Virata common stock, as well as
      how this premium compared to price premiums in recent comparable
      transactions;

    - current financial market conditions and historical market prices,
      volatility and trading information about the Virata common stock and the
      GlobeSpan common stock;

    - Credit Suisse First Boston's written opinion, dated October 1, 2001,
      described below under the caption "--Opinion of Virata's Financial
      Advisor;"

    - corporate governance arrangements for the combined company, which will
      have a board of directors composed of four members designated by Virata
      and four members designated by GlobeSpan;

    - the potential impact of the merger on Virata's customers and employees;

    - the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including:

       - the benefits to be received by Virata stockholders,

       - the parties' representations, warranties and covenants, conditions to
         their respective obligations,

       - the termination fee payable to Virata or to GlobeSpan under specified
         circumstances, and

       - the ability of Virata to negotiate other unsolicited strategic
         transaction proposals if the Virata board of directors believes in good
         faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that to do so
         would be required by the board of directors' fiduciary duties under
         applicable law and would, if consummated, result in a transaction that
         is more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the Virata
         stockholders than the merger and is reasonably capable of being
         completed;

    - the terms and conditions of voting agreements of Virata stockholders and
      GlobeSpan stockholders, which require them to vote their shares of Virata
      and GlobeSpan common stock in favor of the merger agreement;

    - Virata stockholders will have the opportunity to participate in the
      potential for growth of the combined company after the merger including
      the results of Virata's due diligence review of GlobeSpan's financial
      condition, results of operations, business and prospects;

    - the financial condition, results of operations, businesses and prospects
      of GlobeSpan and Virata before and after giving effect to the merger;

    - the combined company will have a significantly larger market
      capitalization and public float than Virata alone; as a result, Virata
      stockholders who exchange their Virata common stock for GlobeSpan common
      stock in the merger may obtain a more liquid investment;

    - historical information concerning GlobeSpan's and Virata's respective
      businesses, prospects, financial performance and condition, operations,
      technology, management and competitive position, including public reports
      concerning results of operations during the most recent fiscal year and
      fiscal quarter for each company as filed with the Securities and Exchange
      Commission;

    - the technical expertise and experience of GlobeSpan's employees;

    - the depth of experience of the combined management; and

    - the merger will be tax-free to Virata United States stockholders (except
      to the extent they receive cash for any fractional shares).

    Virata's board of directors also considered other potential strategic
opportunities.

    The Virata board of directors also identified and considered a number of
risks and potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the
merger, including but not limited to:

    - the risk that the per share value of the consideration to be received in
      the merger could decline significantly from the value prior to the
      announcement of the merger because the exchange ratio will not be adjusted
      for changes in the market price of the Virata common stock or the
      GlobeSpan common stock;

    - the risk that key management and other personnel might not remain employed
      by Virata or the combined company;

    - the possibility that the merger might not be consummated and the potential
      adverse effects of the failure to consummate the merger on:

       - Virata's operating results; and

       - the trading price of Virata common stock;

    - the decreased likelihood that Virata would receive a third-party
      acquisition proposal because of the termination fee and, to a lesser
      extent, the voting agreements described above;

    - the possibility that the integration of Virata and GlobeSpan will be an
      expensive, complex and time-consuming process that may disrupt the
      business of either or both companies if not completed in a timely and
      efficient manner;

    - the risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be fully
      realized; and

    - other applicable risks described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus
      under the heading "Risk Factors."

    After due consideration, Virata's board of directors concluded that the
potential benefits of the merger to Virata and its stockholders outweighed the
risks associated with the merger.

    The foregoing discussion is not exhaustive of all factors considered by the
Virata board of directors. Each member of Virata's board of directors may have
considered different factors, and the Virata board of directors evaluated these
factors as a whole and did not quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to
factors considered. In addition, the Virata board of directors did not reach any
specific conclusion with respect to each of the factors considered, or any
aspect of any particular factor. Instead, the Virata board of directors
conducted an overall analysis of the factors described above. The members of the
board of directors were aware that, as described below under "The
Merger--Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger," certain directors and
officers of Virata have interests in the merger in addition to, or different
from, their interests as stockholders in Virata, and the board of directors
considered this in deciding to recommend the transaction.

    Virata cannot assure you that any of the expected results, synergies,
opportunities or other benefits described in this section will be achieved as a
result of the merger.

    RECOMMENDATION OF VIRATA BOARD OF DIRECTORS. After careful consideration,
the Virata board of directors has determined that the terms of the merger
agreement and the transactions associated with it are advisable, fair to and in
the best interests of the stockholders of Virata and recommends that the
stockholders of Virata vote "FOR" the approval and adoption of the merger
agreement and approval of the merger. All of the Virata directors that
considered the merger agreement concurred in the foregoing determination and
recommendation.

OPINION OF GLOBESPAN'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

    Under an engagement letter dated September 30, 2001, GlobeSpan formally
retained Morgan Stanley to provide it with certain financial advisory services
in connection with the merger. Morgan Stanley was selected by GlobeSpan based on
Morgan Stanley's qualifications, expertise, reputation and its knowledge of the
business and affairs of GlobeSpan. At the meeting of GlobeSpan's board of
directors on September 30, 2001, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion,
subsequently confirmed in writing, that as of September 30, 2001, based upon and
subject to the various considerations set forth in the opinion, the exchange
ratio pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view
to the holders of GlobeSpan common stock.

    THE FULL TEXT OF THE WRITTEN OPINION OF MORGAN STANLEY DATED SEPTEMBER 30,
2001, IS ATTACHED AS ANNEX D TO THIS DOCUMENT. THE OPINION SETS FORTH, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE, PROCEDURES FOLLOWED, MATTERS CONSIDERED AND
LIMITATIONS ON THE SCOPE OF THE REVIEW UNDERTAKEN BY MORGAN STANLEY IN RENDERING
ITS OPINION. WE URGE YOU TO READ THE ENTIRE OPINION CAREFULLY. MORGAN STANLEY'S
OPINION IS DIRECTED TO GLOBESPAN'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ADDRESSES ONLY THE
FAIRNESS OF THE

EXCHANGE RATIO PURSUANT TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT FROM A FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW
TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF GLOBESPAN AS OF THE DATE OF THE OPINION. IT DOES NOT
ADDRESS ANY OTHER ASPECT OF THE MERGER AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION
TO ANY HOLDER OF GLOBESPAN COMMON STOCK AS TO HOW TO VOTE AT GLOBESPAN'S SPECIAL
MEETING. THE SUMMARY OF THE OPINION OF MORGAN STANLEY SET FORTH IN THIS JOINT
PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL
TEXT OF ITS OPINION.

    In rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:

  (i)  reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and
       other information of Virata and GlobeSpan;

 (ii)  reviewed certain internal financial statements and other
       financial and operating data concerning Virata and
       GlobeSpan, prepared by the management of Virata and
       GlobeSpan, respectively;

(iii)  discussed certain financial projections prepared by the
       management of Virata and GlobeSpan;

 (iv)  discussed the past and current operations and financial
       condition and the prospects of Virata and GlobeSpan,
       including information relating to certain strategic,
       financial and operational benefits anticipated from the
       merger, with senior executives of Virata and GlobeSpan,
       respectively;

  (v)  analyzed the pro forma impact of the merger on GlobeSpan's
       earnings per share, consolidated capitalization and
       financial ratios;

 (vi)  reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the
       Virata common stock and the GlobeSpan common stock;

(vii)  compared the financial performance of Virata and GlobeSpan
       and the prices and trading activity of the Virata common
       stock and the GlobeSpan common stock with that of certain
       other comparable publicly-traded companies and their
       securities;

(viii) reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly
       available, of certain comparable transactions;

 (ix)  participated in discussions and negotiations among
       representatives of Virata and GlobeSpan and their financial
       and legal advisors;

  (x)  reviewed the merger agreement, and certain related
       documents; and

 (xi)  considered such other factors as Morgan Stanley deemed
       appropriate.

    In rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without
independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information
reviewed by it for the purposes of its opinion. With respect to the financial
projections, including information relating to certain strategic, financial and
operational benefits anticipated from the merger, Morgan Stanley assumed that
they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments of the future financial performance of Virata and
GlobeSpan. Morgan Stanley relied upon the assessment by the managements of
Virata and GlobeSpan of their ability to retain key employees of Virata and
GlobeSpan. Morgan Stanley also relied upon, without independent verification,
the assessment by the management of GlobeSpan of Virata's technologies and
products, the timing and risks associated with the integration of Virata with
GlobeSpan and the validity of, and risks associated with, Virata's existing and
future products and technologies.

    In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the merger will be consummated in
accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement, including, among
other things, that the merger will be treated as a tax-free reorganization
and/or exchange, each pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Morgan
Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or
liabilities of

Virata, nor was it furnished with any such appraisals. Morgan Stanley's opinion
is necessarily based on the financial, economic, market and other conditions as
in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of Morgan
Stanley's opinion.

    The following is a brief summary of certain analyses performed by Morgan
Stanley in connection with its opinion dated September 30, 2001. THESE SUMMARIES
OF FINANCIAL ANALYSES INCLUDE INFORMATION PRESENTED IN TABULAR FORMAT. IN ORDER
TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES USED BY MORGAN STANLEY, THE TABLES
MUST BE READ TOGETHER WITH THE TEXT OF EACH SUMMARY. THE TABLES ALONE DO NOT
CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES.

    CONTRIBUTION ANALYSIS.  Morgan Stanley analyzed the relative contribution of
GlobeSpan and Virata to historical and estimated revenues and gross profit of
the combined company for calendar years 2000 to 2002 based on publicly available
estimates for GlobeSpan and Virata. Morgan Stanley's contribution analysis
assumed no synergies. The following table presents the results of that analysis:

                                                                % CONTRIBUTION
                                                             --------------------
                                                              VIRATA    GLOBESPAN
                                                             --------   ---------

Revenues:
  Last Quarter.............................................    25.2%      74.8%
  Next Quarter.............................................    35.3       64.7
  Last Twelve Months.......................................    22.5       77.5
  CY2002E..................................................    29.2       70.8

Gross Profit:
  Last Quarter.............................................    21.0%      79.0%
  Next Quarter.............................................    33.3       66.7
  Last Twelve Months.......................................    18.6       81.4
  CY2002E..................................................    26.7       73.3

    Morgan Stanley adjusted the contribution percentages calculated above for
the relative capital structure of each company in order to determine the pro
forma ownership for Virata and GlobeSpan, respectively. The results are set
forth below:

                                                         VIRATA     GLOBESPAN
                                                        ---------   ---------

Pro Forma Ownership (based on                           41%-50%
  Contribution Analysis)..............................               50%-59%

    Morgan Stanley noted that the pro forma ownership of the combined company by
GlobeSpan implied by the exchange ratio set forth in the Merger Agreement would
be 52.5%.

    COMPARABLE COMPANY ANALYSIS.  Morgan Stanley compared selected financial
information for Virata and GlobeSpan with publicly available information for
representative comparable broadband access integrated circuit companies offering
products for DSL applications, including Centillium Communications, Inc., or
Centillium, and Metalink Ltd., or Metalink. Based upon calendar year 2002
projected revenue estimates from securities research analysts and using the
closing prices as of September 28, 2001, Morgan Stanley calculated, for each of
these companies the multiple of aggregate value to projected calendar year 2002
revenue estimates. The following table shows the results of these calculations:

                                                              AGGREGATE VALUE/
                                                                  CY2002E
COMPANY                                                           REVENUES
- -------                                                       ----------------

GlobeSpan...................................................         1.8x
Virata......................................................         1.3
Centillium..................................................         0.6
Metalink....................................................        (1.7)

    Morgan Stanley noted that the multiple of aggregate value to projected
calendar year 2002 revenue estimates implied by the exchange ratio set forth in
the merger agreement would be 0.9x.

    No company included in the comparable company analyses is identical to
GlobeSpan or Virata. In evaluating the comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made
judgements and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general
business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. Many of
these matters are beyond the control of GlobeSpan or Virata, such as the impact
of competition on the business of GlobeSpan or Virata and the industry in
general, industry growth and the absence of any material adverse change in the
financial condition and prospects of GlobeSpan or Virata or the industry or in
the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the
average or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable
company data.

    DISCOUNTED EQUITY VALUATION, OR DEV, ANALYSIS.  Morgan Stanley performed an
analysis of the present value per Virata common stock share, of implied future
trading prices, based on ranges of the following assumptions: annual revenue
growth rates; annual pretax income margins; illustrative one-year forward
Price-to-Earnings Multiples of 20-30x; and a discount rate of 15% based on
Virata's cost of equity of 14.6%, as calculated by Morgan Stanley using the
capital asset pricing model. Based on these assumptions, Morgan Stanley
calculated the present value of future theoretical values ranging from
approximately $8.00 to $14.00 per Virata common share. Morgan Stanley further
noted that the foregoing range of prices implied an exchange ratio range of
0.891x to 1.559x and compared it to the exchange ratio as set forth in the
merger agreement.

    MERGERS-OF-EQUALS, OR MOE, PRECEDENT TRANSACTION ANALYSIS.  Morgan Stanley
compared certain publicly available statistics for 33 MOE transactions from
May 1, 1995, to September 3, 2001. The following table presents the indicated
premiums paid above the closing share prices one day before the announcement of
the transaction and one month before the announcement of the transaction and the
premium to the average exchange ratio 30 days before the announcement of the
transaction:

                                                                     PREMIUM TO
                                                   ----------------------------------------------
                                                     ONE DAY        ONE MONTH          30-DAY
                                                      BEFORE          BEFORE          AVERAGE
                                                   ANNOUNCEMENT    ANNOUNCEMENT    EXCHANGE RATIO
                                                   ------------   --------------   --------------

Mean.............................................      10.1%           12.2%            11.5%
Median...........................................       5.9%            9.1%             4.7%
Virata/GlobeSpan Premium.........................      (7.6%)         (21.9%)           25.7%

    Based on the foregoing analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated an acquisition
value range for the Virata common stock of $9.00 to $12.00 per share. Morgan
Stanley further noted that this range of prices implied an exchange ratio range
of 1.002x to 1.336x and compared it to the exchange ratio as set forth in the
merger agreement.

    No transaction included in the precedent transaction analyses is identical
to the merger. In evaluating the precedent transactions, Morgan Stanley made
judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business,
economic, market and financial conditions and other matters. Many of these
matters are beyond the control of GlobeSpan or Virata, such as the impact of
competition on the business of GlobeSpan or Virata and the industry in general,
industry growth and the absence of any material adverse change in the financial
condition and prospects of GlobeSpan or Virata or the industry or in the
financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the
average or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using precedent
transaction data.

    EXCHANGE RATIO PREMIUM ANALYSIS.  Morgan Stanley reviewed the ratios of the
closing prices of Virata common stock divided by the corresponding closing
prices of GlobeSpan common stock over various periods ending September 28, 2001.
These ratios are referred to as period average exchange

ratios. Morgan Stanley examined the premiums represented by the exchange ratio
of 1.02x, set forth in the merger agreement, over the averages of these daily
ratios over various periods and found them to be as follows:

                                                        PERIOD EXCHANGE   PREMIUM (DISCOUNT) TO PERIOD
PERIOD                                                   RATIO AVERAGE       AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATIO

    The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not
necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description. In
arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its
analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to any
particular analysis or factor considered by it. Furthermore, Morgan Stanley
believes that the summary provided and the analysis described above must be
considered as a whole and that selecting any portion of Morgan Stanley's
analyses, without considering all its analyses, would create an incomplete view
of the process underlying Morgan Stanley's opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley
may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other
assumptions, so that the range of valuations resulting from any particular
analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley's view of the
actual value of GlobeSpan or Virata.

    In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with
respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of GlobeSpan or Virata. Any
estimates contained in Morgan Stanley's analysis are not necessarily indicative
of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those suggested by such estimates. The analyses performed were
prepared solely as part of Morgan Stanley's analysis of the fairness of the
exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement from a financial point of view
to the holders of GlobeSpan common stock and were conducted in connection with
the delivery of the Morgan Stanley opinion to the board of directors of
GlobeSpan. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices
at which GlobeSpan common stock or Virata common stock might actually trade. The
exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement and other terms of the merger
agreement were determined through arm's length negotiations between GlobeSpan
and Virata and were approved by the GlobeSpan board of directors. Morgan Stanley
provided advice to GlobeSpan during such negotiations; however, Morgan Stanley
did not recommend any specific consideration to GlobeSpan or that any specific
consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger. In
addition, as described above, Morgan Stanley's opinion and presentation to the
GlobeSpan board of directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by
GlobeSpan's board of directors in making its decision to approve the merger.
Consequently, the Morgan Stanley analyses as described above should not be
viewed as determinative of the opinion of the GlobeSpan board of directors with
respect to the value of GlobeSpan or of whether the GlobeSpan board of directors
would have been willing to agree to a different consideration.

    The GlobeSpan board of directors retained Morgan Stanley based upon Morgan
Stanley's qualifications, experience and expertise. Morgan Stanley is an
internationally recognized investment banking and advisory firm. Morgan Stanley,
as part of its investment banking and financial advisory business, is
continuously engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection
with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwriting, competitive bidding,
secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements
and valuations for corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary course of
Morgan Stanley's trading and brokerage activities, Morgan Stanley or its
affiliates may at any time hold long or short positions, trade or otherwise
effect transactions, for its own account or for the account of customers, in the
equity or debt securities or senior loans of GlobeSpan and/or Virata.

    Pursuant to an engagement letter dated September 30, 2001, Morgan Stanley
provided financial advisory services and a financial opinion in connection with
the merger, and GlobeSpan agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a customary fee in
connection therewith. GlobeSpan has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for
its expenses incurred in performing its services. In addition, GlobeSpan has
agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, their respective
directors, officers, agents and employees and each person, if any, controlling
Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities and
expenses, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws,
related to or arising out of Morgan Stanley's engagement and any related
transactions. In the past, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have provided
investment banking and financing services to GlobeSpan in connection with
GlobeSpan's public equity offering in August 2000 and a private placement of
convertible subordinated notes in May 2001 and have provided financing services
to Virata. Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have received fees for the
rendering of these services.

OPINION OF VIRATA'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

    Credit Suisse First Boston has acted as Virata's exclusive financial advisor
in connection with the merger. Virata selected Credit Suisse First Boston based
on Credit Suisse First Boston's experience, expertise and reputation, and its
familiarity with Virata and its business. Credit Suisse First Boston is an
internationally recognized investment banking firm and is regularly engaged in
the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings,
secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements
and valuations for corporate and other purposes.

    In connection with Credit Suisse First Boston's engagement, Virata requested
that Credit Suisse First Boston evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of Virata common stock of the exchange ratio provided for
in the merger. On October 1, 2001, at a meeting of the Virata board of directors
held to evaluate the merger, Credit Suisse First Boston rendered to the Virata
board of directors an oral opinion, which opinion was confirmed by delivery of a
written opinion dated October 1, 2001, to the effect that, as of that date and
based on and subject to the matters described in its opinion, the exchange ratio
was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Virata common stock.

    THE FULL TEXT OF CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON'S WRITTEN OPINION, DATED
OCTOBER 1, 2001, TO THE VIRATA BOARD OF DIRECTORS, WHICH SETS FORTH THE
PROCEDURES FOLLOWED, ASSUMPTIONS MADE, MATTERS CONSIDERED AND LIMITATIONS ON THE
REVIEW UNDERTAKEN, IS ATTACHED AS ANNEX E AND IS INCORPORATED INTO THIS JOINT
PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS BY REFERENCE. HOLDERS OF VIRATA COMMON STOCK ARE
ENCOURAGED TO READ THIS OPINION CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. CREDIT SUISSE
FIRST BOSTON'S OPINION IS ADDRESSED TO THE VIRATA BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND RELATES
ONLY TO THE FAIRNESS, FROM A FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW, OF THE EXCHANGE RATIO,
DOES NOT ADDRESS ANY OTHER ASPECT OF THE PROPOSED MERGER OR ANY RELATED
TRANSACTION AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION TO ANY STOCKHOLDER AS TO
ANY MATTER RELATING TO THE MERGER. THE SUMMARY OF CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON'S
OPINION IN THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY
REFERENCE TO THE FULL TEXT OF THE OPINION.

    In arriving at its opinion, Credit Suisse First Boston:

    - reviewed the merger agreement as well as publicly available business and
      financial information relating to Virata and GlobeSpan, including publicly
      available financial forecasts relating to Virata and GlobeSpan;

    - met with the managements of Virata and GlobeSpan to discuss the businesses
      and prospects of Virata and GlobeSpan;

    - considered financial and stock market data of Virata and GlobeSpan, and
      compared those data with similar data for other publicly held companies in
      businesses similar to Virata and GlobeSpan;

    - considered, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of other
      business combinations and transactions announced or effected; and

    - considered other information, financial studies, analyses and
      investigations and financial, economic and market criteria that it deemed
      relevant.

    In connection with its review, Credit Suisse First Boston:

    - did not assume any responsibility for independent verification of any of
      the information that it reviewed or considered and relied on that
      information being complete and accurate in all material respects;

    - with respect to the publicly available financial forecasts relating to
      Virata and GlobeSpan, reviewed and discussed the forecasts with the
      managements of Virata and GlobeSpan, including adjustments to the
      forecasts, and was advised, and assumed, that the forecasts, including the
      adjustments, represented reasonable estimates and judgments as to the
      future financial performance of Virata and GlobeSpan;

    - relied on, without independent verification, the assessments of the
      managements of Virata and GlobeSpan as to Virata's and GlobeSpan's
      existing and future technology and products and risks associated with such
      technology and products, the potential cost savings and synergies,
      including the amount, timing and achievability of those costs savings and
      synergies, and strategic benefits anticipated by the managements of Virata
      and GlobeSpan to result from the merger, and Virata's and GlobeSpan's
      ability to integrate their businesses and to retain key employees;

    - assumed, with Virata's consent, that in the course of obtaining the
      necessary regulatory and third party approvals and consents for the
      proposed merger, no modification, delay, limitation, restriction or
      condition would be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on
      Virata or GlobeSpan or the contemplated benefits of the proposed merger;
      and

    - assumed, with Virata's consent, that the merger would be treated as a
      tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes.

Credit Suisse First Boston was not requested to, and did not, make an
independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities, contingent or
otherwise, of Virata or GlobeSpan, and Credit Suisse First Boston was not
furnished with any evaluations or appraisals.

    Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion was necessarily based on information
available to it, and financial, economic, market and other conditions as they
existed and could be evaluated, on the date of Credit Suisse First Boston's
opinion. Credit Suisse First Boston did not express any opinion as to what the
value of GlobeSpan common stock actually would be when issued in the merger or
the prices at which GlobeSpan common stock would trade at any time after the
merger. Although Credit Suisse First Boston evaluated the exchange ratio from a
financial point of view, Credit Suisse First Boston was not requested to, and
did not, recommend the specific consideration payable in the merger, which
consideration was determined between the respective boards of directors of
Virata and GlobeSpan. In connection with its engagement, Credit Suisse First
Boston was not requested to, and did not, solicit

third party indications of interest in the possible acquisition of all or a part
of Virata. Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion did not address the relative
merits of the merger as compared to other business strategies that might have
been available to Virata and also did not address the underlying business
decision of Virata to proceed with the merger. Except as described above, Virata
imposed no other limitations on Credit Suisse First Boston with respect to the
investigations made or procedures followed in rendering its opinion.

    In preparing its opinion to the Virata board of directors, Credit Suisse
First Boston performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses,
including those described below. The summary of Credit Suisse First Boston's
analyses described below is not a complete description of the analyses
underlying its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex
process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant
methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the
particular circumstances, and, therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily
susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its
opinion, Credit Suisse First Boston made qualitative judgments as to the
significance and relevance of each analysis and factor that it considered.
Accordingly, Credit Suisse First Boston believes that its analyses must be
considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or
focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all
analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create
a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying its analyses and
opinion.

    In its analyses, Credit Suisse First Boston considered industry performance,
general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters,
many of which are beyond the control of Virata and GlobeSpan. No company,
transaction or business used in Credit Suisse First Boston's analyses as a
comparison is identical to Virata, GlobeSpan or the proposed merger, and an
evaluation of the results of those analyses is not entirely mathematical.
Rather, the analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning
financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the
acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies, business segments
or transactions analyzed. The estimates contained in Credit Suisse First
Boston's analyses and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular
analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future
results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those
suggested by the analyses. In addition, analyses relating to the value of
businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the
prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Accordingly,
Credit Suisse First Boston's analyses and estimates are inherently subject to
substantial uncertainty.

    Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion and financial analyses were only one of
many factors considered by the Virata board of directors in its evaluation of
the proposed merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of
the Virata board of directors or management with respect to the merger or the
exchange ratio.

    The following is a summary of the material financial analyses underlying
Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion dated October 1, 2001 delivered to the
Virata board of directors in connection with the merger. THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES
SUMMARIZED BELOW INCLUDE INFORMATION PRESENTED IN TABULAR FORMAT. IN ORDER TO
FULLY UNDERSTAND CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON'S FINANCIAL ANALYSES, THE TABLES
MUST BE READ TOGETHER WITH THE TEXT OF EACH SUMMARY. THE TABLES ALONE DO NOT
CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES. CONSIDERING THE
DATA IN THE TABLES BELOW WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE FULL NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF
THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES, INCLUDING THE METHODOLOGIES AND ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING
THE ANALYSES, COULD CREATE A MISLEADING OR INCOMPLETE VIEW OF CREDIT SUISSE
FIRST BOSTON'S FINANCIAL ANALYSES.

    EXCHANGE RATIO ANALYSIS.  Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed the ratio of
the closing price of Virata common stock to the closing price of GlobeSpan
common stock on September 28, 2001 and the average of this ratio calculated from
November 17, 1999, which was the date of Virata's initial public offering, to
various periods prior to September 28, 2001. Credit Suisse First Boston then
computed the premium/(discount) implied by the exchange ratio in the merger
relative to the implied exchange ratios for the periods observed and also
computed the fully diluted ownership of Virata's stockholders in the

combined company immediately upon consummation of the merger implied by the
resulting exchange ratios. This analysis yielded an implied exchange ratio range
of 0.590x to 1.104x, as compared to the exchange ratio in the merger of 1.020x,
an implied merger premium/(discount) range of approximately (7.6%) to 72.8%, and
an implied fully diluted ownership percentage range for Virata's stockholders in
the combined company of approximately 34.0% to 49.6% using the treasury stock
method, as compared to the fully diluted ownership percentage of Virata's
stockholders in the combined company immediately upon consummation of the merger
of approximately 47.5% using the treasury stock method, the closing per share
price of GlobeSpan common stock on September 28, 2001 of $9.04 and the exchange
ratio in the merger of 1.020x as indicated in the following table:

Period average............................   0.590x         72.8%               34.0%

    Credit Suisse First Boston also reviewed the ratio of the closing price of
Virata common stock to the closing price of GlobeSpan common stock on
September 28, 2001, and the four-day period preceding September 28, 2001, and
computed the premium/(discount) implied by the exchange ratio in the merger
relative to the exchange ratios for the dates observed. This analysis indicated
the following:

    PRECEDENT MERGER OF EQUALS TRANSACTIONS ANALYSIS.  Credit Suisse First
Boston reviewed the purchase prices paid in 95 merger of equals transactions
since 1991 and also reviewed the purchase prices paid in 19 technology merger of
equals transactions since 1994. For each group of transactions, Credit Suisse
First Boston calculated the premium implied by the exchange ratio in the
transaction relative to the ratio of the closing stock prices for the acquirors
and targets in the transactions one trading day and over various periods prior
to public announcement of the transaction. Credit Suisse First Boston then
applied the resulting premiums to the ratio of the closing price of Virata
common stock to the closing price of GlobeSpan common stock over the same
periods. This analysis indicated an implied exchange ratio range for the 95
precedent transactions of 0.411x to 1.859x and for the 19 technology
transactions of 0.664x to 1.623x and the following implied median and mean
exchange ratios

for Virata common stock over the various periods observed, as compared to the
exchange ratio in the merger of 1.020x:

    CONTRIBUTION ANALYSIS.  Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed the relative
contributions of Virata and GlobeSpan to the revenue, gross profit, operating
income and net income of the combined company for the latest 12 months and as
estimated for calendar years 2001 and 2002, excluding goodwill, potential
synergies and one-time charges, based on two cases for each of Virata and
GlobeSpan, a street case and a modified street case. The Virata street case and
the GlobeSpan street case were based on publicly available research analysts'
estimates. The modified street case for each of Virata and GlobeSpan were not
internal plans or projections of the managements of Virata or GlobeSpan but
rather included adjustments to the street case estimates for Virata and
GlobeSpan, based on discussions with the managements of Virata and GlobeSpan, to
reflect, among other things, the potential for increased revenue and
profitability for Virata and GlobeSpan.

    Credit Suisse First Boston then computed the fully diluted ownership
percentages of Virata's stockholders in the combined company implied by Virata's
relative contribution for each operational measure observed, in each case
adjusted to reflect net cash balances, and the exchange ratios implied by those
percentages, based on different scenarios of the two cases outlined above. This
analysis indicated the following low and high fully diluted ownership
percentages of Virata's stockholders in the combined company using the treasury
stock method and the exchange ratios implied by those ownership percentages, as
compared to the fully diluted ownership percentage of Virata's stockholders in
the combined company immediately upon consummation of the merger of
approximately 47.5% using the treasury stock method, the closing per share price
of GlobeSpan common stock on September 28, 2001 of $9.04 and the exchange ratio
in the merger of 1.020x:

IMPLIED VIRATA STOCKHOLDER                                      LOW        HIGH

  Virata modified street case /
    GlobeSpan modified street case..........................     0.6%      56.0%
  Virata modified street case /
    GlobeSpan street case...................................     1.6%      57.5%
 IMPLIED EXCHANGE RATIO:
  Virata street case /
    GlobeSpan street case...................................    0.935x     1.217x

  Virata modified street case /
    GlobeSpan street case...................................    0.019x     1.475x

    Credit Suisse First Boston noted that substantially all of the results
derived for Virata's operating income and net income contributions were not
meaningful due to Virata's net operating losses as compared to the historical
and projected profitability of GlobeSpan.

    PRO FORMA IMPACT ANALYSIS.  Credit Suisse First Boston analyzed the
potential pro forma effect of the merger on the combined company's estimated
earnings per share, commonly referred to as EPS, for

calendar years 2002 and 2003 based on the different scenarios of the two cases
for each of Virata and GlobeSpan described above under the heading "Contribution
Analysis," assuming, based on discussions with the managements of Virata and
GlobeSpan, a range of pretax potential costs savings and other synergies from
the merger, excluding goodwill, amortization and merger related costs, referred
to in the tables below as the no synergy, mid synergy and high synergy cases.
Based on the exchange ratio in the merger of 1.020x, this analysis indicated the
following results for calendar years 2002 and 2003 under each of the different
scenarios, depending on the level of potential synergies assumed:

estimated EPS on a stand-alone basis for calendar years 2002 and 2003. This
analysis indicated the following:

    The actual results achieved by the combined company may vary from projected
results and the variations may be material.

    OTHER FACTORS.  In the course of preparing its opinion, Credit Suisse First
Boston also reviewed and considered other information and data, including:

    - the implied trading multiples of Virata on a stand-alone basis, and pro
      forma for the merger, over various periods prior to September 28, 2001,
      relative to the implied trading multiples of GlobeSpan and selected
      companies in the technology industry on September 28, 2001; and

    - historical price performance and trading characteristics of Virata common
      stock and GlobeSpan common stock and the relationship between movements in
      Virata common stock, movements in GlobeSpan common stock and movements in
      selected stock indices of related industries.

    MISCELLANEOUS.  Virata has agreed to pay Credit Suisse First Boston
customary fees for its financial advisory services. Virata also has agreed to
reimburse Credit Suisse First Boston for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses,
including fees and expenses of legal counsel and any other advisor retained by
Credit Suisse First Boston, and to indemnify Credit Suisse First Boston and
related parties against liabilities, including liabilities under the federal
securities laws, arising out of its engagement.

    Credit Suisse First Boston and its affiliates in the past have provided
investment banking and financial services to Virata in connection with Virata's
initial public offering in November 1999, a subsequent equity offering by Virata
in June 2000 and Virata's acquisition of Excess Bandwidth Corporation in August
2000, for which services Credit Suisse First Boston and its affiliates have
received compensation. In addition, an affiliate of Credit Suisse First Boston
has a representative on the GlobeSpan board of directors. In the ordinary course
of business, Credit Suisse First Boston and its affiliates may actively trade
the securities of Virata or GlobeSpan for their own accounts and for the
accounts of customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold long or short
positions in those securities.

CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

    The following is a summary of certain federal income tax considerations of
the merger to the holders of Virata common stock that exchange such stock for
GlobeSpan common stock pursuant to the merger. This summary addresses only those
stockholders who hold their Virata common stock as a capital asset and will hold
GlobeSpan common stock received in exchange therefor as a capital asset. This
summary does not address all United States federal income tax considerations
that may be relevant to particular stockholders in light of their individual
circumstances or to stockholders that are subject to special rules, such as
financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, dealers
in securities, foreign stockholders, stockholders who hold Virata common stock
as part of a straddle, hedge, or conversion transaction, and stockholders who
acquired their Virata common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock
options or otherwise as compensation. The following summary is based upon the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, applicable Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions and current
administrative rulings, as of the date hereof, all of which are subject to
change, possibly on a retroactive basis. Tax considerations under state, local,
foreign, and other laws are not addressed herein.

    Each stockholder is advised to consult his or her tax advisor as to the
particular facts and circumstances which may be unique to such stockholder and
also as to any estate, gift, state, local, foreign, or federal tax
considerations arising out of the merger.

    No rulings have been or will be requested from the Internal Revenue Service
with respect to any of the matters discussed herein. There can be no assurance
that future legislation, regulations, administrative rulings or court decisions
would not alter the tax considerations set forth below. It is a condition to the
obligation of GlobeSpan to consummate the merger that GlobeSpan receive an
opinion from its counsel, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, and it is a condition
to the obligation of Virata to consummate the merger that Virata receive an
opinion from its counsel, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, in both cases
substantially to the effect that, based upon certain facts, representations, and
assumptions, the merger will constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of
section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The issuance of
such opinions is conditioned, among other things, on the receipt by Wachtell,
Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP of representation letters
from each of GlobeSpan, Wine Acquisition Corp. and Virata, in each case, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and
Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP. The following summary assumes that the merger will
be consummated as described in the merger agreement and this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and that the merger will constitute a "reorganization"
within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended.

    TREATMENT OF VIRATA, GLOBESPAN AND WINE ACQUISITION CORP.  No gain or loss
will be recognized by Virata, GlobeSpan, or Wine Acquisition Corp. as a result
of the merger.

    EXCHANGE OF VIRATA COMMON STOCK FOR GLOBESPAN COMMON STOCK. A holder of
Virata common stock whose shares of Virata common stock are exchanged in the
merger for GlobeSpan common stock will not recognize gain or loss, except to the
extent of any gain or loss attributable to the receipt of cash, if any, in lieu
of a fractional share of GlobeSpan common stock. See "Cash in Lieu of Fractional
Shares" below. The aggregate tax basis of GlobeSpan common stock received by
such holder will be equal to the aggregate tax basis of the Virata common stock
exchanged therefor (excluding any portion of the holder's basis allocable to a
fractional share of GlobeSpan common stock for which cash is paid), and the
holding period of GlobeSpan common stock received will include the holding
period of the Virata common stock exchanged therefor.

    CASH IN LIEU OF FRACTIONAL SHARES. A holder of Virata common stock who
receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of GlobeSpan common stock will be
treated as having received such fractional share pursuant to the merger and then
as having exchanged such fractional share for cash in a redemption by GlobeSpan.
The amount of any gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the
ratable portion of the tax basis of the Virata common stock exchanged in the
merger that is allocable to such fractional share and the cash received in lieu
thereof. Any such gain or loss will constitute long-term capital gain or loss if
such Virata common stock has been held by the holder for more than one year at
the time of the consummation of the merger.

CERTAIN UNITED KINGDOM TAX CONSIDERATIONS

    The following is a summary of certain considerations relating to the
treatment of the merger for the purposes of United Kingdom tax on chargeable
gains to holders of Virata common stock that exchange such stock for GlobeSpan
common stock pursuant to the merger. This summary applies only to persons who
are resident or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom for United Kingdom tax
purposes and who hold Virata common stock beneficially as an investment
(otherwise than under any scheme which benefits from special tax exemptions,
such as individual savings accounts) and will hold GlobeSpan common stock
received in exchange as an investment. This summary does not address all United
Kingdom tax considerations that may be relevant to particular stockholders in
light of their individual circumstances. The taxation position of special
classes of taxpayer such as dealers in securities, broker-dealers, insurance
companies and collective investment schemes is not considered. This summary is
based upon the provisions of UK law and UK Inland Revenue practice as at the
date of this document all of which are subject to change, possibly on a
retrospective basis, and there can be no assurance that future legislation,
changes in Inland Revenue practice or court decisions will not alter the tax
consideration set out below. Accordingly each stockholder is advised to contact
his or her tax advisor as to the particular facts and circumstances which may be
unique to such stockholder. Tax consideration under laws of any jurisdiction
other than the United Kingdom are not addressed herein.

    For the purposes of UK tax on chargeable gains, the merger should constitute
a scheme of reconstruction or amalgamation.

    This will mean that a Virata stockholder who, either alone or together with
persons connected with him, holds 5% or fewer of the shares in or debentures of
Virata should not be treated as having made a disposal of his Virata common
stock for the purposes of UK tax on chargeable gains, and, save to the extent of
cash (if any) received in lieu of a fractional share (see below), no chargeable
gain or allowable loss should arise to him on the implementation of the merger.
Any gain or loss which would otherwise have arisen on a disposal of his Virata
common stock should be "rolled-over" into his GlobeSpan common stock and the
GlobeSpan common stock should be treated as the same asset as his Virata common
stock, acquired at the same time and for the same consideration as such Virata
shares.

    A holder of Virata common stock who receives cash in lieu of a fractional
share of GlobeSpan common stock will be treated as having disposed of his Virata
common stock to that extent, and may realize a chargeable gain or allowable loss
accordingly.

    The treatment for the purposes of UK tax on chargeable gains of a Virata
stockholder who either alone or together with persons connected with him holds
more than 5% of the shares in or debentures of Virata will be the same as that
described in the preceding paragraphs, unless the United Kingdom Inland Revenue
determine that the merger is not being effected for bona fide commercial reasons
or forms part of a scheme or arrangement of which the main purpose, or one of
the main purposes, is avoidance of liability for capital gains tax or
corporation tax. In the event that the United Kingdom Inland Revenue made such a
determination, such a stockholder would be treated as making a disposal of his
shares of Virata common stock for the purposes of UK tax on chargeable gains,
and a chargeable gain or allowable loss would arise on the implementation of the
merger. A procedure exists to obtain confirmation in advance from the United
Kingdom Inland Revenue that they will not make such a determination in respect
of the merger. However, as the board of directors of Virata believes that there
are no Virata stockholders who either alone or together with persons connected
with them hold more than 5% of the shares in or debentures of Virata, no such
confirmation has been sought.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

    We will treat the merger as a purchase by GlobeSpan of Virata under
generally accepted accounting principles. Under the purchase method of
accounting, the assets and liabilities of the company not surviving a merger
are, as of completion of the merger, recorded at their respective fair market
values and added to those of the surviving company. Financial statements of the
surviving company issued after consummation of the merger reflect these values,
but are not restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position
or results of operations of the company not surviving.

    All unaudited pro forma financial information contained in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus has been prepared using the purchase method to account for
the merger. See "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information"
on page 71. The final allocation of the purchase price will be determined after
the merger is consummated and after completion of a thorough analysis to
determine the fair market values of Virata's tangible and identifiable
intangible assets and liabilities. In addition, estimates related to
restructuring and merger-related charges are subject to final decisions related
to combining the companies. Accordingly, the final purchase accounting
adjustments, restructuring and merger-related charges may be materially
different from the unaudited pro forma adjustments presented in this document.
Any decrease in the net fair value of the assets and liabilities of Virata as
compared to the information shown in this document will have the effect of
increasing the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER

    In accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, for a period of
12 months after the merger is consummated (referred to as the "transition
period") the combined company's board of directors will be comprised of eight
members, four of whom will be designated by GlobeSpan prior to the effective
time and four of whom will be designated by Virata prior to the effective time.
It is expected that Charles Cotton, Gary Bloom, Hermann Hauser and Giuseppe
Zocco from Virata's board of directors will join the board of directors of the
combined company, and Armando Geday, Dipanjan Deb, James Coulter and John Marren
from GlobeSpan's board of directors will continue as directors.

    Immediately following the effective time, the combined company will:

    - appoint Armando Geday to serve as the chief executive officer of the
      combined company;

    - appoint Charles Cotton to serve (A) during the transition period, at the
      discretion of the board of directors, as executive chairman of the board
      of directors of the combined company and

      (B) following the transition period, at the discretion of the board of
      directors, as the non-executive chairman of the board of directors of the
      combined company; and

    - amend the bylaws of the combined company to provide that during the
      transition period, neither Armando Geday nor Charles Cotton may be removed
      from their positions on the board of directors of the combined company
      without the affirmative vote of 75% of the board of directors.

    In connection with the proposed merger, Armando Geday and Charles Cotton
have entered into employment contracts with GlobeSpan to be effective on the
closing of the merger. The companies have agreed to use reasonable commercial
efforts to enter into employment arrangements with several GlobeSpan officers
and several Virata officers.

    Pursuant to the new employment agreement, Mr. Geday will serve as chief
executive officer of the combined company. The new employment agreement provides
for a rolling two-year employment term, a base salary no less favorable than
Mr. Geday's current salary, and total cash compensation (including annual bonus)
of no less than $500,000 per year. Under the new employment agreement, if
Mr. Geday's employment is terminated by the combined company without cause or by
Mr. Geday for good reason (each as defined in the new employment agreement),
Mr. Geday will be entitled to a cash payment equal to two times his then-current
base salary, a cash payment equal to the target bonus for the year of
termination, a cash payment of a pro rata target bonus for the year of
termination, $500,000, one year of benefits and vesting of all unvested equity
awards. In addition, Mr. Geday will be bound by non-compete and non-solicitation
restrictions during his employment and for one year thereafter. However, if
Mr. Geday's employment is terminated by the combined company without cause or by
Mr. Geday for good reason (each as defined in the new employment agreement),
Mr. Geday will not be subject to the non-compete or the non-solicitation
restrictions. During the two year period following the merger, the affirmative
vote of at least seventy-five percent of the directors of the combined company
is required to terminate Mr. Geday's employment.

    Pursuant to the new employment agreement, Mr. Cotton will serve as executive
chairman of the board of directors of the combined company. The term of
Mr. Cotton's employment as executive chairman will cease at the first
anniversary of the effective time of merger, at which time he will become a
non-executive chairman of the board of directors of the combined company for a
period of one year thereafter (or longer, but only upon the mutual agreement of
the combined company and Mr. Cotton). Mr. Cotton will receive substantially the
same annual cash compensation during the first year of the new employment
agreement as he received from Virata prior to the merger, but no less than
$500,000. Thereafter, Mr. Cotton's annual compensation will be set by the board
of directors of the combined company. Under the new employment agreement, if
Mr. Cotton's employment is terminated prior to the first anniversary of the
effective time of the merger by the combined company without cause or by
Mr. Cotton for good reason (each as defined in the new employment agreement),
Mr. Cotton will be entitled to a cash payment equal to two times his
then-current base salary, a cash payment equal to the target bonus for the year
of termination, a cash payment of a pro rata target bonus for the year of
termination, one year of benefits and vesting of all unvested equity awards.
Mr. Cotton will receive continued vesting of his equity through the period
during which he remains a non-executive director of the combined company. In
addition, Mr. Cotton will be bound by non-compete and non-solicitation
restrictions during his employment as executive chairman and for one year
thereafter. However, if Mr. Cotton's employment as executive chairman is
terminated by the combined company without cause or by Mr. Cotton for good
reason (each as defined in the new employment agreement), Mr. Cotton will not be
subject to the non-compete or the non-solicitation restrictions. During the
two-year period following the merger, the affirmative vote of at least seventy-
five percent of the directors of the combined company is required to terminate
Mr. Cotton's employment.

    As of November 2, 2001, non-employee members of Virata's board of directors,
Marco De Benedetti, Peter Morris, Patrick Sayer, Hermann Hauser, Andrew Hopper,
Giuseppe Zocco and Gary Bloom, held an aggregate of 291,669 options to purchase
Virata common stock which will accelerate upon completion of the merger. The
merger with GlobeSpan will constitute a change of control under the terms of the
Virata Non-Employee Director Compensation Plan.

    Two of Virata's officers, Charles Cotton and Andrew Vought, entered into
agreements with Virata in 1997 and 1996, respectively, that provide that they
will be entitled to receive bonus payments in the event of a transaction such as
the merger. Pursuant to these agreements, each of Mr. Cotton and Mr. Vought will
be entitled to receive payments upon consumation of the merger.

    GlobeSpan has agreed to indemnify each Virata officer and director to the
same extent as provided in Virata's certificate of incorporation and bylaws and
the indemnification agreements between Virata and its officers and directors. In
addition, GlobeSpan has agreed to maintain Virata's directors' and officers'
liability insurance on terms at least as favorable as the current liability
insurance maintained by Virata for at least six years from the completion of the
merger, provided, however, that GlobeSpan will not be required to spend in any
one year an amount greater than 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by
Virata.

REGULATORY CLEARANCES AND APPROVALS

    Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended,
and the rules that have been promulgated thereunder by the United States Federal
Trade Commission, GlobeSpan and Virata cannot complete the merger until they
give notification and furnish information to the Federal Trade Commission and
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and observe a statutory
waiting period requirement. GlobeSpan and Virata filed the required notification
and report forms with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division as
of October 15, 2001. The waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act is
scheduled to expire on November 14, 2001, unless it is earlier terminated or
extended by a request for additional information or documentary materials. If
the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division issues such a request,
the waiting period will be extended until the first work day that is 30 days
after GlobeSpan and Virata have substantially complied with the request. The
waiting period may be terminated earlier by the Federal Trade Commission or the
Antitrust Division. At any time before or after the effective time of the
merger, and notwithstanding that the waiting period has terminated or the merger
may have been consummated, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division
or any state could take such action under the applicable antitrust or
competition laws as it deems necessary or desirable. This action could include
seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger. Private parties may also
institute legal actions under the antitrust laws under some circumstances. See
applicable risks described in the section of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus entitled "Risk Factors."

NO DISSENTER'S OR APPRAISAL RIGHTS

    Under Delaware law, no holder of GlobeSpan common stock or Virata common
stock will have any dissenter's or appraisal rights in connection with the
merger.

QUOTATION ON THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET

    It is a condition to the merger that the shares of GlobeSpan common stock to
be issued in the merger and the other shares to be reserved for issuance in
connection with the merger be approved for trading on the Nasdaq National Market
subject to official notice of issuance. The merger agreement provides that
GlobeSpan will use its reasonable commercial efforts to cause the shares of
GlobeSpan common stock to be issued in the merger and the shares of GlobeSpan
common stock to be reserved for issuance in connection with the merger to be
approved for trading on the Nasdaq National Market.

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF VIRATA COMMON STOCK

    If the merger is completed, Virata common stock will be delisted from the
Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended.

FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS CONSEQUENCES

    The shares of GlobeSpan common stock to be issued in the merger will be
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These shares will be
freely transferable under the Securities Act, except for GlobeSpan common stock
issued to any person who is deemed to be an affiliate of Virata or the combined
company. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates include individuals or
entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with
Virata and include Virata's officers and directors, as well as its principal
stockholders. Virata's affiliates may not sell their GlobeSpan common stock
acquired in the merger, except pursuant to:

    - an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the
      resale of those shares;

    - an exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act; or

    - any other applicable exemption under the Securities Act.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

    THIS SECTION IS A SUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THE MERGER
AGREEMENT, A COPY OF WHICH IS ATTACHED AS ANNEX A TO THIS JOINT PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS. THE FOLLOWING DESCRIPTION IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE
DESCRIPTION OF ALL THE TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT. YOU SHOULD REFER TO THE
FULL TEXT OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT FOR DETAILS OF THE MERGER AND THE TERMS AND
CONDITIONS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT. WE ENCOURAGE YOU CAREFULLY READ THE COMPLETE
MERGER AGREEMENT FOR THE PRECISE LEGAL TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND OTHER
INFORMATION THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO YOU.

THE MERGER

    The merger agreement provides that upon the closing, Wine Acquisition Corp,
which is referred to herein as Merger Sub, will be merged with and into Virata,
with Virata as the surviving corporation. As a result of the merger, Virata will
become a wholly owned subsidiary of GlobeSpan. The merger will become effective
on the date of filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware which the parties have agreed to file as soon as
practicable after the closing. This is referred to as the "effective time" of
the merger.

THE EXCHANGE RATIO AND TREATMENT OF VIRATA SECURITIES

    At the effective time of the merger:

    - each share of Virata common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
      to the effective time, other than shares of Virata common stock held in
      the treasury of Virata or that are owned by Virata, GlobeSpan or any of
      their subsidiaries (other than those held in a fiduciary capacity for the
      benefit of third parties), shall cease to be outstanding and will be
      converted into the right to receive 1.02 shares of GlobeSpan common stock;
      and

    - shares of Virata common stock held in the treasury of Virata or that are
      owned by Virata, GlobeSpan or any of their subsidiaries will be canceled
      and no GlobeSpan common stock or other consideration will be delivered in
      exchange for this cancellation.

    Each outstanding option to purchase Virata common stock, whether or not
exercisable, will be converted at the effective time of the merger into an
option to purchase GlobeSpan common stock on the same terms and conditions as
were applicable under the option before the merger to purchase Virata common
stock, except the number of shares subject to the option shall be multiplied by
1.02 (and rounded up to the nearest whole share) and the exercise price per
share shall be divided by 1.02 (and rounded to the nearest whole cent).

    At the effective time of the merger, each share of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding will be converted into one share of the surviving corporation.

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

    As soon as reasonably practicable after the effective time of the merger,
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as exchange agent, will mail to each
stockholder of record of Virata a letter of transmittal and instructions for the
surrender of certificates representing Virata common stock in exchange for
certificates representing GlobeSpan common stock.

    No certificates representing fractional shares of GlobeSpan common stock
will be issued in the merger. Instead of issuing fractional shares of GlobeSpan
common stock to the holders of shares of Virata common stock, GlobeSpan will pay
cash in an amount equal to the holder's proportionate interest in the net
proceeds from the sale by the exchange agent at the prevailing prices on the
Nasdaq National Market, on behalf of all such holders, of the aggregate of all
fractional shares of GlobeSpan

common stock. This sale will take place as soon as is practicable after the
effective time. No interest will be paid or accrued on cash in lieu of
fractional shares, if any.

    If, after one year from the effective time of the merger, a holder of shares
of Virata common stock has not surrendered the stock certificates representing
such shares to the exchange agent, then the holder of stock certificates
representing Virata common stock may look only to GlobeSpan to receive its
shares of GlobeSpan common stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares and any
unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of GlobeSpan common stock.

    None of GlobeSpan, Merger Sub, Virata or the exchange agent will be liable
to any holder of a certificate formerly representing shares of Virata common
stock for GlobeSpan common stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares, or any
unpaid dividends and distributions properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

    Unclaimed shares of GlobeSpan common stock, cash in lieu of fractional
shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of GlobeSpan common
stock will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of
GlobeSpan prior to the time such amounts would otherwise escheat or become
property of any governmental entity.

    Holders of Virata common stock should not send in their certificates until
they receive a letter of transmittal from the exchange agent.

ANTI-DILUTION ADJUSTMENTS

    If, before the merger is completed, there is a reclassification, stock
split, split-up, stock dividend, combination or exchange of shares with respect
to, or rights issued in respect of, GlobeSpan common stock or Virata common
stock, the exchange ratio will be adjusted accordingly to provide the holders of
Virata common stock the same economic effect of the exchange ratio in effect
immediately before the relevant event.

POST-MERGER OPERATIONS; GLOBESPAN BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

    The headquarters of the combined company will be located in Red Bank, New
Jersey. During the transition period, the combined company's board of directors
will be comprised of eight members, four of whom will be designated by GlobeSpan
prior to the effective time and four of whom will be designated by Virata prior
to the effective time. At the effective time, the bylaws of GlobeSpan will be
amended to provide that:

    - if an individual designated by GlobeSpan resigns, dies or is removed
      during the transition period such individual shall be replaced by another
      individual designated by the remaining individuals previously designated
      by GlobeSpan;

    - if an individual designated by Virata resigns, dies or is removed during
      the transition period such individual shall be replaced by another
      individual designated by the remaining individuals previously designated
      by Virata; and

    - during the transition period an affirmative vote of 75% or more of the
      directors of the full board of directors will be required to change the
      number of directors on the full board of directors.

    Immediately after the effective time, GlobeSpan will:

    - appoint Armando Geday to serve, at the discretion of the board of
      directors, as the Chief Executive Officer of the combined company;

    - appoint Charles Cotton to serve (a) during the transition period, at the
      discretion of the board of directors, as Executive Chairman of the board
      of directors of the combined company, and (b) following the transition
      period, at the discretion of the board of directors, as the Non-Executive
      Chairman of the board of directors of the combined company; and

    - amend the combined company's bylaws to provide that neither Armando Geday
      nor Charles Cotton may be removed from their positions without the
      affirmative vote of 75% of the full board of directors during the
      transition period.

    During the transition period the board of directors will empower a committee
(referred to as the "transition committee") that will consist initially of
Armando Geday and Charles Cotton. The transition committee, subject to the
authority of the board of directors, will make decisions concerning personnel
and the integration of GlobeSpan and Virata. Any changes in designated members
of management will require the joint approval of Armando Geday and Charles
Cotton. GlobeSpan has agreed to appoint the individuals designated by the
transition committee to the offices designated by the transition committee.

    GlobeSpan has entered into employment agreements with Armando Geday and
Charles Cotton (each to be effective upon consummation of the merger) that may
not be amended prior to the effective time without the consent of Virata. See
the section entitled "The Merger--Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger"
above.

SPECIAL MEETINGS

    Each of GlobeSpan and Virata have agreed to hold special meetings of their
respective stockholders to consider and vote upon approval of the merger
agreement and the merger, in the case of Virata, and the issuance of shares of
GlobeSpan common stock in the merger and the amendment to the certificate of
incoporation to change its name, in the case of GlobeSpan.

ACCESS TO INFORMATION

    Subject to existing confidentiality obligations and applicable law, and upon
reasonable notice, GlobeSpan and Virata and their subsidiaries have agreed to
afford each other and each of their respective representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours to their respective properties, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel and records, and shall provide such copies as the other
party may request.

REASONABLE COMMERCIAL EFFORTS

    Under the merger agreement and subject to the terms and conditions specified
in the merger agreement, the parties have agreed to use reasonable commercial
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement as soon as practicable,
including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to
affect all necessary applications, filings and other documents and to obtain all
necessary consents, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals,
permits, rulings, authorizations and clearances necessary or advisable to be
obtained from any third party and/or governmental entity in order to consummate
the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
and to take all reasonable steps necessary to obtain these approvals or
consents. The parties have made appropriate filings pursuant to the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and all other necessary filings
with other governmental entities with respect to the merger as promptly as
practicable. The parties have agreed to supply, as promptly as practicable, any
additional information or documentation that may be requested pursuant to such
law, to use reasonable commercial efforts to cause the expiration or early
termination of the applicable waiting period under such law and not to extend
any waiting period under such law or enter into any agreement not to consummate
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, except with the prior
written consent of the other party. Neither party shall be obligated to hold
separate or to divest any of its businesses or assets, or agree to take any
action or agree to any limitation that could reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on GlobeSpan (assuming the merger has been consummated),
or to substantially impair the benefits GlobeSpan and Virata expect to be
realized from the consummation of the merger, and neither party shall be
required to agree to or effect any divestiture, hold separate any business or
take any other action that is not conditional on the consummation of the merger.

NO SOLICITATION

    The merger agreement contains detailed provisions prohibiting each of
GlobeSpan and Virata from seeking an alternative transaction. Under these no
solicitation provisions, each of GlobeSpan and

Virata has agreed that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries nor any of their
respective officers and directors will:

    - initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate, any inquiries or the
      making of any proposal or offer with respect to, or a transaction to
      effect any of the following (each of which is referred to herein as an
      "acquisition proposal"):

       - a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business
         combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
         transaction involving it or any of its significant subsidiaries;

       - any purchase or sale of 20% or more of the consolidated assets of it or
         any of its subsidiaries, including the stock of such subsidiaries; or

       - any purchase or sale of, or tender or exchange offer for, its equity
         securities that, if consummated, would result in a third party
         beneficially owning securities representing 20% or more of its total
         voting power or the voting power of any of its significant
         subsidiaries;

    - have any discussion with or provide any confidential information or data
      to any third party concerning any acquisition proposal or engage in any
      negotiations concerning an acquisition proposal or knowingly facilitate
      any effort or attempt to make or implement an acquisition proposal;

    - approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
      acquisition proposal; or

    - approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or
      enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger
      agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar
      proposal or propose publicly or agree to do any of the foregoing related
      to any acquisition proposal.

    However, the merger agreement permits each of GlobeSpan and Virata to engage
in discussions or negotiations with, or provide information to, any third party
in response to an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal, if and
only to the extent that:

    - the special meeting shall not have occurred with respect to the relevant
      party;

    - the board of directors of GlobeSpan or Virata, as the case may be,
      concludes in good faith that there is a reasonable likelihood that such
      acquisition proposal could constitute a superior proposal (as defined
      below); and

    - after consultation with outside counsel, such board of directors
      determines in good faith that it is required to do so in the exercise of
      its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

    Before GlobeSpan or Virata may, in connection with an acquisition proposal,
provide any information to a third party, or enter into any discussions with a
third party, it must promptly:

    - notify the other party of inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any
      information requested from or any discussions sought to be initiated or
      continued with any of its representatives, including the name of the
      person making the inquiry proposal or offer; and

    - have received a confidentiality agreement containing provisions that are
      at least as restrictive as the comparable provisions in the
      confidentiality agreement between GlobeSpan and Virata.

    In addition, GlobeSpan and Virata have agreed to promptly advise the other
party of any request for information or of any proposal in connection with any
alternative transaction, the material terms and conditions of such request or
proposal and the identity of the person making such request or proposal and keep
the other party reasonably informed of the status and details of any request or
proposal.

    In addition, GlobeSpan and Virata and their respective boards of directors
may withdraw, modify or qualify their recommendations of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, if any,

and only to the extent that (i) the special meeting shall not have occurred with
respect to the relevant party, (ii) the board of directors of GlobeSpan or
Virata, as the case may be, concludes in good faith that such acquisition
proposal constitutes a superior proposal, and (iii) after consultation with
outside counsel, such board of directors determines in good faith that it is
required to do so in the exercise of its fiduciary duties under applicable law.
Notwithstanding any change in the recommendation of such board of directors, the
merger agreement must still be submitted to the stockholders of the party
receiving such acquisition proposal for the purpose of approving the merger
agreement and the merger (including, in the case of GlobeSpan stockholders, the
approval of the issuance of the shares pursuant to the merger agreement).

    A "superior proposal" with respect to GlobeSpan or Virata means a bona fide
written proposal made by a third party that is:

    - for an acquisition proposal, except that all references above to "20%"
      shall be changed to "50%", and

    - on terms which its board of directors in good faith concludes, following
      consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, taking into
      account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other
      aspects of the proposal and the third party making the proposal, would, if
      consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable to its
      stockholders, from a financial point of view, than the merger and is
      reasonably capable of being completed.

    The merger agreement provides that these restrictions will not prohibit
GlobeSpan or Virata from complying with applicable law, including Rule 14e-2 and
Rule 14d-9 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

FEES AND EXPENSES

    Subject to the provisions relating to payment of termination fees, all
expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement shall be paid by the
party incurring such expenses, except expenses incurred in the filing, printing
and mailing of the joint proxy statement/prospectus, will be shared equally by
GlobeSpan and Virata.

INDEMNIFICATION, EXCULPATION AND INSURANCE

    The merger agreement provides that GlobeSpan will indemnify and hold
harmless, and advance expenses to all past and present directors, officers and
employees of Virata and its subsidiaries, to the same extent as provided in
Virata's certificate of incorporation, bylaws and indemnification agreements and
to the fullest extent permitted by law for acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the effective time. The surviving corporation will maintain in its
certificate of incorporation and bylaws for a period of six years after the
effective time, provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors,
indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of expenses
that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the
corresponding provisions in the current certificate of incorporation and bylaws
of Virata.

    In addition, GlobeSpan will maintain for at least six years after the
effective time of the merger Virata's directors' and officers' liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance with respect to claims arising from
facts or events occurring prior to the effective time of the merger. GlobeSpan
may substitute policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing
terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the insured, provided that
GlobeSpan will not, with respect to any of these policies, be required to expend
in any one year an amount in excess of 300% of the premiums currently paid by
Virata. To the extent the annual premiums for such coverage exceed this amount,
GlobeSpan will obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding such amount.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

    After the closing of the merger, except as otherwise provided in the merger
agreement, GlobeSpan will assume and honor all of Virata's benefit plans in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the closing,
subject to any permissible amendments or as otherwise permitted by law. For a
period of not less than one year following the closing, GlobeSpan will provide,
or cause to be provided, to all employees of Virata or its subsidiaries who
remain employees of GlobeSpan following the closing, compensation and benefits
(except for discretionary equity and equity based awards which remain
discretionary) that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than those provided
to employees of Virata and its subsidiaries prior to the closing as disclosed to
GlobeSpan prior to the date of the merger agreement; however with the approval
of the transition committee, GlobeSpan may provide employees of Virata or its
subsidiaries with compensation and employee benefits that are, in the aggregate,
no less favorable than those provided to similarly situated GlobeSpan employees.
GlobeSpan agrees to honor any employment agreements between Virata and its
subsidiaries and their respective employees. For a period of one year after the
effective time, GlobeSpan may not reduce the compensation or benefits, without
consent, of specified individuals who are designated by the transition
committee. Virata, prior to the effective time, and GlobeSpan, after the
effective time, may terminate any employee or amend any benefit plan to the
extent permitted by the plan and applicable law or agreement. See "The
Merger--Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger."

    GlobeSpan has agreed for purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and
level of benefits under GlobeSpan employee benefit plans to credit Virata
employees with their years of service with Virata and its subsidiaries and
predecessor companies before the effective time to the same extent such service
was credited by Virata, except if such credits would result in duplicate
benefits, would result in benefit accruals under defined benefit pension or
similar plans or prior service credit is not provided to GlobeSpan employees
under such plan. GlobeSpan has agreed to waive pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements in GlobeSpan plans for employees unless such
conditions would not have been waived under comparable Virata plans. GlobeSpan
has also agreed to provide Virata employees with credit for any eligible
expenses paid before completion of the merger for purposes of satisfying
deductibles, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements for the year in
which the merger occurs.

    The board of directors of Virata shall take all actions necessary so that
the Virata employee stock purchase plan shall terminate immediately prior to the
effective time and all participants will automatically exercise their purchase
rights. The board of directors of GlobeSpan shall take all actions necessary so
that employees of Virata and its subsidiaries who become employees of GlobeSpan
or its subsidiaries will be eligible to participate in the GlobeSpan employee
stock purchase plan as soon as practicable after the effective time and
GlobeSpan is permitted to take all action necessary so that current GlobeSpan
employees may be afforded the same benefits as afforded the Virata employees.

NASDAQ

    GlobeSpan has agreed to use its reasonable commercial efforts to cause the
GlobeSpan common stock issued in the merger to be approved for listing on the
Nasdaq National Market.

AFFILIATES

    Not less than 45 days prior to the date of the Virata special meeting,
Virata shall deliver to GlobeSpan a letter identifying all persons who may be
deemed affiliates for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act, which list
shall be updated as reasonably necessary. Virata shall use reasonable commercial
efforts to cause each person identified on this list to deliver an agreement
whereby each affiliate will agree not to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of
GlobeSpan common stock in violation of the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, and will acknowledge the resale restrictions imposed by

Rule 145 under the Securities Act on shares of GlobeSpan common stock to be
received by that affiliate in the merger.

SECTION 16 MATTERS

    GlobeSpan and Virata have agreed to take, before completion of the merger,
all required steps to exempt under SEC Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, any dispositions of Virata common
stock or acquisitions of GlobeSpan common stock in connection with the merger,
including any derivative securities, by each individual that is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
Virata, or that will become subject to those reporting requirements with respect
to GlobeSpan.

VIRATA RIGHTS AGREEMENT

    Virata has agreed to take all necessary action, including amending Virata's
rights agreement to render the Virata rights inapplicable to the merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Except in connection
with the foregoing sentence, the board of directors will not amend the rights
agreement or take any action with respect to the rights agreement in order to
facilitate an acquisition proposal without GlobeSpan's prior written consent.

    On October 1, 2001, Virata adopted an amendment to its rights agreement
which excepted the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the
GlobeSpan stockholders agreement from triggering such rights and provided for
the termination of the rights agreement at the effective time of the merger.

TERMINATION

    The merger agreement provides that at any time prior to the effective time
of the merger, and except as specifically provided in the merger agreement,
whether before or after the GlobeSpan special meeting or the Virata special
meeting, the merger agreement may be terminated:

    - by mutual written consent of GlobeSpan and Virata;

    - by either GlobeSpan or Virata if:

       - the merger has not been completed on or before March 1, 2002, or
         May 1, 2002, if the waiting period and any extensions applicable to the
         merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976
         has not yet terminated or expired or if either GlobeSpan or Virata has
         failed to obtain any other required approvals, applications or notices
         with any governmental entity, provided, however, that this right to
         terminate shall not be available to a party whose failure to fulfill
         any obligation under the merger agreement has been the primary cause
         of, or resulted in, the failure of the closing to occur on or before
         March 1, 2002;

       - any governmental entity (a) issues an order, decree or ruling or takes
         any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
         prohibiting the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and
         such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final or
         nonappealable or (b) fails to issue an order, decree or ruling or fails
         to take some other action which is necessary to fulfill a closing
         condition to the merger and such denial or failure shall have become
         final and nonappealable, provided that this right to terminate shall
         not be available to a party whose failure to comply with provisions of
         the merger agreement relating to the use of reasonable commercial
         efforts has been the primary cause of such prohibition or denial;

       - the stockholders of GlobeSpan fail to approve the issuance of shares of
         GlobeSpan common stock; or

       - the stockholders of Virata fail to approve the merger and the merger
         agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.

    - by the board of directors of Virata if:

       - subject to various conditions, GlobeSpan breaches or fails to perform
         any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
         in the merger agreement, which breach or failure to perform is
         incapable of being cured or is not cured before March 1, 2002, or
         May 1, 2002, if the reason for the delay is failure to obtain required
         regulatory approvals (March 1, 2002, or May 1, 2002, as the case may
         be, is referred to as the "termination date"); or

       - GlobeSpan's board of directors fails to make, changes, withdraws,
         modifies, qualifies in a manner adverse to Virata or fails to reconfirm
         within 10 days of Virata's request, its recommendation that
         stockholders approve the issuance of shares of GlobeSpan common stock
         in the merger, willfully and materially breaches its obligations with
         respect to non-solicitation or fails to call a stockholder meeting or

          UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

    The following unaudited condensed combined pro forma financial statements
and explanatory notes have been prepared to give effect to the merger and the
subsequent name change of GlobeSpan to GlobeSpan Virata, Inc. as if the merger
had been completed on January 1, 2001, for statement of operations purposes, and
June 30, 2001, for balance sheet purposes. The merger is expected to be
accounted for as a purchase business combination as defined by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 141. GlobeSpan is the acquiring enterprise for
purposes of accounting for the merger. At the time of the closing of the merger,
the holders of shares of common stock outstanding of GlobeSpan will receive a
larger portion of the voting interest in Globespan Virata. In accordance with
Article 11 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, an unaudited pro forma
condensed combined balance sheet as of June 30, 2001, and unaudited pro forma
condensed combined statements of operations for the six months ended June 30,
2001, and the year ended December 31, 2000, have been prepared to reflect the
acquisition of Virata by GlobeSpan.

    The pro forma financial statements are based on the historical consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto of GlobeSpan. Additionally, the pro forma
financial statements reflect certain balance sheet and statement of income
reclassifications made to conform GlobeSpan's and Virata's presentations to the
GlobeSpan Virata presentation. The pro forma financial statements should be read
in conjunction with (a) the historical consolidated financial statements of
GlobeSpan as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2000, and the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements as of June 30, 2001, and for the six month periods ended
June 30, 2001, and 2000; and (b) the historical consolidated financial
statements of Virata as of April 1, 2001, and April 2, 2000, and for each of the
three years in the period ended April 1, 2001, and the unaudited consolidated
financial statements as of July 1, 2001, and for the three month periods ended
July 1, 2001, and July 2, 2000.

    The pro forma adjustments are preliminary and based on GlobeSpan
management's estimates of the value of the tangible and intangible assets
acquired. Based on the timing of the closing of the transaction and other
factors, pro forma adjustments may differ materially from those presented in
these pro forma financial statements. A change affecting the value assigned to
long-term assets acquired and liabilities acquired and/or assumed would result
in a reallocation of purchase price and modifications to the pro forma
adjustments. The statement of operations effect of these changes will depend on
the nature and amount of the assets or liabilities adjusted.

    The pro forma financial data is intended for informational purposes only and
is not necessarily indicative of the future financial position or future results
of operations of GlobeSpan Virata after the merger or the financial position or
results of operations had the merger actually been effected on January 1, 2001
or 2000.

NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

    The pro forma balance sheet was prepared by combining the historical
unaudited consolidated balance sheet data as of June 30, 2001 for GlobeSpan and
the historical unaudited consolidated balance sheet data as of July 1, 2001 for
Virata. The pro forma statement of operations for the six months ended June 30,
2001 has been prepared utilizing the GlobeSpan historical unaudited consolidated
statement of operations data for the six months ended June 30, 2001 and the
Virata historical unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for the
six months ended July 1, 2001 assuming the merger had occurred on January 1,
2001. The pro forma statement of operations for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2000 has been prepared utilizing the unaudited pro forma
consolidated statement of operations data for GlobeSpan for the twelve month
period ended December 31, 2000 and the unaudited pro forma consolidated
statement of operations data for Virata for the twelve months ended April 1,
2001. In addition to giving effect to the merger, these pro forma results have
been adjusted to present the financial results of significant transactions and
acquisitions of GlobeSpan and Virata during the twelve months ended
December 31, 2000 and the twelve months ended April 1, 2001, as if they occurred
at the beginning of each company's twelve month period, in accordance with
Article 3 of Regulation S-X. The merger has not been consummated as of the date
of the preparation of these pro forma financial statements and there can be no
assurances that the merger will be consummated in the future.

(a) The following represents the elimination of Virata's historical intangible
    assets of $319,020 and the preliminary allocation of the purchase price over
    the historical net book values of the acquired assets and assumed
    liabilities of Virata at June 30, 2001, and is for illustrative purposes
    only. Actual fair values will be based on financial information as of the
    acquisition date. Assuming the transaction had occurred on June 30, 2001,
    the preliminary allocation would have been as follows:

Tangible assets acquired at fair value......................  $548,160
Costs in excess of the net tangible assets of the acquired
  business(1)...............................................    95,758
Acquisition costs...........................................   (10,500)
Liabilities assumed.........................................   (35,252)
                                                              --------
Total purchase price(2).....................................  $598,166
                                                              ========

- ------------------------

    (1) The costs in excess of tangible assets of the acquired business have
       been allocated on a preliminary basis as follows:

Technology..................................................  $ 60,000
Trademarks..................................................     5,758
Customer Relationships......................................    30,000
                                                              --------
Total intangible assets.....................................  $ 95,758
                                                              ========

    (2) The purchase price consists of 65,149 shares of common stock exchanged
       and employee stock options valued at approximately $566,666 and $31,500,
       respectively, based upon GlobeSpan's stock price a few days before and
       after the companies reached agreement and the proposed transaction was
       announced.

NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION (CONTINUED)
(b) In connection with the merger, GlobeSpan has estimated acquisition expenses
    of $10,500, reflected as an adjustment to purchase price.

(c) In connection with employment arrangements certain employees may be entitled
    to receive up to an aggregate of $1,000 upon consummation of the merger.

(d) Reflects the elimination of Virata stockholder's equity, in accordance with
    purchase business combination accounting, and the recording of $598,166 as a
    result of the issuance of additional GlobeSpan common shares and vested
    Virata options converted by GlobeSpan to effect the merger. Additionally,
    reflects unvested Virata options converted by GlobeSpan in the approximate
    amount of $9,400, refer to (e) for further information related to deferred
    compensation.

(e) Reflects the elimination of deferred compensation recorded by Virata during
    the periods presented and the amortization of deferred compensation recorded
    by GlobeSpan as a result of the assumption of unvested Virata options. In
    conjunction with the merger, GlobeSpan will convert unvested Virata options
    into GlobeSpan options. GlobeSpan will record deferred compensation of
    approximately $9,400, based on the estimated intrinsic value of the unvested
    options to be converted at the date of the acquisition. This deferred
    compensation will be recorded to expense on a straight-line basis over the
    weighted average vesting period of approximately 24 months.

(f) Reflects the elimination of the amortization of intangible assets which were
    recorded by Virata, in conjunction with their acquisitions and the
    amortization of the amortizable intangible assets of $95,758 recorded as a
    result of the preliminary purchase price allocation, over an estimated
    useful life of 36 months, for the periods presented.

(g) The pro forma basic and diluted loss per common share is computed by
    dividing the loss before extraordinary item by the weighted average number
    of common shares outstanding, reflecting an additional 65,149 shares of
    GlobeSpan's common stock issued in connection with the merger, which are
    assumed to be outstanding for the respective periods presented.

   UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

                      FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000

                (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)

1. PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS

(a) In connection with the acquisition of Ficon by GlobeSpan, 773,760 shares of
    restricted common stock were issued to Ficon employees and its principal
    shareholder, contingent upon continued employment with the merged companies.
    GlobeSpan recorded deferred compensation of approximately $29,522 which is
    being amortized as compensation expense over the vesting period, generally
    three years, in accordance with EITF 95-8, "Accounting for contingent
    consideration Paid to Shareholders of an Acquired Enterprise in a Purchase
    Business Combination," or $801 per month. Such expense has been included as
    a pro forma adjustment.

    An additional 999,999 shares of common stock were issued upon completion of
    certain development activities as provided in the merger agreement.

(b) The pro forma adjustments relating to the acquisition of T.sqware reflect
    four months of amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2000,
    assuming the transaction had occurred on January 1, 2000. The value of the
    goodwill and intangible assets at January 1, 2000 would have been
    approximately $162,000. Goodwill and other intangible assets are being
    amortized over four years. Such amount approximates $13,669 for the four
    months prior to acquisition.

(c) The pro forma adjustments relating to the acquisition of iCompression
    reflect approximately six months of amortization expense for the year ended
    December 31, 2000, assuming the transaction had occurred on January 1, 2000.
    The value of the goodwill and intangible assets at January 1, 2000 would
    have been approximately $327,900. Goodwill and other intangible assets are
    being amortized over approximately four years. Such amount approximates
    $41,538 for the six months prior to acquisitions.

(d) The pro forma adjustment reflects approximately one month of amortization
    expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 relating to the Ficon
    acquisition assuming the transaction had occurred on January 1, 2000. The
    value of the goodwill and intangible assets at January 1, 2000 would have
    been approximately $34,100, including the effects of contingent
    consideration issued subsequent to the date of acquisition. Goodwill and
    other intangible assets are being amortized over the expected estimated
    period of benefit ranging from two to four years. Such amount would
    approximate $8,583, including the effects of the contingent consideration.

(e) In connection with the acquisition of assets of PairGain on February 24,
    2000, GlobeSpan (i) exchanged 3,243,591 shares of its common stock valued at
    $152,706, and (2) issued a $90,000 subordinated redeemable convertible note,
    which was redeemed during the third quarter of 2000. The redemption of the
    beneficial conversion feature resulted in GlobeSpan recording an
    extraordinary gain in an amount equal to the non-cash interest expense
    recorded on the note. The non-cash interest expense has not been eliminated
    form the pro forma statements.

    The value of intangible assets acquired from PairGain at January 1, 2000 was
    approximately $245,000, amortized over approximately four years. Such amount
    approximates $10,112 for two months through February 24, 2000, the date of
    acquisition.

(f) Represents the elimination of purchased in-process research and development
    recorded in connection with the acquisitions of T.sqware, iCompression and
    Ficon.

(g) The pro forma basic and diluted net loss per common share is computed by
    dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted
    average number of common shares outstanding, reflecting an additional
    3,214,298 shares of GlobeSpan's common stock issued in connection with its
    acquisition of T.sqware, iCompression and Ficon, such shares are assumed to
    be outstanding for the entire period.

                   VIRATA UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL DATA

    On April 27, 2000, Virata Corporation completed its acquisition of Inverness
Systems, Ltd. Under the terms of the merger agreement, 2,006,440 shares of
Virata common stock were exchanged for all of the outstanding capital stock of
Inverness. In addition, employee options to purchase shares of Inverness common
stock were exchanged for options to purchase 517,896 shares of Virata common
stock.

    On August 16, 2000, Virata completed its acquisition of Agranat
Systems, Inc. Under the terms of the merger agreement, 430,188 shares of Virata
common stock were exchanged for all of the outstanding capital stock of Agranat
Systems. In addition, employee options to purchase shares of Agranat Systems
common stock were exchanged for options to purchase 61,064 shares of Virata
common stock.

    On August 22, 2000, Virata completed its acquisition of Excess Bandwidth
Corporation. Under the terms of the merger agreement, 5,702,731 shares of Virata
common stock were exchanged for all of the outstanding capital stock of Excess
Bandwidth. In addition, options and warrants to purchase shares of Excess

599,553 shares of Virata common stock.

    The acquisitions have been accounted for as purchase business combinations
in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, "Business
Combinations" and accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the net
tangible and identifiable tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on
the closing dates. The allocations of the purchase price of all three
acquisitions to the net tangible and identifiable tangible assets and goodwill
were based on independent appraisals. The aggregate purchase price of the
acquisitions is as follows (in thousands):

    The valuations of intangible assets acquired were based on independent
appraisals. Assuming that the acquisitions had occurred on April 3, 2000, the
purchase price allocation would have been as follows:

                     DESCRIPTION OF GLOBESPAN CAPITAL STOCK

    The following description summarizes the material terms of GlobeSpan's
common stock. Because it is only a summary, it does not contain all of the
information that may be important to you. For a complete description, you should
refer to GlobeSpan's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and
Amended and Restated Bylaws, which are filed as exhibits to the registration
statement of which this document is a part.

    GlobeSpan's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes
GlobeSpan to issue 400,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. No
other classes of capital stock are authorized under GlobeSpan's Certificate of
Incorporation.

    As of November 2, 2001, there were 74,234,684 shares of common stock
outstanding that were held of record by approximately 835 stockholders, and no
shares of preferred stock were outstanding.

COMMON STOCK

    Holders of GlobeSpan common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all
matters to be voted upon by the stockholders. Holders of common stock are also
entitled to receive any dividends on a pro rata basis declared by GlobeSpan's
board of directors out of legally available funds. In the event of GlobeSpan's
liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of GlobeSpan common stock are
entitled to share on a pro rata basis in all assets remaining after payment of
liabilities. GlobeSpan's common stock has no preemptive or conversion rights or
other subscription rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions
applicable to GlobeSpan common stock. All outstanding shares of common stock are
fully paid and nonassessable.

PREFERRED STOCK

    GlobeSpan's board of directors has the authority to issue the preferred
stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and
restrictions of undesignated preferred stock, including dividend rights,
dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption,
redemption prices, liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting
any series. The GlobeSpan board of directors will have the authority to issue
the undesignated preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights,
preferences, privileges and restrictions of GlobeSpan preferred stock, including
dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of
redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences and the number of shares
constituting any series or the designation of such series, without further vote
or action by GlobeSpan's stockholders. The issuance of preferred stock may have
the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control without
further action by GlobeSpan's stockholders and may adversely affect the voting
and other rights of holders of GlobeSpan common stock. The issuance of preferred
stock with voting and conversion rights may adversely affect the voting power of
holders of our common stock, including the loss of voting control to others. At
present, GlobeSpan has no plans to issue any preferred stock.

WARRANTS

    In May 1999, GlobeSpan issued a warrant to purchase an aggregate of 450,000
share of GlobeSpan common stock, with a five year term expiring June 23, 2004,
at an exercise price determined as follows:

    - For the first 112,500 shares, the exercise price is $5.00 per share;

    - For the second 112,500 shares, the exercise price is $6.25 per share;

    - For the third 112,500 shares, the exercise price is $7.50 per share; and

    - For the remaining 112,500 shares, the exercise price is $8.75 per share.

    The foregoing warrant can either be exercised by payment for the underlying
shares in cash or by a net exercise.

ANTI-TAKEOVER EFFECTS OF DELAWARE LAW AND PROVISIONS OF GLOBESPAN'S AMENDED AND
RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS

    GlobeSpan's amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that
all stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called meeting and not by a
consent in writing. GlobeSpan's amended and restated certificate of
incorporation and bylaws provide that directors may be removed only for cause
and only upon the vote of 80% of GlobeSpan's outstanding shares. These
provisions of GlobeSpan's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and
bylaws could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or
prevent a change in control of GlobeSpan. These provisions are designed to
enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of
GlobeSpan's board of directors and in the policies formulated by the board of
directors and to discourage some types of transactions that may involve an
actual or threatened change of control of GlobeSpan. GlobeSpan's bylaws also
provide that a special meeting of stockholders may be called by the president or
upon the request of stockholders owning at least 25% of GlobeSpan's capital
stock.

EXCLUSION FROM SECTION 203 OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW

    Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law is a business
combination statute that generally prohibits an "interested stockholder,"
defined generally as a person beneficially owning 15% or more of a corporation's
voting stock or an affiliate or associate of such person, from engaging in a
"business combination," defined to include a variety of transactions, including
mergers and sales of 10% or more of a corporation's assets, with a Delaware
corporation for three years following the time at which this person became an
interested stockholder. This prohibition does not apply if:

    - the transaction resulting in a person becoming an interested stockholder,
      or the business combination, is approved by the board of directors of the
      corporation before the person becomes an interested stockholder;

    - the interested stockholder acquired 85% or more of the outstanding voting
      stock of the corporation in the same transaction that makes it an
      interested stockholder, excluding shares owned by persons who are both
      officers and directors of the corporation, and shares held by employee
      stock ownership plans; or

    - at or subsequent to the time the person becomes an interested stockholder,
      the business combination is approved by the corporation's board of
      directors and by the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the corporation's
      outstanding voting stock at an annual or special meeting, excluding shares
      owned by the interested stockholder.

    Section 203 permits the board of directors of a corporation to defend
against takeover attempts and could act as a deterrent to potential takeover
attempts as well. GlobeSpan's amended and restated certificate of incorporation
contains a provision electing that Section 203 not apply to GlobeSpan. By opting
out of Section 203, it will be easier for GlobeSpan to enter into transactions
with large stockholders without giving at least 66 2/3% of GlobeSpan's
stockholders the opportunity to approve the transaction.

    GlobeSpan's board has determined that it is in the best interests of
GlobeSpan not to deter its large stockholders from engaging in a business
combination with it and to ensure that it maintains maximum flexibility in
pursuing business opportunities, including opportunities with our current large
stockholders. GlobeSpan's waiver of Section 203 will make it easier for an
interested stockholder to engage in a business combination with GlobeSpan by
lowering the requirement of 66 2/3% approval of the disinterested stockholders
to a requirement that only a majority of all stockholders approve the
transaction. GlobeSpan's board of directors has determined that placing large
stockholders on an equal footing with potential outside acquirors is both in the
interests of GlobeSpan and its unaffiliated stockholders.

    Upon completion of the merger, holders of Virata common stock will become
entitled to receive GlobeSpan common stock. Both GlobeSpan and Virata are
corporations organized under the laws of the State of Delaware.

    The following is a summary of some material differences between the rights
of holders of GlobeSpan common stock and the holders of Virata common stock.

restated certificate of incorporation and the GlobeSpan bylaws, on the one hand,
and the Virata amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the Virata
bylaws, on the other hand. This summary is qualified by the full text of each
document. For information as to how to get those documents, see "Where You Can

    3.1  EXCHANGE RATIO.  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any holder of any Virata Capital Stock:

        (a) All shares of Virata Capital Stock that are held by Virata as
    treasury stock or that are owned by Virata, Globespan or any of their
    Subsidiaries (other than those held in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit
    of third parties) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be
    outstanding and shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist.

        (b) Subject to Sections 3.1(a) and 3.7, each outstanding share of Virata
    Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
    shall be converted into the right to receive 1.02 (the "EXCHANGE RATIO")
    fully paid and nonassessable shares of Globespan Common Stock (the "MERGER
    CONSIDERATION"). All of such shares of Globespan Common Stock shall be duly
    authorized and validly issued and free of preemptive rights, with no
    personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. At the Effective
    Time, all shares of Virata Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding and
    shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
    certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
    such shares of Virata Common Stock (a "VIRATA CERTIFICATE") shall thereafter
    cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Virata Common Stock,
    except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be issued in
    consideration therefor and any dividends or other distributions to which
    holders of Virata Common Stock become entitled all in accordance with this
    Article III upon the surrender of such Virata Certificate.

        (c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, there
    is a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up, stock
    dividend, combination or exchange of shares with respect to, or rights
    issued in respect of, Virata Common Stock or Globespan Common Stock, the
    Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted accordingly to provide to the holders of
    Virata Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this
    Agreement prior to such event.

        (d) Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub
    shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of
    common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

    3.2  STOCK OPTIONS, WARRANTS AND EQUITY-BASED AWARDS.  (a) Each option to
purchase Virata Common Stock (a "VIRATA STOCK OPTION") granted under Virata
Stock Plans which is outstanding

                                      A-7

immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, cease to
represent a right to acquire shares of Virata Common Stock and shall be
converted (as so converted, a "VIRATA CONVERTED OPTION") into an option to
purchase Globespan Common Stock (a "GLOBESPAN STOCK OPTION"), on the same terms
and conditions as were applicable under the Virata Stock Option; PROVIDED that
the number of shares of Globespan Common Stock subject to each such Virata
Converted Option shall be equal to the number of shares of Virata Common Stock
subject to the Virata Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up, if necessary, to the nearest whole
share of Globespan Common Stock, and such Virata Converted Option shall have an
exercise price per share (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the per
share exercise price specified in such Virata Stock Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the
case of any Virata Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code as of the
Effective Time applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the
Code, the exercise price, the number of shares subject to such option and the
terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. Similarly, each
restricted share of Virata Common Stock ("VIRATA RESTRICTED SHARES") outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted at the Effective Time
into a number of restricted shares of Globespan Common Stock multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio, subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the
Virata Restricted Shares.

    (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Globespan shall deliver
to the holders of Virata Converted Options appropriate notices setting forth
such holders' rights pursuant to the respective Virata Stock Plans and
agreements evidencing the grants of such Virata Converted Options and stating
that such Virata Converted Options and agreements have been assumed by Globespan
and shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the
adjustments required by this Section 3.2 after giving effect to the Merger and
the terms of the Virata Stock Plans).

    (c) Prior to the Effective Time, Virata shall take all action necessary in
order to adjust the Virata Converted Options in accordance with the terms of
this Section 3.2. At or prior to the Effective Time, Globespan shall reserve for
issuance a number of shares of Globespan Common Stock at least equal to the
number of shares of Globespan Common Stock that will be subject to Virata
Converted Options, the Virata Reserved Shares and the Virata Restricted Shares.
Immediately following the Effective Time, Globespan shall file a registration
statement on Form S-8 (or any successor, or if Form S-8 is not available, other
appropriate, forms) with respect to the shares of Globespan Common Stock subject
to Virata Converted Options, the Virata Reserved Shares and the Virata
Restricted Shares and shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such options remain
outstanding.

    3.3  EXCHANGE FUND.  Prior to the Effective Time, Globespan shall appoint
American Stock Transfer & Trust Co., or a commercial bank or trust company, or a
subsidiary thereof, reasonably acceptable to Virata, to act as exchange agent
hereunder for the purpose of exchanging Virata Certificates for the Merger
Consideration (the "EXCHANGE AGENT"). At or prior to the Effective Time,
Globespan shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of
holders of shares of Virata Common Stock, certificates representing the shares
of Globespan Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 3.1 in exchange for
outstanding shares of Virata Common Stock. Following the Effective Time,
Globespan agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent from time to time as
needed, cash sufficient to pay any amounts required under Section 3.5. Any cash
and certificates representing Globespan Common Stock deposited with the Exchange
Agent (including the proceeds from sales of Excess Shares in accordance with
Section 3.7) shall hereinafter be referred to as the "EXCHANGE FUND."

    3.4  EXCHANGE PROCEDURES.  Promptly after the Effective Time, Globespan
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of a Virata Certificate
(a) a letter of transmittal that shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title (if a change of title is requested by the holder of
the Virata Certificate on the transmittal letter) to the Virata Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper

                                      A-8

delivery of the Virata Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which letter
shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as Globespan or Virata
may reasonably specify (such letter to be reasonably acceptable to Virata and
Globespan prior to the Effective Time) and (b) instructions for effecting the
surrender of such Virata Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration,
together with any dividends and other distributions with respect thereto and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares. Upon surrender of a Virata Certificate to the
Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Virata
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (a) shares of
Globespan Common Stock representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of
shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.1 (after
taking into account all shares of Virata Common Stock then held by such holder)
and (b) a check in the amount equal to the cash that such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, including cash in
lieu of any fractional shares of Globespan Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.7
and dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 3.5. No interest will
be paid or will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to Section 3.5 or
Section 3.7. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Virata Common Stock that
is not registered in the transfer records of Virata, one or more shares of
Globespan Common Stock evidencing, in the aggregate, the proper number of shares
of Globespan Common Stock, a check in the proper amount of cash that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article III,
including cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Globespan Common Stock
pursuant to Section 3.7 and any dividends or other distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.5, shall be issued with respect to such
Virata Common Stock to such a transferee if the Virata Certificate is presented
to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid.

    3.5  DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES.  No dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Virata Certificate with respect to the shares of
Globespan Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon
surrender of such Virata Certificate, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
shares of Globespan Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to
Section 3.7 until such holder shall surrender such Virata Certificate in
accordance with Section 3.4. Subject to the effect of applicable law, following
surrender of any such Virata Certificate, there shall be paid to the record
holder thereof without interest, (a) promptly after the time of such surrender,
the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Globespan Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.7 and the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Globespan Common Stock and
(b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of Globespan
Common Stock.

    3.6  NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN VIRATA COMMON STOCK.  All shares of
Globespan Common Stock issued and cash paid upon conversion of shares of Virata
Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Article III (including any
cash paid pursuant to Section 3.5 or 3.7) shall be deemed to have been issued or
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Virata
Common Stock.

    3.7  NO FRACTIONAL SHARES OF GLOBESPAN COMMON STOCK.  No certificates or
scrip or shares of Globespan Common Stock representing fractional shares of
Globespan Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Virata Certificates, and such fractional share
interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a
stockholder of Globespan or a holder of shares of Globespan Common Stock. In
lieu of any such fractional share, each holder of shares of Virata Common Stock
that would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Globespan
Common Stock upon surrender of Virata Certificates

                                      A-9

(determined after taking into account all Virata Certificates delivered by such
holder) shall be paid, upon such surrender, cash (without interest) in an amount
equal to such holder's proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale
or sales in the open market by the Exchange Agent, on behalf of all such
holders, of the aggregate fractional Globespan Common Stock issued pursuant to
this Section 3.7. As soon as practicable following the Effective Date, the
Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (i) the number of full shares of
Globespan Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by Globespan over
(ii) the aggregate number of full shares of Globespan Common Stock to be
distributed to holders of Virata Common Stock (such excess, the "EXCESS
SHARES"), and the Exchange Agent, as agent for the former holders of Virata
Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at the prevailing prices on NASDAQ.
The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on NASDAQ
and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. All commissions,
transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the expenses
and compensation of the Exchange Agent, incurred in connection with such sale of
Excess Shares shall reduce, but not below zero, the amount of cash paid to
holders in respect of fractional shares. Until the net proceeds of such sale
have been distributed to the former holders of Virata Common Stock, the Exchange
Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for such former holders. As soon as
practicable after the determination of the amount of cash to be paid to such
former holders of Virata Common Stock in lieu of any fractional interests, the
Exchange Agent shall make available in accordance with this Agreement such
amounts to such former holders of Virata Common Stock.

    3.8  TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Virata Certificates one year after the
Effective Time shall, at Globespan's request, be delivered to Globespan or
otherwise on the instruction of Globespan, and any holders of Virata
Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall,
after such delivery, look only to Globespan for the Merger Consideration with
respect to the shares of Virata Common Stock formerly represented thereby to
which such holders are entitled pursuant to Sections 3.1 and 3.4, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Globespan Common Stock to which such holders are
entitled pursuant to Section 3.7 and any dividends or distributions with respect
to shares of Globespan Common Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant
to Section 3.5. Any such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by
holders of shares of Virata Common Stock immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity
shall, to the extent permitted by law, become the property of Globespan free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

    3.9  NO LIABILITY.  None of Globespan, Merger Sub, Virata or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration from
the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

    3.10  INVESTMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND.  The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Globespan on a daily basis;
provided that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable or the timing of the amounts payable to Virata stockholders pursuant to
the other provisions of this Article III. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall promptly be paid to Globespan.

    3.11  LOST CERTIFICATES.  If any Virata Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Virata Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Globespan, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Globespan may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Virata Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Virata Certificate the
Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Virata Common Stock formerly
represented thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Globespan Common
Stock, and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Globespan Common
Stock deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

                                      A-10

    3.12  WITHHOLDING RIGHTS.  Globespan shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code, or any provision of U.S. state or local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or paid over to or
deposited with the relevant Governmental Entity by Globespan, such amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Globespan.

    3.13  FURTHER ASSURANCES.  At and after the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub or
Virata, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do,
in the name and on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub or Virata,
any other actions and things necessary to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in Globespan or the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and
interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to
be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger.

    3.14  STOCK TRANSFER BOOKS.  The stock transfer books of Virata shall be
closed immediately upon the Effective Time, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Virata Common Stock thereafter on the
records of Virata. On or after the Effective Time, any Virata Certificates
presented to the Exchange Agent, Globespan or the Surviving Corporation for any
reason shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
with respect to the shares of Virata Common Stock formerly represented thereby
(including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Globespan Common Stock to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.7 and any dividends
or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 3.5).

    jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
    character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
    makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
    be so licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the
    aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Virata. True and complete
    copies of the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of Virata, as in
    effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made available
    by Virata to Globespan.

        (ii) Each Subsidiary of Virata (A) is duly organized and validly
    existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (B) is duly

    U.S. federal, state or local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
    property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and
    (C) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its
    properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted, in each
    case, except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Virata.

with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. As of the date of
this Agreement, except pursuant to the terms of options and stock issued
pursuant to Virata Stock Plans, Virata ESPP and the Virata Rights, Virata does
not have and is not bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants,
calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or
issuance of any shares of Virata Capital Stock or any other equity securities of
Virata or any securities of Virata representing the right to purchase or
otherwise receive any shares of Virata Capital Stock. As of September 28, 2001,

        (ii) Virata owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and
    outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of
    each Subsidiary of Virata, free and clear of any liens, pledges, charges,
    encumbrances and security interests whatsoever ("LIENS"), and all of such
    shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued
    and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no
    personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No Subsidiary of
    Virata has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants,
    calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase
    or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of
    such Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to purchase or
    otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity security
    of such Subsidiary. Section 4.1(b)(ii) of the Virata Disclosure Letter sets
    forth a list of each material investment of Virata in the equity (or any
    security convertible or exchangeable into equity) of any corporation, joint
    venture, partnership, limited liability company or other entity other than
    its Subsidiaries, which would be considered a Significant Subsidiary if such
    investment constituted control of such entity (each a "NON-SUBSIDIARY
    AFFILIATE").

    (c)  AUTHORITY; NO VIOLATION.  (i) Virata has full corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and
validly approved by the Board of Directors of Virata. The Board of Directors of

    its Subsidiaries or its Non-Subsidiary Affiliates under, any of the terms,
    conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of
    trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which
    Virata, any of its Subsidiaries or Non-Subsidiary Affiliates is a party, or
    by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound
    or affected, except (in the case of clause (B) above) for such violations,

    will not have a Material Adverse Effect on Virata or the Surviving
    Corporation.

(ii) though (v) above, "NECESSARY CONSENTS"), and (vi) such other consents,
approvals, filings and registrations the failure of which to obtain or make

Documents, including the Virata 2001 10-K and the Virata 10-Q, (i) complied in
all material respects as to form with the applicable requirements under the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (ii) as of its
filing date (except as amended or supplemented prior to the date hereof), did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; and each of the balance sheets contained in or incorporated by
reference into any such Virata SEC Document (including the related notes and
schedules thereto) fairly presents the financial position of the entity or
entities to which it relates as of its date, and each of the statements of
income and changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows or equivalent
statements in such Virata SEC Documents (including any related notes and
schedules thereto) fairly presents the results of operations, changes in

entity or entities to which it relates for the periods to which it relates, in
each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods
involved, except, in each case, as may be noted therein, subject to normal
year-end audit adjustments in the case of unaudited statements.

    (f)  ABSENCE OF UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES.  Except as disclosed in the audited
financial statements (or notes thereto) included in the Virata 2001 10-K, or in
the financial statements (or notes thereto) included in the Virata 10-Q, or in
the Virata SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof, neither Virata nor any
of its Subsidiaries had at July 1, 2001, or has incurred since that date through

statements of Virata and its Subsidiaries prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied.

    (g)  ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS.  (i) Since July 1, 2001, no event
or events have occurred that have had or would reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Virata.

        (ii) Since July 1, 2001, Virata and its Subsidiaries, taken together as
    a whole, have carried on their respective businesses in all material
    respects in the ordinary course consistent with past practice.

        (iii) Since July 1, 2001, Virata has not declared any dividends on
    Virata Common Stock.

    (h)  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.  There is no suit, action or proceeding or
investigation pending or, to the knowledge of Virata, threatened, against or
affecting Virata or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of Virata, any
basis for any such suit, action, proceeding or investigation that could,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Virata, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or
order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against Virata or its
Subsidiaries having, or that would reasonably be expected to have, any such
effect.

    (i)  COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW.  Virata and each of its Subsidiaries
hold all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the
lawful conduct of their respective businesses under and pursuant to each, and
have complied in all respects with and are not in default in any material
respect under any, applicable law, statute, order, rule or regulation of any
Governmental Entity relating to Virata or any of its Subsidiaries, except where
the failure to hold such license,

                                      A-14

franchise, permit or authorization or such noncompliance or default would not,
either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Virata.

    (j)  CONTRACTS.  (i) Neither Virata nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to or is bound by any contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding
(whether written or oral) (A) with respect to the employment of any directors,
officers or employees other than in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice, (B) which, upon the consummation or stockholder approval of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will (either alone or upon the
occurrence of any additional acts or events) result in any payment (whether of
severance pay or otherwise) becoming due from Globespan, Virata, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any officer or employee
thereof, (C) which is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item
601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) to be performed, entirely or in part,
after the date of this Agreement, or (D) which materially restricts the conduct
of any line of business by Virata or any Subsidiary thereof or, upon
consummation of the Merger, will materially restrict the ability of Globespan or
the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof to engage in any line of
business. Each contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type
described in this Section 4.1(j), whether or not set forth in the Virata
Disclosure Letter or in the Virata SEC Documents, is referred to herein as a
"VIRATA CONTRACT" (for purposes of clarification, each "material contract" (as
such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) to be
performed, entirely or in part, after the date of this Agreement, whether or not
filed with the SEC, is a Virata Contract).

        (ii) (A) Each Virata Contract is valid and binding on Virata and any of
    its Subsidiaries that is a party thereto, as applicable, and in full force
    and effect, (B) Virata and each of its Subsidiaries has in all material
    respects performed all obligations required to be performed by it to date
    under each Virata Contract, except where such noncompliance, either
    individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
    Material Adverse Effect on Virata, and (C) neither Virata nor any of its
    Subsidiaries knows of, or has received notice of, the existence of any event
    or condition which constitutes, or, after notice or lapse of time or both,
    will constitute, a material default on the part of Virata or any of its
    Subsidiaries under any such Virata Contract, except where such default,
    either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
    have a Material Adverse Effect on Virata.

    (k)  ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY.  There are no legal, administrative, arbitral
or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private environmental
investigations or remediation activities or governmental investigations of any
nature seeking to impose, or that could reasonably result in the imposition of,
on Virata or any of its Subsidiaries, any liability or obligation arising under
common law or under any U.S. federal, state or local environmental statute,
regulation or ordinance, including CERCLA, pending or, to the knowledge of
Virata, threatened, against Virata or any of its Subsidiaries, which liability
or obligation, either individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Virata. To the knowledge of
Virata, there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or
governmental investigation that would impose any liability or obligation that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Virata. Neither Virata nor any of its Subsidiaries is
subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or
with any Governmental Entity or third party imposing any liability or obligation
with respect to the foregoing that, either individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Virata.

    (l)  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS; LABOR MATTERS.  (i) There does not now exist
any, and to the knowledge of Virata, there are no existing circumstances that
could reasonably be expected to result in, any Controlled Group Liability to
Virata or any of its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Virata. No Virata
Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3)
of ERISA.

                                      A-15

        (ii) Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
    aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Virata, (A) each of the
    Virata Benefit Plans has been operated and administered in all material
    respects in accordance with applicable law and administrative rules and
    regulations of any Governmental Entity, including, but not limited to, ERISA
    and the Code, and (B) there are no pending or threatened claims (other than
    claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that
    have been asserted or instituted, and, to the knowledge of Virata, no set of
    circumstances exists, that may reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit,
    against the Virata Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to
    their duties to the Virata Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts
    under any of the Virata Benefit Plans that could reasonably be expected to
    result in any material liability of Virata or any of its Subsidiaries to the
    Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the U.S. Department of the Treasury,
    the U.S. Department of Labor, any Virata Benefit Plan, any participant in a
    Virata Benefit Plan, or any other party.

        (iii) Neither Virata nor any Subsidiary of Virata is a party to any
    collective bargaining or other labor union contract applicable to
    individuals employed by Virata or any Subsidiary of Virata, and no
    collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract is being
    negotiated by Virata or any Subsidiary of Virata. Except as would not
    reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Virata,
    (x) there is no labor dispute, strike, slowdown or work stoppage against
    Virata or any Subsidiary of Virata pending or, to the knowledge of Virata,
    threatened against Virata or any Subsidiary of Virata and (y) no unfair
    labor practice or labor charge or complaint has occurred with respect to
    Virata or any Subsidiary of Virata.

        (iv) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
    consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in
    conjunction with any other event) will (A) result in any payment or benefit
    (including, without limitation, option acceleration, severance, unemployment
    compensation, "excess parachute payment" (within the meaning of
    Section 280G of the Code), forgiveness of indebtedness or otherwise)
    becoming due to any director or any employee of Virata or any Subsidiaries
    of Virata under any Virata Benefit Plan or otherwise; (B) increase any
    benefits otherwise payable under any Virata Benefit Plan; (C) result in any
    acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits;
    (D) require the funding of any trust or other funding vehicle; or (E) limit
    or prohibit the ability to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of
    assets from any Virata Benefit Plan or related trust.

        (v) There has been no disallowance of a deduction, or reasonable
    expectation of a disallowance of a deduction, under Section 162(m) of the
    Code for employee compensation of any amount paid or payable by Virata or
    any Subsidiary of Virata that, either individually or in the aggregate,
    would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Virata.

        (vi) Section 4.1(l)(vi) of the Virata Disclosure Letter sets forth a
    list of each material Virata Benefit Plan.

        (vii) Virata has heretofore made available to Globespan true and
    complete copies of each of the Virata Benefit Plans and (i) the actuarial
    report for such Virata Benefit Plan (if applicable) for each of the last two
    years, (ii) the most recent determination letter from the Internal Revenue
    Service (if applicable) for such Virata Benefit Plan, (iii) the summary plan
    description for such Virata Benefit Plan (if any), and (iv) the Form 5500
    for such Virata Benefit Plan (if applicable) for each of the last two years.

        (viii) Each Virata Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under
    Section 401 of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from
    the Internal Revenue Service as to the qualification of such plan, and such
    letter has not been modified, revoked or limited by the failure to satisfy
    any condition thereof or by a subsequent amendment thereto, or failure to
    amend such Virata Benefit Plan.

                                      A-16

        (ix) Except as, either individually or in the aggregate, would not
    reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Virata, no
    individual who has been classified by Virata as a non-employee (such as an
    independent contractor, leased employee or consultant) shall have a claim
    against Virata for eligibility to participate in any Virata Benefit Plan, if
    such individual is later reclassified as a Virata employee.

        (x) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
    expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Virata, all Virata Benefit
    Plans subject to the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the United States
    (i) have been maintained in accordance with all applicable requirements,
    (ii) if they are intended to qualify for special tax treatment meet all
    requirements for such treatment, and (iii) if they are intended to be funded
    and/or book-reserved are fully funded and/or book reserved, as appropriate,
    based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions.

        (xi) Virata has taken all action necessary such that the Virata Salary
    Continuation and Benefit Plan is not a benefit available to current Virata
    employees and no current Virata employees are entitled to any payments or
    other benefits under the Virata Salary Continuation and Benefit Plan.

    (m)  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.  (i) Except as would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Virata, (A) Virata and its Subsidiaries
own, or are licensed to use, all Intellectual Property used in and necessary for
the conduct of their business as it is currently conducted ("VIRATA INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY"), (B) to the knowledge of Virata, the business and operations of
Virata and its Subsidiaries as they are currently conducted does not infringe on
or otherwise violate the rights of any third party, and, to the extent Virata
Intellectual Property is licensed, Virata's use of the Intellectual Property is
in accordance in all material respects with the applicable license pursuant to
which Virata acquired the right to use such Intellectual Property, (C) to the
knowledge of Virata, no third party is challenging, infringing on or otherwise
violating any right of Virata in the Intellectual Property, (D) neither Virata
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice of any pending
claim, order or
