Based
on the maximum number of shares of divine class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share, that divine may be required to issue in the merger, calculated as the
product of (a) 24,975,637, which is the sum of (i) the aggregate number of outstanding shares of common stock, $0.001 par value, of Eprise Corporation on October 1, 2001 and
(ii) the aggregate number of shares of Eprise common stock issuable pursuant to all outstanding and committed employee and director stock options and warrants, multiplied by (b) the
exchange ratio of 2.4233 shares of divine common stock for each share of Eprise common stock. 
(2)
Estimated
solely for the purpose of calculating the registration fee pursuant to Rule 457(f)(1) and Rule 457(c) on the basis of the market value of the shares of
Eprise common stock to be exchanged in the merger, as the product of (a) $0.90 (the average of the high and low sales prices per share of Eprise common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National
Market on October 3, 2001), multiplied by (b) 24,975,637, which is the estimated maximum number of shares of Eprise common stock that may be cancelled in the merger. 
(3)
Each
share of divine class A common stock is accompanied by a series A junior participating preferred stock purchase right that trades with the divine common stock. The value
attributed to those rights, if any, is reflected in the market price of the divine common stock. Prior to the occurrence of certain events, none of which has occurred as of this date, the rights will
not be exercisable or evidenced separately from the divine common stock. 

The Registrant hereby amends this Registration Statement on such date or dates as may be necessary to delay its effective
date until the Registrant shall file a further amendment which specifically states that this Registration Statement shall thereafter become effective in accordance with Section 8(a) of the Securities
Act of 1933 or until the Registration Statement shall become effective on such date as the Securities and Exchange Commission, acting pursuant to said Section 8(a), may determine.  

The information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus is not complete and may be changed. We may not sell these securities until the registration statement filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission is effective. This proxy statement/prospectus is not an offer to sell, and it is not soliciting any offer to buy, these securities in any state where the offer
or sale is not permitted.

SUBJECT TO COMPLETIONDATED OCTOBER 9, 2001  

PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS 

The Proposed MergerYour Vote is Important  

    divine, inc. and Eprise Corporation have agreed on a transaction whereby divine will acquire Eprise in a stock-for-stock
transaction. The transaction is structured as a merger in which a newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of divine will be merged into Eprise. If we complete the merger, you will receive 2.4233 shares
of divine class A common stock for each share of Eprise common stock that you own. 

    divine's
class A common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "DVIN." On            , 2001, the closing sale price of
divine's class A common stock was $   . 

    We
cannot complete the merger unless the Eprise stockholders adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger. A special meeting for that purpose has been scheduled for Eprise
stockholders to vote on the merger. This proxy statement/prospectus provides you with detailed information about the proposed merger and the special meeting. 
Please read this
entire document carefully, including the "Risk Factors" section beginning on page 25, which discusses the potential risks involved in the merger, in the operation of the combined company and in
owning divine class A common stock.  

    Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares you own. Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting, please take the time to vote
(1) by completing and mailing the enclosed proxy card to us, (2) by telephone or (3) over the Internet. If you sign, date and mail your proxy card without indicating how you want
to vote, we will count your proxy as a vote in favor of approving and adopting the merger agreement, the merger and any other proposal properly submitted to stockholders at the meeting. If you
abstain, do not vote or do not instruct your broker how to vote any shares your broker holds for you in its name, the effect will be a vote against approval and adoption of the merger agreement and
the merger. Returning your proxy card or voting by telephone or over the Internet will not affect your right to vote in person if you choose to attend the special meeting. 

    The
date, time and place of the special meeting is as follows:

proxy card, telephone, over the Internet or at the special meeting, or fail to instruct your broker how to vote any shares your broker holds for you in its name, or if you abstain, it will have the
same effect as voting against the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger. You can revoke your proxy in the manner described in this proxy statement/prospectus at any time before

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT
  THE PROPOSED MERGER    

Q:
Why are the two companies proposing to merge?

A:
The
products and services offered by the companies are generally complementary, and we expect that the acquisition of Eprise by divine will provide our combined enterprise
significant potential advantages and resources, including a more diversified portfolio of products and services. We believe that the proposed merger will allow us to accelerate long-term
growth and provide added stockholder value. Achieving these anticipated benefits, however, is subject to certain risks discussed in "Risk Factors" beginning on page 25. To review the reasons
for the acquisition in greater detail, see "The MergerReasons for the Merger" beginning on page 51.

Q:
How will I benefit?

A:
We
believe that you will benefit by being an owner of a company that is able to compete more effectively than either divine or Eprise individually.

Q:
What will happen in the merger?

A:
A
newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of divine will merge into Eprise. As a result, Eprise will survive as a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine.

Q:
What will I receive in the merger?

A:
If
we complete the merger, you will receive 2.4233 shares of divine class A common stock in exchange for each share of Eprise common stock that you own. In this proxy
statement/prospectus, all references to divine common stock are to divine class A common stock along with the right to purchase divine's series A junior participating preferred stock
under divine's stockholders' rights plan. There are currently no other classes of divine common stock outstanding. 

Example: If you own 1,000 shares of Eprise common stock at the time we complete the merger, you will be entitled to receive 2,423 shares of divine common
stock.

Q:
What happens as the market price of divine common stock fluctuates?

A:
The
exchange ratio, and therefore the number of shares of divine common stock that you will receive in the merger, is fixed and will not be adjusted in the event of any increase or
decrease in the price of divine common stock. Therefore, the value of the divine common stock you will receive in the merger will fluctuate as the price of divine common stock increases or decreases.
You should obtain a current market quotation for divine common stock before voting on the merger.

Q:
Will divine issue fractional shares?

A:
divine
will not issue fractional shares. Instead, any holder of Eprise common stock that would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a divine share in the merger will
receive a number of divine shares rounded up or down to the nearest whole number (with fractions equal to or greater than 0.5 being rounded up). 

Q:
What do I need to do now?

A:
After
carefully reviewing and considering this proxy statement/prospectus, you should submit your proxy by mail, by telephone or over the Internet before the special meeting so that
your shares are represented at the special meeting. You may also attend the special meeting scheduled to take place on             , 2001. The board of directors of Eprise unanimously
recommends
voting in favor of the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger.

Q:
What stockholder vote is required to approve the merger?

A:
The
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Eprise common stock outstanding as of the record date,             , 2001, is required to adopt and approve the merger
agreement and the merger.

Q:
How can I vote my shares without attending the special meeting?

A:
You
may vote your shares without attending the special meeting by granting a proxy to us. You can do this:


by
mailif you vote by mail, complete, sign and date your enclosed proxy card and mail it using the enclosed postage paid envelope; or


by
telephone or Internetif you vote by telephone or over the Internet, you will be required to have the control number appearing on your proxy
card available to submit your vote. A properly completed telephone or Internet vote has the same effect as if you marked, signed and returned the proxy card by mail. See the instructions on the proxy
card for a detailed description of telephone and Internet voting procedures. 

Q:
If my Eprise shares are held in "street name" by my broker, will my broker vote my shares for me?

A:
Your
broker will only vote your shares if you provide instructions on how to vote. You should follow the directions provided by your broker regarding how to instruct your broker to
vote your shares. If you do not provide instructions to your broker on how to vote your
shares, they will not be voted. This will have the same effect as voting against the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger.

Q:
What if I don't vote by proxy or at the special meeting or I abstain?

A:
If
you fail to vote by proxy or at the special meeting or abstain from voting, it will have the same effect as a vote against the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and
the merger.

Q:
Can I change my vote after I have mailed a signed proxy card or voted by telephone or over the Internet?

A:
If
you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke a previously-granted proxy and change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the special meeting in one of the
following ways:


by
delivering a written notice to Eprise's Investor Relations office that states you would like to revoke your proxy; 


by
delivering a later-dated proxy card by mail;


by
telephone or over the Internet as set forth in the instructions provided along with your proxy card; or


by
attending the special meeting and voting in person (merely attending the meeting will not revoke your previously-granted proxy and change your vote; you
must cast a vote at the special meeting). 

For
shares held in the name of a bank, broker or other fiduciary, you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to the bank, broker or other fiduciary. 

Q:
What if I receive more than one proxy card?

A:
It
may mean that your shares are registered in different ways or are in more than one account. Please provide voting instructions for all proxy cards you receive to ensure that all
of your shares are voted at the meeting.

Q:
Should I send in my Eprise stock certificate now?

A:
No.
After we complete the merger, Computershare Trust Company of New York, the exchange agent, will send you written instructions for exchanging your Eprise stock certificates for
divine stock certificates.

Q:
When do you expect to complete the merger?

A:
We
expect to complete the merger as quickly as possible after the special meeting.

Q:
What are the tax consequences of the merger?

A:
You
generally will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on the exchange of Eprise common stock for divine common stock. To review the tax consequences to
Eprise stockholders in greater detail, see "The MergerMaterial United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" beginning on page 66. The tax consequences to each of you will depend
on your particular situation. You should therefore consult your own tax advisor for an understanding of the tax consequences to you resulting from the merger.

Q:
What will happen to Eprise if we do not complete the merger?

A:
If
we do not complete the merger, Eprise may be required under certain circumstances to pay divine a termination fee. In addition, significant merger-related costs incurred by
Eprise, such as legal, accounting and financial advisor fees, must be paid by Eprise if we do not complete the merger. Also, the price of Eprise common stock may decline to the extent that its current
market price reflects a market assumption that we will complete the merger. Eprise is not currently in compliance with the Nasdaq National Market's listing maintenance requirements and may be delisted
from the Nasdaq National Market if the merger is not completed. On September 27, 2001, Nasdaq announced that it had suspended until January 2, 2002 its $1.00 minimum bid price
requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq National Market. 

Q:
Who can I call with questions?

A:
If
you would like additional copies of this proxy statement/prospectus or the enclosed proxy card, or, if you have questions about the merger, the special meeting, or how to vote by
proxy, you should contact one of the following:

SUMMARY    

For your convenience, we have provided a brief summary of certain information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus. This
summary highlights selected information from this document and does not contain all of the information that is important to you. To understand the merger fully and for a more complete description of
the legal terms of the merger, you should read carefully this entire document and the documents we have referred you to, including the divine documents incorporated by reference and the merger
agreement, which we have attached as Appendix A. You should also see "Where You Can Find More Information" on page 127. We have included page references parenthetically to direct you to
more complete descriptions of the topics presented in the summary.  

 The Companies  

divine, inc. 
(page 91) 

    divine
provides a combination of Web-based technology, professional services and managed applications capabilities designed to allow clients to deploy advanced enterprise
Web solutions that are integrated with their business strategies and existing software and technical systems. divine's enterprise Web solutions offer businesses the ability to improve collaboration,
workflow and business relationships. divine provides these solutions and managed applications through its four business units: 


Enterprise
Portal Solutions;


Software

Professional
Services; and

Applications. 

    divine
maintains its principal offices at 1301 North Elston Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60622, telephone (773) 394-6600. See "divine's Recent Developments"
for a discussion of recent events intended to further divine's business strategy. 

Eprise Corporation
 (page 97) 

    Eprise
provides software products and design and consulting services that enable businesses to create and publish effective Web content quickly and easily. Its core product, Eprise
Participant Server, enables a business organization to distribute this Web content management function among the appropriate individuals within the enterprise who have responsibility for particular
aspects of that Web content. These individuals need no knowledge of programming languages or other technical skills to use Eprise Participant Server, thereby minimizing a customer's reliance on
information technology professionals and consultants. Eprise targets customers in a broad spectrum of industries, including the financial services, technology, and manufacturing industries. Eprise
currently sells its products primarily in the United States. Eprise maintains its principal offices at 200 Crossing Boulevard, Framingham, Massachusetts 01702, telephone (508) 661-5200. 

Our Reasons for the Merger
 (page 51) 

    divine
and Eprise believe that the proposed merger will provide each company with the complementary strengths and resources of the other and will enable the combined company to 

address strategic opportunities more effectively. For example, the combination of Eprise's content management software, in particular Eprise Participant Server, with divine's software applications and
sales and marketing infrastructure should enable the combined company to
further its strategy of providing Web-based technology, professional services, and managed applications that help global enterprises conveniently and cost-effectively manage
information resources and engage their constituencies. 

Recommendation of the Eprise Board of Directors
 (page 46) 

    The
Eprise board unanimously recommends that you vote 
FOR
 the proposal to adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger. 

The Eprise Special Meeting  

 Time, Place, Date and Purpose
 (page 46) 

    The
special meeting of Eprise stockholders will be held on             , 2001, at 10:00 a.m. local time at the offices of Hill & Barlow, One International Place, Boston,
Massachusetts. The purpose of the special meeting is to vote upon the proposal to adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger. You may also vote upon such other matters as may be properly
brought before the Eprise special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting. 

 Record Date and Vote Required
 (page 46) 

    Only
Eprise stockholders of record at the close of business on the record date,             , 2001, are entitled to vote at the special meeting. The affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares of Eprise common stock outstanding as of the record date is required to adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger. At the close of business on the record date, there
were         shares of Eprise's common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Eprise special meeting, approximately   % of which were held by directors
and executive officers of Eprise and their affiliates. These directors and executive officers have indicated their intention to vote, or cause to be voted, the shares beneficially owned by them in
favor of the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger. 

Dissenters' Rights
 (page 65) 

    You
are not entitled to dissenters' rights or appraisal rights under the Delaware General Corporation Law in connection with the merger. 

The Merger  

    The merger agreement is attached as Appendix A to this proxy statement/prospectus. We encourage you to read the merger agreement because it is the legal
document that governs the merger. If the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Eprise common stock adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger and all other conditions to the
merger are satisfied or waived, DI2 Acquisition Company will merge into Eprise. As a result, Eprise will survive as a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine. 

 What You Will Receive 
(pages 64 and 68) 

    If
we complete the merger, each outstanding share of Eprise common stock will be exchanged for 2.4233 shares of divine common stock. The value of the divine shares you will receive in
the merger will fluctuate as the market price of divine common stock changes. As of October 1, 2001, divine had approximately 164,124,076 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.
Based upon 22,270,386 shares of Eprise common stock issued and outstanding as of October 1, 2001 and the 2.4233 exchange ratio, divine will issue an aggregate of approximately 53,968,000 shares
of divine common stock to holders of Eprise common stock following the merger. As a result, following completion of the merger, and assuming divine does not issue any additional shares of its common
stock (in other pending mergers or otherwise), Eprise stockholders would own approximately 24.7% of the issued and outstanding shares of divine's common stock. Assuming that divine
(1) completes its pending mergers with RoweCom Inc., eshare communications, Inc. and Open Market, Inc. (which are discussed under "divine's Recent
Developments"), (2) issues 10,164,558 shares of divine common stock pursuant to the RoweCom merger, (3) issues approximately 68,435,596 shares of divine common stock pursuant to
the eshare merger (based upon approximately 21,934,486 eshare common shares issued and outstanding and an eshare exchange ratio of 3.12 as of October 1,
2001), (4) issues 44,454,961 shares of divine common stock pursuant to the Open Market merger and (5) does not issue any other shares of divine common stock prior to the closing
of this merger, Eprise stockholders would own approximately 15.8% of the issued and outstanding shares of divine's common stock after the merger. 

 Treatment of Outstanding Options and Purchase Rights
 (page 69) 

    Each
outstanding option to purchase shares of Eprise common stock under Eprise's stock option plans with an exercise price that, when divided by 2.4233, is greater than the closing
sale price of divine common stock on the trading day immediately prior to the completion of the merger, will become exercisable at an exercise price equal to such closing sale price of divine common
stock, for a number of shares of divine common stock equal to the number of shares of Eprise common stock subject to the Eprise option. Each outstanding Eprise option with an exercise price that, when
divided by 2.4233, is less than or equal to the closing sale price of divine common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the completion of the merger, will become exercisable at an exercise
price equal to the exercise price of the Eprise option divided by 2.4233, for a number of shares of divine common stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of Eprise common stock subject to
such Eprise option by 2.4233. As of October 1, 2001, Eprise had outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of approximately 1,799,800 shares of Eprise common stock, with exercise prices
ranging from $0.255 to $17.75. 

    The
merger agreement also provides that divine will assume each promise by Eprise to grant stock options in connection with its stock option exchange program. Upon completion of the
merger, divine will grant to each such promisee a substitute option to purchase the number of shares of divine common stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of Eprise common stock
subject to such promise by 2.4233 (rounded to the nearest full share), at an exercise price equal to the closing sale price of divine common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the
completion of the merger. Under the stock option exchange program, which terminated on June 8, 2001, Eprise accepted for exchange Eprise options to purchase an aggregate of approximately
551,000 shares of Eprise common stock. 

    Upon the completion of the merger, each right to purchase shares of Eprise common stock that is outstanding and unexercised under the Eprise 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan will be
converted into a right to purchase divine shares under divine's 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan in accordance with the terms thereof. 

 Treatment of Outstanding Warrants
 (page 70) 

    Each
outstanding warrant to purchase shares of Eprise common stock will become a warrant to purchase a number of shares of divine common stock at an exercise price as determined in
accordance with the terms of such warrant. As of October 1, 2001, Eprise had outstanding warrants to purchase (1) approximately 128,000 shares of Eprise common stock at an exercise price
of $1.27 per share, and (2) approximately 226,000 shares of Eprise common stock at an exercise price of $3.93 per share. Upon completion of the merger, the first warrant will convert into a
warrant to purchase approximately 310,700 shares of divine common stock at an exercise price of approximately $0.52 per share. The second warrant will terminate if it is not exercised before the
completion of the merger. 

 Opinion of Eprise's Financial Advisor 
(page 54) 

    Broadview
International LLC, Eprise's financial advisor, delivered its opinion to the Eprise board on September 17, 2001, that the consideration to be received in the merger by
holders of Eprise common stock is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The full text of the Broadview opinion is attached as Appendix B. You should read the Broadview opinion
in its entirety. The Broadview opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how you should vote with respect to the merger. 

 Conditions to the Merger 
(page 74) 

    The
completion of the merger depends upon the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including, among others: 


the
Eprise stockholders must adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger, and divine's stockholders must approve the issuance of divine common
stock to you, if required by the rules of Nasdaq;


the
registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part must not be subject to a stop order or proceeding seeking a stop order;


no
law, injunction, or order preventing the completion of the merger may be in effect;


no
breach of a representation or warranty resulting in a material adverse effect on either divine or Eprise may have occurred that has not been waived;


the
shares of divine common stock to be issued to you under the merger agreement must be authorized for listing on the Nasdaq National Market;


if
the merger is completed after December 31, 2001 and divine does not then satisfy the maintenance criteria of the Nasdaq National Market (or any
other requirements set forth in a letter from the Nasdaq National Market to divine regarding the possible delisting of divine's common stock), there shall then remain at least 45 calendar days before
the date, if any, specified by the Nasdaq National Market in a notice to divine upon which date divine's common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq National 

Market
if divine shall have not then satisfied the criteria of the Nasdaq National Market necessary to maintain the listing of its common stock on the Nasdaq National Market, unless that notice is
subsequently withdrawn, suspended or revoked; and 


Eprise
must have received a written opinion from its tax counsel, and divine must have received a written opinion from its tax counsel if divine's
stockholders must approve the issuance of divine common stock to the Eprise stockholders under the rules of Nasdaq, to the effect that the merger will constitute a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code for federal income tax purposes, and that opinion must not be withdrawn. 

 Termination 
(page 76) 

    divine
and Eprise can jointly terminate the merger agreement at any time before completing the merger, even if Eprise stockholders have approved the merger. Either of divine or Eprise
can also terminate the merger agreement if: 


we
do not complete the merger before December 31, 2001 (subject to extension under certain circumstances);


a
governmental or legal restraint does not permit completion of the merger;


Eprise
stockholders do not adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger at the special meeting; provided, however, Eprise does not have the right
to terminate under these circumstances if it has violated its non-solicitation covenant contained in the merger agreement or its board has withdrawn its recommendation of the merger. See "The Merger
AgreementCovenants and AgreementsNo Solicitation of Alternative Transactions."


the
other party materially breaches its representations, warranties or covenants in the merger agreement and such breach has not been, or cannot be, cured
within 20 business days of the other party receiving notice of the breach; or


the
approval of divine's stockholders is needed in order for divine to issue shares of its common stock to you in order to complete the merger, and that
approval is not obtained. 

    In
addition, divine may terminate the merger agreement without completing the merger if: 


Eprise's
board of directors or a committee of the board withdraws or modifies its approval or recommendation of the merger;


in
response to a third-party tender offer or exchange offer, Eprise takes any action other than rejection of the offer;


Eprise's
board of directors recommends an alternative acquisition proposal to you;


Eprise
or any of its officers or directors enters into discussions or negotiations regarding an alternative acquisition proposal in violation of the merger
agreement;


Eprise
enters into an agreement regarding, or consummates, an acquisition transaction with a party other than divine; or


the
Eprise board of directors resolves to do any of the foregoing. 

    Further,
Eprise may terminate the merger agreement without completing the merger if: 


the
approval of divine's stockholders is needed in order for divine to issue shares of its common stock to you to complete the merger and the board of
directors of divine, or any committee thereof, shall have withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Eprise its approval or recommendation of the merger or the merger agreement; or


prior
to the adoption of the merger agreement by Eprise's stockholders and after giving notice to divine as specified in the merger agreement, Eprise is in
active negotiations, or executes a definitive agreement, with respect to an alternative acquisition proposal that Eprise determines in good faith has a reasonable likelihood of closing on terms more
favorable to you than the merger. 

    If
we do not consummate the merger, except under the circumstances described below in "Termination Fee," all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger
agreement and the transactions it contemplates will be paid by the party incurring those expenses. If we complete the merger, divine will pay all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
merger agreement and the transactions it contemplates. 

 Termination Fee 
(page 77) 

    Eprise
has agreed to pay divine a termination fee of $2,000,000 if the merger agreement is terminated by: 


divine
or Eprise because the merger is not completed by December 31, 2001, because Eprise receives, or a third party publicly announces, an
alternative acquisition proposal and within one year of the termination of the merger agreement either an alternative transaction is consummated or Eprise enters into a definitive agreement to
consummate an alternative transaction;


divine
or Eprise because (1) an alternative acquisition proposal, or the intention or desire to make an alternative acquisition proposal, is
received by you, or otherwise publicly announced by a third party or Eprise, (2) the alternative acquisition proposal or intention or desire is not withdrawn prior to the special meeting,
(3) the Eprise stockholders do not adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger, and (4) within one year of the termination of the merger agreement, an alternative transaction
is consummated or Eprise enters into a definitive agreement to consummate an alternative transaction;


divine
because (1) an alternative acquisition proposal, or the intention or desire to make an alternative acquisition proposal, is received by you,
or otherwise publicly announced by a third party or Eprise, (2) the alternative acquisition proposal or intention or desire is not withdrawn prior to the special meeting, (3) Eprise
shall have breached or failed to perform any of the covenants or other agreements in the merger agreement or any representation or warranty of Eprise shall have become untrue such that, in either
case, certain conditions to the merger would not be satisfied, and that breach or failure to be true has not been or is not capable of being cured within 20 business days following receipt by Eprise
of notice of such failure or breach, and (4) within one year of the termination of the merger agreement, an alternative transaction is consummated or Eprise enters into a definitive agreement
to consummate an alternative transaction; 


Eprise
because prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by Eprise's stockholders and after giving notice to divine as specified in the merger
agreement, Eprise is in active negotiations, or executes a definitive agreement, with respect to an alternative acquisition proposal that Eprise determines in good faith has a reasonable likelihood of
closing on terms more favorable to you than the merger;


divine
because Eprise's board of directors or a committee of the board withdraws or modifies its approval or recommendation of the merger;


divine
because in response to a third-party tender offer or exchange offer, Eprise takes any action other than rejection of the offer;


divine
because Eprise's board of directors recommends an alternative acquisition proposal to you;


divine
because Eprise or any of its officers or directors enters into discussions or negotiations regarding an alternative acquisition proposal in
violation of the merger agreement; or


divine
because Eprise enters into an agreement regarding, or consummates, an acquisition transaction with a party other than divine. 

    divine
must pay Eprise a termination fee of $2,000,000 if Eprise terminates the merger agreement because the approval of divine's stockholders is needed in order for divine to issue
shares of its common stock to you in order to complete the merger, and divine's board of directors or a committee of the board withdraws or modifies its approval or recommendation of the merger. 

    If
the merger agreement is terminated (1) by either divine or Eprise because the approval of divine's stockholders is needed in order for divine to issue shares of its common
stock to you to complete the merger, and that approval is not obtained, or (2) by Eprise because divine breaches or fails to perform any of the covenants or other agreements contained in the
merger agreement, and that breach or failure to be true has not been or is incapable of being cured within 20 business days, then divine must pay Eprise's expenses incurred in connection with the
merger agreement, up to a maximum of $500,000. 

    If
the merger agreement is terminated (1) by either divine or Eprise because the stockholders of Eprise do not approve the merger at the special meeting, except in the case
where, within one year of the termination of the merger agreement, an alternative transaction is consummated or Eprise enters into a definitive agreement to consummate an alternative transaction, or
(2) by divine because Eprise breaches or fails to perform any of the covenants or other agreements contained in the merger agreement, and that breach or failure to be true has not been or is
incapable of being cured within 20 business days, then Eprise must pay divine's expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement, up to a maximum of $500,000. 

 Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger 
(page 63) 

    When
you consider the Eprise board's recommendation in favor of the merger, you should be aware that a number of Eprise directors and executive officers may have interests in the
merger that differ from, or are in addition to, your interests. In particular: 


all
of the options held by Eprise's directors and chief executive officer, whether or not vested, will vest and convert into fully exercisable options to
purchase shares of divine common stock upon completion of the merger. The number of divine shares underlying the options and the exercise prices will be determined as described above under
"Treatment of Outstanding Options." Vesting of the options held by Eprise's executive officers other than the chief executive officer, as well as options held by all other
employees, accelerates at the completion of the merger so that all options that would have vested on the next annual installment date shall become immediately exercisable. In addition, if any Eprise
executive officer experiences a material adverse change in position within one year after the merger, 50% of his or her then-unvested options will vest. Based upon divine's closing common stock price
of $0.55 on October 1, 2001, Eprise's directors and executive officers and their affiliates would receive options to purchase approximately 1,558,900 shares of divine common stock;


all
outstanding company loans to Eprise executive officers in connection with their exercise of stock options (including loans to pay federal alternative
minimum tax) will be forgiven if the merger is completed. As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, four Eprise executive officers had loans outstanding with an aggregate principal balance of
$919,900;


if
we complete the merger, the surviving corporation will honor existing indemnification obligations of Eprise, indemnify directors and officers of Eprise
or its subsidiaries for acts or omissions occurring prior to the merger and provide indemnification arrangements for Eprise's officers and directors that are at least as favorable as those in Eprise's
current certificate of incorporation and bylaws for a period of six years after the merger; and


if
we complete the merger, the surviving corporation will provide directors' and officers' liability insurance covering those persons who were covered by
Eprise's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy as of the date of the merger agreement. However, the surviving corporation will not be required to spend more than 150% of the annual
premium currently paid by Eprise for that coverage. 

 Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences 
(page 66) 

    You
generally will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on your exchange of Eprise common stock for divine common stock. Tax matters are very complicated,
and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on the facts of your particular situation. You are urged to consult your own tax advisor as to the specific tax consequences to you of the
merger, including the applicable federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences. 

 Accounting Treatment 
(page 63) 

    divine
will record the merger using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This means that for financial reporting
purposes, divine will treat both companies as one company beginning as of the date we complete the merger. In addition, under this method of accounting, divine will record the fair value of Eprise's
assets and liabilities on its consolidated financial statements, with the remaining purchase price in excess of the fair value of Eprise's net assets recorded as goodwill. 

 Regulatory Matters 
(page 64) 

    Currently,
neither divine nor Eprise is required to file any information with the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice under the provisions
of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, in connection with the merger. We are not aware of any other governmental approvals or actions that are required to
complete the merger other than compliance with federal securities laws and Delaware corporate law. 

 Comparison of Stockholders' Rights 
(page 120) 

    If
we complete the merger, you will become a stockholder of divine. divine's certificate of incorporation and bylaws differ from those of Eprise, and, as a result, you will have
different rights as a divine stockholder. In addition, divine has a stockholders' rights plan similar to Eprise's stockholder rights plan that entitles holders of its common stock, in certain
instances, to purchase shares of divine's series A junior participating preferred stock. 

Risk Factors
 (page 25) 

    This
merger and an investment in divine common stock by you involve certain risks and uncertainties, including risks related to the integration of our companies, risks associated with
a fixed exchange ratio and risks relating to the combined entity, including RoweCom, eshare and Open Market. See "Risk Factors" for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that you should consider
before you decide whether to approve the merger agreement and merger and thereby become a divine stockholder. 

divine's Recent Developments 
(page 93) 

    Since
July 1, 2001, divine has completed, or entered into agreements in connection with, a number of other acquisitions to further its business strategy. 

    On
July 6, 2001, divine entered into an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization with RoweCom Inc. RoweCom is a leading
business-to-business provider of high quality service and e-commerce solutions for purchasing and managing the acquisition of magazines, newspapers, journals and
e-journals, books and other printed sources of commercial, scientific and general interest information and analysis. RoweCom targets clients in knowledge-intense industries, such as
business and financial services; biomedical; academia and the federal government; and corporate and professional services. Under the terms of the RoweCom merger agreement, each of the approximately
13,552,745 outstanding shares of RoweCom common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.75 shares of divine common stock, and RoweCom will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine.
Completion of the RoweCom 

merger is subject to a number of conditions, including the approval of the RoweCom merger by RoweCom's stockholders and the satisfaction of certain financing conditions by RoweCom and its
subsidiaries. divine anticipates that RoweCom's content offerings and procurement technology will be key components of divine's enterprise portal solutions and international expansion. The special
meeting of RoweCom stockholders is scheduled to be held on October 25, 2001. 

 eshare Merger  

    On July 8, 2001, divine entered into an agreement and plan of merger with eshare communications, Inc., pursuant to which divine will acquire
eshare. eshare is a provider of customer interaction management, or CIM, software products and services. These CIM software applications enable eshare's customers to effectively manage new and
existing customers across multiple communications channels, including voice, email, interactive Web chat and voice-over-internet protocol. 

    Upon
completion of the eshare merger, each of the approximately 21.9 million outstanding shares of eshare common stock will be converted into the right to receive shares of
divine common stock as follows: 


If
the average closing price on the Nasdaq National Market of divine common stock for the ten trading days ending two trading days before the closing date
of the eshare merger, which we refer to as the divine average closing price, is greater than $2.39 but less than $2.82, then eshare shareholders will receive 1.30 shares of divine common stock for
each eshare common share they own;


If
the divine average closing price is $2.82 or greater, then eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare
common share they own equal to $3.653 divided by the divine average closing price; and


If
the divine average closing price is $2.39 or less, then eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare
common share they own equal to $3.12 divided by the greater of the divine average closing price or $1.00. 

If
pursuant to these adjustments, more than 28,546,506 shares of divine common stock are to be issued to eshare shareholders in the eshare merger, divine may elect to pay cash instead of any or all of
the excess shares in an amount per share equal to the divine average closing price. However, because divine and eshare intend for the merger to be a tax-free reorganization, divine will
not pay cash in excess of 50% of the total consideration paid to all eshare shareholders. Completion of the eshare merger depends on a number of conditions, including (1) approval by eshare
shareholders and, if necessary, divine stockholders and (2) expiration or termination of any waiting periods under any applicable antitrust laws. The special meetings of eshare shareholders and
divine stockholders are scheduled to be held on October 19, 2001. 

 Emicom Merger  

    On July 17, 2001, divine acquired 67% of the equity interests of Emicom Group, Inc. that divine did not already own in exchange for a total of
13.8 million shares of divine common stock. Emicom has been an associated company of divine since April 2000, when divine acquired a 33% interest in Emicom. Emicom is a technology
holding company that provides 

capital and advisory services to early-stage technology companies located in Israel. Emicom partners with privately-held technology-related companies in the telecommunications, cellular,
Internet infrastructure and enterprise software markets. At the time of the acquisition, Emicom held interests in four technology-related companies and had approximately $34 million in
uncommitted cash reserves. divine expects that Emicom will provide divine a base of operations in the Israeli high-tech market, a platform from which to expand an international customer
base and a channel for divine's expansion in Israel and Europe. 

 Intira Asset Acquisition  

    On July 29, 2001, divine entered into an agreement to purchase substantially all of the assets of Intira Corporation, subject to bankruptcy court
approval. Intira provides information technology and network infrastructure for online business applications and is based in Pleasanton, California. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, divine
will purchase substantially all of the assets of Intira for $1 million in cash, provide Intira with a $6.8 million debtor-in-possession credit facility and assume
certain obligations that divine intends to restructure on more favorable terms. divine expects that the acquisition of Intira's assets will expand divine's capabilities in its Managed Applications
business unit and provide opportunities for its other business units. 

 Fracta Networks Acquisition  

    In August 2001, divine acquired certain assets, subject to certain liabilities, of Fracta Networks, Inc., a provider of personal content
management solutions. Among the assets divine acquired was Fracta Networks' software, FractaNet, an application that allows users to easily capture portions of documents, spreadsheets or Web sites.
For these assets, divine issued warrants to purchase 1,000,000 shares of divine common stock. In addition, divine has agreed to grant Fracta Networks' continuing employees options to purchase 468,000
shares of divine common stock. 

 Open Market Merger  

    On August 15, 2001, divine entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Open Market, Inc., pursuant to which divine will acquire Open
Market. Open Market provides enterprise content management and delivery application software. Open Market's software solutions are designed to enable businesses and other organizations to use the
Internet to optimize interactions with their site visitors, employees, customers and distribution channels. 

    Upon
completion of the Open Market merger, each of the approximately 53.4 million outstanding shares of Open Market common stock will be converted into the right to receive
that number of shares of divine common stock equal to 44,285,714 divided by the total
number of shares of Open Market common stock deemed outstanding as of the closing of the merger, giving effect to the conversion of any then-outstanding shares of Open Market Series E preferred
stock but less shares of Open Market common stock issued after August 3, 2001 pursuant to Open Market's employee stock purchase plans and exercises of Open Market options and warrants. The
maximum Open Market exchange ratio will be 0.8394 and the minimum Open Market exchange ratio will be 0.8326. Completion of the Open Market merger depends on a number of conditions, including approval
by Open Market stockholders 

and divine stockholders. The special meetings of Open Market stockholders and divine stockholders are scheduled to be held on October 19, 2001. 

 marchFIRST GmbH iI Acquisition  

    In September 2001, divine entered into an agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of marchFIRST GmbH iI that comprised its former Munich
and Hamburg operations. divine has agreed to pay approximately DM 10.5 million (approximately US $4.9 million) for these assets. Upon completion of the acquisition, the
assets purchased from marchFIRST GmbH iI will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine under the name divine GmbH from offices in Munich and Hamburg. 

 Parlano Acquisition  

    On September 7, 2001, divine acquired from UBS AG a 21% equity interest in Parlano, Inc. in exchange for 3,596,007 shares of divine
common stock. Parlano has been an associated company of divine since February 2000, when divine acquired a 75% equity interest in Parlano. As a result of the acquisition, divine now owns approximately
96% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Parlano and intends to purchase the remaining interest in a short-form merger in the near future. Parlano, which is headquartered in Chicago,
Illinois, is a provider of global solutions for real-time business communications and collaboration in an enterprise environment. The software licensed by Parlano allows information to be captured,
filtered and stored in corporate databases and used in knowledge management applications. 

    We
anticipate that the integration of these acquired companies into our products and services offering will help us to deliver a combination of software, technology-based solutions,
professional services and hosting/managed applications that allow businesses to increase efficiency, generate revenue, advance their brand and build customer loyalty. 

SELECTED HISTORICAL AND PRO FORMA FINANCIAL DATA    

Selected Historical Financial Data of divine  

    We are providing the following divine selected historical consolidated financial information to aid you in your analysis of the financial aspects of the
merger. The following information is only a summary and should be read together with divine's consolidated audited and unaudited financial statements, the related notes and the discussion under
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in divine's Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended December 31,

We are providing the following Eprise selected historical consolidated financial information to aid you in your analysis of the financial
aspects of the merger. The following information is only a summary and should be read together with Eprise's audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements, the related notes and the

    The selected financial data presented below as of December 31, 1999 and 2000 and for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000 have been derived
from Eprise's audited financial statements, included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. Selected financial data as of August 31, 1997, and December 31, 1997 and 1998 and for
the year ended August 31, 1997 and the four months ended December 31, 1997 have been derived from Eprise's audited financial statements, which are not included herein. The selected
financial data as of August 31, 1996, for the year ended August 31, 1996, and for the six months ended June 30, 2000 and 2001 have been derived from Eprise's unaudited financial
statements, which in the opinion of management include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of such information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Information
for the unaudited interim periods may not be indicative of results to be expected for a full year. In 1997, Eprise changed its fiscal year end from August 31 to December 31. The
statement of operations data for the 12 months ended December 31, 1997 has been derived by summing the unaudited results of operations for the four fiscal quarters in the period ended
December 31, 1997. The data for pro forma loss per share treats Eprise's preferred stock as though it were common stock from the date of original issuance.

Unaudited Selected Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information  

    The following unaudited selected pro forma condensed combined financial information describes the pro forma effect of divine's proposed acquisition of Eprise
on the: 


statements
of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2001 and the year ended December 31, 2000 of divine; and 

balance
sheet as of June 30, 2001 of divine. 

The
following unaudited selected pro forma condensed combined financial information also describes the pro forma effect of divine's proposed acquisitions of RoweCom Inc., eshare communications,
Inc. and Open Market, Inc. discussed below. The purpose of this pro forma financial information is to demonstrate how the combined financial statements of these businesses might have appeared if each
of the mergers had been completed at the beginning of the periods presented. 

    In
addition to the pending merger between divine and Eprise, on July 6, 2001, divine entered into an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization with RoweCom, which is a
business-to-business provider of e-commerce solutions for purchasing and managing the acquisition of magazines, newspapers, journals and e-journals,
books and other printed sources of commercial, scientific and general interest information and analysis. Completion of the RoweCom merger is subject to a number of conditions, including the approval
of the RoweCom merger by RoweCom's stockholders and the satisfaction of certain financing conditions by RoweCom and its subsidiaries. Further, on July 8, 2001, divine entered into a definitive
agreement to acquire eshare, which provides customer interaction management, or CIM, products and services. Completion of the eshare merger is subject to a number of conditions, including eshare
shareholder approval and, if required, divine stockholder approval. In addition, on August 15, 2001, divine entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Open Market, which provides enterprise
content management and delivery application software to businesses and other organizations. Completion of the Open Market merger is subject to a number of conditions, including Open Market stockholder
approval and divine stockholder approval. The following unaudited selected pro forma condensed combined
financial information reflects the acquisition of Eprise alone, as well as the acquisitions of Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market together. 

    divine
has prepared the pro forma financial information using the purchase method of accounting for all these transactions. Because the pro forma financial information is based upon
the financial condition and operating results of Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market during periods when they were not under the control, influence or management of divine, the information
presented may not be indicative of the results that would have actually occurred had the acquisitions been completed as of the respective periods presented, nor is it indicative of future financial or
operating results. divine expects to incur reorganization and integration expenses as well as potential operating efficiencies as a result of the acquisitions of Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open
Market. The unaudited selected pro forma condensed combined financial information does not give effect to any synergies that may occur due to the integration of Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market
with divine, nor does it take into account the effect of any potential changes to accounting policies, including with respect to the recognition of revenues, of the acquired entities after the mergers
due to the integration of their businesses into divine's business model. The unaudited selected pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read along with the historical financial
statements of divine and the related notes, incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus, the historical financial statements of Eprise and the related notes, included elsewhere in
this proxy statement/prospectus and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and the related notes, included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.

Comparative Per Share Data  

    We have summarized below certain (1) comparative per share data of divine, Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market on a historical basis and
(2) combined per share data on an unaudited pro forma basis after giving effect to the Eprise merger alone, as well as the Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market mergers together, using the
purchase method of accounting as if the mergers occurred on January 1, 2000 and assuming that: 


2.4233
shares of divine common stock were issued in exchange for each share of Eprise common stock outstanding;


0.75
of a share of divine common stock was issued in exchange for each share of RoweCom common stock outstanding;


3.12
shares of divine common stock were issued in exchange for each share of eshare common stock outstanding; and


.8326
shares of divine common stock were issued in exchange for each share of Open Market common stock outstanding. 

    You
should read this data along with the historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes of divine incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus
and of Eprise that are included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. We have presented the pro forma per share data for illustrative purposes only. This unaudited pro forma combined per share
data does not necessarily indicate the operating results that would have been achieved had the mergers been in effect as of the beginning of the periods presented, or the results of operations or
financial position that we will experience in the future.

    The market price of divine and Eprise common stock will fluctuate between the date of this proxy statement/prospectus and the date on which the
merger occurs. We urge you to obtain current market quotations before making any decision about the merger. 

    Neither
divine nor Eprise has ever paid any cash dividends on its stock. We anticipate that, for the foreseeable future, our combined enterprise will retain any earnings for use in
the operation of our business. Therefore, we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 

RISK FACTORS    

    In addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus, you should carefully consider the following
factors in voting on whether to adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger and, therefore, your related investment in divine common stock. For periods following the merger, we have assumed
the completion of the RoweCom, eshare and Open Market mergers and references to the products, businesses, financial results or financial condition of divine and Eprise mean our combined enterprise and
its subsidiaries, including RoweCom, eshare and Open Market. We have divided the risks into three groups: risks relating to the proposed merger, risks relating to the combined entity, including
RoweCom, eshare and Open Market, and risks relating to ownership of divine common stock. References to "we," "us" and "our" in "Risks Relating to the Proposed Merger" refer to the
combined divine/Eprise entity following completion of the Eprise merger. References to "we," "us" and "our" in "Risks Relating to the Combined Entity" and "Risks Relating to
Owning divine Common Stock" refer to the combined divine/Eprise/RoweCom/eshare/Open Market entity following completion of the mergers. 

Risks Relating to the Proposed Merger  

The value of shares of divine common stock that you will receive in the merger will fluctuate based on the price of divine common
stock.  

    Under the merger agreement, the number of shares of divine common stock that you will receive in the merger for your shares of Eprise is fixed. This means that
the exchange ratio of 2.4233 will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of either divine or Eprise common stock and neither company can terminate the merger agreement solely because of
changes in the market price of either company's common stock. Therefore, the value of the divine shares that you receive in the merger will depend on the market price of divine common stock at the
time of completion of the merger, which may vary from the market price on the date you submit your proxy and the date of the special meeting. The prices of divine and Eprise common stock historically
have been volatile, and we cannot assure you what the market prices of the divine common stock or Eprise common stock will be at the time of the merger. We advise you to obtain recent market
quotations for divine common stock and Eprise common stock before making any decision about the merger. 

We may be unable to successfully integrate our operations and personnel and, as a result, may not realize the expected benefits of the merger.  

    This merger requires the integration of our companies, which have previously operated independently. We may not accomplish this integration smoothly,
expeditiously, successfully, or at all. The successful combination of the companies will require significant effort, managerial resources, time and expense. divine and Eprise have different systems
and procedures in many operational areas that must be rationalized and integrated. Integration also may be difficult because divine is based in Chicago, Illinois and Eprise is presently based in
Framingham, Massachusetts. This integration may be further complicated by the possible simultaneous integration of RoweCom's, eshare's and Open Market's operations. While we integrate operations,
management may be distracted and employee uncertainty and lack of focus may disrupt our normal operations. As often occurs with mergers, during the pre-merger and integration phases,
competitors may intensify their efforts to recruit key employees. Employee uncertainty regarding the effects of the merger could also increase 

turnover. Failure to quickly and effectively accomplish the integration of our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

If we are unable to successfully integrate our products and technologies on a timely basis, we may not be able to operate efficiently or realize the expected
benefits of the merger.  

    After the merger, we will need to integrate our products and technologies. This integration may be difficult and unpredictable because divine's and Eprise's
products were developed independently and without regard to this integration. In addition, divine has limited experience with the content management products sold by Eprise. Successful integration
will also require coordination of different development and engineering teams, as well as sales and marketing efforts and personnel. This integration may take longer than expected, and the companies
may be required to expend more resources on integration than anticipated. The need to expend additional resources on our integration would reduce the resources that would otherwise be available to
develop new products and technologies. If we cannot integrate our products and technologies successfully and on a timely basis, we may not be able to operate efficiently or realize the expected
benefits of the merger. 

Our customers may react unfavorably to the merger, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  

    The merger may disrupt our customer relationships. Uncertainty regarding the merger and our ability to effectively integrate our operations without a
significant reduction in the quality of product and service offerings may also cause some of our customers to explore alternatives. Further, customers may defer purchasing decisions as they evaluate
the likelihood of our successful integration. Any significant delay or loss of business from significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 

Officers and directors of Eprise have potential conflicts of interest in the merger.  

    Certain of Eprise's executive officers and directors have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests. These interests,
which include indemnification and insurance protections and loan forgiveness for management and the ownership of options that will become exercisable for divine common stock, are described in more
detail under the caption "The MergerInterests of Certain Persons in the Merger" on page 63. 

After the merger, stockholders of Eprise will have different rights that may be less advantageous than their current rights.  

    Upon completion of the merger, you will become divine stockholders. Differences in Eprise's certificate of incorporation and bylaws and divine's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, as well as divine's stockholders' rights plan, will result in changes to your rights when you become divine stockholders. See "Comparison of Stockholders' Rights" beginning
on page 120. You may conclude that your rights under divine's certificate of incorporation, bylaws and stockholders' rights plan are more limited than your current rights under Eprise's certificate of
incorporation, bylaws and stockholders' rights plan. 

Risks Relating to the Combined Entity  

divine has been in business for only two years, has little operating history and has a new business strategy that may continue to
change, which makes it difficult to evaluate its business.  

    divine was formed in May 1999 and began operations as an Internet holding company engaged in business-to-business
e-commerce through a community of associated companies. divine announced a new strategy to focus on enterprise Web solutions in February 2001. 

Because divine has only recently begun operating under this new business strategy, there is limited data upon which you can evaluate its prospects. As we continue to analyze business plans and
internal operations in light of market developments, we may decide to make further substantial changes in our business plan and organization. These changes in business strategy may include moving into
areas in which divine has little or no experience. Furthermore, our future business strategy will depend on our ability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses as we continue to seek to
expand our portfolio of products and services. We are, and will remain for the foreseeable future, subject to risks, expenses and uncertainties frequently encountered by young companies, and it will
continue to be difficult to evaluate our business and its likelihood of success. 

Our overall performance and quarterly operating results may fluctuate and will be affected by the revenues generated from Eprise's, RoweCom's, eshare's and
Open Market's products and services and RoweCom's need for additional capital.  

    We expect Eprise's, RoweCom's, eshare's and Open Market's revenues to comprise a significant portion of our revenues for the near future. In particular, we
expect RoweCom's revenues to represent a significant portion of our revenues because RoweCom historically has recognized as revenue its cost of the knowledge resources it sells plus the fee retained
by RoweCom. Fluctuations in the revenue generated from our offering of Eprise's and Open Market's content management solutions, RoweCom's knowledge resources and eshare's CIM solutions, will likely
impact our overall performance, and risks relating to these content management solutions, knowledge resources, and CIM solutions may affect our success as a whole. divine's, Eprise's, RoweCom's,
eshare's and Open Market's revenues and results of operations have varied substantially from quarter to quarter. We expect large fluctuations in our future quarterly operating results due to a number
of factors, including: 


the
success of, and costs associated with, acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic relationships; 

losses
or charges incurred by associated companies that may include significant write-downs, write-offs and impairment charges; 

the
level of product and price competition; 

the
length of our sales and implementation process; 

the
size and timing of individual transactions; 

seasonal
trends; 

the
mix of products and services sold; 

software
defects and other product quality problems; 

the
timing of new product introductions and enhancements by us or our competitors; 

customer
order deferrals in anticipation of enhancements or new products to be offered by us or our competitors; 

changes
in foreign currency exchange rates; 

customers'
fiscal constraints; and 

general
economic conditions. 

    In
addition, RoweCom's revenue flow is seasonal in nature and as a result RoweCom periodically will have to rely on financing from divine or third parties to support its needs for
working capital. RoweCom has an established practice of paying some of its publishers 30 to 

60 days before receipt of funds from customers. Consequently, RoweCom anticipates making substantial expenditures in the fourth quarter of each year, while receiving the majority of its cash
receipts relating to those purchases late in the first quarter of the following year. Given these seasonal cash flow imbalances, if RoweCom has an unexpected demand for liquid capital, or does not
have financing available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, when needed, it could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. 

We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we may never become profitable.  

    divine incurred net losses of approximately $9,407,000 for the period from inception on May 7, 1999 through December 31, 1999, approximately
$470,319,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000, and approximately $104,132,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2001. The majority of these losses were related to the consolidated
operations of divine's associated companies and charges divine took to reduce the carrying value of these associated companies. In addition: 


Eprise
incurred net losses of approximately $5,261,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998, $6,600,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999,
$16,704,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000 and $14,443,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2001; 

RoweCom
incurred net losses of approximately $7,630,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998, $15,067,000 for the year ended December 31,
1999, $83,981,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000 and $16,922,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2001; 

Open
Market incurred net losses of approximately $36,970,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998, $19,780,000 for the year ended
December 31, 1999, $37,796,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000 and $14,702,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2001; and 

eshare
incurred net losses of approximately $9,958,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999, $11,117,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000
and $3,197,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2001. 

We
expect to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, we expect our operating expenses to increase significantly as we continue to develop the infrastructure necessary to
implement our current business strategy and integrate acquired businesses. Changes to our business strategy and product lines may cause us to incur additional expenses. Our financial results will
continue to be affected by the operations of divine's existing associated companies, some of which may cease operations in the future if they are unable to generate positive cash flow. To the extent
that our revenues do not increase at a sufficient rate, we may not be able to achieve and maintain profitability. 

The failure of the RoweCom, eshare and/or the Open Market merger to close could adversely impact divine's business strategy and the market value of divine's
common stock.  

    This merger, the RoweCom merger, the eshare merger and the Open Market merger are each proceeding separately. None of the mergers is subject to, or conditioned
upon, the completion of the other mergers. As a result, it is possible that we complete this merger, but the RoweCom merger, the eshare merger and/or the Open Market merger fail to close. The failure
to close one, two or all three of the other mergers could adversely affect divine's 

implementation of its enterprise Web solutions strategy and could be negatively viewed by analysts or investors, which in turn could cause the value of divine's common stock to decline. 

If we do not successfully implement our acquisition strategy or address the risks associated with the acquisitions, our growth and ability to compete may be
impaired.  

    Our business strategy includes the acquisition of other businesses that are complementary to ours, including other providers of enterprise software products or
professional services. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates available for sale at reasonable prices, consummate any acquisitions, including the proposed RoweCom, eshare and
Open Market mergers, or successfully integrate any acquired businesses, including RoweCom, eshare or Open Market, into our operations. Acquisitions, including the proposed RoweCom, eshare and Open
Market mergers, involve a number of special risks and challenges, including: 


diversion
of management's attention; 

assimilation
of the operations and personnel of acquired companies; 

incorporation
of acquired products into existing product lines; 

adverse
short-term effects on reported operating results; 

assumption
of the liabilities of acquired companies; 

possible
loss of key employees; and 

difficulty
of presenting a unified corporate image. 

If
we are unable to successfully implement our acquisition strategy or address the risks associated with acquisitions, our growth and ability to compete may be impaired. 

    If
we engage in future acquisitions, we might finance these acquisitions with available cash, the proceeds from possible debt financing or the issuance of additional common or
preferred stock, or a combination of the foregoing. We may not be able to arrange adequate financing on acceptable terms. If we consummate one or more significant acquisitions by issuing additional
equity securities, the market price of our common stock could decline and our stockholders could suffer significant dilution of their interests in us. Furthermore, sellers may be reluctant to accept
divine common stock as consideration at its recent price level and given its historical volatility, in which case, our ability to complete further transactions could be significantly limited. 

    For
most of the businesses that we may acquire, we will likely have to record significant goodwill and other intangible assets, and generally accepted accounting principles may
require us to recognize substantial amortization charges on the other intangible assets, reducing our future reportable earnings. We will also have to periodically test our goodwill and other
intangible assets for impairment. If we determine that the value of the goodwill and/or the intangible assets have been impaired, we will be required to recognize substantial charges that would
adversely affect our operating results. In addition, these acquisitions could involve
significant non-recurring acquisition-related charges, such as the write-off or write-down of software development costs or other intangible items. 

Our failure to retain key personnel may adversely affect our business.  

    Our success depends partly upon our ability to retain senior executives and other key employees who are critical to the continued advancement, development and
support of our products and services and ongoing sales and marketing efforts. The loss of any key personnel or any significant group of employees could negatively affect our future business and 

prospects. If our management does not succeed in their roles or we are not able to effectively allocate management responsibilities and cause our officers and senior managers to operate effectively as
a group, our business could be adversely affected. 

    Employee
morale and our ability to attract and retain qualified employees may also be adversely affected by the decline and substantial fluctuation in the market price of divine
common stock since its initial public offering, as many divine employees hold options with exercise prices far greater than divine's recent stock price. 

Revenues from our professional services division are difficult to predict because they are derived from project-based engagements.

    For
the six months ended June 30, 2001, divine derived approximately 92% of its revenues from professional services. Almost all of these revenues were from project-based client
engagements, which vary in size and scope. As a result, the revenues of our professional services division are difficult to predict because a client that accounts for a significant portion of these
revenues in one period may not generate a similar amount of revenues, if any, in subsequent periods. In addition, because many of our professional services engagements involve sequential stages, each
of which may represent a separate contractual commitment, a client may choose not to retain us for subsequent stages of an engagement or for new professional services projects. 

If we cannot keep our billable professionals engaged on client projects, our future revenues could decline and our operating results could be adversely
affected.  

    Virtually all the client contracts of our professional services division allow the client to terminate our services on relatively short notice and do not
guarantee us any specific or minimum amount of business from the client. To the extent that any significant clients decrease their use of our professional services, delay an engagement or terminate
their relationship with us, the revenues of our professional services division could decline substantially and our overall operating results could be adversely affected to the extent we are unable to
quickly redeploy our billable professionals to other client engagements. 

We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and competitive pressures faced by us could hurt our business and financial
results.  

    The market for our products and services is intensely competitive, fragmented and subject to rapid change. As a result of this merger and the RoweCom, eshare
and Open Market mergers, we will compete with a variety of companies that provide software solutions and professional services independently or on an integrated basis. We may not be able to compete
successfully against current and future competitors, and competitive pressures faced by us could hurt our business and financial results. Furthermore, many of our current and potential competitors
have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, product development and marketing resources, greater name recognition and a larger customer base than we do. 

    Eprise
has five primary sources of competition: 


file-based
content management systems from providers such as Interwoven, Inc.; 

legacy
document management systems from providers such as Documentum, Inc.; 

specialized
application servers from providers such as Vignette Corporation; 

other
specialized content management providers such as Stellent, Inc. (f/k/a Intranet Solutions); and 


in-house
development efforts by potential clients and partners. 

    In
addition, Eprise currently partners with a number of companies that provide complementary products such as Web tools and application servers. Any of these companies might introduce
competitive product offerings in the future. Also, larger companies with broader product offerings, such as Microsoft Corporation, may bundle their products to discourage users from purchasing
Eprise's products. 

    The
market for the sale of magazines, newspapers, journals and e-journals, books and other knowledge resources to businesses is intensely and increasingly competitive.
Although RoweCom has not yet had significant direct competition from other companies offering a service for purchasing and managing the acquisition of subscriptions and books with comparable
management control features, EBSCO Industries, Inc. has recently launched a desktop e-commerce service that is similar to RoweCom's kStore. Thus, we expect that significant
competition will develop in the near future with respect to RoweCom's knowledge resource products, and it may adversely impact our business. 

    eshare's
primary competitors in the field of integrated inbound/outbound telephony-based call management systems have been Davox Corporation, SER Systeme AG, formerly EIS
International, Inc., and Avaya, Inc., formerly Mosaix International, Inc. We will continue to compete primarily against Davox and Avaya in the collections segment of the outbound
call management systems market, and against SER Systeme in the telemarketing and telesales segments of the inbound/outbound call management systems market. We will also compete in the computer
telephony integration segment of the market, where principal competitors include Interactive Intelligence, Inc., Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories/Alcatel, and Stratasoft Corp., Apropos
Technology, Castel, Inc. and CellIT, Inc., among others. In the future, we may also face additional direct competition from private branch exchange/automatic call distribution vendors,
other telecommunications equipment providers, telecommunications service providers, computer hardware and software vendors and others. Furthermore, in the Internet-based CIM industry, our competitors
will include eGain Communications Corporation, Kana Software, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Face Time Communications, Inc., LivePerson, Inc., People Support, Inc. and
Siebel Systems, Inc. 

    Open
Market's primary competition in the e-business content management market includes in-house development efforts by prospective customers, other vendors of application software or
application development platforms and tools directed at interactive commerce and financial services, such as Art Technology Group, Inc., BroadVision, Inc., Documentum, Inc., Interwoven, Inc. and
Vignette Corporation. In addition, larger companies with much broader product offerings, such as BEA Systems, Inc., IBM Corporation, Microsoft Corporation and Oracle Corporation, may bundle their
products to discourage users from purchasing Open Market's products. Companies such as IBM, BEA Systems and iPlanet E-Commerce Solutions also may add content management functionality to
their application servers or introduce their own content management software. 

    divine
competes in various market segments that are extremely competitive, highly fragmented and subject to rapid change. While we offer an increasingly comprehensive range of
advanced enterprise solutions, we compete with various providers of one or more components of our solutions. In the enterprise portal software and services segment, according to Delphi Research and
the Yankee Group, the leading portal application makers in 2000 included: Plumtree Software, Inc., Hummingbird Ltd., Viador Inc., Sequoia Software Corporation, acquired by Citrix
Systems, Inc., and InfoImage, Inc., among others. We believe 

that additional competitors in the broader advanced enterprise solutions market include: IBM Corporation, PeopleSoft, Inc., BEA Systems, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, Sybase, Inc.,
Oracle Corporation, Computer Associates International, Inc., Epicentric, Inc., BroadVision, Inc., Vignette Corporation, Citrix Systems, Inc., Open Text Corporation, Top
Tier Software, Inc., DataChannel, Inc., Tibco Software Inc., SAP AG, American Express Company and InfoSys Consulting Inc. 

If we do not expand our customer base, we may never become profitable and our stock price will likely decline.  

    The market for many of our products and services is newly emerging. As a result, we cannot accurately estimate the potential demand for them. We believe that
market acceptance of our products and services depends principally on our ability to: 


develop
or acquire products and services that meet changing customer needs in a timely fashion; 

effectively
market our products and our services; 

hire,
train, and retain a sufficient number of qualified sales and marketing personnel; 

provide
high-quality and reliable customer support for our products; 

distribute
and price our products and services in a manner that is more appealing to customers than that of our competitors; 

develop
a favorable reputation among our customers, potential customers and participants in the software industry; and 

withstand
downturns in general economic conditions or conditions that would slow corporate spending on software products and professional services. 

Our
inability to accomplish any of the foregoing may limit our ability to expand our customer base. If our customer base does not expand, we may never become profitable and our stock price will likely
decline. Furthermore, the adoption of networks for book and subscription procurement, particularly by companies that have relied on traditional means of procurement, will require broad acceptance of
the new approach. In addition, companies that have already invested substantial resources in traditional methods of procurement may be reluctant to adopt a new strategy. This could limit the growth of
our revenues derived from the merger. 

Our success is dependent upon the market for Internet services, which, along with the general economy, is experiencing a downturn.

    During
late 2000 and 2001, and particularly since the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the market for Internet services and technology has experienced a significant
decline. This decline is at least partly attributable to funding difficulties experienced by many smaller companies, a general economic slowdown and the instability generated by these attacks. All of
these developments have caused many of our current and potential clients to cancel, reduce and/or delay some projects. A prolonged economic slowdown or continued uncertainty about the future of the
market for Internet services will adversely affect our business and financial
results. If demand for our products and services does not improve, increased competition for business may result in significant decreases in the prices we charge for our products and services. The
market for our products and services may not improve in a timely manner or to the extent necessary to allow us to achieve and sustain profitability in the near future. 

Our success will depend upon the ability of our products to work with a large variety of hardware, software, database and networking systems.  

    The success of our products will depend on our ability to integrate our products and make them compatible with customer systems, particularly hardware systems,
operating systems and data sources, as well as, or better than, competing products. The success of our products will also depend on the ability of our existing products to work well with one another,
with new products we develop and with new software developed by third parties. We currently serve, and intend to continue to serve, a customer base with a wide variety of hardware, software, database
and networking systems. If we cannot support an increasing number of systems in the future, we may not gain broad market acceptance. 

Customers will be less likely to accept our products if we are unable to introduce in a timely manner new software products and enhancements that meet industry
requirements.  

    The market for our software products is subject to rapid technological change, changing customer needs, frequent new product introductions and evolving
industry standards that may render our existing products and services obsolete. As a result, unforeseen changes in customer and technological requirements for application features, functions and
technologies could limit our ability to develop market share or could rapidly erode our position in those markets in which we have an established presence. Our growth and future operating results will
depend in part upon our ability to develop and introduce new applications that anticipate, meet or exceed technological advances in the marketplace, meet changing customer requirements, respond to
competitive products and achieve market acceptance. 

    New
products, platforms and language support can require long development and testing periods. New products or enhancements may not be released according to schedule or may contain
defects when released. Either situation could result in adverse publicity, loss of sales, delay in market acceptance of our products or customer claims against us, any of which could harm our
business. Our product acquisition, development and testing efforts have required,
and are expected to continue to require, substantial investments. We may not possess sufficient resources to make these necessary investments. 

    We
also expect to develop and introduce new and enhanced versions of products as an integrated suite. In addition to the risks and uncertainties inherent in the development and
introduction of new products, we will face significant challenges in developing and introducing new products and versions that work together effectively and allow customers to achieve the benefits of
a broader product offering. We may not be able to identify or overcome these challenges. 

If we cannot cross-sell the products and services of divine, Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market to the other companies' customers, we will not
achieve one of the expected benefits of the mergers.  

    Assuming completion of the Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market mergers, we intend to offer the products and services of Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open
Market to existing divine customers and the customers of each other acquired company, and divine's products to existing Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market customers. One company's customers may
not have an interest in the other companies' products and services. If we fail to cross-market our products and services, we will not achieve one of the expected benefits of the mergers, and this
failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 

We expect that our future revenues and operating results will be adversely affected if the software application industry continues to evolve toward a
subscription-based model.  

    We expect that our revenue growth rates and operating results will be adversely affected as more customers require us to offer our products under a
subscription-based application service provider model. We currently sell software application solutions on a perpetual license basis in exchange for an up-front license fee. Many of our
customers are attempting to reduce their up-front capital expenditures by purchasing software applications under a hosted subscription service model. Under the hosted model, the customer
subscribes to use an application from the software provider. Generally, the application is hosted on a server managed by the software provider or a third-party hosting service. We expect that
subscription-based revenues will represent a substantial portion of future revenues generated by our software applications and managed applications divisions. 

    Under
the subscription-based model, we generally will recognize revenue and receive payment ratably over the term of a customer's subscription. As a result, our revenue growth rate
under a subscription model may be less than what our revenue growth rate would be under a license model. In addition, the price of our services will be fixed at the time of entering into the
subscription agreement. If we are unable to adequately predict the costs associated with maintaining and servicing a customer's subscription, then the periodic expenses associated with a subscription
may exceed the revenues we recognize for the subscription in the same period, which would adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if we are not successful in implementing the
subscription-based model, or if market analysts or investors do not believe that the model is attractive relative to our existing license model, our business could be impaired and our stock price
could decline. 

Our business may be adversely affected if there are defects in our software or we are unable to acquire third-party software or hardware that is
error-free.  

    Software products as complex as those that we offer may contain errors that could be detected at any point in the products' life cycles. divine, Eprise,
RoweCom, eshare and Open Market have, in the past, discovered software errors in certain of their products and have experienced delays in shipment or implementation of products during the period
required to correct these errors. Despite extensive testing by us and by current and potential customers, errors in our software may be found in the future. This could result in a loss of, or delay
in, market acceptance and sales, diversion of development resources, injury to our reputation or increased service and warranty cost. In particular, the call center environment in which eshare
operates is characterized by a wide variety of standard and non-standard configurations that make pre-release testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and
time consuming and will limit our ability to uncover all defects prior to shipment and installation at a customer's location. We also license certain software used in our products from third parties,
and our products are designed to operate on certain hardware platforms manufactured by third parties. Third-party software or hardware may contain errors that we are dependent upon others to correct.
These errors could cause problems with the installation and operation of our products, which could harm our business. 

We may face potential liability to customers if our products or our customers' systems fail.  

    Our software, portal and application products are often critical to the operations of our customers' businesses and provide benefits that may be difficult to
quantify. If one of our products or a customer's system fails, the customer could make a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. The limitations of
liability set forth in our contracts may not be enforceable in all instances and may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Our insurance coverage may not continue to be available on
reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims. In addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim. If we experience one or more large claims against
us that exceed available insurance coverage or result in changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements,
our business and financial results could be hurt. 

We could lose our competitive advantage if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights, and any related litigation could be costly and
time-consuming.  

    We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our
proprietary rights in our products and technology. These measures may not be adequate to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technology. As a result, unauthorized third parties may copy or
otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. We may not be able to detect all instances of infringement. Furthermore, we may be subject to additional risks as we enter into transactions in
countries where intellectual property laws are not well-developed or are poorly enforced. Legal protections of our rights may be ineffective in these countries. If we must engage in
litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, either domestically or in other countries, we could face substantial costs and diversion of resources, regardless of the final
outcome of such litigation. Any future attempt by us to enforce our intellectual property rights might not be successful or might result in royalties that do not exceed the cost of such enforcement
efforts. Even if we succeed in protecting our intellectual property, others may independently develop similar technologies or products that do not infringe on our intellectual property. 

Other companies may claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights, which could harm our business.  

    Although we believe our intellectual property is non-infringing, third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. We expect
that the risk of infringement claims will rise as the number of products and competitors in our industry grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. To develop our
services or products, we may need to acquire licenses for intellectual property to avoid infringement of a third party's product. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms,
if at all. Former employers of our present and future employees may assert claims that these employees improperly disclosed confidential or proprietary information to us. Any such claims could be
time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management's attention and resources, cause product shipment delays or require us to pay money damages or enter into royalty
or licensing agreements. These royalty or licensing agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In the event of a successful claim of product infringement against us and our
failure or inability to license the 

infringed or similar technology, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 

We may not be able to prevent online security breaches, which could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation and expose us to liability.  

    A party that is able to circumvent our security systems or the security systems of our customers could steal proprietary information or cause interruptions in
our operations. Security breaches could also damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. Our insurance policies have coverage limits and exclusions that
may prevent reimbursement for losses caused by security breaches. Furthermore, our servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions.
We may need to expend significant additional capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches. Despite these efforts, we may not be able
to prevent all security breaches. 

Future government regulation could place financial burdens on our business.  

    Because of the Internet's popularity and increasing use, new laws and regulations may be adopted that could have an adverse effect on us. In particular, states
may impose discriminatory, multiple or special taxes on the Internet if the current moratorium on the application of these taxes, due to end on October 21, 2001, is not extended. If the
moratorium ends, federal taxes may also be imposed on the sale of goods over the Internet. These state and federal taxes could cause a decrease in the volume of e-commerce and, therefore,
the demand for our products and services. The enactment of any additional laws or regulations, including international laws and regulations, could impede the growth of the Internet and
e-commerce, which could decrease our revenue and place additional financial burdens on our business. 

    Federal,
state or foreign agencies have also adopted, and may continue to adopt, laws or regulations affecting the use of outbound call processing systems. These laws or regulations
could limit the market for eshare's products or expose us to liability, which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 

Legal restrictions relating to the privacy of Internet users and the collection and use of online data could limit the utility of the personalization
functionality of Eprise's, eshare's and Open Market's products and, therefore, the attractiveness of those products to customers.  

    One of the principal features of Eprise's, eshare's and Open Market's products is the ability to develop and maintain profiles of online users to assist
business managers in personalizing content and in displaying tailored commercial offers to specific online users. By limiting the means in which this feature can be utilized, proposed and existing
legal restrictions on the collection and use of information relating to Internet users could materially and adversely impact Eprise's, eshare's and Open Market's products. For example, legislation has
been proposed in some jurisdictions that would regulate the practice of placing small information files, or "cookies," on a user's hard drive to gather information. Likewise, regulation of the
practice of online preference marketing is also under consideration in many jurisdictions. Moreover, legislation regulating the collection of data online and offline is already in place in the United
States and elsewhere, including the European Union, and applicable to certain populations and in certain sectors. While regulatory and legislative efforts in this area are relatively new and still
developing, they continue to gain attention, and 

continued regulation and legislation in this area could adversely affect the demand for Eprise's, eshare's and Open Market's products. 

If we lost the services of Andrew J. Filipowski, our business could fail.  

    We believe that Andrew J. Filipowski, our chairman and chief executive officer, is critical to our success. If we lost the services of Mr. Filipowski,
our ability to promote our business and raise additional capital would be severely limited, and our business could fail. We do not maintain key man life insurance on Mr. Filipowski. 

Our key personnel have entered into non-compete agreements that could prevent us from engaging in certain activities and acquiring interests in
some companies.  

    Andrew J. Filipowski, our chairman and chief executive officer, Michael P. Cullinane, our executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer and a
director, and Paul L. Humenansky, our president and chief operating officer and a director, have entered into consulting and non-compete agreements with PLATINUM 

technology
 International, 
inc.
, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Computer Associates
International, Inc. These agreements prohibit Mr. Filipowski until June 29, 2007, and each of Messrs. Cullinane and Humenansky until June 29, 2004, from
participating or engaging, directly or indirectly, in the development, manufacture, marketing or distribution of any products or services offered by PLATINUM as of March 29, 1999, or any
products or services offered by PLATINUM after that date and in which they had actively participated. PLATINUM was, as of March 29, 1999, and continues to be, engaged in the business of
developing, marketing and supporting software products for managing information technology infrastructures and providing related professional services. As of March 29, 1999, PLATINUM also
offered products and services for the creation, deployment and management of Web content. Under these agreements, Messrs. Filipowski, Cullinane and Humenansky also are prohibited from
soliciting, or assisting another person to solicit or attempt to solicit, persons or entities that were current customers of PLATINUM or its affiliates before the end of the respective employment
periods of Messrs. Filipowski, Cullinane and Humenansky, unless the solicitation of these customers is for goods or services unrelated to any activity which competes with PLATINUM. 

    To
manage divine's business effectively with respect to these agreements, divine has consulted with PLATINUM and Computer Associates before making any acquisition to confirm that a
breach of these agreements would not result. PLATINUM and Computer Associates have consented to this merger and to the eshare and Open Market mergers. In the future, however, these consulting and
non-compete agreements could limit our business opportunities, which could impair our success. 

If Reed Elsevier or any of the other suppliers with whom RoweCom does business stops providing knowledge resources to RoweCom on favorable terms, we may not be
able to satisfy customers' demands at acceptable prices.  

    The primary supplier of the magazines and journals whose subscriptions RoweCom sells is Reed Elsevier, which supplied titles accounting for approximately 16%
and 13% of RoweCom's sales for the year ended December 31, 1999 and 2000, respectively. RoweCom currently does not have a contract with Reed Elsevier. If Reed Elsevier stops offering RoweCom
knowledge resources on favorable terms, we may not be able to offer customers competitive prices on their orders. If Reed Elsevier were to cease providing RoweCom with knowledge resources, it would
not be possible to obtain replacements for many of the titles 

Reed Elsevier publishes at a comparable price, if at all, from another supplier. Either of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Similarly, if any of the other suppliers with whom RoweCom does business decides not to provide RoweCom with knowledge resources or decides to stop providing RoweCom with knowledge resources on
favorable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

We may not be able to expand RoweCom's catalog of knowledge resources.  

    One of the key elements of RoweCom's strategy is to continue to expand its catalog of knowledge resources. RoweCom gains content through acquisitions and
strategic alliances and through contact with various suppliers. We may not be able to continue to gain available content through strategic alliances or directly from suppliers. In the event that we
are unable to continue to increase RoweCom's available content, we may: 


be
at a competitive disadvantage with respect to competitors that may compile greater libraries of available titles;


lose
clients that rely upon RoweCom as a single-source of knowledge resources; and


be
unable to increase the amount of revenue that is otherwise generated from particular clients. 

Any
of these effects could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. 

Delays in sales and the implementation cycle for CIM solutions and managed applications could adversely affect us.  

    If we experience delays in, or cancellation of, sales or implementations of CIM solutions and managed applications, our business and financial results could be
hurt. To sell these products, we generally must provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding their use and benefits. In addition, prospective customers generally make a
significant commitment of resources in connection with the implementation of these products. For these and other reasons, the length of time between the date of initial contact with the potential
customer and the installation and use of eshare products has generally been six months or more. Our implementation cycle could be lengthened in the future by delays over which we have little or no
control and increases in the size and complexity of our installations and in the number of third-party systems with which our products must integrate. In addition, any unexpected delays in individual
implementations could expose us to liability claims from our customers. 

We expect that our future operating results will be significantly dependent on a limited suite of Eprise, eshare and Open Market products and the market for
these products.  

    Eprise has historically derived substantially all of its revenues from licenses of, and services related to, Eprise Participant Server, and expects that
revenues from this product will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenues for the foreseeable future. A decline in the price of Eprise Participant Server or Eprise's inability to
increase license sales of Eprise Participant Server would harm our business and operating results. In addition, our future financial performance would suffer if the successful development,
introduction and customer acceptance of enhanced versions of Eprise Participant Server and future products 

are not achieved. Failure to deliver the enhancements or products that customers want could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 

    eshare
traditionally has derived a majority of its revenues from sales of its Conversations call center management product, its NetAgent Web-collaboration product and
related services and support. eshare introduced Conversations in 1999 and NetAgent in 1998. eshare is currently in the process of developing next generation CIM applications and expects to begin beta
trials in 2001. In the near term, we anticipate that a significant portion of our eshare-related revenue may be derived from eshare's Conversations and NetAgent product offerings and related services
and support. We intend to enhance these products and develop market-specific solutions. However, any factor adversely affecting the market for call center and Internet-based solutions in general, or
the Conversations and NetAgent products in particular, could hurt our business and financial results. We also may face potential charges resulting from the write-down of inventory of
outdated products that we cannot sell. 

    Open
Market expects to derive substantially all of its product license revenues in the future from its recently announced Content Server Enterprise Edition software. Our future growth
and profitability will depend on the successful release, introduction and customer acceptance of this new suite of products and future enhancements to these products. Any factors adversely affecting
the pricing of, demand for or market acceptance of these products, including competition or technological change, could cause our revenues to decline and our business and future operating results to
suffer. 

Eprise and eshare traditionally have relied on a few customers for a significant portion of their revenues.  

    Eprise typically derives a significant portion of its software license revenues in each quarter from a small number of relatively large orders. Although we do
not believe that the loss of any particular Eprise customer would have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, our operating results could be materially adversely affected if
Eprise was unable to complete one or more substantial license sales in any future period. In the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2000, Eprise's five largest customers accounted for
approximately 50%, 26%, 33%, and 34%, respectively, of its total revenues in those quarters. In the first and second quarter of 2001, Eprise's five largest customers accounted for approximately 33%
and 42% of its total revenues, respectively. 

    eshare
has historically derived, and we believe that we will continue to derive, a significant portion of call center revenues in any period from a limited number of large corporate
clients. In 2000, eshare's five largest customers accounted for approximately 17% of its total revenues. During 1999, eshare's five largest customers accounted for approximately 28% of its total
revenues. The loss, deferral or cancellation of an order from one of these customers could have a significant impact on our operating results. eshare's current customers may not place additional
orders and we may not obtain orders of similar magnitude from other customers. If
we fail to retain any major customer of eshare, suffer any reduction, delay in or cancellation of orders by any such customer or fail to market successfully CIM solutions to new customers, our
business and financial results could be hurt. 

    Open Market is party to several securities class action lawsuits that may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain and
may harm our business.  

    Open Market and several of its former and present officers and directors are named as defendants in several class action complaints filed on behalf of certain
of its stockholders who purchased securities between November 8, 1999 and April 18, 2000. These complaints allege violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule
10b-5 promulgated under the Exchange Act. In particular, they allege, among other things, that during the putative class period, the defendants sought to mislead the investing public by overstating
Open Market's prospects and the quality of its products. The plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages and other appropriate relief. Any resolution of this litigation in a manner adverse to Open Market
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the costs to us of defending this litigation or other related proceedings, even if
resolved in our favor, could be substantial. This litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and resources in general. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and
continuation of this litigation or other related proceedings could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace. 

Our strategy to expand our international operations is subject to many risks that may prevent us from maintaining or increasing our international revenues.  

    RoweCom's sales outside the United States accounted for approximately 42% and 51% of its total revenues in 1999 and 2000, respectively. eshare's sales outside
the United States accounted for approximately 32% and 28% of its total revenues in 1999 and 2000, respectively. Open Market's sales outside of North America accounted for approximately 30% and 40% of
its total revenues in 1999 and 2000, respectively. A significant element of our business strategy is to expand our international presence through RoweCom's, eshare's and Open Market's operations and
sales channels in international markets. This projected expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources. Because of the difficulty in penetrating new markets, we may
not be able to maintain or increase
international revenues. Our international operations will be subject to a number of inherent risks, which will increase as we expand our international operations, including: 


significant
volatility in the level and timing of business;


the
impact of possible recessionary environments in economies outside the United States;


changes
in foreign legal and regulatory requirements;


changes
in tariffs;


the
costs of localizing products for foreign markets and integrating products with foreign system components;


longer
accounts receivable collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection;


difficulties
and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations;


reduced
protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;


potentially
adverse tax consequences; 


political
and economic instability; and


the
higher cost of foreign service delivery. 

    While
eshare's and Open Market's expenses incurred in foreign countries typically are denominated in the local currencies, revenues generated by eshare's and Open Market's
international sales typically are paid in U.S. dollars, British pounds or Euros. While a significant portion of RoweCom's expenses in foreign countries are denominated in local currencies, a portion
of the expense for both its U.S. operations and its foreign countries is denominated in currencies other than the local currency. RoweCom enters into forward currency contracts primarily in European,
Australian and Canadian currencies to hedge its foreign currency exposures. However, RoweCom does not hedge all foreign currency exposure and existing forward currency contracts may not adequately
cover intended exchange gains and losses. We could experience fluctuations in currency exchange rates in the future that would have a material adverse impact on our international operations. 

Our growth in operations will likely be dependent upon the successful development of direct and indirect sales channels.  

    Eprise, eshare and Open Market primarily sell their products domestically through a direct sales force and internationally through both direct and indirect
sales channels. Eprise, eshare and Open Market support customers with internal technical and outsourced customer support staff. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will
greatly depend on our ability to recruit and train sufficient technical and direct sales personnel and to outsource effectively our customer support functions. Each of Eprise, eshare and Open Market
has in the past experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified sales and technical personnel. If we are unable to rapidly and effectively expand Eprise's, eshare's and Open Market's technical staff
and direct sales force, our business and financial results could be hurt. 

    We
believe that our future growth will also depend on our ability to continue to develop and maintain Eprise's, eshare's and Open Market's indirect sales channels, including value
added resellers, or VARs, and distributors. Additionally, our investment of significant resources to develop these indirect channels could adversely affect our operating results if these efforts do
not generate sufficient additional revenues. 

    If
we are unable to recruit and retain qualified VARs and distributors, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Increased indirect sales also could adversely affect our
average selling prices and result in lower gross margins because lower unit prices are typically charged on sales made through indirect channels. Sales of Eprise, eshare and Open Market products
through indirect channels will reduce our gross profits from our services because the VARs and distributors provide these services. 

    As
indirect sales increase, our direct contact with Eprise's and eshare's customer bases will decrease, and we may have more difficulty accurately forecasting sales, evaluating
customer satisfaction and recognizing emerging customer requirements. In addition, VARs and distributors may develop, acquire or market products competitive with our products. Our strategy of
marketing products directly to customers and indirectly through VARs and distributors may result in distribution channel conflicts. Our direct sales efforts may compete with those of our indirect
channels and, to the extent different VARs and distributors target the same customers, VARs and distributors may also come into conflict with each other. Any 

channel conflicts that develop may have a material adverse effect on our relationships with VARs and distributors or hurt our ability to attract new VARs and distributors. 

Risks Relating to Owning divine Common Stock  

If divine common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq National Market, the liquidity, visibility and price of divine common stock may
decrease.  

    Since divine's initial public offering in July 2000, divine common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq National Market. Shares of divine common stock
could be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market if we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq National Market, including the minimum bid price of $1.00. If divine common
stock is delisted from the Nasdaq National Market, we would be forced to list divine common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board or some other quotation medium, depending upon our ability to meet the
specific listing requirements of those quotation systems. If this happens, an investor might find it more difficult to buy and sell, or to obtain accurate price quotations for, shares of divine common
stock. This lack of visibility and liquidity could further decrease the price of divine common stock. In addition, delisting from the Nasdaq National Market might negatively impact our reputation and,
as a consequence, our business. On September 27, 2001, Nasdaq announced that it had suspended until January 2, 2002 its $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the
Nasdaq National Market. 

    The
merger agreement for this merger and the RoweCom, eshare and Open Market mergers require divine to deliver shares of its common stock that have been authorized for listing on the
Nasdaq National Market as a condition to closing the applicable merger. If divine common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq National Market, each of Eprise, RoweCom,
eshare and Open Market can (1) terminate its respective merger agreement with divine or (2) continue with its respective merger, with holders of common stock of Eprise, RoweCom, eshare
or Open Market, as applicable, receiving shares of divine common stock that may have diminished liquidity and visibility. 

The market price of divine common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, which could cause litigation against us and prevent you from reselling your
shares at or above the price at which you acquire them in the merger.  

    From divine's initial public offering in July 2000 through the date of this proxy statement/ prospectus, the price per share of divine common stock has
ranged from a high of $12.44 to a low of $0.46. The market price of divine common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations due to various
factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: 


quarterly
variations in operating results;


volatility
in the stock market;


volatility
in the general economy;


changes
in interest rates;


announcements
of acquisitions, technological innovations or new software, services or products by us or our competitors; and


changes
in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts. 

In
addition, there have been large fluctuations in the prices and trading volumes of securities of many technology, Internet and CIM product and related professional service companies. Broad market
and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock. As a result, you may be unable to resell your shares of divine common stock that you receive in the merger at or above the
prices at which you acquired them. In the past, volatility in the market price of a company's securities has often led to securities class action litigation. Such litigation could result in
substantial costs to us and divert our attention and resources, which could harm our business. Declines in the market price of divine common stock or failure of the market price to increase could also
harm our ability to retain key employees, our access to capital and other aspects of our business. 

Our stockholders' rights plan and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law could delay or deter tender offers or takeover
attempts that may offer you a premium for your common stock, which could adversely affect our stock price.  

    Our stockholders' rights plan and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to
acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to you. These impediments include: 


the
rights issued in connection with the stockholders' rights plan that will substantially dilute the ownership of any person or group that acquires 15% or
more of our common stock unless the rights are first cancelled or redeemed by our board of directors, in its discretion;


the
classification of our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms;


the
ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock with rights as it deems appropriate without stockholder approval;


a
requirement that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by our chairman, president or a majority of our board of directors;


a
prohibition against action by written consent of our stockholders;


a
requirement that our stockholders comply with advance notice provisions to bring director nominations or other matters before meetings of our
stockholders; and


the
adoption of a provision of Delaware law that prohibits us from entering into some business combinations with interested stockholders without the
approval of our board of directors. 

The
existence of the stockholders' rights plan and these provisions may deprive you of an opportunity to sell your shares at a premium over prevailing prices. The potential inability of our
stockholders to obtain a control premium could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 

Our stock price may decline if a large number of shares are sold or there is a perception that these sales may occur.  

    The market price of our stock could decline as a result of additional sales of common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur. As of
October 1, 2001, there was an aggregate of 137,468,965 shares of restricted divine common stock that could be resold only 

through registration under the Securities Act or under an available exemption from registration, including the exemption provided by Rule 144. As of October 1, 2001, of those shares,
17,396,007 shares could be resold immediately under an effective registration statement on Form S-3; 109,920,014 were eligible for sale subject to the volume, manner of sale and
other limitations of Rule 144; and the remaining 13,748,861 shares will become eligible for sale between October 1, 2001 and August 2002, subject to certain
lock-up agreements described below. 

The market price of divine common stock could decline as a result of the large number of shares that will become eligible for sale upon completion of this
merger and the RoweCom, eshare and Open Market mergers.  

    Based upon 22,270,386 shares of Eprise common stock issued and outstanding on October 1, 2001 and the 2.4233 Eprise exchange ratio, divine will
issue approximately 53,968,000 shares of
divine common stock upon completion of the Eprise merger. Based upon approximately 13,552,745 shares of RoweCom common stock issued and outstanding on October 1, 2001 and the 0.75 RoweCom
exchange ratio, divine will issue approximately 10,164,558 shares of divine common stock upon completion of the RoweCom merger. Based upon approximately 21,934,486 eshare common shares issued and
outstanding and an eshare exchange ratio of 3.12 on October 1, 2001, divine will issue approximately 68,435,596 shares of divine common stock upon completion of the eshare merger. In addition,
divine will issue 44,454,961 shares of divine common stock upon completion of the Open Market merger. Based on the foregoing assumptions, an aggregate of approximately 130,479,384 shares
of divine common stock issued in this merger and the RoweCom, eshare and Open Market mergers will be eligible for sale in the public market without restriction under the Securities Act, and an
aggregate of approximately 55,536,209 shares of divine common stock issued in this merger and the RoweCom, eshare and Open Market mergers to affiliates of Eprise, RoweCom, eshare or Open Market
will be eligible for sale subject to the volume, manner of sale and other limitations of Rule 145 or Rule 144 under the Securities Act. The market price of divine common stock could
decline as a result of these sales or the perception that these sales could occur. 

    Aleksander
Szlam, the chairman and chief executive officer of eshare, and Szlam Partners have agreed with divine that, for a period of one year from the date of the closing of the
eshare merger, they will not offer to sell, contract to sell, or otherwise sell, dispose of, loan, pledge or grant any rights with respect to the significant number of shares of divine common stock
(approximately 33,527,423 as of October 1, 2001) they will receive in connection with the eshare merger, other than their right to sell shares directly to divine pursuant to the terms of their
stockholder agreement with divine. Similarly, in connection with divine's acquisition of Emicom Group, Inc., certain of the founders of Emicom have agreed that, until July 18, 2002, they
will not offer to sell, contract to sell, or otherwise sell, dispose of, loan, pledge or grant any rights with respect to the 6,179,104 shares of divine common stock they received in that
transaction. Further, in connection with divine's acquisition from UBS AG of a 21% equity interest in Parlano, Inc., UBS has agreed that, until September 28, 2002, UBS will not
transfer during any three-month period more than 15% of the 3,596,007 shares of divine common stock it received in that transaction. An early waiver of these lock-up agreements by
us could permit sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock and could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.

THE EPRISE SPECIAL MEETING    

    This proxy statement/prospectus is being mailed on or about          , 2001 to holders of record of Eprise common stock as of the close of business on
          , 2001, and constitutes notice of the Eprise special meeting in conformity with the requirements of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. It is accompanied by a proxy
card furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Eprise board for use at the special meeting and at any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting. 

Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting  

    The Eprise special meeting is scheduled to be held as follows: 

             , 2001

10:00 a.m., local time

at the offices of Hill & Barlow

One International Place

Boston, Massachusetts  

 Matters to be Considered at the Eprise Special Meeting  

    The purpose of the special meeting of Eprise's stockholders is to consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger.
You may also consider and vote upon such other matters as may be properly brought before the Eprise special meeting, including any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting. The merger cannot
occur unless the holders of a majority of Eprise's outstanding common stock as of the record date vote in favor of the proposal to adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger. 

The Eprise board of directors unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger, and recommends a vote FOR adoption and approval of the merger agreement
and the merger.

Record Date for the Eprise Special Meeting and Voting Rights  

    Only holders of record of Eprise common stock at the close of business on the record date,          , 2001, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at,
the special meeting. At the close of business on the record date, there were         shares of Eprise common stock outstanding held by approximately    holders
of record. Each holder of record of Eprise common stock on the record date will be entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted upon at the special meeting. As of the record
date, Eprise's directors and executive officers and their affiliates held approximately 13.0% of the outstanding shares of Eprise common stock. These directors and executive officers have indicated
their intention to vote, or cause to be voted, the shares beneficially owned by them in favor of the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger. 

Quorum; Required Votes; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes  

    The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Eprise common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting is
necessary to constitute a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes, which are executed proxies returned by a broker holding shares in street name that indicate that the broker has not
received voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares and does not have discretionary authority to vote the shares with respect to the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and
the merger, will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. 

    Adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Eprise common stock outstanding as of the record date. All
properly executed proxies delivered and not properly revoked will be voted at the special meeting as specified in such proxies. If you do not specify a choice, your shares represented by a signed
proxy will be voted "FOR" the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger. The failure to submit a vote by proxy card, by telephone, over the Internet or in person at the special
meeting, an abstention and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger. 

Proxies; Solicitation of Proxies  

    To vote by proxy, you should complete your proxy card and mail it in the enclosed postage prepaid envelope. Alternatively, you may vote by telephone or over
the Internet. If you vote by telephone or over the Internet, you must do so by 12:00 p.m. Eastern time on          , 2001, and you will be required to have the control number appearing
on your proxy card available in order to submit your vote. A properly completed telephone or Internet vote has the same effect as if you marked, signed and returned the proxy card by mail. See the
instructions on the proxy card for a description of the telephone and Internet voting procedures. We believe that the granting of proxies by telephone or the Internet is valid under Delaware law.
Please note that if you choose to vote over the Internet, you are responsible for any Internet access charges incurred. 

    If
your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you must direct them on how to vote your shares. Your broker or bank will vote your shares only if you provide
directions on how to vote by following the instructions provided to you by your broker or bank. 

    Eprise
does not expect that any matter other than adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger will be brought before the special meeting. If, however, other matters
are properly presented, the persons named as proxies will vote in accordance with their judgment with respect to those matters. 

    The
cost of the solicitation of proxies from holders of Eprise common stock and all related costs will be borne by Eprise. In addition, Eprise may reimburse brokerage firms and other
persons representing beneficial owners of shares for their expenses in forwarding solicitation materials to such beneficial owners. Original solicitation of proxies by mail may be supplemented by
telephone, telecopy, e-mail or personal solicitation by directors, officers or other regular employees of Eprise. No additional compensation will be paid to directors, officers or other
regular employees for these services. 

    You
should not send in any Eprise stock certificates with your proxy card. The exchange agent will mail a transmittal letter to you containing instructions for the surrender of Eprise
stock certificates as soon as practicable after completion of the merger. 

Revocability of Proxies  

    You may revoke and change your vote at any time prior to the special meeting by: 


notifying
Eprise in writing at 200 Crossing Boulevard, Framingham, Massachusetts 01702 Attn: Investor Relations, that you would like to revoke your proxy; 

submitting
another proxy with a later date by mail, telephone or over the Internet; or 

appearing
in person and voting at the special meeting (merely attending the special meeting will not revoke your previously-granted proxy and change your
vote; you must cast a vote at the special meeting). 

If

THE MERGER    

    This section of the proxy statement/prospectus describes material aspects of the proposed merger. While we believe that the description covers the material
terms of the merger, this summary may not contain all the information that is important to you. You should therefore carefully read this entire proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents we
refer to, including the merger agreement attached as Appendix A, and incorporate by reference for a more complete understanding of the merger. 

Structure of the Merger  

    If the Eprise stockholders adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger, and all other conditions to the merger agreement are satisfied, DI2
Acquisition Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine, will merge into Eprise. As a result, DI2 will cease its separate corporate existence and become a part of Eprise, the surviving corporation,
which will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine. We currently anticipate that we will complete the merger on or about             , 2001. 

Background of the Merger  

    Over the past several months, Eprise's board of directors and management have considered a number of strategic alternatives to maximize Eprise stockholder
value in light of adverse changes to the market for web content management and delivery solutions and a decline in the overall economy. 

    Eprise
has experienced operating losses in each quarterly and annual period since its inception. Eprise incurred net losses of $5.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 1998, $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 and $14.4 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2001. Furthermore, the general economic climate has been deteriorating since the fourth quarter of 2000, which served to decrease information technology spending by Eprise's
customers and potential customers. This decrease has adversely affected Eprise's ability to maintain and increase its
sales and operating revenues since the third quarter of 2000. The resulting operating losses, coupled with a significant downturn in the public equity markets, significantly reduced Eprise's market
capitalization and adversely affected its long-term prospects. 

    Faced
with continued operating losses and flat revenues, Eprise began to consider various strategic alternatives, including corporate partnering initiatives, strategic private
placements, strategic acquisitions and/or combinations, and, ultimately, the sale of the company. At its April 24, 2001 meeting, the Eprise board of directors decided to engage Broadview
International LLC as a financial advisor to assist Eprise in identifying possible strategic alternatives. Broadview had previously worked with Eprise before its initial public offering. Broadview's
knowledge of Eprise, its technology, products, and markets, as well as Broadview's reputation, background and experience in the industry were important factors in the board's decision to engage
Broadview for this purpose. 

    Beginning
on April 12, 2001, Eprise management and other employees began meeting with representatives of Broadview to review information about Eprise's business and financial
condition, as well as a list of parties with which Eprise might seek a business combination or other strategic relationship. 

    From
April 2001 through July 2001, management and representatives of Broadview contacted approximately 15 companies regarding a potential strategic combination with 

Eprise, had preliminary discussions with five of these companies, and engaged in extensive discussions and negotiations with one of Eprise's competitors regarding a potential merger. 

    On
several dates in May and June, 2001, management of Eprise met with management of the competing company referred to above regarding a possible business combination. Representatives
from Broadview and from the other company's financial advisor were present at some of these meetings. 

    At
meetings held in June and July of 2001, Eprise's board of directors, management and representatives from Broadview discussed various strategic alternatives, including possible
strategic investments, and continued negotiations with the company referred to above. 

    On
July 23, 2001, the other company informed Eprise that it had received another offer that its board of directors was obligated to consider, and that it was subject to a
10-day non-solicitation agreement that prohibited it from continuing negotiations with Eprise during that time period. 

    On
July 24, 2001, Eprise held a regularly scheduled meeting of its board of directors, during which the board discussed sales results for the second quarter, projections for
the third quarter, the status of negotiations with the other company, and other strategic alternatives, including a potential acquisition of complementary technology. 

    On
August 3, 2001, Gavin Coote, vice president of mergers and acquisitions for divine, and Rodney Bienvenu, president of divine's enterprise portal software group, held a
conference call with Joseph Forgione, president and chief executive officer of Eprise, and Milt Alpern, senior vice president and chief financial officer of Eprise, and representatives of Broadview,
to introduce the parties and consider the advisability of meeting to discuss a potential transaction. 

    On
August 9, 2001, at the request of divine, Mr. Forgione, Mr. Alpern, and Hank Barnes, vice president of strategy for Eprise, met with Mr. Bienvenu,
Mr. Coote, and other members of divine's acquisition team at Eprise's offices in Framingham, Massachusetts to discuss the respective businesses of Eprise and divine and the potential synergies
between the two companies. Mr. Bienvenu expressed divine's interest in continuing discussions with Eprise. 

    On
August 16, 2001, Eprise learned that the other company with which it had been engaged in negotiations had entered into an agreement to be acquired by a third party. 

    On
August 21, 2001, Andrew Filipowski, divine's chairman and chief executive officer, and Mr. Coote met with Messrs. Forgione and Alpern at Eprise's offices in
Framingham. At this meeting, Mr. Filipowski led a discussion of divine's strategic plans. 

    On
August 22, 2001, divine delivered to Eprise a proposed term sheet outlining the terms of a possible transaction. 

    On
August 24, 2001, a meeting of the board of directors of Eprise was held at Eprise's headquarters with representatives of Broadview and management to review the proposed term
sheet. During the meeting, management also discussed Eprise's forecasts for the third quarter of 2001 and other alternatives to a transaction, including liquidation of Eprise. Eprise's board
authorized Eprise to enter into a 17-day exclusivity agreement with divine and to begin the negotiation of a definitive merger agreement. 

    Also
on August 24, 2001, divine's legal counsel, Bell, Boyd & Lloyd LLC, submitted to Eprise's legal counsel, Hill & Barlow, a draft of a mutual confidentiality
and exclusivity agreement that would prohibit Eprise, during the 17-day exclusivity period, from engaging in 

discussions with respect to, among other things, change in control transactions with parties other than divine. The parties discussed the draft agreement with their respective legal counsel, and on
August 27, 2001, both parties executed the agreement. 

    From
August 28, 2001 through August 31, 2001, representatives from divine, Eprise, and their respective auditors met in Eprise's offices in Framingham for business and
financial due diligence on Eprise, focusing on Eprise's license and partnering agreements, sales pipeline, and other general corporate matters. divine's due diligence activities continued
off-site through the week of September 4, 2001. 

    On
August 30, 2001, Bell, Boyd & Lloyd delivered to Hill & Barlow a draft of the proposed merger agreement. 

    On
September 4 and 5, 2001, representatives of Hill & Barlow met with representatives of divine at divine's offices in Lisle, Illinois for business and legal due
diligence on divine. 

    On
September 5, 2001, Mr. Forgione met with Paul Humenansky, divine's chief operating officer, and Michael Cullinane, divine's chief financial officer, at divine's
offices in Chicago to discuss business integration issues. 

    Also
on September 5, 2001, Mr. Forgione met with Mr. Filipowski, Mr. Coote, and Alex Walker, executive vice president, mergers and acquisitions, divine, to
discuss the terms of the merger and related issues of business strategy and organization going forward. 

    Between
September 5, 2001 and September 17, 2001, representatives from divine and Eprise, their respective legal counsel and Broadview engaged in a series of discussions
to negotiate
the terms and conditions of the definitive Eprise merger agreement and related documentation. Throughout this period, both parties and their legal, financial and accounting advisors conducted a
detailed due diligence review of the other party's business, financial condition and operations. 

    On
September 7, 2001, the divine board of directors, with one director not present, held a special meeting to consider the terms of the proposed Eprise transaction and
additional due diligence findings. Representatives of senior management also participated. divine's transaction team led the discussion by summarizing additional due diligence findings and reporting
on the status of the Eprise merger negotiations. divine's board of directors then unanimously adopted and approved the Eprise merger agreement and ancillary agreements contemplated by the Eprise
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and unanimously recommended that the stockholders of divine approve the issuance of divine common stock in the Eprise merger. 

    On
September 9, 2001, a meeting of the Eprise board of directors was held at Eprise's Framingham offices. Representatives of Hill & Barlow and Broadview also
participated. During the meeting, Broadview provided the board members with its preliminary financial analysis of the transaction with divine, the board discussed the proposed terms of the
transaction, and representatives from Hill & Barlow outlined the terms of the current draft of the merger agreement. Representatives of Hill & Barlow also advised the board with respect
to its fiduciary obligations and reported on their due diligence review of divine. The board and Hill & Barlow then discussed the relative merits and the timing and legal issues surrounding the
proposed transaction, as well as the alternative of liquidating Eprise. 

    On
September 11, 2001, the parties agreed to postpone temporarily the final negotiation and execution of the merger agreement because of the terrorist attacks in New York and
Washington, D.C. 

    On September 14, 2001, the parties agreed to extend the exclusivity period through September 21, 2001. From September 14, 2001 through September 17, 2001,
representatives from divine and Eprise, their respective legal counsel and Broadview participated in a series of discussions to negotiate the final terms and conditions of the definitive merger
agreement and related documentation. 

    On
September 17, 2001, the Eprise board of directors held a special meeting to consider the final terms of the proposed transaction with divine. Representatives of Broadview
and Hill &
Barlow also participated. Representatives of Hill & Barlow reviewed the significant terms of the merger agreement and summarized the board's fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed
transaction. Representatives of Broadview then presented their financial analyses with respect to the proposed business combination with divine. Following this presentation, Broadview delivered its
oral opinion that, as of such date and based upon and subject to certain assumptions and matters set forth in the opinion, the transaction exchange ratio is fair from a financial point of view to the
holders of Eprise common stock. This opinion was confirmed in a letter subsequently delivered by Broadview, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix B.
Following the presentations and further discussions, including full consideration of the liquidation alternative, the Eprise board unanimously determined that the merger agreement, and the
transactions contemplated thereby, were advisable, fair and in the best interests of Eprise and its stockholders, unanimously adopted and approved the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, and unanimously recommended that stockholders of Eprise approve the merger. 

    On
September 17, 2001, immediately following the board meeting, the merger agreement and other ancillary documents were executed. 

    On
September 18, 2001, prior to the opening of the Nasdaq National Market, divine and Eprise issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the merger agreement. 

Reasons for the Merger  

    Joint Reasons for the Merger.
  The boards of directors of divine and Eprise independently concluded that they expect
that the proposed merger will: 


afford
to each company the complementary strengths of the two individual companies;


provide
the combined company significant potential advantages and resources; and


enable
the combined company to address emerging strategic opportunities more quickly and effectively. 

divine
and Eprise have each identified additional reasons for the merger, as discussed below. It should be noted, however, that the potential benefits of the merger may not be fully realized, if at
all. See "Risk Factors" beginning on page 25. 

    divine's Reasons for the Merger.
  In addition to the anticipated joint benefits described above, divine believes that
Eprise's products, technology and client base are compatible with divine's enterprise Web solutions business strategy. divine also believes that the combination of Eprise's content management
software, in particular Eprise Participant Server, with divine's software applications and sales and marketing infrastructure will enable the combined company to further its strategy of providing
Web-based technology, professional services, and managed applications that help global enterprises conveniently and cost-effectively manage information resources and engage
their constituencies. 

    Eprise's Reasons for the Merger.
  The Eprise board of directors believes that the merger is fair to Eprise's
stockholders and in their best interests, and has unanimously recommended the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger. In reaching its determination to approve the merger, the
merger agreement and the related transactions, the Eprise board of directors considered a number of factors in addition to those described above. The following summarizes the material factors the
Eprise board of directors considered: 


the
current state of Eprise's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, given the general economic climate and the highly
competitive nature of the industry in which Eprise operates, including the fact that Eprise's ability to attract new customers and generate revenues has been hampered by a general decrease in
information technology spending by prospective customers and by market concerns about Eprise's long-term viability given its stock price;


the
strategic viability and economic terms of possible alternatives to the transaction with divine, including continuing as an independent entity and
entering into strategic financing or business arrangements with other industry participants or entering into a combination with another company in the content management and delivery market or a
related market, and the conclusion that these alternatives could not be completed on acceptable terms, if at all;


the
likelihood that the value of the consideration to be received by stockholders in the merger would exceed any amount to be distributed upon any
liquidation of Eprise, after payment of various liquidation expenses, given the upside potential created by the merger;


the
possible synergies to be realized from a merger with divine, including the opportunity for the combined businesses of Eprise and divine to employ
divine's significant financial and technical resources: to help expand the market for Eprise's current products; to offer a broader suite of products and services encompassing software products,
professional services and application hosting; to accelerate the introduction of next-generation, content-driven customer interaction products built upon the foundation of Eprise's content
management products; and to benefit immediately and in the long-term from divine's global sales and marketing presence, including through divine's execution of a reseller agreement,
concurrently with signing the merger agreement, to begin distributing Eprise's products immediately;


the
opportunity for Eprise's stockholders to continue to participate in the potential future growth and success of Eprise and divine and the possible
synergies to be realized from the merger through their receipt of shares of divine common stock in the merger;


the
likelihood of completing the merger, given the need for relatively few regulatory approvals or consents, and the favorable prospects for receiving
these necessary approvals and consents and completing the merger;


the
terms of the merger agreement, including those relating to the board recommendation, the holding of the Eprise stockholder meeting, the $2,000,000
termination fee payable by Eprise under specified circumstances, the effect that the merger agreement would have on Eprise's ability to pursue or complete an alternative transaction, and the fact that
the merger agreement was the product of arm's-length negotiations; 


the
proposed acquisitions by divine of eshare communications, Inc., RoweCom Inc. and Open Market, Inc., and the opportunities and
risks associated with combining their businesses with those of divine and Eprise;


the
fact that the consideration to be received by Eprise stockholders in the merger is expected to be tax-free to those stockholders for U.S.
federal income tax purposes;


the
historical market prices and recent trading activity of shares of Eprise common stock and divine common stock, including the fact that the offer price
per share of Eprise common
stock implied by the exchange ratio represents a significant premium to the market price of Eprise common stock relative to that of divine common stock at the time the merger agreement was executed;
and


the
opinion of Broadview International LLC, Eprise's financial advisor, that the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement is fair, from a financial
point of view, to holders of Eprise common stock. 

The
Eprise board of directors also identified and considered a number of uncertainties and risks concerning the merger, including: 


the
risks described under "Risk Factors" beginning on page 25.


the
risk that the per share value of the consideration actually received by Eprise stockholders might be significantly less than the per share price
implied by the exchange ratio prior to the announcement of the merger because the exchange ratio will not be adjusted for changes in market price of either divine common stock or Eprise common stock;


the
risk that the per share value of the merger consideration may be less than the liquidation value of Eprise;


the
risk that the benefits sought in the merger and the related transactions might not be achieved;


the
difficulty of integrating the businesses of Eprise and divine, and the possible adverse effects that could result from the need for senior management
to focus significant time and effort on completing the merger and integrating the businesses;


the
risk that Eprise might suffer employee attrition or fail to attract key personnel due to uncertainties associated with the merger, and that customers
may delay purchases of Eprise's products until the merger is completed;


the
substantial price volatility and price decline that divine's common stock has experienced in the past year;


the
risk that divine's common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market;


the
risk that eshare may terminate the eshare merger agreement on any date prior to the date of the eshare special meeting if the average closing sale
price of divine's common stock for a ten trading day period, under certain circumstances, is less than $1.00; and


the
risk that the merger might not be consummated and the other applicable risks described in this proxy statement/prospectus under "Risk
FactorsRisks Relating to the Proposed Merger" beginning on page 25. 

    In
considering the proposed merger, the directors of Eprise were aware of these risks, as well as the interests of certain officers and directors in the merger described under
"Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger" beginning on page 63. 

    In
light of the wide variety of factors that the Eprise board of directors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger agreement and the complexity of these matters,
the Eprise board of directors did not quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the factors it considered. In addition, individual members of the Eprise board may have given different weights
to different factors. However, the Eprise board as a whole made its determinations and recommendations based on the totality of the information presented to and considered by it. Based on the
foregoing analysis, the Eprise board of directors has determined that the merger agreement and the merger are advisable and in the best interests of Eprise and you and unanimously recommends that you
vote 
FOR
 adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger. 

Fairness Opinion of Broadview International LLC  

    Pursuant to a letter agreement dated as of May 7, 2001, Eprise engaged Broadview International LLC to act as financial advisor to Eprise's board of
directors. The Eprise board of directors selected Broadview based on Broadview's reputation and experience in the information technology, communication and media sector and the Web content management
industry in particular. Broadview focuses on providing merger and acquisition advisory services to information technology, communications and media companies. In this capacity,
Broadview is continually engaged in valuing these businesses and maintains an extensive database of information technology, communications and media mergers and acquisitions information for
comparative purposes. At the meeting of the Eprise board of directors on September 17, 2001, Broadview rendered its opinion that, as of September 17, 2001, based upon and subject to the
various factors and assumptions described in the Broadview opinion, the exchange ratio to be received in the merger by holders of Eprise common stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders. 

    Broadview's
opinion, which describes the assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by Broadview, is incorporated by reference and attached as
Appendix B to this proxy statement/prospectus. You are urged to, and should, read the Broadview opinion carefully and in its entirety. The Broadview opinion is directed to the Eprise board of
directors and addresses only the fairness of the exchange ratio to be received by you in the merger, from a financial point of view, to you, as of the date of the opinion. The Broadview opinion does
not address any other aspect of the merger and does not constitute a recommendation to you as to how to vote at the special meeting. The summary of the Broadview opinion set forth in this proxy
statement/prospectus, although materially complete, is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. 

    In
connection with rendering its opinion, Broadview, among other things: 


reviewed
the terms of the draft Eprise merger agreement furnished to Broadview on September 17, 2001;


reviewed
certain publicly available financial statements and other information on Eprise and divine, respectively;


reviewed
certain internal financial and operating information for Eprise and divine prepared and provided to Broadview by Eprise and divine management
respectively; 


participated
in discussions with Eprise and divine management concerning the operations, business strategy, financial performance and prospects for Eprise
and divine, respectively;


discussed
the strategic rationale for the Eprise merger with Eprise and divine management, respectively;


reviewed
the recent reported closing prices and trading activity for Eprise and divine common stock, respectively;


compared
aspects of the financial performance of Eprise and divine with other comparable public companies;


analyzed
available information, both public and private, concerning other comparable mergers and acquisitions;


reviewed
recent equity research analyst reports covering Eprise and divine;


analyzed
the anticipated effect of the Eprise merger on the future financial performance of divine;


participated
in discussions related to the merger with Eprise, divine and their respective advisors; and


conducted
other financial studies, analyses and investigations as Broadview deemed appropriate for purposes of its opinion. 

    In
rendering its opinion, Broadview relied, without independent verification, on the accuracy and completeness of all the financial and other information, including the
representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement, that was publicly available or furnished to Broadview by Eprise, divine or their respective advisors. With respect to the financial
outlooks examined by Broadview, Broadview assumed that they were prepared reasonably and reflected the best available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of Eprise and divine as to
the future performance of Eprise and divine, respectively. Broadview also assumed that Eprise is not involved currently in any material transaction as of the date of Broadview's opinion other than the
merger, other publicly announced transactions, any other transactions of which Broadview was aware and those activities undertaken by Eprise in the ordinary course of conducting its business. 

    Broadview
did not make or obtain any independent appraisal or valuation of any of Eprise's assets. Broadview's opinion necessarily is based upon market, economic, financial and other
conditions as they existed and could be evaluated as of September 17, 2001, and any change in such conditions since that date would require a reevaluation of Broadview's opinion. The Broadview
opinion did not express any opinion as to the price at which divine common stock will trade at any time in the future. 

    The
following is a brief summary of some of the sources of information and valuation methodologies employed by Broadview in rendering its opinion. These analyses were presented to the
Eprise board of directors at its meeting on September 17, 2001. This summary includes the financial analyses used by Broadview and deemed to be material, but does not purport to be a complete
description of analyses performed by Broadview in arriving at its opinion. Broadview did not assign explicitly any relative weights to the various factors of analyses considered. This summary of
financial analyses includes information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Broadview, the 

tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. 

Eprise Stock Performance Analysis  

    Broadview compared the recent stock performance of Eprise with that of the NASDAQ Composite and the Eprise Comparable Index. The Eprise Comparable Index is
comprised of public companies that Broadview deemed comparable to Eprise. Broadview selected companies competing in the Web content management and electronic customer relationship management, or eCRM,
industries with Trailing Twelve Month ("TTM") revenue less than $100 million and Projected Calendar 2001 revenue growth between 50% and 20%. The Eprise Comparable Index consists of the
following companies: Exchange Applications, Inc.; Viador Inc.; Digital Impact, Inc.; ServiceWare Technologies, Inc.; Primus Knowledge Solutions, Inc.; Accrue
Software, Inc.; Delano Technology Corporation; Blue Martini Software, Inc.; and NetGenesis Corp. 

Public Company Comparables Analysis  

    Broadview considered ratios of share price and market capitalization, adjusted for cash and debt when necessary, to selected operating metrics in order to
derive multiples placed on a
company in a particular market segment. In order to perform this analysis, Broadview compared financial information of Eprise with publicly available information for the companies comprising the
Eprise Comparable Index. For this analysis, as well as other analyses, Broadview examined publicly available information. 

    The
following table presents, as of September 17, 2001, the median multiple and the range of multiples for the Eprise Comparable Index of equity market capitalization or total

    No company utilized in the public company comparables analysis as a comparison is identical to Eprise. In evaluating the comparables, Broadview
made numerous assumptions with respect to Web content management and eCRM industry performance and general economic conditions, many of which are beyond the control of Eprise. Mathematical analysis,
such as determining the median, average or range, is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable company data. 

Transaction Comparables Analysis  

    Broadview considered ratios of equity purchase price, adjusted for the seller's cash and debt when appropriate, to selected historical operating results in
order to indicate multiples strategic and financial acquirers have been willing to pay for companies in a particular market segment. In order to perform this analysis, Broadview reviewed a number of
transactions that it considered similar to the merger. Broadview selected these transactions by choosing recent transactions involving sellers in the Web content management and eCRM industries with
TTM revenue less than $100 million. For this analysis, as well as other analyses, Broadview examined publicly available information, as well as information from Broadview's proprietary database
of published and confidential merger and acquisition transactions in the information technology, communication and media industries. These transactions consisted of the acquisition of: 


YOUcentric, Inc.
by JD Edwards & Company;


NetObjects, Inc.
(Enterprise Division) by Merant Incorporated;


Open

eshare

    No transaction utilized as a comparable in the transaction comparables analysis is identical to the merger. In evaluating the comparables,
Broadview made numerous assumptions with respect to the Web content management and eCRM industry's performance and general economic conditions, many of which are beyond the control of Eprise or
divine. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the average, median or range, is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable transaction data. 

Transaction Premiums Paid Analysis  

    Broadview considered the premiums paid above a seller's share price in order to determine the additional value that strategic and financial acquirers, when
compared to public stockholders, are willing to pay for companies in a particular market segment. In order to perform this analysis, Broadview reviewed a number of transactions involving
publicly-held
software companies. Broadview selected these transactions from its proprietary database by choosing transactions since January 1, 1999 with an equity purchase price between $25 million
and $100 million. These transactions consisted of the acquisition of:

    No transaction utilized as a comparable in the transaction premiums paid analysis is identical to the merger. In evaluating the comparables,
Broadview made numerous assumptions with respect to the software industry's performance and general economic conditions, many of which are beyond the control of Eprise or divine. Mathematical
analysis, such as determining the average, median or range is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable transaction data. 

Present Value of Projected Share Price Analysis  

    Broadview calculated the present value of potential future share prices of Eprise common stock on a stand-alone basis using Eprise management estimates for the
12 months ending December 31, 2002. The implied share price calculated using the median total market capitalization to last 12 months revenue multiple for the Eprise Comparable
Index and a discount rate determined by the Capital Asset Pricing Model with the risk implied by the past stock performance of the Eprise Comparable Index was not meaningful. The implied share price
calculated using the total market capitalization to last 12 months revenue multiple for Eprise and a discount rate determined by the Capital Asset Pricing Model with the risk implied by the
past stock performance of Eprise was not meaningful. Broadview also examined the effects of potential variations in the December 31, 2002 revenue estimate. 

Liquidation Analysis  

    Broadview considered the estimated per share liquidation value of Eprise if Eprise were to cease operations and liquidate its assets at various points in time
in the future. Using Eprise balance sheet projections provided to Broadview by Eprise management and working with Eprise management to make recovery and pay-out assumptions, Broadview
derived a cash per diluted share amount that would be distributed to Eprise stockholders in the event of
liquidation. Based on these estimates, if Eprise were to liquidate on September 30, 2001, the per share value would be $1.60, which amount would likely decline over time. 

Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis  

    Broadview compared the ratios of the closing prices of Eprise common stock divided by the corresponding prices of divine common stock over the period from
September 15, 2000 through September 17, 2001, referred to as the historical exchange ratio, with the exchange ratio contained in the merger agreement. The historical exchange ratio has
ranged from 0.307 to 2.939, with an average of 1.007. 

Relative Contribution Analysis  

    Broadview examined the relative contribution of Eprise to divine plus Eprise for a number of operating metrics. The following metrics were examined: Last 12
Months Revenue; Last Quarter Annualized Revenue; Projected Calendar Year 2001 Revenue; Projected Calendar Year 2002 Revenue; and Net Cash as of June 30, 2001. Eprise's relative contributions
for these operating metrics ranged from 6.4% to 26.2%. 

    At
the Eprise merger consideration, the implied equity ownership is 25.9% for Eprise and 74.1% for divine, while the implied entity ownership (equal to equity value plus total debt
minus cash and cash equivalents) is not meaningful because both companies trade below cash. 

divine Stock Performance Analysis  

    Broadview compared the recent stock performance of divine with that of the NASDAQ Composite and the divine Comparable Index. The divine Comparable Index is
comprised of public companies that Broadview deemed comparable to divine. Broadview selected companies competing in the technology-focused Internet services industry with Projected 12/31/01 revenue
between $100 million and $500 million. The divine Comparable Index consists of the following companies: Answerthink, Inc.; Sapient Corporation; Digitas, Inc.; and eLoyalty
Corporation. 

Evaluation of divine Equity  

    Broadview compared financial information of divine with publicly available information for companies comprising the divine Comparable Index. For this analysis,
as well as other analyses, Broadview examined publicly available information, as well as a range of estimates based on securities research analyst reports. 

Pro Forma Combination Analysis  

    Broadview calculated the pro forma impact of the merger on the combined entity's projected earnings per share for the fiscal quarter ending December 31,
2001 and the fiscal year ending December 31, 2002 taking into consideration various financial effects which will result from a completion of the merger. This analysis relies upon certain
financial and operating assumptions obtained from both management and publicly available sources about Eprise and divine. Broadview assumed that the merger would be treated as a purchase transaction
for accounting purposes and that no opportunities for cost savings or revenue enhancements exist. Based on this analysis, the pro forma purchase model indicates
earnings-per-share increases of $0.02 for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2002 and earnings-per-share decreases of $0.01 for the fiscal year
ending December 31, 2002. 

Consideration of the Discounted Cash Flow Methodology  

    While discounted cash flow is a commonly used valuation methodology, Broadview did not employ such an analysis for the purposes of this opinion. Discounted
cash flow analysis is most appropriate for companies which exhibit relatively steady or somewhat predictable streams of future cash flow. Given the uncertainty in estimating both the future cash flows
and a sustainable long-term growth rate for Eprise, Broadview considered a discounted cash flow analysis inappropriate for valuing Eprise. 

    The
preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Broadview
considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it. Furthermore, Broadview believes that selecting any
portion
of its analyses, without considering all analyses, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion. 

    In
performing its analyses, Broadview made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance and general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are
beyond the control of Eprise or divine. The analyses performed by Broadview are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable
than suggested by such analyses. The consideration to be received by you pursuant to the merger agreement and other terms of the merger agreement were determined through arm's length negotiations
between Eprise and divine, and were approved by the Eprise board of directors. Broadview participated in discussions with the Eprise board of directors during those negotiations. However, Broadview
did not recommend any specific consideration to the Eprise board of directors or that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger. In addition, Broadview's
opinion and presentation to the Eprise board of directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Eprise board of directors in making its decision to approve the merger. Consequently,
the Broadview analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Eprise board of directors with respect to the value of Eprise or of whether the Eprise board of
directors would have been willing to agree to a different consideration. 

    Upon
completion of the merger, Eprise will be obligated to pay Broadview a transaction fee of approximately $1,000,000. Eprise has already paid Broadview a fairness opinion fee of
$300,000. The fairness opinion fee will be credited against the transaction fee payable by Eprise upon completion of the merger. In addition, Eprise has agreed to reimburse Broadview for its
professional expense. The terms of the fee arrangement with Broadview, which Eprise and Broadview believe are customary in transactions of this nature, were negotiated at arm's length between Eprise
and Broadview, and the Eprise board of directors was aware of the nature of the fee arrangement, including the fact that a significant portion of the fees payable to Broadview is contingent upon
completion of the merger. 

Accounting Treatment  

    divine will record the merger using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This means that for
financial reporting purposes, divine will treat both companies as one company beginning as of the date we complete the merger. In addition, under this method of accounting, divine will record the fair
value of Eprise's net assets on its consolidated financial statements, with the remaining purchase price in excess of the fair value of Eprise's net assets recorded as goodwill. See "Unaudited Pro
Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements" beginning on page 81. 

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger  

    In considering the recommendation of the Eprise board of directors that Eprise stockholders adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger, you should
be aware that certain directors and executive officers of Eprise have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as stockholders of Eprise. The Eprise board of
directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in adopting and approving the merger agreement and the merger. 

    Options.
  All of the options held by Eprise's directors and executive officers, whether or not vested, will convert into
options to purchase shares of divine common stock upon completion of the merger. The number of divine shares underlying the options and the exercise prices will be adjusted as described under "The
Merger AgreementTreatment of Outstanding Options." Vesting of options to purchase Eprise common stock granted to non-employee directors of Eprise under Eprise's 2000
Non-employee Director Stock Option Plan and options granted to Eprise's chief executive officer under Eprise's 1997 Stock Option Plan accelerates fully at the completion of the merger. In
addition, non-employee directors will have a period of two years following termination of their service as directors to exercise their options. Vesting of the options held by Eprise's executive
officers other than the chief executive officer accelerates at the completion of the merger so that all options that would have vested on the next annual installment date become immediately
exercisable. In addition, if any executive officer experiences a material adverse change in position within one year after the merger, vesting of an additional 50% of his or her then-unvested options
will accelerate. Based on the closing sale price of divine's common stock of $0.55 on October 1, 2001, Eprise's directors and
executive officers and their affiliates would receive options to purchase approximately 1,558,900 shares of divine common stock. 

    Indemnification and Insurance.
  Upon completion of the merger, the surviving corporation will fulfill and honor all of
Eprise's existing obligations to indemnify the officers and directors of Eprise and its subsidiaries. In addition, divine will indemnify Eprise's officers and directors for acts or omissions in such
capacity occurring prior to the completion of the merger. Further, for six years after the completion of the merger, the surviving corporation's certificate of incorporation and bylaws will contain
indemnification provisions as favorable to the officers and directors of Eprise or its subsidiaries as the indemnification provisions in Eprise's current certificate of incorporation and bylaws. 

    Upon
completion of the merger, the surviving corporation will provide directors' and officers' liability insurance covering those persons who were covered by Eprise's directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy as of the date of the merger agreement. However, the 

surviving corporation will not be required to spend more than 150% of the annual premium currently paid by Eprise for that coverage. 

    Loan Forgiveness.
  Between October 1999 and April 2001, Eprise loaned money to certain of its executive
officers under its stock loan program to fund those officers' exercise of options granted under Eprise's 1997 Stock Option Plan and payment of federal alternative minimum tax related to those
exercises. The loan agreements under which those loans were made provide that, if Eprise enters into a "change in control" transaction (defined to include a merger, asset sale or liquidation) on or
before December 31, 2002, all amounts due to Eprise under those loan agreements will be forgiven. As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, there were loans outstanding to four
executive officers in the aggregate principal amount of $919,000. 

Stock Ownership Following the Merger  

    As of October 1, 2001, divine had approximately 164,124,076 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Based upon 22,270,386 shares of
Eprise common stock issued and outstanding on October 1, 2001 and the 2.4233 Eprise exchange ratio, divine will issue approximately 53,968,000 shares of divine common stock upon
completion of the Eprise
merger. As a result, following completion of the merger, and assuming divine does not issue any additional shares of its common stock (in other pending mergers or otherwise), Eprise stockholders would
own approximately 24.7% of the issued and outstanding shares of divine's common stock. Assuming that divine (1) completes its pending mergers with RoweCom, eshare and Open Market,
(2) issues approximately 10,164,558 shares of divine common stock pursuant to the RoweCom merger, (3) issues approximately 68,435,596 shares pursuant to the eshare merger
(based upon approximately 21,934,486 eshare common shares issued and outstanding and an eshare exchange ratio of 3.12 as of October 1, 2001), (4) issues approximately
44,454,961 shares pursuant to the Open Market merger and (5) does not issue any other shares of divine common stock prior to the closing of this merger, the existing holders of these
shares of Eprise common stock collectively will hold approximately 15.8% of divine common stock issued and outstanding after the merger. 

Regulatory Matters  

    The merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, which prevents specified transactions from
being completed until required information and materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and specified waiting periods are
terminated or expire. Because the value of the divine common stock to be issued in the merger is, as of October 1, 2001, less than $50 million, no information or materials are required
to be so filed. If the value of the divine common stock to be issued in the merger were to increase and to exceed $50 million for at least 45 consecutive days prior to the closing of the
merger, we would be required to make the relevant filings, and the closing of the merger would be delayed until the specified waiting periods from the time of filing had terminated or expired. 

    The
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission may challenge the merger on antitrust grounds, either before or after expiration of the waiting
period. Accordingly, at any time before or after the completion of the merger, either the Antitrust Division or the Federal Trade Commission could take action under the antitrust laws 

as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, or other persons could take action under the antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the merger. Additionally, at any time before or
after the completion of the merger, any state could take action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. We cannot assure you that a challenge to the merger
will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail. 

Dissenters' Rights  

    You are not entitled to dissenters' rights or appraisal rights under Delaware law in connection with the merger because you are receiving publicly traded stock
in exchange for your Eprise stock. 

Federal Securities Laws Consequences  

    The shares of divine common stock to be issued in connection with the merger will be registered under the Securities Act and will be freely transferable under
the Securities Act, except for shares of divine common stock issued to any person who is deemed to be an "affiliate" of Eprise on the date of the special meeting or of divine following completion of
the merger. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under the common control of Eprise or divine, as applicable, and may
include executive officers, directors and significant stockholders of Eprise or divine, as applicable. Affiliates of Eprise may not sell their shares of divine common stock acquired in connection with
the merger except pursuant to: 


an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of those shares;


Rule 145
(or, for Eprise stockholders who become affiliates of divine, Rule 144) under the Securities Act; or


any
other applicable exemption under the Securities Act. 

    The
merger agreement provides that Eprise will use its reasonable efforts to obtain from each of its affiliates (for purposes of Rule 145 of the Securities Act) a written
agreement providing that the affiliate will not sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of any divine common stock issued to the affiliate pursuant to the merger, except in compliance with
Rule 145 or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. 

    divine's
registration statement, of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part, does not cover the resale of shares of divine common stock to be received by Eprise affiliates in
the merger. 

Nasdaq National Market  

    The shares of divine common stock to be issued in connection with the merger are required to be approved for quotation on the Nasdaq National Market, subject
to official notice of issuance, before the completion of the merger. When the merger is completed, shares of Eprise common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market and will be
deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences  

    The following are the material United States federal income tax consequences of the merger. This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, applicable Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations and court decisions as in effect as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, all of which may change, possibly
with retroactive effect. 

    This
discussion only addresses United States federal income tax consequences of those stockholders who hold their Eprise common stock as capital assets. It does not address all
aspects of federal income taxation that may be important to you in light of your particular circumstances or if you are subject to special rules, such as: 


you
are not a citizen or resident of the United States;


you
are a financial institution or insurance company;


you
are a tax-exempt organization;


you
are a dealer or broker in securities;


you
hold your Eprise stock as part of a hedge, appreciated financial position, straddle or conversion transaction; or


you
acquired your Eprise stock by exercising options or otherwise as compensation. 

    This
discussion of material federal income tax consequences is not a complete analysis or description of all potential federal income tax consequences of the merger. This discussion
does not address tax consequences that may vary with, or are contingent on, individual circumstances. In addition, it does not address any non-income tax or any foreign, state or local tax
consequences of the merger. 

We strongly urge you to consult your own tax advisor to determine the particular United States federal, state or local or foreign income or other tax
consequences of the merger to you.  

    Tax Opinion.
  The obligations of divine and Eprise to consummate the merger are conditioned upon the receipt of a legal
opinion from Hill & Barlow, counsel to Eprise, that the merger will qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and that this opinion of counsel shall
not have been withdrawn prior to closing. However, the merger agreement provides that if Hill & Barlow does not render this tax opinion, this condition will nonetheless be deemed satisfied with
respect to Eprise if counsel to divine delivers a tax opinion to Eprise. The opinion of Hill & Barlow will rely on customary factual assumptions and customary representations made by Eprise and
divine. If any of the factual assumptions or representations relied upon by Hill & Barlow are inaccurate, the opinion may not accurately describe the federal income tax treatment of the merger,
and this discussion may not accurately describe the tax consequences of the merger. The opinion of Hill & Barlow is not binding upon the Internal Revenue Service or the courts, and it is
possible that the Internal Revenue Service or the courts will disagree with Hill & Barlow's opinion. Further, neither divine nor Eprise intends to obtain an IRS ruling on the tax consequences
of the merger. 

    If the approval of divine's stockholders is needed in order for divine to issue shares of its common stock to Eprise stockholders to complete the merger, then the obligations of
divine and Eprise to consummate the merger will also be conditioned upon the receipt of a legal opinion from Bell, Boyd & Lloyd LLC, counsel to divine, that the merger will qualify as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and that this opinion of counsel shall not have been withdrawn prior to closing. The opinion of Bell, Boyd & Lloyd would
be subject to the identical provisions set forth in the paragraph above with respect to the Hill & Barlow opinion. 

    Federal Income Tax Treatment of the Merger.
  The merger is intended to qualify as a "reorganization" under
Section 368(a)(1)(A) and Section 368(a)(2)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code. The discussion immediately below "Federal Income Tax Consequences to Eprise
Stockholders" assumes that the merger will qualify as a reorganization. 

    Federal Income Tax Consequences to Eprise Stockholders.
  Provided that the merger qualifies as a reorganization, then
for federal income tax purposes, subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications referred to herein: 


If
you exchange all of your Eprise stock solely for shares of divine common stock pursuant to the merger, you will not recognize any gain or loss upon that
exchange.


You
will have a tax basis in the divine common stock you receive in the merger equal to (1) the aggregate tax basis of the Eprise stock you
surrender in the merger, plus (2) any gain you recognize in the merger.


The
holding period for shares of divine common stock you receive in exchange for Eprise stock in the merger will include the holding period for the Eprise
stock you surrender in the merger. 

    Federal Income Tax Consequences to divine Stockholders.
  For federal income tax purposes, holders of divine common stock
will not recognize gain or loss on their divine common stock as a result of the merger. 

The preceding discussion is intended only as a summary of material United States federal income tax consequences of the merger and does not purport to be a
complete analysis or discussion of all potential tax effects relevant thereto. Thus, you are urged to consult your own tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences to you of the merger, including
tax return reporting requirements, the applicability and effect of foreign, federal, state, local and other applicable tax laws and the effect of any proposed changes in tax laws.  

THE MERGER AGREEMENT    

    The following is a summary of the material provisions of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Appendix A to this proxy
statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference. The following is not a complete statement of all provisions of the merger agreement. Statements made in this proxy statement/prospectus
with respect to the terms of the merger agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the more detailed information set forth in the merger agreement. 

The Merger  

    Following the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger by Eprise's stockholders and the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions to
the merger, DI2 Acquisition Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine, will merge with and into Eprise. As a result of the merger, DI2 Acquisition Company will cease to exist, Eprise will become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of divine and you will become a stockholder of divine. The merger will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State or at
any later time as may be specified in the certificate of merger. The filing of a certificate of merger will occur as soon as practicable after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to complete the
merger, unless divine and Eprise agree otherwise. We cannot assure you, however, that the conditions to the merger will be satisfied or waived or that the merger agreement will not be terminated. See
"Conditions of the Merger" and "Termination." 

    After
the merger: 


Eprise's
certificate of incorporation will be amended to read as set forth in Exhibit A to the merger agreement, and will govern the surviving
corporation;


the
bylaws of DI2 Acquisition Company will become the bylaws of Eprise; and


the
officers and directors of DI2 Acquisition Company will become the officers and directors of Eprise. 

Consideration to be Received in the Merger  

    Upon completion of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of Eprise common stock will be exchanged for 2.4233 shares of divine common stock. 

No Fractional Shares  

    divine will not issue fractional shares of divine common stock in the merger. Instead, any holder of Eprise common stock that would otherwise be entitled to
receive a fraction of a divine share in the merger will receive a number of divine shares rounded up or down to the nearest whole number (with fractions equal to or greater than 0.5 being rounded up). 

Procedures for Exchange of Certificates  

    As soon as practicable after the merger, the exchange agent will mail to each registered holder of Eprise common stock (1) a letter of transmittal and
(2) instructions for surrendering Eprise stock certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of divine common stock. Upon surrendering an Eprise stock certificate along with a
duly executed letter of 

transmittal and any other required documents to the exchange agent, you will be entitled to receive a certificate representing the whole number of shares of divine common stock that you have the right
to receive. 

    If
any Eprise stock certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, divine will require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Eprise stock certificate to provide an appropriate
affidavit and may require the owner to deliver a bond as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against the exchange agent, divine or Eprise with respect to such Eprise stock certificate. 

You should not surrender your Eprise stock certificates for exchange until you receive a letter of transmittal and instructions from the exchange agent.  

 Treatment of Outstanding Options and Purchase Rights  

    Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Eprise common stock under Eprise's stock option plans with an exercise price that,
when divided by 2.4233, is greater than the closing sale price of divine common stock on the trading day immediately prior to the completion of the merger, will become exercisable, at an exercise
price equal to such closing sale price of divine common stock, for a number of shares of divine common stock equal to the number of shares of Eprise common stock subject to the Eprise option. Each
outstanding Eprise option with an exercise price that, when divided by 2.4233, is less than or equal to the closing sale price of divine common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the
completion of the merger, will become exercisable, at an exercise price equal to the exercise price of the Eprise option divided by 2.4233, for a number of shares of divine common stock determined by
multiplying the number of shares of Eprise common stock subject to such Eprise option by 2.4233. As of October 1, 2001, Eprise had outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of approximately
1,799,800 shares of Eprise common stock, with exercise prices ranging from $0.255 to $17.75. 

    The
merger agreement also provides that divine will assume each promise by Eprise to grant stock options in connection with its stock option exchange program. Upon completion of the
merger, divine will grant to each such promisee a substitute option to purchase the number of shares of divine common stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of Eprise common stock
subject to such promise by 2.4233 (rounded to the nearest full share), at an exercise price equal to the closing sale price of divine common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the
completion of the merger. Under the stock option exchange program, which terminated on June 8, 2001, Eprise accepted for exchange Eprise options to purchase an aggregate of approximately
551,000 shares of Eprise common stock. 

    In
addition, the merger agreement provides that the shares of divine common stock issuable upon conversion of these options will be registered on a registration statement on
Form S-8 filed with the SEC within 30 days after the completion of the merger. 

    Upon
the completion of the merger, each right to purchase shares of Eprise common stock that is outstanding and unexercised under the Eprise 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan will be
converted into a right to purchase divine shares under divine's 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan in accordance with the terms thereof. 

Treatment of Outstanding Warrants  

    Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding warrant to purchase shares of Eprise common stock will become a warrant to purchase a number of shares of
divine common stock at an exercise price as determined in accordance with the terms of such warrant. As of September 17, 2001, Eprise had outstanding warrants to purchase
(1) approximately 128,000 shares of Eprise common stock at an exercise price of $1.27 per share, and (2) approximately 226,000 shares of Eprise common stock at an exercise price of $3.93
per share. Upon completion of the merger, the first warrant will convert into a warrant to purchase approximately 310,700 shares of divine common stock at an exercise price of approximately $0.52 per
share. The second warrant will terminate if it is not exercised before the completion of the merger.

reasonable efforts consistent with past practices and policies to preserve substantially intact its business organization, to keep available the services of its officers and employees, and to preserve
its present relationships with customers and with other persons and entities with whom it has business relationships to the end that its goodwill and ongoing business will be unimpaired when we

release
or permit the release of any person from, or waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement
to which any of Eprise or any of its subsidiaries is a party. 

    No Solicitation of Alternative Transactions.
  Until completion of the merger or the termination of the merger agreement,
Eprise agreed not to: 


solicit,
initiate or take any action to facilitate or encourage a "company acquisition proposal," as defined below; or 


engage
in, or enter into, any negotiations or discussions concerning any company acquisition proposal. 

    However,
prior to approval of the merger agreement by Eprise stockholders, in response to an unsolicited company acquisition proposal that is, or may lead to, a company superior
proposal, as defined below, that did not result from Eprise's breach of its obligations not to solicit alternative transactions, and provided that Eprise promptly provides notice to divine of its
intent to do so, Eprise may participate in discussions regarding any company acquisition proposal in order to be informed and make a determination with respect to that proposal. 

    A
"company acquisition proposal" means any bona fide inquiry, proposal or offer by a third party relating to any: 


merger,
consolidation, business combination, or similar transaction involving Eprise or any subsidiary of Eprise;


sale,
lease or other disposition, directly or indirectly, by merger, consolidation, share exchange or otherwise, of any assets of Eprise or any subsidiary
of Eprise in one or more transactions;


issuance,
sale, or other disposition of (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or any similar transaction) securities (or options,
rights or warrants to purchase such securities, or securities convertible into such securities) of Eprise or any subsidiary of Eprise;


liquidation,
dissolution, recapitalization or other similar transaction with respect to Eprise or any of its subsidiaries;


tender
offer or exchange offer for Eprise securities that would result in a third party (or its stockholders) acquiring more than 50% of the voting power
of Eprise, or assets representing more than 50% of Eprise's consolidated net income, net revenue or assets;


transaction
similar in form, substance or purpose to any transaction listed above; or


public
announcement of an agreement, proposal, plan or intention to enter into any transaction listed above. 

    A
"company superior proposal" means any offer not solicited after the date of the merger agreement to engage in a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation or similar
transaction that would result in a third party owning more than fifty percent of the shares of Eprise common stock (or the common stock of the surviving company in a merger), or all or substantially
all of the assets of Eprise, and which the Eprise board of directors determines in good faith has a reasonable likelihood of closing and otherwise on terms that the Eprise board of directors
determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and considering other matters that it deems relevant) would result in a transaction more
favorable to Eprise stockholders than the merger, taking into account, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Eprise board of directors after consultation with its financial advisor, the
availability to the person making the company superior proposal of the financial means to conclude the transaction. 

    Neither
the Eprise board of directors nor any committee thereof may, except as required by its fiduciary duties as determined in good faith thereby (after consultation with its
outside 

counsel), (1) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to divine, the approval or recommendation by the Eprise board of directors of the merger,
(2) approve, recommend, or otherwise support or endorse any company acquisition proposal, or (3) cause Eprise to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement or similar agreement with respect to any company acquisition proposal. Eprise is not prohibited from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the Eprise stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Eprise board of
directors (after consultation with its outside counsel), the disclosure is necessary for the board of directors to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; 

provided
, that, except as
required by their fiduciary duties as determined in good faith and after consultation with its outside
counsel and investment advisor, neither Eprise nor its board of directors nor any committee thereof may withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, its position with respect to the
merger or approve or recommend or propose publicly to approve or recommend, a company acquisition proposal. 

    Conduct of Business of divine Pending the Merger.
  The merger agreement provides that, until the completion of the
merger or termination of the merger agreement and unless Eprise consents otherwise, divine will not: 


amend
its certificate of incorporation in a manner that would materially alter its common stock;


pay
dividends;


split,
combine or reclassify its capital stock; or


except
in accordance with agreements already in existence, repurchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any shares of its capital stock in
excess of 10% of the number of shares of divine's capital stock then outstanding. 

    Other Covenants.
  The merger agreement contains certain other covenants and agreements, including agreements relating to
preparation and distribution of this proxy statement/prospectus, public announcements and cooperation regarding certain filings with governmental and other agencies and organizations. In addition, the
merger agreement contains a general covenant requiring each of the parties to use its commercially reasonable efforts to effectuate the merger and to ensure that the merger is treated as a
tax-free reorganization. 

Conditions of the Merger  

    The obligations of divine, DI2 Acquisition Company and Eprise to consummate the merger are subject to a number of customary conditions, including the
following: 


adoption
and approval of the merger agreement and merger by the requisite vote by the stockholders of Eprise and approval by the stockholders of divine (if
necessary) of the issuance of shares of divine common stock in the merger;


effectiveness
of the registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part and the absence of any stop order or proceeding
seeking a stop order; 


the
absence of any provision of any applicable law or regulation and judgment, injunction, order or decree that prohibits completion of the merger;


authorization
for listing on the Nasdaq National Market, subject to official notice of issuance, of the shares of divine common stock to be issued to
Eprise stockholders under the merger agreement;


if
the merger is completed after December 31, 2001 and divine does not then satisfy the maintenance criteria of the Nasdaq National Market (or any
other requirements set forth in a letter from the Nasdaq National Market to divine regarding the possible delisting of divine's common stock), there shall then remain at least 45 calendar days before
the date, if any, specified by the Nasdaq National Market in a notice to divine upon which date divine's common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market if divine shall have not then
satisfied the criteria of the Nasdaq National Market necessary to maintain the listing of its common stock on the Nasdaq National Market, unless that notice is subsequently withdrawn, suspended or
revoked;


receipt
of all required governmental approvals and consents, except, in the case of consents the absence of which could not result in civil or criminal
sanctions being imposed, where the failures to obtain any of these consents and approvals would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on divine or Eprise;


receipt
of a written opinion by Eprise from its tax counsel stating that the merger will constitute a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax
purposes within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and which opinion shall not have been
withdrawn; however, if counsel to Eprise does not render that opinion, the condition shall be deemed to be satisfied with respect to Eprise if counsel for divine renders such opinion (divine has a
similar obligation if it requires stockholder approval to issue shares of its common stock to Eprise stockholders in the merger); and


the
absence of any statute, rule, regulation, injunction, order or decree, enacted, enforced, promulgated, entered, issued or deemed applicable to the
merger, by any court or governmental authority or agency, that could, or could reasonably be expected to, have a material adverse effect on Eprise or divine at or after the completion of the merger. 

    In
addition, the obligations of each of divine and Eprise to consummate the merger are subject to the condition that: 


at
or prior to the effective time the other party's representations and warranties set forth in the merger agreement that are qualified as to materiality
or material adverse effect shall be true and correct, and those that are not so qualified shall be true and correct in all material respects, except as contemplated by the merger agreement, except, in
all cases where the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and correct would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the other party; and


the
other party shall have performed or complied in all material respects with its agreements and covenants required to be performed or complied with under
the merger agreement as of or prior to the completion of the merger. 

Indemnification and Insurance  

    The merger agreement provides that after we complete the merger, the surviving corporation will honor existing indemnification obligations of Eprise, indemnify
directors and officers of Eprise or its subsidiaries for acts or omissions occurring prior to the merger and provide indemnification arrangements for Eprise's officers and directors that are at least
as favorable as those in Eprise's current certificate of incorporation and bylaws for a period of six years after the merger. In addition, the surviving corporation will provide directors' and
officers' liability insurance covering those persons who were covered by Eprise's directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy as of the date of the merger agreement. However, the surviving corporation will not be required to spend more than 150% of the annual premium currently paid by Eprise for
that coverage.

merger if: 


the
merger has not been consummated on or before December 31, 2001 (subject to extension under certain circumstances);

the
requisite Eprise stockholder approval has not been obtained at the special meeting; provided, however, Eprise does not have the right to terminate in
this situation if it has violated its non-solicitation covenant contained in the merger agreement or Eprise's board of directors has withdrawn its recommendation in favor of the merger. See
"Covenants and AgreementsNo Solicitation of Alternative Transactions"; or

that approval is not obtained. 

    Termination by divine.
  divine may terminate the merger agreement and abandon the merger at any time prior to the
completion of the merger, before or after the approval by Eprise's stockholders, if:

a reasonable likelihood of closing on terms more favorable to you than the merger.

covenants or other agreements contained in the merger agreement, and that breach or failure to be true has not been or is incapable of being cured within 20 business days, then divine must pay

AGREEMENT RELATED TO THE MERGER    

Reseller Agreement  

    In connection with the signing of the merger agreement, Eprise entered into a reseller agreement with divine. Pursuant to the reseller agreement, Eprise
appointed divine as a worldwide distributor of certain Eprise products to distribute those products to third parties. In exchange, divine agreed to license and pay for the products, solicit orders for
the products, promote and license the products and render customer service and support. 

    The
reseller agreement will remain in effect until termination of the merger agreement, either by the completion of the merger or otherwise, unless terminated earlier in accordance
with its terms. divine and Eprise may terminate the agreement at any time upon mutual written agreement. Either divine or Eprise may also terminate the agreement in the event of a default by the other
party if the defaulting party fails to cure the default after 30 days' written notice. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement upon written notice if a bankruptcy, reorganization or
insolvency proceeding is initiated against the other party. 

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED
  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    

    The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements describe the pro forma effect of divine's proposed acquisition of Eprise on the: 


statements
of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2001 and the year ended December 31, 2000 of divine; and


balance
sheet as of June 30, 2001 of divine. 

The
following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements also describe the pro forma effect of divine's proposed acquisitions of RoweCom Inc., eshare communications, Inc. and Open
Market, Inc. discussed below. The purpose of these pro forma financial statements is to demonstrate how the combined financial statements of these businesses might have appeared if each of the mergers
had been completed at the beginning of the periods presented. 

    In
addition to the pending merger between divine and Eprise, on July 6, 2001, divine entered into an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization with RoweCom, which is a
business-to-business provider of e-commerce solutions for purchasing and managing the acquisition of magazines, newspapers, journals and e-journals, books and other printed sources of comercial,
scientific and general interest information and analysis. Completion of the RoweCom merger is subject to a number of conditions, including the approval of the RoweCom merger by RoweCom's stockholders
and the satisfaction of certain financing conditions by Rowecom and its subsidiaries. Further, on July 8, 2001, divine entered into a definitive agreement to acquire eshare, which provides
customer interaction management products and services. Completion of the eshare merger is subject to a number of conditions, including eshare shareholder approval and divine stockholder approval. In
addition, on August 15, 2001, divine entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Open Market, which provides content-driven e-business solutions to enterprises. Completion of the
Open Market merger is subject to a number of conditions, including Open Market stockholder approval and
divine stockholder approval. The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect the acquisition of Eprise alone as well as the acquisitions of Eprise, RoweCom, eshare
and Open Market together. 

    divine
has prepared the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements using the purchase method of accounting for all these transactions. Because the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements are based upon the financial condition and operating results of Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market during periods when they were not under the control,
influence or management of divine, the information presented may not be indicative of the results that would have actually occurred had the acquisitions been completed as of the respective periods
presented, nor is it indicative of future financial or operating results. divine expects to incur reorganization and integration expenses as well as potential operating efficiencies as a result of the
acquisitions of Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not give effect to any synergies that may occur due to the integration of
Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market with divine, nor do they take into account the effect of any potential changes to accounting policies, including with respect to the recognition of revenues, of
the acquired entities after the mergers due to the integration of their businesses into divine's business model. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read 

along with the historical financial statements of divine and the related notes, incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus, and the historical financial statements of Eprise and the
related notes, included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. 

    Certain
assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets of Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market have been reclassified to conform to the divine line item presentation in
the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet. Certain expenses and other deductions in the consolidated statements of operations of Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market have been
reclassified to conform to the divine line item presentation in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations.

Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements  

1.
Basis
of Presentation 

    The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of June 30, 2001 gives effect to the acquisitions of Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market as if they occurred on
that date. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 and the six months ended June 30, 2001 give effect to the acquisitions
of Eprise, RoweCom, eshare, and Open Market as if they had occurred on January 1, 2000. 

    The
following summarizes information concerning the estimated purchase price allocation for the acquisitions of Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market.

    The
purchase prices include $500,000 of estimated acquisition costs relating to each acquisition. The Open Market purchase price also includes $5,000,000 paid by divine to Open Market
in conjunction with a secured credit facility signed in connection with the Open Market merger agreement. 

    In
the Eprise merger, divine will issue 2.4233 shares of divine common stock for each outstanding share of Eprise common stock. Additionally, outstanding Eprise warrants and options
will generally be converted to warrants or options to buy shares of divine common stock, generally at the 2.4233 exchange ratio. For purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements, the number of shares, options and warrants assumed to be issued by divine in the Eprise merger has been calculated based on the number of Eprise shares, options and warrants outstanding as
of October 1, 2001. For the Eprise merger, the assumed fair value of divine common stock for purchase accounting purposes is $0.71, which represents the average of divine's closing price on the
first day the agreed upon terms of the Eprise merger were announced by divine (September 18, 2001) and the three business days before and after the announcement date. 

    In
the RoweCom merger, divine will issue 0.75 of a share of divine common stock for each outstanding share of RoweCom common stock. Additionally, each RoweCom warrant and "in-
the-money" option will be converted to a warrant or fully-vested option to buy shares of
divine common stock, generally at the 0.75 exchange ratio. For purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, the number of shares, options and warrants assumed to be
issued by divine in the RoweCom merger has been calculated based on the number of RoweCom shares, options and warrants outstanding as of October 1, 2001. For the RoweCom merger, the assumed
fair value of divine common stock for purchase accounting purposes is $1.44, which represents the average of the closing price of divine's common stock on the first day the agreed upon terms of the
RoweCom merger were announced by divine (July 9, 2001) and the three business days before and after the announcement date. 

    The
merger between divine and eshare is a stock-for-stock transaction. The number of shares to be issued by divine in the eshare merger is yet to be
determined, and is dependent 

on the divine average closing price, which is the average of the closing sale price per share of divine's common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market for the ten consecutive trading days
ending two trading days prior to the closing date of the merger. If the divine average closing price is greater than $2.39 but less than $2.82, then eshare shareholders will receive 1.30 shares of
divine common stock for each eshare common share they own. If the divine average closing price is $2.82 or greater, then eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for
each eshare common share they own equal to $3.653 divided by the divine average closing price. If the divine average closing price is $2.39 or less, then eshare shareholders will receive a number of
shares of divine common stock for each eshare common share they own equal to $3.12 divided by the greater of the divine average closing price or $1.00. Additionally, each eshare "in-the-money" option
will be converted, at the same conversion rate applied to outstanding eshare common shares, to a fully-vested option to buy shares of divine common stock. For purposes of the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial information, the number of shares and options assumed to be issued by divine in the eshare merger has been calculated based on the number of eshare common shares and
options outstanding as of October 1, 2001, and using the minimum divine average closing price as of October 1, 2001, which was $1.00. For the eshare merger, because the fair value of
divine common stock for purchase accounting purposes is yet to be determined, the assumed fair value is $0.58, which represents the average of the closing price of divine's common stock on
October 1, 2001 and the three days prior and two days after October 1, 2001. 

    In
the Open Market merger, divine will issue 44,454,961 shares of divine common stock. In addition, all outstanding options and warrants to purchase shares of Open Market stock will
convert to options and warrants to purchase divine common stock. The conversion ratio to be applied to the number and exercise price of the Open Market options and warrants is driven by the number of
Open Market common shares outstanding at the closing of the merger and the number of shares of divine common stock to be issued to holders of Open Market's Series E preferred stock. For
purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial statements, this conversion ratio has been calculated as 0.8326, based on the number of Open Market common shares outstanding as of October 1, 2001. For the Open Market merger, the
assumed fair value of divine common stock for purchase accounting purposes is $1.26, which represents the average of the closing price of divine's common stock on the first day the agreed upon terms
of the Open Market merger were announced by divine (August 16, 2001) and the three business days before and after the announcement date. 

    The
effects of the Eprise, RoweCom, eshare and Open Market mergers have been presented using the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon management's best preliminary estimate of fair value with any excess purchase price being allocated to goodwill or other identifiable intangibles. In
the Eprise merger, the excess fair value of net assets acquired over the purchase price has been applied first to the writedown of noncurrent assets, with the remainder recorded in retained earnings,
reflecting the extraordinary gain generated by negative goodwill and that would have been realized by divine had the merger been completed on June 30, 2001. This gain is not reflected in the
unaudited proforma condensed combined statements of operations. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price may be subject to further adjustments, as divine finalizes its allocation of purchase
price in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The pro forma adjustments related to the 

purchase price allocation of the acquisitions represent management's best estimate of the effects of these transactions. 

2.
Pro
Forma Balance Sheet Adjustments 

(a)
Reflects
the assumed issuance of 53,967,826 shares of divine common stock and the elimination of Eprise's equity in consolidation. Also reflects the equity reclassification
of $920,000 resulting from the forgiveness, upon the closing of the Eprise merger, of all outstanding loans from Eprise to executive officers in connection with their exercise of Eprise stock options.
Also reflects the elimination of Eprise's noncurrent assets of $4,648,000 and the realization by divine of an extraordinary gain of $13,806,000 (prior to the reduction in extraordinary gain described
in adjustment (b) below), which represents the estimated fair value of Eprise's tangible net current assets as of June 30, 2001 in excess of the value of shares of divine common stock,
and options and warrants to purchase divine common stock, assumed to be issued. 
(b)
Reflects
the issuance of options and warrants to purchase 4,621,499 shares of divine common stock, which represents the number of Eprise options and warrants outstanding as of
October 1, 2001, as converted per the merger agreement. The Black-Scholes fair value of these options and warrants, which reduces the extraordinary gain recorded in adjustment (a) above, is
$2,782,000 and has been included as a component of the purchase price. 
(c)
Reflects
divine's estimated acquisition costs of $500,000 for each of the acquisitions. 
(d)
Reflects
the assumed issuance of 10,164,559 shares of divine common stock and the elimination of RoweCom's equity in consolidation. Also reflects the elimination of RoweCom's
stand-alone goodwill and other intangible assets of $15,593,000 and the establishment by divine of goodwill and other intangible assets of $49,290,000, which represents the value of shares of divine
common stock assumed to be issued in excess of the estimated fair value of RoweCom's tangible net assets as of June 30, 2001. 
(e)
Reflects
the issuance of warrants to purchase 1,559,543 shares of divine common stock, representing the number of RoweCom warrants outstanding as of October 1, 2001, as
converted per the merger agreement. The Black-Scholes fair value of these warrants is $1,683,000 and has been included as a component of the purchase price. 
(f)
Reflects
the assumed issuance of 68,435,596 shares of divine common stock and the elimination of eshare's equity in consolidation. Also reflects the elimination of eshare's
deferred tax assets of $10,583,000 and stand-alone goodwill and other intangible assets of $3,611,000, and the establishment by divine of goodwill and other intangible assets of $12,754,000, which
represents the value of shares of divine common stock issued in excess of the estimated fair value of eshare's tangible net assets as of June 30, 2001. 
(g)
Reflects
the assumed issuance of options to purchase 3,681,285 shares of divine common stock. This is the number of "in-the-money" eshare options as of October 1, 2001, as
converted per the merger agreement. The Black-Scholes fair value of these options is $1,850,000 and has been included as a component of the purchase price. 
(h)
Accounts
payable and accumulated deficit have been adjusted to eliminate the unpaid balance for software sold by eshare to Brandango, a consolidated associated company of divine
that ceased operations in 2000. Accumulated deficit is affected 

instead
of accounts receivable, because eshare wrote off this unpaid balance prior to June 30, 2001.

the effect of real estate options which are dependent on the closing of the merger of divine with eshare. Upon closing, divine has agreed to enter into agreements with
Szlam Partners, L.P. and Melita House, Inc., pursuant to which divine will pay approximately $3,703,000 and $2,047,000, respectively, for ten-year options to purchase eshare's U.S.
and United Kingdom headquarters.

the assumed issuance of 44,454,961 shares of divine common stock and the elimination of Open Market's equity and redeemable preferred stock in consolidation. Also reflects
the establishment by divine of goodwill and other intangible assets of $49,810,000, which represents the value of shares of divine common stock assumed to be issued, and cash paid by divine under a
secured credit facility with Open Market, in excess of the estimated fair value of Open Market's tangible net assets as of June 30, 2001.

October 1, 2001, as converted per the merger agreement. The Black-Scholes fair value of these options and warrants was $6,766,000 and has been included as a component of the purchase price.

the elimination of the accretion of dividends on Eprise's redeemable preferred stock. 
(m)
Selling,
general and administrative expenses have been adjusted to reflect the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the RoweCom, eshare, and Open

Open Market. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 142, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
, approved by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board on June 29, 2001, goodwill acquired in transactions completed after June 30, 2001 will not be amortized. As the RoweCom, eshare and Open Market acquisitions are expected to be
completed in the fourth quarter of 2001, divine's operating results will not reflect any goodwill amortization expense related to these acquisitions. Note that SFAS No. 142 will require the
amortization of intangible assets with determinable useful lives, which are generally intangible assets other than goodwill, over the estimated useful life of those assets. The excess purchase price
over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets of RoweCom, eshare and Open Market have not yet been allocated between goodwill and other intangible assets. For purposes of the pro forma
condensed combined statements of operations, the entire excess purchase price is considered to be other intangible assets and therefore is amortizable.

Sensitivity
Analysis on divine Average Closing Price 

    As
noted in Note 1 above, the number of shares assumed to be issued by divine in the eshare merger has been calculated using $1.00 as the minimum divine average closing price.
If the divine average closing price and fair value of divine common stock were $2.50, divine would issue 28,514,832 shares in the eshare merger, and would record $49,760,000 of goodwill and
other intangible assets. Related amortization expense, for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations, would be $15,566,000 and $7,708,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2000 and the six months ended June 30, 2001, respectively. 

    If
the divine average closing price and fair value of divine common stock were $3.00, divine would issue 26,708,892 shares in the eshare merger, and would record $58,599,000 of
goodwill and other intangible assets. Related amortization expense, for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations, would be $18,512,000 and $9,182,000 for the
year ended December 31, 2000 and the six months ended June 30, 2001, respectively.

proxy statement/prospectus. All references to "we," "us," "our" and "divine" refer to divine, inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 

 Historical Information  

    We began as divine interVentures, inc. on June 30, 1999, engaging in business-to-business e-commerce through
a community of associated companies in which we invested. From September 30, 1999 to December 31, 2000, we acquired interests in 40 associated companies, established a total of 13
associated companies when we identified opportunities consistent with our business strategy, and also further developed our operational procedures and capabilities. 

    In
February 2001, we announced our strategy to primarily focus on enterprise Web solutions, and changed our name to divine, inc. We no longer reflect separately our
interests in our remaining associated companies that provide Web-based technology, software, professional services and managed applications. Instead, the operations of these businesses are
a part of our core business strategy. Other of our associated companies offer software and 

services focused on e-commerce and vertical markets, which we include in our divine interVentures segment. As of June 30, 2001, there were 22 companies in our divine interVentures
segment. 

 Our Growth Strategy  

    Our objective is to become the leading provider of enterprise Web solutions that offer global businesses the ability to improve collaboration, workflow and
business relationships by delivering a powerful combination of technology, software, professional services and managed applications capabilities. As the flow of information becomes more liberated and
more complex, we believe that a new type of solution provider is required to unite all of the skills and emerging technologies needed to create advance enterprise Web solutions that position companies
to go beyond the processing of transactions and operate at the leading edge of their industries. In order to achieve this objective, we have adopted the following key elements of our strategy: 


Become a recognized leader in advanced enterprise solutions
. We currently have over 500 customers
consisting of predominantly Global 2000 companies and high-growth middle-market companies. These customers are serviced by one or more of our four principal business units. By expanding
our relationships with these customers, we can enhance our reputation and visibility and capitalize on cross-selling opportunities with their customers, suppliers, partners and distributors. 

Develop, acquire and integrate offerings and solutions
. We plan to focus on the development, acquisition
and integration of components that can be combined to form a powerful set of technology, software, professional services and hosting capabilities that can advance and extend our customers'
businesses to include external and internal business communities. 

Target a specific customer base
. We plan to target customers whom we believe can benefit most
readily from
greater collaboration, more efficient workflow and better management of business relationships between their customers, employees, partners, suppliers, prospects and sources of information. We believe
that these customers are primarily concentrated in information-intensive businesses such as the financial services, insurance, energy, pharmaceutical, biotechnology and telecommunications industries. 

Support and complement our solutions through alliances with business partners.
 We intend to establish
strategic alliances with a number of companies like our strategic alliance with
Computer Associates International, Inc. ("CA"), which is also one of our strategic investors. CA's professional expertise enhances the range and quality of our Professional Services and CA's
Jasmine
ii
 Portal Software is a key component of our Enterprise Portal Solutions. We believe that strategic alliances will enable us to improve our
ability to attract and retain customers who prefer to deal with larger, more stable solutions providers, provide additional channels for our products, and enable us to build industry-specific
solutions for our customers. 

Position divine as a technology owner and solutions integrator
. We plan to differentiate divine from other
solutions delivery organizations by positioning divine as a technology owner and solutions integrator. We intend to gain a strategic advantage by acquiring and developing innovative technologies and
making these part of our broader solutions in order to leverage their full potential. 

divine's Recent Developments  

    Since July 1, 2001, divine has completed, or entered into agreements in connection with, a number of other acquisitions to further its business
strategy. 

 RoweCom Inc.  

    On July 6, 2001, divine entered into an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization with RoweCom Inc. RoweCom is a leading
business-to-business provider of high quality service and e-commerce solutions for purchasing and managing the acquisition of magazines, newspapers, journals and
e-journals, books and other printed sources of commercial, scientific and general interest information and analysis. RoweCom targets clients in knowledge-intense industries, such as
business and financial services; biomedical; academia and the federal government; and corporate and professional services. Under the terms of the RoweCom merger agreement, each of the approximately
13,552,745 outstanding shares of RoweCom common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.75 shares of divine common stock, and RoweCom will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine.
Completion of the RoweCom merger is subject to a number of conditions, including the approval of the RoweCom merger by RoweCom's stockholders and the satisfaction of certain financing conditions by
RoweCom and its
subsidiaries. divine anticipates that RoweCom's content offerings and procurement technology will be key components of divine's enterprise portal solutions and international expansion. 

 eshare communications, Inc.  

    divine entered into an agreement and plan of merger with eshare communications, Inc. on July 8, 2001, pursuant to which eshare will be merged
with and into DES Acquisition Company, a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of divine. eshare is a provider of customer interaction management, or CIM, software products and services. These CIM software
applications enable eshare's customers to effectively manage new and existing customers across multiple communications channels, including voice, email, interactive Web chat and
voice-over-internet protocol. Following the eshare merger, eshare will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine. 

    Upon
completion of the eshare merger, each of the approximately 21.9 million outstanding shares of eshare common stock will be converted into the right to receive shares of
divine common stock as follows: 


If
the average closing price on the Nasdaq National Market of divine common stock for the ten trading days ending two trading days before the closing date
of the eshare merger, which we refer to as the divine average closing price, is greater than $2.39 but less than $2.82, then eshare shareholders will receive 1.30 shares of divine common stock for
each eshare common share they own; 

If
the divine average closing price is $2.82 or greater, then eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare
common share they own equal to $3.653 divided by the divine average closing price; and 

If
the divine average closing price is $2.39 or less, then eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare
common share they own equal to $3.12 divided by the greater of the divine average closing price or $1.00. 

    If
pursuant to these adjustments, more than 28,546,506 shares of divine common stock are to be issued to eshare shareholders in the eshare merger, divine may elect to pay cash instead
of any or all of the excess shares in an amount per share equal to the divine average closing price. However, because divine and eshare intend for the merger to be a tax-free
reorganization, divine will not pay cash in excess of 50% of the total consideration paid to all eshare shareholders. 

    In
addition, each outstanding option to purchase shares of eshare common stock that has an exercise price that, when divided by the eshare exchange ratio, is less than or equal to the
closing price of divine common stock on the day prior to the completion of the eshare merger will become fully exercisable at the adjusted exercise price for a number of shares of divine common stock
equal to the number of shares of eshare common stock subject to the option multiplied by the eshare exchange ratio. All other eshare stock options will be cancelled. Based on the divine average
closing price and an eshare exchange ratio of 3.12 on October 1, 2001, divine would assume options to purchase approximately 3,681,285 shares of divine common stock in the eshare merger. divine
has also agreed to grant to eshare employees who become employees of divine after the eshare merger is consummated an aggregate number of options to purchase its common stock equal to 13% of the
aggregate number of shares of divine common stock issued to eshare shareholders in the eshare merger. 

    Completion
of the eshare merger is subject to a number of conditions, including (1) approval of the eshare merger by the shareholders of eshare and, if necessary, the
stockholders of divine and (2) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. Szlam Partners, L.P., an entity
beneficially owned by Aleksander Szlam, the chairman and chief executive officer of eshare, has entered into an agreement with divine to vote 10,745,969 of its eshare common shares, representing
approximately 49% of the eshare common shares that were outstanding as of the record date of the eshare special meeting of stockholders, in favor of the eshare merger. Mr. Filipowski, divine's
chairman and chief executive officer, is also a director of eshare. Mr. Filipowski holds 413,333 shares of eshare common stock, representing approximately 2% of the eshare common shares that
were outstanding as of the record date of the eshare special meeting of stockholders, and has indicated that he intends to vote these shares in favor of the merger. The eshare merger agreement may be
terminated under certain circumstances, including by eshare if at any time after the registration statement registering the shares of divine common stock to be issued in the eshare merger is declared
effective, but prior to the eshare shareholders meeting, the average per share closing price of divine common stock for the previous ten trading days is less than $1.00. Under certain circumstances,
termination of the eshare merger agreement will require divine or eshare, as applicable, to pay the other party a $2,000,000 termination fee. 

 Emicom Group, Inc.  

    On July 17, 2001, divine acquired 67% of the equity interests of Emicom Group, Inc. that divine did not already own in exchange for a total of
13.8 million shares of divine common stock. Emicom has been an associated company of divine since April 2000, when divine acquired a 33% interest in Emicom. Emicom is a technology
holding company that provides capital and advisory services to early-stage technology companies located in Israel. Emicom partners with privately-held technology-related companies in the
telecommunications, cellular, Internet infrastructure and enterprise software markets. At the time of the acquisition, 

Emicom held interests in four technology-related companies and had approximately $34 million in uncommitted cash reserves. divine expects that Emicom will provide divine a base of operations in
the Israeli high-tech market, a platform from which to expand an international customer base and a channel for divine's expansion in Israel and Europe. 

 Intira Corporation  

    On July 29, 2001, divine entered into an agreement to purchase substantially all of the assets of Intira Corporation, subject to bankruptcy court
approval. Intira provides information technology and network infrastructure for online business applications and is based in Pleasanton, California. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, divine
will purchase substantially all of the assets of Intira for $1 million in cash, provide Intira with a $6.8 million debtor-in-possession credit facility and assume
certain obligations, which divine intends to restructure on more favorable terms. divine expects that the acquisition of Intira's assets will add to divine's capabilities in its Managed Applications
business unit and provide business opportunities for its other business units. 

 Fracta Networks, Inc.  

    In August 2001, we acquired certain assets, subject to certain liabilities, of Fracta Networks, Inc., a provider of personal content management
solutions. Among the assets we acquired was Fracta Networks' software, FractaNet, an application that allows users to easily
capture portions of documents, spreadsheets or Web sites. For these assets, divine issued warrants to purchase 1,000,000 shares of divine common stock. In addition, divine has agreed to grant Fracta
Network's continuing employees options to purchase 468,000 shares of divine common stock. 

 Open Market, Inc.  

    On August 15, 2001, divine entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Open Market, Inc., pursuant to which divine will acquire Open
Market. Open Market provides enterprise content management and delivery applications software. Open Market's software solutions are designed to enable businesses and other organizations to use the
Internet to better manage interactions with their site visitors, employees, customers and distribution channels. 

    Upon
completion of the Open Market merger, each of the approximately 53.4 million outstanding shares of Open Market common stock will be converted into the right to receive
that number of shares of divine common stock equal to 44,285,714 divided by the total number of shares of Open Market common stock deemed outstanding as of the closing of the merger, giving effect to
the conversion of any then-outstanding shares of Open Market Series E preferred stock but less shares of Open Market common stock issued after August 3, 2001 pursuant to Open Market's employee
stock purchase plans and exercises of Open Market options and warrants. The maximum Open Market exchange ratio will be 0.8394 and the minimum Open Market exchange ratio will be 0.8326. Completion of
the Open Market merger is dependent on a number of conditions, including (1) approval by Open Market stockholders and if necessary, divine stockholders and (2) expiration or termination
of any waiting periods under any applicable antitrust laws. 

    When
the Open Market merger is completed, each of the outstanding Open Market stock options will convert into a fully exercisable option to purchase a number of shares of 

divine common stock equal to the number of shares of Open Market common stock underlying the stock option multiplied by the exchange ratio. The exercise price for these stock options will be equal to
the current exercise price divided by the exchange ratio. When the Open Market merger is completed, each of the outstanding warrants to purchase shares of Open Market's common stock will be converted
into a warrant to purchase the number of shares of divine's common stock equal to the number of shares of Open Market's common
stock subject to such warrant multiplied by the exchange ratio, with an exercise price equal to the exercise price of that warrant divided by the exchange ratio. Based on an Open Market exchange ratio
of .8326 on October 1, 2001, divine would assume options to purchase 8,333,328 shares of divine common stock and warrants to purchase 1,460,554 shares of divine common stock after
the merger. Stockholders holding approximately 10.5% of the shares of Open Market common stock that were outstanding as of the record date for the Open Market special meeting of stockholders have
entered into a stockholder agreement with divine to vote their shares in favor of the Open Market merger. The Open Market merger may be terminated under certain circumstances. Under certain
circumstances, termination of the Open Market merger agreement will require divine or Open Market, as applicable, to pay the other party a $2,600,000 termination fee. 

 marchFIRST GmbH iI  

    In September 2001, divine entered into an agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of marchFIRST GmbH iI that comprised its former Munich
and Hamburg operations. divine has agreed to pay approximately DM 10.5 million (approximately US $4.9 million) for these assets. Upon completion of the acquisition, the
assets purchased from marchFIRST GmbH iI will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine under the name divine GmbH from offices in Munich and Hamburg. 

 Parlano, Inc.  

    On September 7, 2001, divine acquired from UBS AG a 21% equity interest in Parlano, Inc. in exchange for 3,596,007 shares of divine
common stock. Parlano has been an associated company of divine since February 2000, when divine acquired a 75% equity interest in Parlano. As a result of the acquisition, divine now owns approximately
96% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Parlano and intends to purchase the remaining interest in a short-form merger in the near future. Parlano, which is headquartered in Chicago,
Illinois, is a provider of global solutions for real-time business communications and collaboration in an enterprise environment. The software licensed by Parlano allows information to be captured,
filtered and stored in corporate databases and used in knowledge management applications. 

    We
anticipate that the integration of these acquired companies into our products and services offering will help us to deliver a combination of software, technology-based solutions,
professional services and hosting/managed applications that allow businesses to increase efficiency, generate revenue, advance their brand and build customer loyalty. 

INFORMATION REGARDING EPRISE    

Business  

 Overview  

    Eprise provides software products and services that enable businesses to create and publish effective Web content quickly and easily. Eprise's core product,
Eprise Participant Server, enables a business organization to distribute this Web content management function among the appropriate individuals within the enterprise who are charged with particular
aspects of the Web business. These individuals need no knowledge of programming languages or other technical skills to use Eprise Participant Server, thereby minimizing a customer's reliance on
information technology professionals and consultants. Eprise Participant Server allows businesses to carefully manage changes to Web content through rules contained in the software which govern Web
content access and approval rights. Eprise Participant Server enables an enterprise to have Web site content which is dynamic and responsive to the needs of customers, business partners, employees and
others who visit the enterprise's Web site. Eprise's products can be integrated with a customer's existing Web site infrastructure and can be extended to provide enhanced, customized functionality.
Eprise believes that Eprise Participant Server's comprehensive, out-of-the-box functionality makes it the most cost-effective Web content management
solution currently available. 

    Eprise
was incorporated in Delaware in 1992 under the name Inner Circle Technologies, Inc. In 1994 it changed its name to NovaLink USA Corporation, and became Eprise
Corporation in 1997. 

 Industry Background  

    The Internet has evolved into a critical sales, service and communications channel for businesses. This development has permanently altered the way
organizations manage relationships with customers, suppliers, business partners, employees and others interested in the business enterprise. Business organizations worldwide have realized that an
effective Web site can help the organization to achieve higher revenues as well as to build and strengthen relationships with its many constituencies. 

    Effective
Web sites must communicate business information to one or more target audiences. In order to do this, many enterprises maintain: 


an

intranet site,
 which is used for internal communications with and among employees and which may contain
information about corporate policies and employee benefits, other non-public announcements, and internal product and sales support;


an

extranet site,
 which is used for restricted external communications with business partners and which may
contain information about products and pricing, distribution channels, contract terms and conditions and promotional material; and/or


an

Internet site,
 which is used for communications with customers and the general public and which often
contains information about products, customer service and support, company contacts, and investor and financial information. 

    Because
Web sites provide critical business information, they must be carefully managed and kept up to date. Given the large amount of information that can be made available on an 

organization's Web sites, and the number of people who may be responsible for delivering and maintaining that information, a business must determine who will contribute and manage what
content, and how and to whom that content will be presented. This means that software which manages Web site content must: 


distribute
Web site content contribution, editing and approval functions to the most appropriate individuals in the organization to enable them to modify
content quickly and easily without the assistance of technical personnel
;


organize
and store content so that it is presented consistently throughout the Web site, and so that it can be easily formatted, retrieved,
re-used and revised over time;


target
content to the intended audience that is consistent with the organization's business strategy and marketing messages; and


permit
integration with existing Web site content and software, without the need for complex conversions or extensive programming. 

    Businesses
have found it difficult and expensive to build in-house systems or to customize commercially available software to manage their Web site content. Businesses
first attempted to manage the content of their Web sites through in-house software development efforts. These efforts often failed because the organization did not have sufficient
resources and internal technical personnel. These difficulties led to the development of commercially available software that businesses could use to manage their Web site content without substantial
commitment of internal technical personnel. Many of these solutions required a high degree of costly and time-consuming customization in connection with both implementation and ongoing Web
site management and enhancement. Customized software solutions have also made businesses dependent upon proprietary technology, which is difficult to integrate with other existing and future business
applications. 

    Because
of these difficulties, business organizations require a new approach to Web content management. This new approach requires software that is as fully functional as possible
upon installation, without requiring extensive customization or consulting services. The software should be easy for non-technical personnel to use, should be easy to integrate with the
user's existing databases, information systems and other technology and it should permit a business to manage the content of its Web site on a decentralized basis so that the appropriate individuals
within the organization are responsible for managing the content. Finally, the software should permit the business organization to deliver timely, targeted information to its various audiences. 

 The Eprise Solution  

    Eprise Participant Server provides a solution that addresses all of the requirements for effective Web content management software. 

Comprehensive, Out-of-the-Box Functionality.  
Eprise believes that Eprise Participant Server is the
most complete out-of-the-box content management software solution available today, with built-in functionality that results in low implementation and
customization costs. 

Rapid Deployment.  
Typically, a customer can quickly install Eprise Participant Server and begin using it commercially within a week.
Eprise's software is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, so there is no need for technical scripting or programming. This means that 

business people can begin contributing to and modifying content on the Web site immediately after deployment, reducing the time to market of the enterprise's Web initiatives. 

Integration with Existing Web Site Infrastructure and Technology.  
Eprise Participant Server uses widely accepted,
non-proprietary industry standards to communicate with other Internet infrastructure software. This permits a customer to integrate Eprise Participant Server with its
back-office systems, databases, e-commerce and application servers and existing Web content. In addition, customers can use readily available software development tools to
adapt and customize Eprise Participant Server to address their specific needs. Eprise's architecture also permits a software developer to enhance the functionality of Eprise's product to address a
customer's specific requirements. 

Distribution of Content Management Responsibility.  
Eprise Participant Server distributes Web site content creation, editing and approval
responsibilities throughout an organization, enabling the appropriate individuals to implement and manage the Web site, in most cases without assistance from a Webmaster or other technical personnel.
At the same time, Eprise Participant Server enables an organization to establish rules to control those aspects of the Web site which are most appropriately managed by the Webmaster, such as rules to
provide a consistent look and feel. As a result of this distribution of responsibility, a customer using the
Eprise solution can provide more timely and targeted information that is consistent with the organization's business objectives. 

Delivery of Information Targeted to Particular Audiences.  
Through the creation of unique business rules and individually assigned roles,
Eprise Participant Server allows the appropriate people within an enterprise to create targeted, up-to-date content for the specific audiences that the enterprise is trying to
reach. Similarly, by assigning roles to Web site users within and outside the enterprise, such as "employee," "manager" or "business partner," and allowing those persons to select user preferences
relevant to their role or the available content, an enterprise can ensure that each member of its audience is receiving the most relevant content. 

    Because
Eprise Participant Server has these attributes, Eprise believes that it is the most cost-effective Web content management solution currently available. Eprise
believes that, using Eprise Participant Server, a customer can create and maintain a dynamic Web site that can be seamlessly integrated with other aspects of its business with minimal reliance on
internal or external information technology professionals. 

 Eprise's Products  

    The Eprise product line consists of Eprise Participant Server, which is Eprise's Web content management software, and a series of add-on products
for Eprise Participant Server. The following table highlights the key functionality and features of Eprise Participant Server.

    Eprise
typically charges for Eprise Participant Server and add-on product licenses based on the number of servers the customer will need to support its Web sites, but
occasionally Eprise will provide its customers with the option to license Eprise's products on an enterprise, divisional, or site license basis. As a result, if the customer's Web sites prosper and
site visits and transaction volume grow, the client will need to purchase more licenses for the additional servers deployed. 

 Technology  

    Eprise Participant Server incorporates a number of important technological and design features. Its open architecture is based on the programming language XML
and supports other programming standards such as COM and Java through optional add-ons. The user interface for Eprise products is delivered through a Web browser and is based upon standard
Web programming languages such as HTML, DHTML, Java and JavaScript. Eprise Participant Server is also portable, allowing customers to use different database products for their information repository,
such as Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle, as well as different operating systems and Web servers such as Windows NT and Solaris. 

    Eprise Participant Server's architecture is scalable because it uses technology that allows dynamically rendered content to be stored in memory to improve transactional performance
and speed, as well as a two-tier architecture that permits multiple Eprise servers to be "clustered" to share a database server. 

    Eprise
Participant Server is also extensible, allowing a business to create customized Web pages for specialized business process automation. Eprise Participant Server's business rule
management can incorporate information provided by other corporate systems, such as directories. Using widely available Web software development tools, a customer can integrate Eprise Participant
Server with other systems, such as application and e-commerce servers, sales and service systems and back-office systems. 

 Services  

    While the effective use of Eprise Participant Server requires little or no customization, Eprise does offer a variety of optional services to Eprise's
customers. 

Eprise Advantage Program.
  Through the Eprise Advantage Program, available for a standard fee, an Eprise professional will evaluate a
customer's Internet initiatives in conjunction with its overall business strategy. Based on this evaluation, Eprise will deliver a discovery and
design analysis providing recommendations on how Eprise Participant Server can best be used to implement the customer's business goals, either through the customer's own technology department, Eprise
professional services or third party service providers. 

Professional Services.
  If a customer wishes to work with Eprise in the implementation phase of a project, including projects arising out
of Eprise Advantage Program recommendations, Eprise's professional services team will provide development services ranging from graphics design to building applications using complex database and
development tools, either on a fixed fee or a time and materials basis. 

Customer Training.
  Eprise's professional services team provides customer training, either as a component of the Eprise Advantage Program
or as a stand-alone service offering for a fixed fee. 

Maintenance and Support.
  Eprise provides technical support and maintenance services through annual maintenance agreements with its
customers. These services include delivery of software product bug fixes, enhancements and new versions of Eprise Participant Server. Eprise delivers support and maintenance services primarily through
telephone and e-mail communications. Eprise also addresses customer questions involving product operation, installation and application development. 

 Customers  

    To date, Eprise has licensed Eprise Participant Server to over 150 clients in a broad spectrum of industries, including the financial services, technology and
manufacturing industries. The following is a partial list of clients that have licensed Eprise's products and that Eprise believes are representative of its overall client base: American Cancer
Society, American Express, American Heart Association, Bausch & Lomb, BP Amoco, Eastman Chemical, Hewlett-Packard, Lincoln Financial Group, McKesson HBOC, Providence Health Systems, Sanwa Bank,
Sharp Electronics, and Sulzer Management. 

 Sales, Marketing and Business Development  

    Eprise licenses its product through both its direct sales force and indirect sales channels. As of September 30, 2001, Eprise's sales, marketing and
business development organization consisted of 54 individuals, 46 of whom were based in North America, including 18 direct sales representatives, who are supported by 11 sales support personnel, and
10 marketing personnel. 

Direct Sales.
  To date, Eprise has sold its products primarily through its direct sales force. Eprise currently has nationwide sales
coverage, organized principally by geographic regions. In addition, Eprise has direct sales coverage in Europe. Eprise intends to increase its direct sales force in the U.S. and overseas. Eprise is
focusing its sales efforts on well-defined market segments where the need for its solution is greatest and where technology innovation is the norm, such as the financial services,
technology and manufacturing industries. Eprise targets enterprise-level accounts for whom the Internet is a fundamental part of their corporate strategy. 

Marketing.
  Eprise supports its sales efforts through various marketing efforts to generate brand awareness and to qualify leads for the
sales organization. Eprise intends to continue to invest selectively in high value marketing programs to support its marketing efforts. 

Business Development.
  It is the goal of Eprise's business development staff to extend its market reach and increase sales opportunities
through the establishment of relationships with systems integrators, Web developers and application service providers who build customer solutions based on Eprise Participant Server. In many cases,
these business partners will recommend a Web content management solution to their customers as part of the e-business application that they deliver. Eprise anticipates that these business
partners will reduce its current three- to six-month sales cycle while adding value to the planning and deployment phase of projects that require an Eprise solution. Eprise's current
business partner arrangements include lead sharing, product training, joint marketing and access to engineering resources. These relationships are important to Eprise's strategy because of its
business partners' technical knowledge and extensive customer relationships across many industries. Eprise has formal agreements with more than 30 such partners, including EDS, Agency.com, Lante, Sira
Technologies, Proxicom, and PSINet. Eprise intends to devote significant resources to developing these relationships further. 

    Eprise's
business development organization is also focused on forming and expanding alliance relationships with complementary technology vendors. Because Eprise Participant Server is
generally used as a central element of an enterprise-scale Web presence, it must be able to
integrate with leading Web infrastructure software applications, including application servers, personalization vendors, search technologies, security and authentication protocols, and portal
solutions. Eprise seeks to identify and establish alliances with leading providers of this key technology. The scope of these relationships varies but may include lead sharing,
co-marketing, joint development of pre-integrated solutions, and joint selling. To date, Eprise's alliance relationships include Microsoft, Sun, IBM, Art Technology Group
(ATG), BEA, Idiom, Screaming Media, and Plumtree. 

ISV Sales.  
Eprise believes that many independent software vendors, or ISVs, have recognized a need to offer sophisticated content
management functionality directly to their customers. Rather than building a content management product themselves, or purchasing technology 

through an acquisition, some ISVs are licensing content management products such as Eprise Participant Server, embedding them in their own solution, and then selling and supporting the end product
directly. Eprise recently has begun to license its products to ISVs, including Haht Commerce. While Eprise offers a significant per-copy discount to ISV customers, its cost of sales and
associated operating expenses are also reduced. 

Global Expansion.  
Eprise currently sells its products primarily in the United States, but is taking steps to expand its
global sales efforts to domestically based global companies and companies based outside the United States. Eprise intends to do this with a combination of direct sales and support personnel, indirect
sales channels and partnerships. Eprise has formed alliances with a Japanese integrator, Teijin Systems Technology Ltd., to co-develop and distribute Japanese-language versions of
its products, and with a Stockholm-based systems integrator, Adcore, to distribute its products. Additionally, Eprise has established subsidiary offices in Reading, U.K. and Munich and Hamburg,
Germany, and is in the process of forming partnerships in the European market. 

 Research and Development  

    Eprise has invested significantly in research and development to enhance its current products and develop new products. Eprise's research and development
expenses were approximately $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, approximately $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, approximately
$5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, and approximately $4.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2001. Eprise expects to increase the dollar amount of
its research and development expenditures substantially in the
future. As of September 30, 2001, 31 employees were engaged in research and development activities and Eprise plans to continue to hire additional engineers to further its research and
development activities. 

    Eprise's
research team, led by the chief technology officer, identifies market opportunities and develops prototypes for new product features, product updates, add-ons and
new products. This team is responsible for defining and guiding Eprise's product strategy and vision, and maintaining its reputation as an innovator in content management solutions. Eprise's
development team, led by the senior vice president of products, designs, develops and enhances new and existing products. This team is responsible for product development, quality and assurance
testing, product documentation, product release and maintenance, and overall execution of Eprise's product development strategy. Eprise intends to continue to expand and enhance the capabilities of
Eprise Participant Server, as well as develop and extend its content management product offerings, to provide its customers with complete flexibility in choosing the most desirable environment for
creating and managing content. 

 Competition  

    The market for Web content management solutions is intensely competitive, subject to rapid technological changes and significantly affected by new product
introductions and other market activities of industry participants. Many of Eprise's competitors currently have a greater market share than Eprise. Eprise has four primary sources of competition: 


file-based
content management systems from providers such as Interwoven.


legacy
document management systems from providers such as Documentum; 


specialized
application servers from providers such as Vignette;


other
specialized content management providers such as Intranet Solutions; and


in-house
development efforts by potential clients and partners. 

    In
addition, Eprise currently partners with a number of companies that provide complementary products such as Web tools and application servers. Any of these companies might introduce
competitive product offerings in the future. 

    Eprise
believes that the primary factors upon which it competes favorably are the out-of-the-box functionality and rapid deployment capability of
Eprise Participant Server and Eprise Participant Server's ability to integrate with Eprise's customers' existing and future application server products. Other areas in which Eprise believes it
competes favorably include the ability to distribute content management responsibilities within an organization, the ability to deliver information targeted to specific audiences, and the
cost-effectiveness of Eprise's products. 

    Despite
these potential competitive advantages, Eprise also face competitive disadvantages because many of its competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater
financial, technical, marketing and other resources than it has. As a result, they may be able to undertake more extensive promotional efforts, adopt more aggressive pricing strategies, and offer more
attractive terms to purchasers than Eprise. 

    Eprise
expects competition to persist and intensify in the future. Competition could materially and adversely affect Eprise's ability to obtain revenues from license fees from new or
existing customers and service fees from existing customers. Further, competitive pressure may force Eprise to reduce the price of its products. In either case, Eprise's operating results and
financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. 

 Proprietary Rights and Licensing  

    Eprise's success depends upon its ability to maintain the proprietary aspects of its technology and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of
others. Eprise relies on a combination of trademark, trade secret and copyright law, and contractual restrictions, to protect the proprietary aspects of its technology. Eprise seeks to protect the
source code for its software, documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws. These legal protections provide limited protection for Eprise's technology. Eprise's
license agreements prohibit its customers from using its software other than for internal business purposes. Eprise also seeks to protect its intellectual property by requiring employees and
consultants with
access to its proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with Eprise and by restricting access to its source code. Due to rapid technological change, Eprise believes that factors
such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel, new product developments and enhancements to existing products are at least as important to establishing and maintaining a technology
leadership position. Eprise also licenses third party software that is incorporated into Eprise Participant Server and certain add-on products. Eprise believes these licenses are not
material to its business and the technology could be replaced, if necessary or appropriate, by commercially available third party software or internally developed technology without material
disruption to Eprise's business or operations. 

 Employees  

    As of September 30, 2001, Eprise had a total of 157 employees, including 54 in sales and marketing, 31 in research and development, 52 in professional
services and support and 20 in information technology, administration and finance. None of its employees is represented by a collective bargaining agreement, nor has Eprise experienced any work
stoppage. Eprise considers its relations with its employees to be good. 

Properties  

    Eprise's principal office occupies approximately 78,000 square feet of new office space in Framingham, Massachusetts. Initial annual lease payments for the
Framingham facility are approximately $2.1 million, with periodic increases over the ten-year term of the lease. In addition, Eprise leases sales and service offices in Oak Brook,
Illinois; Dallas, Texas; San Diego, California; San Jose, California; Denver, Colorado; Reston, Virginia; Hamburg, Germany; Munich, Germany; and Reading, U.K. Eprise does not own any real property. 

Legal Proceedings  

    Eprise is not a party to any material legal proceedings. Eprise may from time to time become a party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary
course of its business. 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

    Eprise, originally named Inner Circle Technologies and then NovaLink, was founded in 1992 as a provider of online interactive games. Between 1994 and 1997,
Eprise's principal business shifted to creating and hosting Web sites for corporate clients. During this period, Eprise encountered recurring problems arising out of the inadequacy of software tools
that were commercially available to build and maintain Web sites. Recognizing that there was an opportunity to streamline and automate these processes, Eprise began to develop a software product
called Eprise Participant Server to facilitate the construction and updating of Web sites. Eprise shipped its first commercial product in early 1998. Eprise now markets and sells version 3.0 of Eprise
Participant Server. 

    Eprise
completed three rounds of venture capital financing between December 1997 and November 1999, with over $38.0 million in gross proceeds. Eprise completed
its initial public offering in March 2000, with gross proceeds of $69.0 million. 

    Eprise
changed its fiscal year end from August 31 to December 31 in 1997. Eprise's financial information, to the extent provided, for the last eight months of the fiscal
year ended August 31, 1997 and the four months ended December 31, 1997 has been combined in order to present a comparable accounting period for 1997 to the audited year ended
December 31, 1998. Future references to the year 1997 or 1998 mean the twelve months ended December 31 unless otherwise indicated. 

    Eprise
generates revenues from two principal sources: (1) license fees for its software products and (2) professional services and technical support revenues derived
from consulting, implementation, training and maintenance services related to its software products. In the year ended December 31, 2000 no customer accounted for more than 10% of Eprise's
revenue. In the year ended December 31, 1999, two customers accounted for 23% of Eprise's total revenues. In the year ended December 31, 1998, one customer accounted for 58% of Eprise's
total revenues. In the three-month period ended June 30, 2001, two customers each accounted for 17% and 12% of Eprise's total revenues. In the six-month period ended June 30,
2001, there were no individual customers accounting for 10% or more of Eprise's total revenues. In the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2000, there were no
individual customers accounting for 10% or more of Eprise's total revenues. 

    License
revenue represented 60% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2000, and 43% of total revenues in the first six months of 2001. License sales produce
significantly higher margins than service sales due to lower costs associated with licenses and their delivery. 

    Software licenses.
  Customers typically pay an up-front, one-time fee for a perpetual
non-exclusive license of Eprise's software. Generally, the amount of the fee is based on the number of licensed servers. To date, software license revenues have principally come from
direct sales to customers. The sales cycle for Eprise's products is typically three to six months. Although Eprise has limited historical financial data, Eprise believes that its quarterly operating
results may experience seasonal fluctuations due to clients' fiscal year budgeting cycles and purchasing patterns. Because of Eprise's server-based licensing, it experiences significant variation in
the size of its licensing transactions. 

    Eprise generally recognizes license fee revenues upon delivery of the product. If the product is subject to acceptance and/or return and refund, Eprise defers revenues until
acceptance has occurred or the refund period has expired. 

    Services.
  Revenues from services consist principally of revenues derived from professional services associated with the
implementation and integration of Eprise's software products, training of customers' employees and ongoing customer support, which primarily includes customer technical support services and product
enhancements. Eprise delivers professional services on either a fixed price basis or a time and materials basis. Eprise generally completes implementation and training services within six months
following license contract signing. 

    Eprise
recognizes revenues from professional services as such services are performed. Eprise recognizes maintenance revenues, which are invoiced annually in advance, ratably over the
term of the maintenance agreement, which is generally 12 months. Eprise's maintenance revenues currently account for approximately 15% of its total revenues. As part of these agreements, Eprise
provides product enhancements and technical support services to customers for an annual fee, which typically amounts to 20% of the license fee. While a 60-day warranty is included in the
software license, maintenance agreements typically are entered into as of the date of the software license. Maintenance agreements are renewable at the discretion of the customer. As of
June 30, 2001, there have been 141 customers who have entered into maintenance agreements with Eprise. Of the 141 contracts, to date 26 have
expired, of which 10 have been renewed. The remaining contracts have not yet come up for renewal. 

    Backlog.
  Delivery lead times for Eprise's products are very short and, consequently, substantially all of its license
fee revenues in each quarter result from orders received in that quarter. Accordingly, Eprise generally only maintains a backlog for its professional services and maintenance activities, and Eprise
believes that its backlog at any point in time is not a reliable indicator of future revenues and earnings. 

    Cost of revenues.
  Cost of software licenses revenues includes royalties paid to certain software companies for products
sold or distributed with or embedded in Eprise Participant Server. In 2000, these royalties amounted to 1.2% of total revenues and in the six months ended June 30, 2001, these royalties
amounted to 3.8% of total revenues, and may increase in the future as license sales increase. Other costs associated with software licenses, including CDs and packaging, arise primarily from the
production of software products, and have not been significant in any period presented, nor are they expected to be significant in the foreseeable future. Cost of services revenues consists primarily
of salaries and related personnel costs, costs of third party contractors, and other allocated expenses of Eprise's consulting, support and training organizations. 

    Research and development.
  Eprise maintains a product development staff to enhance its existing products and to develop
new products. Software costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility of the software is determined, after which any additional costs are capitalized. To date, Eprise has expensed all
software development costs because development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility have been minimal. 

    Selling and marketing.
  Eprise licenses its products primarily through its direct sales force. Selling and marketing
expenses consist primarily of costs associated with personnel, sales commissions, office facilities, travel and promotional events such as trade shows, seminars and technical conferences, advertising
and public relations programs. 

    General and administrative.
  General and administrative expenses include salaries and related personnel expenses and
other costs of the finance, human resources, information technology and administrative functions at Eprise. 

    Recent events.
  On July 17, 2001, Eprise completed a reduction in force, affecting approximately 20% of its
workforce, in an effort to balance revenues and expenses in the current environment. Eprise had 196 full-time employees as of June 30, 2001 compared to 154 as of June 30,
2000. As of September 30, 2001, Eprise had 157 employees. 

    On
May 10, 2001, Eprise commenced a voluntary stock option exchange program for its employees. Under the program, employees were given the opportunity to elect to cancel
outstanding stock options held by them in exchange for an equal number of new options to be granted at a future date. These elections had to be made by June 8, 2001 and had to include all
options granted during the prior six months. A total of 624,675 options to purchase Eprise common stock were tendered in return for promises to grant new options on the grant date of
December 12, 2001. The exercise price of the new options will be equal to the fair market value of Eprise common stock on the date of grant.

Six Months Ended June 30, 2001 compared to the Six Months Ended June 30, 2000  

     Software licenses.
  Revenues from software licenses decreased by 39.5% to approximately $3.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2001
compared to approximately $5.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000. Software license revenues represented 43% and 80% of total revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. The decrease in
revenues from software licenses was primarily due to a lengthening in the customer decision making process resulting from market conditions and increased competition in the marketplace. 

    Services.
  Revenues from services increased by 227.8% to approximately $4.7 million for the six months ended June 30,
2001 compared to approximately $1.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000. Services revenues represented 57% and 20% of total revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. Approximately 67% of the increase in absolute dollars is attributable to consulting and 33% to maintenance revenue generated by new software license sales. The increase as a percentage
of total revenues is attributable to implementation services for licenses sold in 2000 and additional follow-on services provided to Eprise's existing customers. 

    Cost of software licenses.
  Cost of software licenses revenues were $420,000, representing 12% of license revenues, for
the six months ended June 30, 2001. These costs primarily represent royalties paid to certain software companies for products sold with or embedded in Eprise Participant Server. These products were
released in the second half of 2000. 

    Cost of services.
  Cost of services increased by 107.9% to approximately $5.5 million for the six months ended June 30,
2001 compared to approximately $2.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000. Cost of services represented 115% and 182% of services revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. The increase in absolute dollars was due to the expansion of Eprise's professional services organization, including technical consulting, technical support and training. The decrease as
a percentage of services revenues was primarily due to increased utilization of Eprise's services staff and the increase in maintenance revenue as a percentage of services revenue in the six months
ended June 30, 2001. Eprise expects cost of services revenues as a percentage of total revenues to vary from period to period depending on the mix of services it provides, whether the services are
provided by Eprise's staff or third party contractors, and on the utilization rates of Eprise's staff. Since services revenues have substantially lower margins than license revenues, growth of
Eprise's services business will result in a lower gross profit if its license revenues do not increase significantly in the same period. 

    Research and development.
  Research and development expenses increased by 87.1% to approximately $4.3 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2001 compared to approximately $2.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000. Research and development expenses represented 52% and 31% of total revenues for the six
months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel and employee-related expenses incurred as well as utilizing
contracted resources more extensively as part of Eprise's development effort for version 3.5 of Eprise Participant Server and future product releases. 

    Selling and marketing.
  Selling and marketing expenses increased by 14.0% to approximately $10.8 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2001 compared to approximately $9.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000. Selling and marketing expenses represented 130% of total revenues for each of the six months
ended June 30, 2001 and 2000. Approximately 61% of the increase in absolute dollars was attributable to an increase in the number of sales and sales support personnel as Eprise expanded its direct
sales force nationally and globally. In addition, approximately 50% of the increase in absolute dollars was attributable to the expansion of Eprise's business development staff as the company extended
its market reach through the establishment of relationships with systems integrators. These increases were offset by a decrease in marketing programs in the second quarter of 2000, during which Eprise
launched an extensive advertising and branding campaign. 

    General and administrative.
  General and administrative expenses increased by 49.7% to approximately $3.3 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2001 compared to approximately $2.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000. General and administrative expenses represented 40% and 31% of total revenues for the
six months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in absolute dollars primarily reflects personnel increases and the related costs associated with supporting Eprise's anticipated
growth. 

    Compensation cost for stock options.
  For certain option grants made during 2000 and 1999, we have concluded that the
exercise price of such options were less than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. As a result, compensation cost has been incurred related to these options which
aggregated approximately $1.4 million and $6.8 million, for grants in 2000 and 1999, respectively, which is being amortized to expense over the four year vesting period of the option grants. For the
six months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000, compensation expense recorded related to stock option grants aggregated $824,000 and $953,000, respectively. 

    Other income (expense).
  Other income and expense consisted primarily of interest income on invested cash balances and
interest expense on borrowings. The decrease in other income between the two periods was the result of lower cash balances as we used the cash generated from our public offering in March 2000 for
funding operations. 

    Income taxes.
  During the six months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000, Eprise reported losses for both financial and income
tax purposes. No provision or benefit for income taxes was recorded in either period. The income tax expense of $31,000 for the six months ended June
31, 2001 primarily represents taxes paid on income earned on assets held by Eprise Securities Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eprise. 

Year Ended December 31, 2000 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 1999  

     Software licenses.
  Revenues from software licenses increased by 460.2% to approximately $13.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000 compared to approximately $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Software license revenues represented 69% and 64% of total revenues for the years
ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in revenues from software licenses was primarily due to the release of version 2.0 of Eprise Participant Server in April 1999
and the continued resulting increases in licenses delivered, as 

well as follow-on orders received from Eprise's existing customers. License revenue from follow-on orders was approximately $2.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000. 

    Services.
  Revenues from services increased by 347.5% to approximately $5.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000 compared to approximately $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Services revenues represented 31% and 36% of total revenues for the years ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Approximately 74% of the increase in absolute dollars is attributable to consulting, 11% to training, and 15% to maintenance revenue generated by new
software license sales. The decrease as a percentage of total revenues is attributable to the fact that more extensive implementation services were required by customers for the initial commercial
release (version 2.0) of Participant Server in 1999. 

    Cost of revenues.
  Cost of software licenses primarily includes royalties paid to certain software companies for
products sold or distributed with or embedded in Eprise Participant Server. The other costs of software licenses relate to the production of software products, including CDs and packaging. Cost of
services revenues primarily include salaries, related personnel costs, and costs of third party contractors of Eprise's consulting, support and training organizations. These costs of revenues
increased by 584.4% to approximately $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared to approximately $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. As a
percentage of total revenues, cost of revenues increased to 40% for the year ended December 31, 2000 from 31% for the year December 31, 1999. The increase in absolute dollars was due to
the expansion of Eprise's professional services organization, including technical consulting, technical support, and training from a staff of 14 in 1999 to 62
in 2000. The increase as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to the period of time needed to train Eprise's expanding service organization as well as an increase in the use of third party
contractors. In 2000, the cost of license revenues was 1.6% of total revenue. Since revenues from services have substantially lower margins than license revenues, growth of Eprise's services business
will result in a lower gross profit if Eprise's license revenues do not increase significantly in the same period. Eprise expects cost of services revenues as a percentage of total revenues to vary
from period to period depending on the mix of services Eprise provides, whether the services are provided by Eprise's staff or third party contractors, and on the utilization rates of Eprise's staff.
Depending on the mix of software licenses sold, the cost of license revenues as a percentage of total revenue may increase in the future due to Eprise's existing royalty agreements. 

    Research and development.
  Research and development expenses increased by 144.4% to approximately $5.8 million
for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared to approximately $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Research and development expenses represented 31% and 65% of
total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel, employee-related expenses,
and the use of third-party contractors in the year ended December 31, 2000 for the development of Version 3.0 of Eprise Participant Server which was released in November 2000. Eprise
believes that continued investment in research and development is critical to achieving its corporate objectives, and Eprise expects that the absolute dollar amounts of research and development
expenses will increase in future periods. To date, all software development costs have been expensed as incurred. 

    Selling and marketing.
  Selling and marketing expenses increased by 303.7% to approximately $20.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 2000 compared to approximately $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Selling and marketing expenses represented 107% and 138% of total
revenues for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Approximately 64% of the increase in selling and marketing expenses was attributable to an increase in the number of sales
and sales support personnel from 24 in 1999 to 61 in 2000 as Eprise expanded its direct sales force nationally and globally. In addition, approximately 25% of the increase was attributable to
significant cost increases in marketing programs and public relations activities as Eprise expanded its presence in the market and further developed its brand. Eprise expects to increase its
investment in selling and marketing efforts in order to increase brand awareness, build strategic partnerships, and continue its global expansion. Eprise also anticipate that selling and marketing
expenses will fluctuate from period to period as a percentage of total revenue as new sales personnel become productive, and based on the timing of marketing programs and new product releases. 

    General and administrative.
  General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of
finance, human resources, information technology, legal and other administrative functions. General and administrative expenses increased by 194.3% to approximately $5.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2000 compared to approximately $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. General and administrative expenses represented 31% and 55% of total revenues
for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses primarily reflects personnel increases and the related costs associated with
supporting Eprise's recent and anticipated revenue growth. Eprise expects general and administrative costs to increase in absolute dollars as it continues to add the infrastructure and personnel
needed to support its future growth. 

    Compensation cost for stock options.
  Options were granted during 1999 at exercise prices which were the best estimate
of Eprise's board of directors as to the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. However, subsequent to the grant date, Eprise concluded that for grants after the release of
the new version of Eprise Participant Server, these estimates may not have fully reflected the impact of this release. Eprise determined that for grants made from May to August 1999, $3.93 is a
more reliable estimate of the fair value of the common stock during this period. For grants subsequent to August 1999, Eprise determined that the mid-point of the preliminary price
range for its anticipated public offering represented the best estimate of the fair value of the common stock during this period. For grants during 1999, compensation cost aggregated approximately
$6.8 million, which will be amortized to expense over the four year vesting period of the option grants. For the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, compensation expense recorded
related to these grants aggregated approximately $1.9 million and $524,000, respectively. 

    Other income (expense).
  Other income and expense consisted primarily of interest income on invested cash balances and
interest expense on borrowings. The increase in other income between the two periods was the result of higher cash balances generated from Eprise's private placement financing in November 1999
and its initial public offering in March 2000. 

    Income taxes.
  During the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, Eprise reported losses for both financial and
income tax purposes. No provision or benefit for income taxes was recorded in either period, other than a provision related to income earned on investments 

in a securities corporation as discussed below. At December 31, 2000, Eprise had net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state income tax purposes aggregating $27.7 million
available to offset future taxable income. These loss carry forwards expire in varying amounts through 2020. At December 31, 2000, Eprise had federal and state tax credits aggregating $610,000
available to reduce future taxes payable, expiring through 2014. Because of changes
in ownership that have occurred, including Eprise's initial public offering, Eprise's ability to fully utilize these carry forwards is likely to be limited. The income tax expense of $47,000 for the
year ended December 31, 2000 represents taxes paid on income earned on assets held by Eprise Securities Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eprise Corporation. 

Year Ended December 31, 1999 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 1998  

    Software licenses.
  Revenues from software licenses increased by 582.6% to approximately $2.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 1999 compared to $345,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998. The increase in revenues from software licenses was primarily due to the release of version 2.0 of Eprise
Participant Server in April 1999 and the resulting increases in license deliveries during 1999. All license revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999 were attributable to new
customers compared to 30% attributable to new customers for the year ended December 31, 1998. 

    Services.
  Revenues from services increased by 182.3% to approximately $1.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 1999 compared to $462,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998. Approximately 88% of the increase in revenues from services is attributable to consulting, 9% to training,
and 3% to implementation revenue generated by new software license sales. Approximately 58% of services revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999 were attributable to new customers compared
to 51% for the year ended December 31, 1998. 

    Cost of revenues.
  Cost of revenues primarily relate to services because costs of licenses were insignificant. Cost of
revenues increased by 144.6% to approximately $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 compared to $460,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998. However, as a percentage
of total revenues, cost of revenues decreased to 31% for the year ended December 31, 1999 from 57% for the year December 31, 1998. This was primarily due to a larger percentage of total
revenues being derived from software license fees (which have significantly higher gross profit margins) in the year ended December 31, 1999 compared to the year ended December 31, 1998,
more efficient implementation of Eprise's products and better utilization of service personnel. 

    Research and development.
  Research and development expenses increased by 9.8% to approximately $2.4 million for
the year ended December 31, 1999 compared to approximately $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. The increase was primarily attributable to employee-related expenses
incurred in the year ended December 31, 1999 for the continued development of Version 2.0 of Eprise Participant Server and future product releases. 

    Selling and marketing.
  Selling and marketing expenses increased by 115.2% to approximately $5.1 million for the
year ended December 31, 1999 compared to approximately $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. Approximately 72% of the increase in selling and marketing expenses was
attributable to an increase in the number of sales and sales support personnel as Eprise expanded its direct sales force. In addition, approximately 

19% of the increase was attributable to significant cost increases in marketing programs and public relations activities as Eprise expanded its presence in the market and further developed its brand. 

    General and administrative.
  General and administrative expenses increased by 61.0% to approximately $2.0 million
for the year ended December 31, 1999 compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. The increase in general and administrative expenses primarily reflects
personnel increases and the related costs associated with supporting Eprise's recent and anticipated revenue growth. 

    Compensation cost for stock options.
  For grants during 1999, compensation cost aggregated approximately
$6.8 million, which will be amortized to expense over the four year vesting period of the option grants. For the year ended December 31, 1999, compensation expense recorded related to
these grants aggregated $524,000. 

    Other income (expense).
  Other income and expense consisted primarily of interest income on invested cash balances and
interest expense on borrowings. The increase in other income between the two periods was the result of higher cash balances generated from Epreise's second round of venture capital financing in
August 1998 and its private placement financing in November 1999. 

    Income taxes.
  During the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, Eprise reported losses for both financial and
income tax purposes. No provision or benefit for income taxes was recorded in either period. At December 31, 1999, Eprise had net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state income tax
purposes aggregating $13.5 million available to offset future taxable income. These loss carry forwards expire in varying amounts through 2014. At December 31, 1999, Eprise had federal
and state tax credits aggregating $319,000 available to reduce future taxes payable, expiring through 2014. Because of changes in ownership that have occurred, Eprise's ability to fully utilize these
carry forwards is likely to be limited. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

    On September 17, 2001, Eprise agreed to be acquired by divine, inc. in a transaction involving the exchange of 2.4233 shares of divine common stock for each
outstanding share of Eprise. The acquisition is expected to be accounted for using purchase accounting. The acquisition is subject to a number of conditions, including approval of the transaction by
the stockholders of Eprise and, if required under the rules of Nasdaq, those of divine. 

    From
its inception through 1997, Eprise primarily financed its operations and met its capital expenditure requirements through funds generated from operations, funds borrowed from
several stockholders and a director, and funds borrowed from Silicon Valley Bank. Since December 1997, Eprise has raised over $107.0 million in venture capital, private placement and
initial public offering financing in order to expand the product development and sales and marketing efforts of its business and the infrastructure to support its future growth. 

    At
June 30, 2001, Eprise's primary source of liquidity consisted of cash totaling approximately $54.0 million as well as accounts receivable of approximately
$3.5 million. On March 29, 2000, Eprise raised cash proceeds of approximately $63.2 million, after expenses, from the sale of 4,600,000 shares of its common stock in its initial
public offering. In addition, 

Eprise had a working capital revolving line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank that provided for borrowings up to a maximum amount equal to the lesser of $1.0 million or a percentage of
eligible accounts receivable. The working capital line of credit expired on June 30, 2001 and has not been renewed. At June 30, 2001, there was a term note outstanding relating to a
previous equipment line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank totaling $35,798. 

    Eprise's
operating activities have used cash in the current calendar year and each of the last two calendar years. During the calendar years 2000, 1999, and 1998, cash used for
operating activities of approximately $13.4 million, $6.9 million, and $5.3 million, respectively, resulted from net losses of approximately $16.7 million,
$6.6 million, and $5.3 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2000, cash used for operating activities consisted primarily of payroll and related expenditures, as
well as expenditures for marketing programs representing approximately 36%, and expenditures for research and development representing
approximately 15% (excluding payroll and related expenditures). For the year ended December 31, 1999, cash used for operating activities consisted primarily of payroll and related expenditures,
as well as expenditures for marketing programs representing approximately 15%, and expenditures for research and development representing approximately 10% (excluding payroll and related
expenditures). Cash used in operating activities was approximately $11.2 million and $5.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net cash used in
operating activities is primarily attributable to the net losses incurred in both periods. Eprise expects cash operating losses to decrease over time as its revenues increase. However, Eprise will
continue to incur cash operating losses in the short-term as it increases and expands its distribution capability and continues its product development. 

    Cash
used for investing activities was approximately $4.5 million, $366,000, and $350,000 in the calendar years 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively, and $912,000 and
approximately $1.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The cash used for investing activities was primarily used for purchases of computer systems and
software for internal development used to support Eprise's growth, as well as leasehold improvements for Eprise's new corporate office facility, and furniture and equipment to accommodate the
increased number of personnel. 

    Cash
used for financing activities was approximately $2.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2001. Cash provided by financing activities was approximately
$63.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2000 primarily representing the proceeds from Eprise's initial public offering. The cash used for financing activities was primarily used
for the repurchase of Eprise's common stock under a stock repurchase program. 

    Eprise
currently anticipates that its current cash and equivalents will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the
next 12 months. However, Eprise may need to raise additional funds in future periods through public or private financings, or other arrangements. Any additional financings, if needed, might not
be available on reasonable terms or at all. Failure to raise capital when needed could harm Eprise's business, financial condition and results of operations. If additional funds are raised through the
issuance of equity securities, additional dilution could result. In addition, any equity securities issued might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to Eprise's common stock. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

    In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,"
effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. The new standard requires that all companies record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair value.
Gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for based on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. Eprise has adopted
this accounting standard effective January 1, 2001, as required. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 will not have a material impact on Eprise's financial position or results of operations. 

    In
July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 ("SFAS 141"), "Business Combinations."
SFAS 141 requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and eliminates the pooling-of-interests method. Eprise
does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 141 will have a significant impact on its financial statements. 

    Also
in July 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 ("SFAS 142"), "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", which is effective
January 1, 2002. SFAS 142 requires, among other things, the discontinuance of goodwill amortization. Eprise does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 142 will have a significant
impact on its financial statements. 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  

 Interest Rate Risk  

    As of June 30, 2001, Eprise had approximately $54.0 million in cash equivalents and short-term investments that was subject to
interest rate risk. The average interest rate as of June 30, 2001 was approximately 4.0%. 

    The
primary objective of Eprise's investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this
objective,
Eprise maintains its portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments in a limited number of securities, including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds. 

    Eprise
did not hold derivative financial instruments as of June 30, 2001, and has never held such instruments in the past. Eprise had outstanding debt at June 30, 2001
of $35,798. 

 Foreign Currency Risk  

    Currently, the majority of Eprise's sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, Eprise has experienced no significant foreign exchange
gains or losses to date. While Eprise does expect to effect some transactions in foreign currencies in 2001, it does not anticipate that foreign exchange gains or losses will be significant. Eprise
has not engaged in foreign currency hedging activities to date.

COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDERS' RIGHTS    

    The rights of divine and Eprise stockholders are currently governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law, the respective certificates of incorporation and
bylaws of divine and Eprise, and the respective stockholders' rights plans of divine and Eprise. In connection with the merger, the Eprise stockholders will be exchanging their shares of Eprise common
stock for shares of divine common stock and will become subject to the divine certificate of incorporation, bylaws and stockholders' rights plan, which differ from the Eprise certificate of
incorporation, bylaws and stockholders' rights plan in several respects. Because of these differences, the rights of a holder of divine common stock differ from the rights of a holder of Eprise common
stock. 

    Below
is a comparison of some of the important provisions in the certificate of incorporation, bylaws and stockholders' rights plan of divine and Eprise. It is not practical to
summarize all of these provisions in this proxy statement/prospectus, but the principal differences that could materially affect the rights of stockholders include the following: 

AUTHORIZED CAPITAL STOCK

divine

Eprise

divine's certificate of incorporation authorizes divine to issue 2,650,500,000 shares of capital stock, with a par value of $0.001 per share, of which:

 2,500,000,000 are designated class A common stock;

 100,000,000 are designated class C common stock;

 50,000,000 are designated preferred stock; and

 500,000 are designated series A junior participating preferred stock.

As of October 1, 2001, there were:

 approximately 164,124,076 shares of class A common stock issued and outstanding;

 no shares of class C common stock issued and outstanding; and

 no shares of preferred stock, including series A junior participating preferred stock, issued and outstanding.

Eprise's certificate of incorporation authorizes Eprise to issue 100,000,000 shares of capital stock, of which:

 90,000,000 are designated common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share; and

 10,000,000 are designated preferred stock with a par value of $0.01 per share; and

 of the 10,000,000 preferred shares 1,000,000 are designated series A junior participating preferred.

As of October 1, 2001, there were:

 22,270,386 shares of common stock issued and outstanding; and

 no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding.

DIVIDENDS

divine

Eprise

Holders of class A and class C common stock will be entitled to receive dividends or other distributions when and if declared by the divine board of directors.

Holders of the common stock are entitled to receive dividends as and when declared by the Eprise board of directors.

VOTING RIGHTS

divine

Eprise

Holders of class A common stock have the right to cast one vote for each share they hold of record on all matters on which stockholders of divine are generally entitled to vote.

Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held.

Holders of class C common stock do not have any voting rights, except as may be required by Delaware law.

Not applicable

Any stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders may vote either in person or by duly authorized proxy, but no proxy dated more than three years prior to the meeting at which it is offered will confer the right to vote unless the proxy
provides that it will be effective for a longer period.

Same

CUMULATIVE VOTING

divine

Eprise

Holders of common stock may not cumulate their votes for the election of directors.

Same

STOCKHOLDER ACTION

divine

Eprise

At all stockholders meetings, a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum requisite for the transaction of business.

Same

STOCKHOLDERS' RIGHTS PLAN

divine

Eprise

Pursuant to a stockholders' rights plan between divine and the rights agent and adopted by the divine board in 2001, for each outstanding share of divine common stock, a dividend of one right was issued.

 Each right certificate entitles its holder to purchase 1/1,000
th
 of a share of divine series A junior participating preferred stock for $15.00 per right.

 The rights are not exercisable unless a person or group has acquired, or announces the intent to acquire, 15% or more of divine's common stock (20% or more if such a person or group owned 10% or more of divine's common stock at the time
of the plan's adoption).

 The rights, once exercisable, entitle the holder to purchase, for the exercise price of the rights, the number of shares of divine common stock having a market value of two times the exercise price of the rights.

 Alternatively, if the rights have become exercisable and divine is acquired in a merger or other business combination, or 50% or more of its assets, cash flow or earning power are sold, each right will entitle the holder to purchase, for
the exercise price of the right, the number of shares of the acquiring company's common stock that, at the time of the transaction, have a market value of two times the exercise price of the right.

Pursuant to a stockholders' rights plan between Eprise and the rights agent and adopted by the Eprise board in 2000, for each outstanding share of Eprise common stock, a dividend of one right was issued.

 Each right certificate entitles its holder to purchase 1/100th of a share of Eprise series A junior participating preferred stock for $21.00 per right.

 The rights are not exercisable unless a person or group that has not been approved in advance by the board has acquired, or announces the intent to acquire, 15% or more of Eprise's common stock.

 The rights, once exercisable, entitle the holder to purchase, for the exercise price of the rights, the number of shares of Eprise common stock having a market value of two times the exercise price of the rights.

 Alternatively, if the rights have become exercisable and Eprise is acquired in a merger or other business combination, or 50% or more of its assets, cash flow or earning power are sold, and such acquisition or sale has not been approved
in advance by the board, each right will entitle the holder to purchase, for the exercise price of the right, the number of shares of the acquiring company's common stock that, at the time of the transaction, have a market value of two times the
exercise price of the right.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT    

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Eprise Corporation 

    We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Eprise Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of
income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits. 

    We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

    In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Eprise Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

EPRISE CORPORATION
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    

1.  NATURE OF BUSINESS  

    Eprise Corporation and its subsidiaries develop, market and implement web content management solutions that help businesses shape and direct
e-business communications effectively and efficiently. We also provide design and other consultative services designed to help organizations maximize the value they derive from the our web
content management solutions. Business is conducted primarily in the United States. 

2.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

    The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are
eliminated. 

UNAUDITED INTERIM INFORMATION  

    In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2001 and the unaudited consolidated statements of
operations and cash flows for the six month periods ended June 30, 2000 and 2001, include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of
the interim periods presented. The operating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results which would be expected for the full year. 

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION  

    Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into dollars using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. The results of operations are
translated at rates in effect during the periods transactions occur. Translation gains and losses are accumulated as separate components of comprehensive loss. Transaction gains and losses are
recorded to the statement of operations currently; such gains and losses have not been material to date. 

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

 USE OF ESTIMATES  

    The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and reported results of
operations. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

 REVENUE RECOGNITION  

    Revenue from products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed and determinable, and
collectibility is probable. When
arrangements contain multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence exists for all undelivered elements, we recognize revenue for the delivered elements using the residual method. For
arrangements containing multiple elements wherein vendor specific objective 

F7

evidence does not exist for all undelivered elements, revenue for the delivered and undelivered elements is deferred until vendor specific objective evidence exists or all elements have been
delivered. Maintenance services revenues, whether sold separately or as part of a multiple element arrangement, are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract, generally
twelve months. Consulting revenue is recognized as services are performed. Our revenue recognition practices are in conformity with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements." 

 COSTS OF REVENUE  

    Costs of revenue consist primarily of personnel costs related to the provision of services. Costs of licenses, which are comprised of media and documentation
costs, are not material in any period presented. 

 COMPREHENSIVE LOSS  

    Comprehensive loss represents the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from nonowner
sources. For 1999 and 1998, the only item included in comprehensive loss is the Company's net loss. The components of the Company's comprehensive loss in 2000 are as follows: 

Net loss

$

(16,704

)

Foreign currency translation adjustments

Comprehensive loss

$

(16,671

)

 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  

    Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of demand deposits and highly liquid short-term instruments purchased with remaining maturities of
three months or less. 

 DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  

    Property and equipment are stated at cost. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred, while betterments are capitalized. Depreciation and amortization
are provided using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives. Furniture and fixtures are depreciated over 7 years using the half year convention. Computers/Telecom are
depreciated over 3 years using the half year convention. Any software with a value greater than $1,000 is capitalized over 36 months, with the use of the half month convention rule.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or the useful life, whichever is shorter. 

 LONG-LIVED ASSETS  

    Upon occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances, we review the carrying value of its long-lived assets to determine if impairment has
occurred and, if necessary, adjusts the carrying value accordingly. No adjustments have been required to date. 

F8

 STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  

    Compensation expense associated with awards of stock or options to employees is measured using the intrinsic-value method. Compensation expense associated with
awards to nonemployees is measured using the fair-value method. 

 INCOME TAXES  

    Deferred income taxes are provided for differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities and
tax loss and credit carryforwards, using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided to the extent
realization of deferred tax assets is not considered more likely than not. 

 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS  

    Research and development costs, other than software development costs, are expensed as incurred. Software development costs are capitalized upon achievement of
technological feasibility. To date, no costs have been incurred which qualify for capitalization. 

NET LOSS PER SHARE  

 PRO FORMA NET LOSS PER SHARE  

    Pro forma net loss per share has been computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. In addition, for
purposes of pro forma net loss per share, all shares of Series A, B and C preferred stock, which were converted to
common upon closing of our initial public offering in March of 2000, have been treated as though they were common stock in all periods in which such shares were outstanding. In addition, no effect is
given to accretion of the preferred stock for purposes of this computation. 

 HISTORICAL NET LOSS PER SHARE  

    Historical net loss per share has been computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted amounts per
share would include the impact of our outstanding potential common shares, such as options and warrants (computed using the treasury stock method) and convertible preferred stock. However, the effect
of these items would be antidilutive in all periods presented and they are excluded from the computation. 

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS  

    Our revenues are derived from various customers who generally are not required to provide collateral for amounts owed to the Company. We operate in one
segment. Our customers are dispersed over a wide geographic area. 

    In
1999 two major customers accounted for 13% and 10% of our revenues. In 1998 one customer accounted for 58% of our revenues. No other customers accounted for more than 10% of
revenue in any of the other years presented. For the six months ended June 30, 2000 and 2001, there were no customers who individually accounted for more than 10% of revenue. 

F9

DUE FROM RELATED PARTIES  

    Amounts shown as due from related parties represent cash advances due from our employees as well as loans issued under the stock loan program. 

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

 DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS  

    On June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board released Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001 will not have a
material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 

 GOODWILL AND ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  

    In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 ("SFAS 141"),
"Business Combinations." SFAS 141 requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and eliminates the
pooling-of-interests method. We do not believe that the adoption of SFAS 141 will have a significant impact on our financial statements. 

    Also
in July 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 ("SFAS 142"), "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", which is effective
January 1, 2002. SFAS 142 requires, among other things, the discontinuance of goodwill amortization. We do not believe that the adoption of SFAS 141 will have a significant impact
on our financial statements. 

3.  LINES OF CREDIT  

    We have lines of credit with a bank providing for borrowings of up to $1,000,000 for working capital ($800,000 prior to March 26, 1999) and borrowings
of up to $500,000 for equipment purchases ($400,000 prior to March 26, 1999). 

    Borrowings
under the working capital commitment are limited to the lesser of $1,000,000 or 80% of eligible accounts receivable. The revolving line of credit expires on June 30,
2001. Any borrowings outstanding under the working capital line of credit bear interest at the bank's prime rate plus .5%. As of December 31, 1999 and 2000, there were no borrowings under the
working capital line of credit. The equipment line of credit was available to acquire equipment through December 26, 1999, at which time outstanding borrowings converted to a term loan.
Borrowings under the equipment line of credit bear interest at the bank's prime rate plus 1.5%. At December 31, 2000, $78,757 was outstanding under the initial tranche of the equipment line of
credit, all of which is due in 2001. As of December 31, 2000, there were no borrowings under the second tranche of the equipment line of credit. 

    The
revolving line of credit is collateralized by substantially all of our assets. Borrowings under the equipment line of credit are collateralized by the related assets. The lines of
credit contain covenants requiring minimum levels of liquidity and tangible net worth, and prohibit the payment of cash dividends. At December 31, 1999 and 2000, we were in compliance with the
terms and covenants contained in the amended lines of credit. 

F10

4.  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY  

    In November 1999, the number of authorized shares of common stock was increased to 58,500,000. In March 2000, the number of authorized shares of
common stock was further increased to 90,000,000. 

    On
December 11, 2000, our board of directors authorized a plan to repurchase, from time to time, an aggregate of up to $4,000,000 in shares of its outstanding Common Stock. 

    On
December 18, 2000, the Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution, payable to stockholders of record on December 29, 2000, of one preferred share purchase
right for each outstanding share of common stock. The rights expire on December 18, 2010, and will be exercisable only if a person or group (an "Acquiring Person") becomes the beneficial owner
of 15% or more of the Company's common stock or commences a tender or exchange offer which would result in the offeror beneficially owning 15% or more of the common stock. Each right entitles the
registered holder to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of newly
issued Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $21.00 (subject to certain adjustments). Each one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Preferred
Stock has designations and powers, preferences and rights which make its value approximately equal to the value of a share of the Company's common stock. The Company generally will be entitled to
redeem the rights at $0.01 per right at any time prior to the tenth day following a public announcement of the existence of an Acquiring Person. The description and terms of the rights are set forth
in a Stockholder Rights Agreement dated December 18, 2000. 

 REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK  

    Prior to the completion of our initial public offering of common stock in March 2000, we had three series of redeemable convertible preferred stock
outstanding; Series A, Series B and Series C. These series were issued at various times from 1997 through 1999, and all contained preferences over our common stock, including
liquidation preferences, cash redemption requirements, dividend preferences, and voting privileges. When we closed upon the initial public offering, all outstanding shares of redeemable convertible
preferred stock were automatically converted into 16,105,845 shares of our common stock, and those classes of preferred stock were cancelled and all privileges they contained before conversion were
terminated. 

    As
of December 31, 1999, the number of shares and liquidation value of the three classes of our redeemable convertible preferred stock were as follows: 

Number of shares:

Series A

10,515,925

Series B

14,320,446

Series C

16,233,766

Redemption and liquidation value:

Series A

$

5,225,889

Series B

$

8,592,268

Series C

$

25,000,000

    Because the issuance of the Series C was close to the commencement of the Company's initial public offering, we concluded that a
beneficial conversion feature was present in the 

F11

Series C stock on the date of issuance. For purposes of evaluating this beneficial conversion feature, we determined that the mid-point value implied in the preliminary range of
prices for the initial public offering ($9.00) represented the fair value of our common stock on the date the Series C was issued. 

    As
a result of this beneficial conversion feature, the proceeds from the Series C financing were allocated between the conversion feature and the Series C stock; because
the fair value of the common stock ($9.00) was significantly in excess of the conversion price implicit in the Series C stock ($3.93), the entire amount of net proceeds ($21,555,501) were
allocated to the conversion feature. Since the Series C was immediately convertible into common stock, an immediate dividend or accretion of $21,555,501 was recorded from common stockholders'
equity to the carrying value of the Series C preferred stock. 

 WARRANTS  

    In connection with the private placement the Series C preferred stock, we issued to the placement agent a warrant to purchase 254,598 shares of our
common stock at an exercise price of $3.93 per share. The warrant expires five years from the issuance date (September 1999). The estimated fair value of the warrant as of the date of grant was
$1,863,759. The warrant has been recorded as an issuance cost and was offset against the initial carrying value of the Series C Stock. 

    The
warrant was valued on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the assumptions we used to value the warrant were: 

Risk-free interest rate

 STOCK OPTIONS  

    In August 1997, we adopted the 1997 Stock Option Plan (the "1997 Plan"), which provides for the issuance of common stock as either incentive stock
options ("ISOs") or nonqualified stock options ("NSOs"). Under the terms of the 1997 Plan, ISOs are to be granted at the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and NSOs are to be
granted at a price determined by the Board of Directors. ISOs and NSOs generally vest over four years and have contractual lives of up to ten years. In December 1999, we amended the plans to
allow the holder of options to exercise their options immediately, with a requirement that the employees rights to the shares vest over a period that is identical to the original vesting schedule.
Should the employee terminate prior to vesting, the employee is required to resell the shares to us at the original purchase price. This amendment did not result in a new measurement date. 

    In
December 1999, the 1997 Plan was amended to provide for automatic increases in options available for grant on January 1 of each of 2000, 2001 and 2002. The increase
in options available (and the related reserved shares of common stock) in any given year is 

F12

limited to the lesser of 5% of the total outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31st of the previous year or 1,372,549 additional options. 

    As
of the effective date of the 1997 Plan, any unvested or unexercised options that were issued under the 1997 Plan's predecessor, the 1994 Plan, that are forfeited will become
available for issuance under the 1997 Plan thereby increasing the options available for grant under the 1997 Plan to a maximum of 4,144,281 shares. Option activity under both the 1997 and 1994 plans
is as follows:

    In July, 1999, the Board of Directors approved a stock loan program, which allows specified employees to fund the purchase of common stock
pursuant to the exercise of stock options through loans from the Company. Borrowings are limited to 50% of the employee's annual salary. Loans under this program bear interest at a fixed rate of 0.5%
over the Company's cost of funds on the date of the loan and are secured by the underlying shares, with the exception of the interest charges which are on a full-recourse basis. All loans
are due no later than five years from the date of the loan. At December 31, 2000, $641,936 had been advanced to employees under this program. 

    In
January 2000, the Board of Directors approved the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which allows our employees to purchase our common stock through payroll deductions at
85% of the then fair market value of the Company's stock. The Company reserved 588,235 shares for issuance under the plan. The plan provides for automatic increases in shares available for purchase
under the plan. In general, the increase in shares available in any given year is limited to the lesser of 1% of the total outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31st of the previous
year or 294,118 additional shares. 

    The
2000 Non-Employee Director Stock Plan provides for the issuance of options covering up to 274,510 shares of common stock to non-employee directors. Under
the plan, non-employee directors receive a one-time grant of 15,686 options upon election to the Board 

F13

of Directors. In addition, each year all non-employee directors will automatically receive an additional grant of 7,843 shares following our annual meeting. Options granted under the plan
will be immediately exercisable, but will be subject to repurchase restrictions which will lapse over a three year period following the grant. Options granted under the plan contain exercise prices
equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. 

    At
December 31, 2000, there were 221,122 options available for grant under the 1997 Plan, including those shares forfeited under the 1994 Plan. 

    Grants
made during 1999 contained exercise prices which were our best estimate of fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. However, subsequent to the grant
date, we concluded that for grants after the release of the new version of our principal product, these estimates may not have fully reflected the impact of this event. We concluded that for grants
made between May and August 1999, $3.93 was a more reliable estimate of the fair value of the common stock during this period. For grants made in periods after August 1999, we concluded
that the mid-point value implied in the preliminary range of prices for our initial public offering ($9.00) was a more reliable estimate of the fair value of the common stock during the
period. For grants during this period, compensation cost aggregated $6,796,000, which is being amortized to expense over the four year vesting period of the option grants. For the years ended
December 31, 1999 and 2000, compensation expense recorded related to these grants aggregated $523,726 and $1,881,445 respectively. 

    On
May 10, 2001, we commenced a voluntary stock option exchange program for our employees. Under the program, our employees were given the opportunity to elect to cancel
outstanding stock options held by them in exchange for an equal number of new options to be granted at a future date. These elections had to be made by June 8, 2001 and had to include all
options granted during the prior six months. A total of 624,675 options to purchase our common stock were tendered in return for promises to grant new options on the grant date of December 12,
2001. The exercise price of the new options will be equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. 

    The
fair value of the options on their grant date was measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Key assumptions used to apply this option pricing model are as follows:

    The option-pricing model used was designed to value readily tradable stock options with relatively short lives. However, we believe that the
assumptions used to value the options and the model applied yield a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the grants made under the circumstances.
