(1) Based on the maximum number of shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per
    share ("Olin common stock") of Olin Corporation, a Virginia corporation,
    ("Olin") estimated to be issuable upon the completion of the merger (the
    "merger") of Plumber Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly
    owned subsidiary of Olin, with and into Chase Industries Inc., a Delaware
    corporation, ("Chase"), calculated as the product of (a) 16,794,705, the
    aggregate number of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share
    ("Chase common stock"), of Chase outstanding on April 30, 2002 (other than
    shares owned by Olin, Plumber Acquisition Corp. or Chase) to be exchanged

    required by Section 6(b) of the Securities Act, and calculated pursuant to
    Rule 457(f) under the Securities Act. Pursuant to Rule 457(f)(1) under the
    Securities Act, the proposed maximum aggregate offering price of Olin
    common stock was calculated in accordance with Rule 457(c) under the
    Securities Act as: (a) $11.62, the average of the high and low prices per
    share of Chase common stock on May 17, 2002, as reported on the New York

                    QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q: What will happen to Chase as a result of the merger?

A: If the merger is completed, Chase will become a wholly owned subsidiary of
   Olin.

Q: Why are Olin and Chase proposing to merge?

A: Olin and Chase believe that the merger will combine two companies that are
   leaders with premier reputations in their respective fields. Olin and Chase
   believe that the combined company will have the scale, scope and critical
   mass to compete more effectively and be a stronger, less cyclical company.
   Olin and Chase believe the merger will provide the opportunity to leverage
   both Olin's and Chase's strengths and to utilize the combined metallurgical
   and manufacturing capabilities, marketing and distribution know-how and
   economies of scale to further enhance capacity utilization, long-term
   profitability and return on investment.

   To review the reasons for the merger in greater detail, see pages 27 through
   28 and 33 through 35.

Q: What do I need to do now?

A: After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this
   proxy statement/prospectus, please complete and sign your proxy and return
   it in the enclosed return envelope as soon as possible, so that your shares
   may be represented at your special meeting.

   If you are an Olin shareholder, you may also vote your shares on the
   Internet or by telephone. To vote on the Internet or by telephone follow the
   voting instructions that are printed on the Olin proxy card.

   If you sign and submit your proxy and do not indicate how you want to vote,
   we will count your proxy as a vote in favor of the issuance of shares of
   Olin common stock if you are an Olin shareholder or in favor of the adoption
   of the merger agreement if you are a Chase stockholder.

   If you are an Olin shareholder and you abstain from voting or do not vote,
   it will have no effect (assuming that a quorum is present) in determining
   whether the issuance of shares of Olin common stock in the merger will be
   approved. If you are a Chase stockholder and you abstain from voting or do
   not vote, it will be equivalent to a vote against adoption of the merger
   agreement.

   The Olin special meeting will take place on [  .  ], 2002. The Chase special
   meeting will take place on [  .  ], 2002. You may attend your special
   meeting and vote your shares in person rather than signing and completing
   your proxy.

Q: Can I change my vote after I have completed my signed proxy?

A: Yes. You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at your
   special meeting. You can do this in one of four ways. First, you can send a
   written notice stating that you would like to revoke your proxy. Second, if
   you are an Olin shareholder, you can cast a new vote on the Internet or by
   telephone. Third, you can complete and submit a new proxy. If you choose any
   of these three methods, you must submit your notice of revocation or your
   new proxy to Olin at the address on page 86 or to Chase at the address on
   page 86. Fourth, you can attend your special meeting and vote in person.

Q: If my broker holds my shares in "street name", will my broker vote my shares?

A: Your broker will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to
   vote. You should follow the directions provided by your broker regarding how
   to instruct your broker to vote your shares. If you are an Olin shareholder
   and you do not provide your broker with instructions on how to vote your
   shares, it will have no effect (assuming that a quorum is present) in
   determining whether the issuance of shares of Olin common stock in the
   merger will be

   approved. If you are a Chase stockholder and you do not provide your broker
   with instructions on how to vote your shares, it will be equivalent to a
   vote against adoption of the merger agreement.

Q: How do I vote my shares held in the Olin Contributing Employee Ownership
   Plan or Arch Chemicals, Inc. Contributing Employee Ownership Plan?

A: If you are a participant in the Olin Corporation Contributing Employee
   Ownership Plan or the Arch Chemicals, Inc. Contributing Employee Ownership
   Plan, or the CEOP, you may instruct JPMorgan Chase Bank, the Trustee of the
   CEOP, how to vote shares of common stock credited to you by indicating your
   instructions on your proxy card and returning it to Olin or by voting on the
   Internet or telephone. JPMorgan Chase Bank will vote shares of common stock
   held in the CEOP for which it does not receive voting instructions, or which
   are not credited to participants' accounts, in the same manner
   proportionately as it votes the shares of common stock for which they do
   receive instructions.

Q: Should I send in my Chase stock certificates now?

A: No. After the merger is completed, we will send Chase stockholders written
   instructions for exchanging their Chase stock certificates. Chase
   stockholders should not send in their stock certificates now. Olin
   shareholders will keep their existing share certificates.

Q: When do you expect to complete the merger?

A: We expect to complete the merger by mid-summer 2002. We are working to
   complete the merger as quickly as possible and intend to do so shortly after
   the requisite approvals at the special meetings, provided that we have
   obtained the regulatory approvals necessary for the merger.

   This summary highlights selected information from this proxy
statement/prospectus and may not contain all of the information that is
important to you. To understand the merger fully and for a more complete
description of the legal terms of the merger, you should read carefully this

                                    General

What You Will Receive in the Merger

  Olin shareholders

   After the merger, each share of Olin common stock will remain outstanding.

  Chase stockholders

   In the merger, holders of Chase common stock will receive 0.6400 shares of
Olin common stock for each share of Chase common stock that they own.
Stockholders will receive cash for any fractional shares which they would
otherwise receive in the merger. This amount will be calculated by multiplying
the fractional share interest of Olin common stock to which each Chase
stockholder would be entitled by the closing price of Olin common stock on the
closing date.

   Chase stockholders should not send in their Chase stock certificates until
instructed to do so after the merger is completed.

Ownership of Olin After the Merger

   Based on the number of outstanding shares of Chase common stock on [  .  ],
2002, the most recent practicable date prior to the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus, Chase stockholders will receive a total of approximately
[  .  ] shares of Olin common stock in the merger. Based on that number and on
the number of outstanding shares of Olin common stock on [  .  ], 2002, after
the merger former Chase stockholders will own approximately [  .  ]%, and
existing Olin shareholders will own approximately [  .  ]%, of the outstanding
shares of Olin common stock.

Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 49)

   The merger will be tax-free to holders of Chase common stock for United
States federal income tax purposes, except with respect to cash received for
fractional shares of Olin common stock.

   Tax matters are very complicated and the tax consequences of the merger to
you will depend on the facts of your own situation. You should consult your own
tax advisor for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the merger to
you.

Board of Directors Recommendations (pages 28 and 35)

   The Olin board of directors has determined that the merger and the merger
agreement are advisable and recommends that Olin shareholders vote FOR the
issuance of shares of Olin common stock in the merger.

   The Chase board of directors, in a seven to one vote, has determined that
the merger and the merger agreement are advisable and recommends that Chase
stockholders vote FOR the adoption of the merger agreement. Mr. Martin V.
Alonzo voted against the merger.

   To review the background and reasons for the merger in greater detail, as
well as certain risks related to the merger, see pages 16, 22 through 26, 27
through 28 and 33 through 35.

Fairness Opinions of Financial Advisors

  Olin (page 28)

   In deciding to approve the merger and the issuance of shares of Olin common
stock in the

merger, the Olin board of directors considered the opinion, dated May 7, 2002
of its financial advisor, Lehman Brothers Inc., as to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, as of that date, of the 0.6400 exchange ratio to Olin.
This opinion is attached as Annex 3 to this proxy statement/prospectus. We
encourage Olin shareholders to read this opinion carefully.

  Chase (page 35)

   In deciding to approve the merger, the Chase board of directors considered
the opinion, dated May 7, 2002, of its financial advisor, Credit Suisse First
Boston Corporation, or CSFB, as to the fairness, from a financial point of
view, as of that date, of the 0.6400 exchange ratio to the Chase stockholders.
This opinion is attached as Annex 4 to this proxy statement/prospectus. We
encourage Chase stockholders to read this opinion carefully.

Interests of Chase's Directors and Management in the Merger (page 43)

   Chase stockholders should note that some Chase directors and officers have
interests in the merger as directors or officers that are different from, or in
addition to, the interests of other Chase stockholders. You should be aware of
these interests because they may conflict with yours. If we complete the
merger, several current Chase executive officers will continue to be employees
of Chase. Several Chase officers have entered into agreements with Olin and
Chase that modify their existing agreements with Chase and provide for
retention payments if they remain employed with Chase through the expiration of
the two-year period following the completion of the merger and severance
benefits if their employment is terminated prior to the expiration of the
two-year period following the completion of the merger. The indemnification
arrangements for current Chase directors and officers will also be continued.
In addition, options to acquire Chase common stock held by all Chase employees
will automatically vest.

Olin and Chase using the purchase method of accounting for business
combinations. Each of Olin's and Chase's fiscal year ends on December 31.

   The unaudited "pro forma combined" and the unaudited "pro forma
equivalent--Chase" information assumes that the merger occurred on January 1,
2001. The unaudited "pro forma combined" information combines the financial
information of Olin for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, and the
three-month period ended March 31, 2002, with the financial information of
Chase for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, and the three-month period
ended March 31, 2002.

   The unaudited "pro forma equivalent--Chase" information was calculated by
multiplying the corresponding pro forma combined data by the exchange ratio of
0.6400. This information shows how each share of Chase common stock would have
participated in net income (loss) and book value of Olin if the merger had been
completed at the beginning of the earliest period presented. However, these
amounts do not necessarily reflect future per share levels of income (loss)
from continuing operations, cash dividends or book value of Olin. The following
information which is unaudited comparative and unaudited pro forma per share
data is derived from the historical and unaudited pro forma combined condensed
financial statements of Olin and Chase.

   You should read the information in this section along with Olin's and
Chase's historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes
included in the documents described under "Where You Can Find More Information"
on page 85. You should also read the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial statements and accompanying discussion and notes included in this
proxy statement/prospectus starting on page 65.

(1) Historical book value per common share is computed by dividing
    shareholders' equity or stockholders' equity by the number of shares of
    common stock outstanding at the end of each period. Olin unaudited pro
    forma combined book value per common share is computed by dividing
    unaudited pro forma shareholders' equity by the unaudited pro forma number
    of shares of Olin common stock that would have been outstanding had the
    merger been completed as of each balance sheet date.
(2) Reflects the cost in excess of acquired net assets after assigning the fair
    value of assets and liabilities acquired by Olin. The results of final
    valuations of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets have not
    yet been completed as well as final estimates for other charges and
    true-ups as of the closing date, which may be material.

- --------
 (1) In the year ended December 31, 2001, Cost of Goods Sold included $2
     million of unusual items, which represented the write-off of inventory
     associated with canceled customer orders.

 (2) In the year ended December 31, 2001, Other Income included $1 million of
     unusual items, which represented the write-off of an investment in an
     E-commerce company, $11 million of gains on the demutualization of
     Prudential Insurance and $6 million related to the sale of excess real
     estate property.
 (3) In the year ended December 31, 2001, Gain (Loss) on Sales and
     Restructurings of Businesses and Spin-off Costs consisted of a $39 million
     pretax charge for restructuring costs associated with a salaried workforce
     reduction through an early retirement incentive program, a voluntary
     special separation program and the consolidation of certain Metals
     facilities to optimize distribution operations. In the year ended December
     31, 1998, Gain (Loss) on Sales and Restructurings of Businesses and
     Spin-off Costs consisted of a $42 million pretax charge related to the
     sale of the microelectronic packaging unit at Manteca, CA, for $4 million
     in cash, and the restructuring of the rod, wire and tube businesses at
     Indianapolis, IN, and a $21 million pretax charge for non-recurring costs
     associated with the spin-off of our specialty chemicals businesses as Arch
     Chemicals, Inc. which represented primarily severance, investment banking
     and legal fees.
 (4) Income from Discontinued Operations Net of Taxes included the operating
     results of our specialty chemicals businesses, which we spun-off as Arch
     Chemicals, Inc. on February 8, 1999. Accordingly, 1999 included the
     operating results of Arch Chemicals, Inc. for the month of January while
     the 1998 and 1997 years included twelve months of operating results.
 (5) Working Capital includes $205 million at March 31, 2002, $11 million at
     March 31, 2001, $165 million at December 31, 2001, $57 million at December
     31, 2000, $21 million at December 31, 1999, $50 million at December 31,
     1998 and $157 million at December 31, 1997 of Cash and Cash Equivalents
     and $25 million at March 31, 2002 and 2001, $37 million at December 31,
     2001, $25 million at December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 and $28 million at
     December 31, 1997 of short-term investments.
 (6) In 1999, the spin-off of Arch Chemicals, Inc. reduced Shareholders' Equity
     by $453 million.
 (7) For purposes of determining the ratio of earnings to fixed charges,
     earnings are defined as Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations before
     income taxes, less interest capitalized, less undistributed earnings
     (loss) of non-consolidated affiliates plus fixed charges and preferred
     stock dividends. Fixed charges consist of interest expense on all
     indebtedness and that portion of operating lease rental expense that is
     representative of the interest factor. Income (Loss) from Continuing
     Operations was insufficient to cover fixed charges by approximately $15
     million and $13 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2002
     and the year ended December 31, 2001, respectively.
 (8) This percentage has been calculated by dividing Total Debt by Total
     Capitalization.
 (9) Employee data excludes employees who work at
     government-owned/contactor-operated facilities, and employees of Arch
     Chemicals, Inc. which we spun-off in 1999.

(1) Exclusive of depreciation shown separately.

(2) Inventories are stated at lower of cost-or-market, with cost determined on
    the last-in, first out (LIFO) basis. During 2001 and 1998, Chase recorded
    non-cash inventory writedowns totaling $1.8 million and $3.2 million,
    respectively, due to reductions in the brass metal price.

(3) Includes costs associated with incremental consulting and legal expenses
    resulting from activities related to an unsolicited tender offer, which
    expired January 31, 2001, and an executive severance package of $0.6
    million in 2001.

(4) Other non-operating expenses of $0.4 million consisted of Chase's write-off
    of its investment in MetalSpectrum, a consortium of major metals-related
    companies that provided business-to-business internet services.
    MetalSpectrum ceased operations in June 2001 due to low demand for its
    services and economic conditions.

(5) In first quarter 2001, Chase sold the assets and operations of Leavitt Tube
    Company, Inc. Chase received $31.7 million in cash, before closing costs
    and fees of $1.9 million. In fourth quarter 2000, Chase recorded an
    estimated loss on the sale of Leavitt Tube of $36.0 million, net of income
    tax benefit of $11.3 million. In fourth quarter 2001, Chase recorded an
    additional $0.2 million, net of taxes, loss on the sale of Leavitt Tube,
    which resulted from the additional costs associated with certain
    post-closing liabilities maintained by Chase. The disposal of Leavitt Tube
    represented the disposal of a business segment and is reflected as
    discontinued operations.

Olin and Chase Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Data

   The following selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data
of Olin and Chase combine the consolidated financial information of Olin for
the year ended December 31, 2001 and at and for the three-month period ended
March 31, 2002 with the consolidated financial information of Chase for the
year ended December 31, 2001 and at and for the three-month period ended March
31, 2002. The selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data is
derived from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements
contained elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. This pro forma
information does not give effect to any potential cost savings or other
synergies that could result from the merger.
   The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not
purport to represent what the combined company's financial position or results
of operations would have been had the merger occurred at the beginning of the
earliest period presented or to project the combined financial position or
results of operations for any future date or period.

                      RISK FACTORS RELATING TO THE MERGER

   In addition to the other information included and incorporated by reference
in this proxy statement/prospectus, Olin shareholders should consider carefully
the matters described below in determining whether to approve the issuance of
shares of Olin common stock in the merger and Chase stockholders should
consider carefully the matters described below in determining whether to adopt
the merger agreement.

   . The exchange ratio for shares of Olin common stock to be received in the
     merger is fixed and will not be adjusted in the event of any change in
     stock price.  Under the merger agreement, each share of Chase common stock
     will be converted into the right to receive 0.6400 shares of Olin common
     stock. This exchange ratio is a fixed number and will not be adjusted in
     the event of any increase or decrease in the price of Olin common stock or
     Chase common stock. The prices of Olin common stock and Chase common stock
     at the closing of the merger may vary from their respective prices on the
     date of this proxy statement/prospectus and on the dates of the special
     meetings. These prices may vary as a result of changes in the business,
     operations or prospects of Olin or Chase, market assessments of the
     likelihood that the merger will be completed, the timing of the completion
     of the merger, the prospects of post-merger operations, regulatory
     considerations, general market and economic conditions and other factors.
     Because the date that the merger is completed may be later than the dates
     of the special meetings, the prices of Olin common stock and Chase common
     stock on the dates of the special meetings may not be indicative of their
     respective prices on the date the merger is completed. We urge Olin
     shareholders and Chase stockholders to obtain current market quotations
     for Olin common stock and Chase common stock.

   . The price of Olin common stock on the closing date may be lower than the
     average price required to satisfy a condition to closing.  Under the
     merger agreement, Chase is not obligated to complete the merger if the
     average of the volume weighted averages of the trading price of Olin
     common stock for the five trading days ending on the second trading day
     immediately preceding the closing date is not equal to or greater than
     $14.50. The price of Olin common stock on the closing date could be lower
     than $14.50, yet Chase may be obligated to complete the merger because the
     average of the volume weighted averages of the trading price of Olin
     common stock as described above could be greater than $14.50.

   . The merger may cause customers to delay purchasing decisions.  There can
     be no assurance that certain customers of Chase will continue to use and
     purchase Chase's products or services as they have in the past without
     regard to the proposed merger.

   . The price of Olin common stock may be affected by factors different from
     those affecting the price of Chase common stock.  Upon completion of the
     merger, holders of Chase common stock will become holders of Olin common
     stock. Olin's business is different from that of Chase, and Olin's results
     of operations, as well as the price of Olin common stock, may be affected
     by factors different than those affecting Chase's results of operations
     and the price of Chase common stock. For a discussion of Olin's and
     Chase's businesses and certain factors to consider in connection with such
     businesses, see Olin's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
     ended December 31, 2001 and Chase's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
     fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, which are incorporated by reference
     in this proxy statement/prospectus.

                           THE OLIN SPECIAL MEETING

   We are furnishing this proxy statement/prospectus to shareholders of Olin as
part of the solicitation of proxies by the Olin board of directors for use at
the Olin special meeting.

Date, Time and Place

   We will hold the Olin special meeting on [  .  ], 2002, at [  .  ], local
time, at [  .  ].

Purpose of Olin Special Meeting

   At the Olin special meeting, we are asking holders of Olin common stock to
approve the issuance of shares of Olin common stock in order for each Chase
stockholder to receive in the merger 0.6400 shares of Olin common stock for
each share of Chase common stock that they own. See "The Merger" and "The
Merger Agreement and Related Documents". The Olin board of directors has
approved the merger agreement and the merger, and has determined that the
merger and the merger agreement are advisable. The Olin board of directors
recommends that Olin shareholders vote FOR the issuance of shares of Olin
common stock in the merger.

Olin Record Date; Stock Entitled to Vote; Quorum

   Only holders of record of Olin common stock at the close of business on
[  .  ], 2002, the Olin record date, are entitled to notice of and to vote at
the Olin special meeting. On [  .  ], 2002, the most recent practicable date
prior to the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, approximately [  .  ]
shares of Olin common stock were issued and outstanding and held by
approximately [  .  ] holders of record. A quorum will be present at the Olin
special meeting if a majority of the shares of Olin common stock issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote on the Olin record date are represented in
person or by proxy. Shares of Olin common stock represented at the Olin special
meeting but not voting, including shares of Olin common stock for which proxies
have been received but for which holders of shares have abstained, will be
treated as present at the Olin special meeting for purposes of determining the
presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of all business. If a
quorum is not present at the Olin special meeting, we expect that the meeting
will be adjourned or postponed to solicit additional proxies. Holders of record
of Olin common stock on the Olin record date are entitled to one vote per share
at the Olin special meeting on the proposal to approve the issuance of shares
of Olin common stock in the merger.

Votes Required

   The issuance of shares of Olin common stock in the merger requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all shares of Olin common
stock casting votes in person or by proxy at the Olin special meeting, assuming
that the total votes cast, including votes cast against the proposal, represent
more than 50% of all Olin common stock entitled to vote. If an Olin shareholder
abstains from voting or does not vote, it will have no effect (assuming that a
quorum is present) in determining whether the issuance of shares of Olin common
stock in the merger will be approved.

   Only shares affirmatively voted for the issuance of shares of Olin common
stock in the merger, including votes cast over the Internet or by telephone and
properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions, will be
counted as favorable votes for that proposal. Brokers who hold shares of Olin
common stock in street name for customers who are the beneficial owners of
those shares may not give a proxy to vote those shares without specific
instructions from those customers. These non-voted shares are referred to as
broker non-votes and will have no effect (assuming that a quorum is present) in
determining whether the issuance of shares of Olin common stock in the merger
will be approved.

Voting by Olin Directors and Executive Officers

   At the close of business on April 30, 2002, directors and executive officers
of Olin and their affiliates owned and were entitled to vote approximately
508,529 shares of Olin common stock, which represented approximately 1.1% of
the shares of Olin common stock outstanding on that date. Each

Olin director and executive officer has indicated his or her present intention
to vote, or cause to be voted, the shares of Olin common stock owned by him or
her for the issuance of shares of Olin in the merger.

Voting of Proxies

   All shares represented by properly executed proxies received in time for the
Olin special meeting will be voted at the Olin special meeting in the manner
specified by the holders of those proxies. Properly executed proxies that do
not contain voting instructions will be voted for the issuance of shares of
Olin common stock in the merger.

   In addition to manually executing and returning a proxy by mail, Olin
shareholders may vote by telephone or over the Internet. If voting by telephone
or over the Internet, the shareholder should dial the toll-free number or
access the Internet address, in each case as indicated on the shareholder's
proxy card. The shareholders will then be prompted to enter the control number
printed on his or her proxy card and to follow the subsequent instructions.

   Olin does not expect that any matter other than the proposal to issue shares
of Olin common stock in the merger will be brought before the Olin special
meeting. If, however, the Olin board of directors properly presents other
matters, the persons named as proxies will vote in accordance with their
judgment.

Revocability of Proxies

   The grant of a proxy on the enclosed proxy card or over the Internet or by
telephone does not preclude an Olin shareholder from voting in person at the
Olin special meeting. An Olin shareholder may revoke a proxy at any time prior
to its exercise by filing with Olin a duly executed revocation of proxy, by
submitting a duly executed proxy to Olin bearing a later date, by casting a new
vote over the Internet or by telephone or by appearing at the Olin special
meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the Olin special meeting will not
itself revoke a proxy.

Solicitation of Proxies

   Olin will bear the cost of the solicitation of proxies from its
shareholders. In addition to solicitation by mail, the directors, officers and
employees of Olin and its subsidiaries may solicit proxies from Olin
shareholders by telephone or other electronic means or in person. Arrangements
will also be made with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and
fiduciaries for the forwarding of solicitation materials to the beneficial
owners of stock held of record by these persons, and Olin will reimburse them
for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

   Olin will mail a copy of this proxy statement/prospectus to each holder of
record of Olin common stock on the Olin record date.

   Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc. will assist in the solicitation of
proxies by Olin. Olin will pay Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc. a fee
of $25,000, plus reimbursement of certain out-of-pocket expenses, and will
indemnify Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc. against any losses arising
out of Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc's. proxy soliciting services on
behalf of Olin.

Proxies for Participants in the Olin Contributing Employee Ownership Plan or
Arch Chemicals, Inc. Contributing Employee Ownership Plan

   If you are a participant in the CEOP, you may instruct JPMorgan Chase Bank,
the Trustee of the CEOP, how to vote shares of common stock credited to you by
indicating your instructions on your proxy card and returning it to Olin or by
voting on the Internet or by telephone. JPMorgan Chase Bank will vote shares of
common stock held in the CEOP for which it does not receive voting
instructions, or which are not credited to participants' accounts, in the same
manner proportionately as it votes the shares of common stock for which they do
receive instructions.

                           THE CHASE SPECIAL MEETING

   We are furnishing this proxy statement/prospectus to stockholders of Chase
as part of the solicitation of proxies by the Chase board of directors for use
at the Chase special meeting.

Date, Time and Place

   We will hold the Chase special meeting on, [  .  ], 2002, at [  .  ], local
time, at [  .  ].

Purpose of Chase Special Meeting

   At the Chase special meeting, we are asking holders of record of Chase
common stock to consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the merger agreement
among Olin, Plumber Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Olin, and Chase, providing for the merger of Plumber
Acquisition Corp. with and into Chase. After the merger, Chase will be a
subsidiary of Olin.

   A majority of the Chase board of directors has approved the merger agreement
and has determined that the merger and the merger agreement are advisable and
recommends that Chase stockholders vote FOR the adoption of the merger
agreement. Mr. Alonzo voted against the merger.

Chase Record Date; Stock Entitled to Vote; Quorum

   Only holders of record of Chase common stock at the close of business on
[  .  ], 2002, the Chase record date, are entitled to notice of and to vote at
the Chase special meeting and any adjournments or postponements of it.

   On [  .  ], 2002, the most recent practicable date prior to the date of this
proxy statement/prospectus, [  .  ] shares of Chase common stock were
outstanding and held by approximately [  .  ] holders of record. A quorum will
be present at the Chase special meeting if a majority of the shares of Chase
common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote on the Chase record
date are represented in person or by proxy. Shares of Chase common stock
represented at the Chase special meeting but not voting, including shares of
Chase common stock for which proxies have been received but for which holders
of shares have abstained, will be treated as present at the Chase special
meeting for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the
transaction of all business. If a quorum is not present at the Chase special
meeting, we expect that the Chase special meeting will be adjourned or
postponed to solicit additional proxies. Holders of record of Chase common
stock on the Chase record date are entitled to one vote per share at the Chase
special meeting on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

Votes Required

   The adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares of Chase common stock issued and outstanding and
entitled to vote on the Chase record date. If a Chase stockholder abstains from
voting or does not vote (either in person or by proxy), it will have the same
effect as if that Chase stockholder had voted against adoption of the merger
agreement.

   Only shares affirmatively voted for adoption of the merger agreement,
including properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions,
will be counted as favorable votes for these proposals. Brokers who hold shares
of Chase common stock in street name for customers who are the beneficial
owners of those shares may not give a proxy to vote those shares without
specific instructions from

those customers. These non-voted shares are referred to as broker non-votes and
have the same effect as votes against adoption of the merger agreement.

Voting by Chase Directors and Executive Officers

   At the close of business on April 30, 2002, directors and executive officers
of Chase and their affiliates (other than Court Square Capital which is
discussed below) owned and were entitled to vote 1,090,819 shares of Chase
common stock, which represented approximately 7.1% of the shares of Chase
common stock outstanding on that date.

   Under the terms of a voting agreement with Olin, Court Square Capital has
agreed to vote its shares of Chase common stock for adoption of the merger
agreement. On April 30, 2002, Court Square Capital owned and was entitled to
vote 7,289,945 shares of Chase common stock, or approximately 47.6% of the
shares of Chase common stock outstanding on that date.

Voting of Proxies

   All shares represented by properly executed proxies received in time for the
Chase special meeting will be voted at the Chase special meeting in the manner
specified by the holders of those proxies. Properly executed proxies that do
not contain voting instructions will be voted for adoption of the merger
agreement.

   The persons named as proxies by a Chase stockholder may propose and vote for
one or more adjournments of the Chase special meeting, including adjournments
to permit further solicitations of proxies. No proxy voted against the
proposals to adopt the merger agreement will be voted in favor of any such
adjournment or postponement.

   Chase does not expect that any matter other than the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement will be brought before the Chase special meeting. If, however,
the Chase board of directors properly presents other matters, the persons named
as proxies will vote in accordance with their judgment.

Revocability of Proxies

   The grant of a proxy on the enclosed proxy card does not preclude a Chase
stockholder from voting in person at the Chase special meeting. A Chase
stockholder may revoke a proxy at any time prior to its exercise by filing with
Chase a duly executed revocation of proxy, by submitting a duly executed proxy
to Chase bearing a later date or by appearing at the Chase special meeting and
voting in person. Attendance at the Chase special meeting will not itself
revoke a proxy.

Solicitation of Proxies

   Chase will bear the cost of the solicitation of proxies from its
stockholders. In addition to solicitation by mail, the directors, officers and
employees of Chase and its subsidiaries may solicit proxies from Chase
stockholders by telephone or other electronic means or in person. Arrangements
will also be made with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and
fiduciaries for the forwarding of solicitation materials to the beneficial
owners of stock held of record by these persons, and Chase will reimburse them
for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

   Chase will mail a copy of this proxy statement/prospectus to each holder of
record of Chase common stock on the Chase record date.

   Mellon Investor Services LLC will assist in the solicitation of proxies by
Chase. Chase will pay Mellon Investor Services LLC a fee of $6,000, plus
reimbursement of certain out-of-pocket expenses, and will indemnify Mellon
Investor Services LLC against any losses arising out of Mellon Investor
Services LLC's proxy soliciting services on behalf of Chase.

   Chase stockholders should not send stock certificates with their proxies.  A
transmittal form with instructions for the surrender of Chase common stock
certificates will be mailed to Chase stockholders as soon as practicable after
completion of the merger.

                                  THE MERGER

   The discussion in this proxy statement/prospectus of the merger and the
principal terms of each of:

   . the merger agreement dated as of May 7, 2002, among Olin, Plumber
     Acquisition Corp. and Chase (the "merger agreement")

   . the voting agreement dated as of May 7, 2002, between Olin and Court
     Square Capital Limited, an affiliate of Citicorp Venture Capital (the
     "voting agreement")

is a summary of the material terms of these agreements and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the merger agreement and the voting agreement, copies
of which are attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annexes 1 and 2,
respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.

Background to the Merger

   For a number of years, Citicorp Venture Capital, or CVC, had periodically
reviewed the nature of its investment in Chase and had numerous discussions
with members of the Chase board of directors, sometimes referred to as the
"Chase Board", about alternatives to increase stockholders' value and enhance
liquidity for CVC and the other Chase stockholders. During such time, Thomas F.
McWilliams, managing director of CVC serving on the Chase Board repeatedly
expressed his disappointment with Chase's return on capital employed and
encouraged management and the Chase Board to explore alternatives to create
value for all stockholders.

   In October 1999, Chase hired a predecessor of CSFB to advise the Chase Board
on strategic alternatives to increase stockholders' value and to enhance
liquidity for all stockholders.

   On December 18, 2000, Chase Acquisition Corporation, an affiliate of CVC
("Chase Acquisition"), publicly announced its intention to make an unsolicited
tender offer to purchase up to 2.3 million shares of Chase common stock at a
price of $10.50 cash per share. Chase Acquisition also announced plans to
complete a second-step merger to acquire all common stock of Chase that
remained outstanding following the unsolicited tender offer at a cash price of
$10.50 per share. On January 2, 2001, Chase Acquisition formally commenced its
offer.

   On December 27, 2000, Chase announced that the Chase Board had authorized
the adoption of a stockholder rights plan, engaged CSFB to advise in connection
with its evaluation of Chase Acquisition's offer and approved a number of
defensive by-law amendments.

   On January 9, 2001, the Chase Board established a subcommittee of the Chase
Board comprised of four outside directors (the "Subcommittee") to evaluate
Chase Acquisition's offer and other alternatives for Chase. At a meeting of the
Subcommittee on January 9, 2001, Credit Suisse First Boston discussed with the
Subcommittee inquiries received from a number of third parties, including Olin,
regarding possible business combination transactions involving Chase.

   Between January 9, 2001 and January 12, 2001, at the direction of the
Subcommittee, several companies were contacted to inquire as to their interest
in a business combination transaction with Chase. On January 12, 2001, Chase
received a non-binding indication of interest from Olin outlining a proposal to
acquire Chase for a cash purchase price of approximately $12.00 per share,
subject to due diligence and several contingencies.

   On January 12, 2001, Chase and Olin entered into a confidentiality agreement
and over the weekend and into Monday, January 15, 2001, Olin engaged in
extensive business, financial and legal due diligence including meetings with
Chase's management and a plant visitation. On January 15, 2001, Olin delivered
to Chase a letter containing a non-binding proposal to acquire all of the
outstanding shares of Chase common stock at a cash price per share of $11.00
plus 75% of any net

cash proceeds received (including any related tax benefits realized or
reasonably expected to be realized) by Chase from its disposition of its
subsidiary Leavitt Tube Company, Inc. This proposal was contingent on CVC,
through its affiliate Court Square Capital, committing its shares to the
transaction and the sale of Leavitt Tube. The Subcommittee estimated that the
aggregate value of the Leavitt Tube portion of the consideration payable to the
stockholders of Chase would amount to between $1.00 to $2.00 per share,
implying an aggregate per share price of the proposal of between $12.00 and
$13.00 for each share of Chase common stock.

   Between January 13, 2001 and January 25, 2001, the Subcommittee and its
legal and financial advisors held discussions with CVC/Court Square Capital
regarding the terms of the Chase Acquisition unsolicited tender offer and Olin
regarding the terms of its proposal, as well as continuing discussions
regarding potential business combination transactions with third parties.

   On January 25, 2001, the Chase Board, acting through the Subcommittee,
unanimously recommended that the stockholders of Chase reject the Chase
Acquisition unsolicited tender offer for the reasons set forth in Chase's
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 filed on January 25,
2001, including the following:

   . the Subcommittee believed the tender offer price did not reflect the
     inherent value of Chase

   . the Subcommittee believed there were numerous conditions to and
     contingencies associated with the tender offer and

   . the Subcommittee believed the possibility existed of receiving a higher
     offer for Chase.

   On January 31, 2001, Chase Acquisition terminated the unsolicited tender
offer upon the expiration thereof without any shares of Chase common stock
being purchased. After the termination of the Chase Acquisition unsolicited
tender offer, from February 2001 through March 2001 the Subcommittee and its
legal and financial advisors continued discussions with Olin, and contacted a
number of other potential financial and strategic acquirors regarding a
possible business combination transaction with Chase.

   On March 30, 2001, Chase sold Leavitt Tube to Pinkert Industrial Group, LLC
for approximately $31.7 million in cash, generating approximately $11.4 million
of future tax benefits from such sale, or total proceeds and benefits estimated
at $2.85 per share.

   On April 27, 2001, Olin informed the Chase Board that it was withdrawing its
non-binding proposal to acquire Chase as a result of changes in the
then-current economic conditions and the failure to reach agreement with CVC on
the sale of its interest in Chase on mutually agreeable terms. On May 7, 2001,
Chase issued a press release regarding Olin's withdrawal of its non-binding
proposal without identifying Olin by name.

   At a May 2, 2001 meeting of the Chase Board, Mr. McWilliams informed the
other Chase Board members that Court Square Capital and Chase Acquisition were
still interested in evaluating an acquisition of Chase.

   After Olin's withdrawal of its non-binding proposal, the Subcommittee and
its legal and financial advisors continued to solicit indications of interest
from third parties for a business combination transaction involving Chase. From
February 2001 through August 2001, thirteen organizations signed
confidentiality agreements, received information about Chase and engaged in
discussions and/or meetings with representatives of Chase. From March 2001
through August 2001, Chase received several written non-binding indications of
interest from potential financial acquirors and strategic

acquirors. These indications ranged from $10.00 to $13.61 per share in cash, as
well as a potential stock-for-stock merger. Further discussions with each such
potential acquiror from March 2001 through October 2001 failed to result in a
firm proposal or an agreement on the terms of a potential transaction with
Chase, and thereafter such potential acquirors withdrew their indications of
interest.

   At the July 19, 2001 meeting of the Chase Board, Mr. McWilliams informed the
other Board members that Court Square Capital and Chase Acquisition were still
interested in evaluating an acquisition of Chase and requested the opportunity
to conduct due diligence. Such due diligence did not proceed, however, because
the parties could not agree on terms of a confidentiality agreement.

   The Chase Board met on August 30, 2001. At that meeting, Martin V. Alonzo
resigned as Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President of
Chase; and John H. Steadman was elected President and Chief Executive Officer
of Chase as of such date. The Chase Board discussed two recently received
indications of interest from potential financial acquirors and charged Mr.
Steadman to work with the two potential financial acquirors toward a firm
proposal and also to invite CVC to make a proposal, but no other parties were
to be solicited at the time. The Chase Board concluded that a continued process
of soliciting indications of interest would be disruptive to Chase's business
and that a prompt resolution of the sales process was desired. On September 28,
2001, CVC and Chase executed a new confidentiality agreement and CVC conducted
additional due diligence. October 22, 2001 was established as a deadline for
the submission of final indications of interest from all three parties.

   The Chase Board met next on October 26, 2001 to review the outcome. In the
face of uncertainty arising from the events of September 11th and a very
difficult financing market for leveraged buyouts, one party withdrew, the
second party lowered their indication of interest to between $10.00 and $10.25
per share, and CVC, through Chase Acquisition, submitted a non-binding
indication of interest of $10.25 per share. The Chase Board, based on the
recommendation of the Subcommittee, determined not to proceed any further with
either proposal. The Chase Board also determined that the work of the
Subcommittee had been completed and that Chase would no longer actively solicit
offers. Therefore, the Subcommittee was disbanded.

   In early January 2002, representatives of Lehman Brothers, financial advisor
to Olin, contacted Mr. McWilliams and indicated that Olin was interested in
reviving discussions regarding a business combination transaction with Chase,
but only on terms that could be supported by CVC/Court Square Capital.

   On January 10, 2002, Mr. McWilliams and other representatives of CVC/Court
Square Capital met with Joseph D. Rupp, President and Chief Executive Officer
of Olin and Anthony W. Ruggiero, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer of Olin, together with Olin's financial advisor, to discuss terms of a
possible stock-for-stock business combination between Olin and Chase that might
be acceptable to CVC/Court Square Capital. No agreement or understandings of
acceptable terms was reached at this meeting. That afternoon, Mr. McWilliams
informed Mr. Steadman of the January 10 meeting.

   On January 11, 2002, Chase received a verbal indication of interest from
another potential financial acquiror working in partnership with Mr. Alonzo
with respect to an acquisition of Chase for a price range of $11.00 to $11.50
per share in cash. At a meeting on January 17, 2002, the Chase Board, including
representatives of CVC, instructed management to request that this indication
of interest be made in written form. Also during that meeting, Mr. McWilliams
informed the other Chase Board members that CVC and its affiliates were no
longer interested in acquiring Chase. A written indication of interest was
received on January 22nd from the potential financial acquiror working with Mr.
Alonzo. The Chase Board met again on January 24th and instructed Messrs.
Steadman and McWilliams, together with Chase's financial and legal advisors, to
pursue this proposal. Further

discussions with this potential financial acquiror failed to result in a firm
proposal or an agreement on the terms of a potential acquisition of Chase. The
potential financial acquiror withdrew its indication of interest on March 12,
2002.

   On January 24 and January 31, 2002, the Olin board of directors met and
Messrs. Rupp and Ruggiero discussed with the Olin board of directors the
possibility of restarting negotiations for an acquisition of Chase. Messrs.
Rupp and Ruggiero indicated their belief based on their recent discussions with
Mr. McWilliams that CVC/Court Square Capital might be willing to sell its
interest in Chase. The Olin board of directors then authorized management to
proceed to negotiate the terms of an acquisition of Chase and to continue to
explore with CVC/Court Square Capital the terms on which CVC/Court Square
Capital would be willing to sell its interest in Chase.

   In early February 2002, Mr. Steadman contacted Mr. Rupp and informed him
that he would welcome a proposal regarding a business combination from Olin.
Mr. Rupp indicated that Olin was continuing to evaluate its intentions
regarding Chase, and through Lehman Brothers, had been continuing to have
conversations with CVC/Court Square Capital. These conversations did not result
in any agreement or understanding of terms that were acceptable to Olin or
CVC/Court Square Capital. On February 28, 2002, Olin management recommended to
the Olin board of directors that discussions with Chase be terminated. On
February 28, 2002, representatives of Olin advised both Mr. Steadman and Mr.
McWilliams that they were not interested in making a proposal and were
terminating discussions.

   During March and early April 2002, Mr. Alonzo initiated discussions with Mr.
McWilliams and other members of the Chase Board regarding a potential
repurchase of all or a substantial portion of the approximately 47.6% of the
outstanding Chase common stock owned by Court Square Capital. The independent
directors on the Chase Board determined not to pursue a stock repurchase
transaction unless a repurchase transaction included participation by the
non-CVC affiliated stockholders as well. No formal purchase price proposal was
made by either CVC/Court Square Capital or Chase. Mr. McWilliams and other
officers of CVC also had discussions with other members of the Chase Board
concerning a possible reconstitution of the members of the Chase Board. The
independent directors invited CVC to make a proposal regarding new Chase Board
members. On April 5, 2002, CVC submitted a proposal for a reconstituted Chase
Board to be submitted to stockholders of Chase at the next annual stockholders
meeting. A special board meeting was scheduled for April 12, 2002 to discuss
the CVC proposal.

   On or about April 8, 2002, in light of the improvement in Olin's financial
flexibility as a result of certain recently completed financing transactions,
Messrs. Rupp and Ruggiero discussed with the Olin directors the possibility of
approaching Chase with a firm indication of interest regarding the terms of a
proposed acquisition of Chase. The Olin board of directors then authorized
management to submit an indication of interest to acquire Chase and to commence
negotiations with representatives of Chase. On April 9, 2002, Olin submitted an
indication of interest to acquire Chase in a stock-for-stock transaction with
an exchange ratio of 0.613 shares of Olin common stock for each share of Chase
common stock. This proposal was also conditioned on CVC/Court Square Capital
committing their support to the transaction.

   At the April 12, 2002 Chase Board meeting, the Chase Board determined to
proceed with negotiations to pursue a business combination between Olin and
Chase. The Chase Board, with CVC concurring, determined to postpone scheduling
the 2002 Chase annual stockholders meeting and proposing a slate of directors
at such stockholders meeting pending the results of negotiations with Olin. The
independent directors also determined to postpone further discussions regarding
a share repurchase transaction pending such negotiations, but instructed its
financial and legal advisors to be prepared to evaluate the feasibility of
securing financing and the financial and legal implications of

implementing such a transaction. By letter dated April 30, 2002, Court Square
Capital informed Chase that, at the time, it was not interested in and would
not agree to any proposal to repurchase its shares of Chase.

   From April 12, 2002 through April 21, 2002, Credit Suisse First Boston held
discussions with Lehman Brothers regarding the terms of Olin's potential
acquisition of Chase. On April 21, 2002, Lehman Brothers indicated that Olin
would be prepared to offer an exchange ratio of 0.6400 shares of Olin common
stock per share of Chase common stock, subject to satisfactory confirmatory due
diligence and transaction documentation. On April 23, 2002, Chase and Olin
entered into a new confidentiality agreement, and from April 24 through May 6,
2002, Olin and its legal and financial advisors performed confirmatory due
diligence. In addition, from April 24, 2002 through May 6, 2002, Chase
performed a due diligence review of Olin.

   On April 25, 2002, at a meeting of the Olin board of directors, Olin
management updated the Olin directors on the status of their discussions with
the management of Chase and Lehman Brothers made a presentation to the Olin
board of directors regarding the financial terms of the proposed merger with
Chase. The Olin board of directors then directed Olin management to continue
negotiations with Chase regarding the merger.

   On April 26, 2002, Olin's legal advisors distributed a draft merger
agreement and voting agreement to Chase and CVC/Court Square Capital and their
respective legal and financial advisors. From April 27 through May 7, 2002,
representatives of Olin, Chase and CVC/Court Square Capital and their legal and
financial advisors negotiated the terms of the merger agreement and voting
agreement. On May 3, 2002, Chase's legal and financial advisors updated the
Chase Board as to the status of negotiation of these agreements.

   On May 7, 2002, the Olin board of directors met to consider the approval of
the acquisition of Chase. At this meeting, Mr. Rupp discussed the results of
Olin's due diligence review of Chase, and Cravath, Swaine & Moore, Olin's legal
advisors, discussed with the Olin board of directors the terms of the merger
agreement and voting agreement. Lehman Brothers delivered its oral opinion,
which was subsequently confirmed in writing, to the Olin board of directors
that, as of May 7, 2002, and based on and subject to the assumptions,
limitations and qualifications set forth in its written opinion, the exchange
ratio of 0.6400 was fair to Olin from a financial point of view. After
discussion, the Olin board of directors authorized Olin management to enter
into the merger agreement and the voting agreement, subject to the resolution
by management of certain outstanding issues.

   On May 7, 2002, a meeting of the Chase Board was held to consider approval
of the merger with Olin. At this meeting, Credit Suisse First Boston made a
presentation to the Chase Board regarding the financial terms of the merger and
delivered its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing, to the
Chase Board that, as of May 7, 2002, and based on and subject to the
assumptions, limitations and qualifications set forth in its written opinion,
the 0.6400 exchange ratio was fair to stockholders of Chase from a financial
point of view. In addition, at this meeting, Mr. Steadman and Credit Suisse
First Boston discussed with the Chase Board the results of Chase's due
diligence review of Olin, and Cahill Gordon & Reindel, legal advisors to Chase,
discussed the terms of the merger agreement and voting agreement with the Chase
Board. After extensive discussion, the Chase Board instructed Chase's legal and
financial advisors to continue to negotiate with Olin for the right to
terminate the merger agreement for a superior proposal and to receive a
termination fee if Olin shareholders do not approve the issuance of Olin common
stock in the merger. Such rights were granted by Olin on terms acceptable to
the Chase Board, and the Chase Board voted to approve the merger agreement and
the voting agreement by a vote of seven directors for such approval and one
director, Mr. Alonzo, against such approval.

   The merger agreement, the voting agreement and related documents were signed
by the parties on the night of May 7, 2002. On the morning of May 8, 2002,
prior to the commencement of trading, Olin and Chase issued a joint press
release announcing the execution of the merger agreement and the voting
agreement.

Olin Reasons for the Merger and the Olin Board of Directors Recommendation

   Reasons for the Merger.  At its meeting on May 7, 2002, the Olin board of
directors approved the merger agreement and determined that the merger and the
merger agreement are advisable. The Olin board of directors recommends that
Olin shareholders vote FOR the issuance of shares of Olin common stock in the
merger.

   In reaching its decision to approve the merger and the merger agreement and
to recommend that Olin shareholders vote to approve the issuance of shares of
Olin common stock in the merger, the Olin board of directors consulted with
senior management and its financial and legal advisors and considered a number
of factors, including the following potentially positive factors:

   . the Olin board's familiarity with and review of Chase's business,
     operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects

   . the opportunity to create a company with the scale, scope and critical
     mass to compete more effectively and be less cyclical

   . the opportunity to combine two complementary leaders in their respective
     fields to achieve a broader product line and geographic scope than either
     of them individually possess

   . the opportunity to leverage both Olin and Chase's strengths and to utilize
     the combined metallurgical and manufacturing capabilities, marketing and
     distribution know-how and economies of scale to further enhance capacity
     utilization, long-term profitability and return on investment

   . the opportunity to leverage Chase's position as a low cost producer with
     access to Olin's considerable technical, product development and marketing
     resources

   . the opportunity to strengthen Olin's financial position

   . the potential to generate new ideas and increase customer satisfaction by
     combining the marketing and sales expertise of both Olin and Chase

   . the written opinion of Lehman Brothers Inc., dated May 7, 2002, a copy of
     which is attached as Annex 3 to this proxy statement/prospectus, that,
     subject to the assumptions and limitations contained in that opinion, as
     of that date, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view,
     to Olin, and the financial presentation made by Lehman Brothers Inc. to
     the Olin board of directors in connection with delivering that opinion and

   . the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and closing conditions.

   The Olin board of directors also considered other factors relating to the
merger, and their impact on Olin shareholders, including:

   . the financial condition, cash flows and results of operations of Olin and
     Chase

   . the historical market prices and trading information with respect to Olin
     common stock and Chase common stock

   . the impact of the merger on Olin's and Chase's customers, suppliers and
     employees

   . the impact of the merger on Olin's existing shareholder base and

   . current industry, economic and market conditions.

   The Olin board of directors also identified and considered a number of
potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger,
including:

   . the risk that, despite the efforts of Olin and Chase, key personnel might
     leave Chase after the merger

   . the risk that management resources may be diverted from Olin's existing
     businesses due to the merger and the issues related to the transition

   . the risk of not capturing all the synergies between Olin and Chase in the
     manufacturing, procurement, product development and marketing areas and

   . the risk that potential benefits of the merger might not be fully realized.

   The Olin board of directors believed that certain of these risks were
unlikely to occur, while others could be avoided or mitigated by Olin, and
that, overall, these risks were outweighed by the potential benefits of the
merger.

   This discussion of the information and factors considered by the Olin board
of directors in making its decision is not intended to be exhaustive but is
believed to include all material factors considered by the Olin board of
directors. In view of the variety of material factors considered in connection
with its evaluation of the merger, the Olin board of directors did not find it
practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to,
the specific factors considered in reaching its determination. In addition,
individual members of the Olin board of directors may have given different
weight to different factors.

   Recommendation of the Olin Board of Directors.  After careful consideration,
the Olin board of directors has determined that the merger and the terms of the
merger agreement are advisable and recommends that Olin shareholders vote FOR
the issuance of shares of Olin common stock in the merger.

Opinion of Olin's Financial Advisor

   In December 2000, the Olin board of directors engaged Lehman Brothers to act
as its financial advisor with respect to pursuing an acquisition of Chase. On
May 7, 2002, Lehman Brothers rendered its opinion to the Olin board of
directors that as of such date and, based upon and subject to certain matters
stated therein, from a financial point of view, the exchange ratio to be paid
by Olin to the stockholders of Chase was fair to Olin.

   The full text of Lehman Brothers' written opinion, dated May 7, 2002, or the
Lehman Brothers Opinion, is attached as Annex 3 to this proxy
statement/prospectus. Shareholders may read such opinion for a discussion of
the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and limitations
upon the review undertaken by Lehman Brothers in rendering its opinion. The
following is a summary of the Lehman Brothers Opinion and the methodology that
Lehman Brothers used to render the Lehman Brothers Opinion.

   Lehman Brothers' advisory services and opinion were provided for the
information and assistance of the Olin board of directors in connection with
its consideration of the merger. The Lehman Brothers Opinion is not intended to
be and does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of Olin as to
how such shareholder should vote in connection with the merger. Lehman Brothers
was not requested to opine as to, and the Lehman Brothers Opinion does not
address, Olin's underlying business decision to proceed with or effect the
merger.

   In arriving at its opinion, Lehman Brothers reviewed and analyzed:

      (1) The merger agreement, the voting agreement and the specific terms of
   the merger

      (2) Publicly available information concerning Olin and Chase that Lehman
   Brothers believed to be relevant to its analysis, including, without
   limitation, each companies' annual reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
   ended December 31, 2001

      (3) Financial and operating information with respect to the business,
   operations and prospects of Chase furnished to us by Chase including
   financial projections of Chase prepared by management of Chase (the "Chase
   Projections")

      (4) Projections for future financial performance of Chase prepared by
   management of Olin (the "Adjusted Chase Projections")

      (5) Financial and operating information with respect to the business,
   operations and prospects of Olin furnished to us by Olin including estimates
   of future financial performance of Olin prepared by management of Olin (the
   "Olin Estimates")

      (6) The trading histories of Olin's common stock and Chase's common stock
   from May 1, 2001 to May 7, 2002 and a comparison of those trading histories
   with each other and with those of other companies that Lehman Brothers
   deemed relevant

      (7) A comparison of the historical financial results and present
   financial condition of Chase with those of other companies that Lehman
   Brothers deemed relevant

      (8) A comparison of the financial terms of the merger with the financial
   terms of certain other transactions that Lehman Brothers deemed relevant and

      (9) The potential pro forma impact on Olin of the merger.

   In addition, Lehman Brothers had discussions with the managements of Olin
and Chase concerning their respective businesses, operations, assets, financial
conditions and prospects and undertook such other studies, analyses and
investigations as Lehman Brothers deemed appropriate.

   In arriving at this opinion, Lehman Brothers assumed and relied upon the
accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information used by Lehman
Brothers without assuming any responsibility for independent verification of
such information. Lehman Brothers further relied upon the assurances of the
managements of Olin and Chase that they were not aware of any facts or
circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading. With
respect to the Chase Projections, upon advice of Chase, Lehman Brothers assumed
that such projections were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of Chase's management as to the
future performance of Chase. With respect to the Adjusted Chase Projections,
upon advice of Olin, Lehman Brothers assumed that such projections were
reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments of Olin's management as to the future performance of
Chase, and Lehman Brothers relied upon such projections in performing its
analysis. With respect to the Olin Estimates, upon advice of Olin, Lehman
Brothers assumed that such estimates were reasonably prepared on a basis
reflecting the best currently available judgments of Olin's management as to
the future performance of Olin, and relied upon such estimates in performing
its analysis. In arriving at its opinion, Lehman Brothers did not make or
obtain any evaluations or appraisals of the assets or liabilities of Olin or
Chase. The Lehman Brothers Opinion was necessarily based upon market, economic
and other conditions as they existed on, and could be evaluated as of, the date
of such opinion.

   In connection with rendering its opinion, Lehman Brothers performed certain
financial, comparative and other analyses as described below. In arriving at
its opinion, Lehman Brothers did not ascribe a specific range of value to Olin
or Chase, but rather made its determination as to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to Olin of the exchange ratio to be paid by Olin in
the merger on the basis of financial and comparative analyses. The preparation
of a fairness opinion involves various determinations as to the most
appropriate and relevant methods of financial and comparative analysis and the
application of those methods to the particular circumstances, and therefore,
such an opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description. Furthermore,
in arriving at its opinion, Lehman Brothers did not attribute any particular
weight to any analysis or factor considered by it, but rather made qualitative
judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor.
Accordingly, Lehman Brothers believes that its analyses must be considered as a
whole and that considering any portion of such analyses and factors, without
considering all analyses and factors as a whole, could

create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion.
In its analyses, Lehman Brothers made numerous assumptions with respect to
industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other
matters, many of which are beyond the control of Olin and Chase. None of Olin,
Chase, Lehman Brothers or any other person assumes responsibility if future
results are materially different from those discussed. Any estimates contained
in these analyses were not necessarily indicative of actual values or
predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than as set forth therein. In addition, analyses relating to the
value of businesses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at
which businesses actually may be sold.

   The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by Lehman
Brothers in connection with providing its opinion to the Olin board of
directors. Certain of the summaries of financial analyses include information
presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial
analyses used by Lehman Brothers, the tables must be read together with the
text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description
of the financial analyses. Accordingly, the analyses listed in the tables and
described below must be considered as a whole. Considering any portion of such
analyses and of the factors considered, without considering all analyses and
factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying
the Lehman Brothers Opinion.

Stock Trading History

   Lehman Brothers, considered historical data with regard to the trading
prices of Olin common stock and Chase common stock for the period from May 1,
2001 to May 7, 2002 and the relative stock price performances during this same
period for Olin, Chase, and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. During this period
the closing stock price of Olin ranged from $12.21 to $19.64 per share, and the
closing price of Chase ranged from $8.35 to $15.00 per share. Lehman Brothers
noted over this approximate one-year period, Olin stock returned -4.3% and
Chase stock returned 33.1%, while the S&P 500 Index returned -17.1%. As such,
Olin and Chase outperformed the S&P 500 Index over this period by 12.8% and
50.2%, respectively.

Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis

   Lehman Brothers also compared the historical share prices of Olin and Chase
during different periods during the 1 year period prior to May 8, 2002 in order
to determine the implied average exchange ratio that existed during those
periods. The following table indicates the average exchange ratio of Olin
common stock for Chase common stock for the periods indicated:

             Relevant Time Period           Average Exchange Ratio
             --------------------           ----------------------

             May 7, 2002...................         0.8055
             Trailing 10 day period........         0.7766
             Trailing 20 day period........         0.7381
             Trailing One month period.....         0.7266
             Trailing Three month period...         0.6634
             Trailing Six month period.....         0.6424
             Trailing One year period......         0.6038

Purchase Price Ratio Analysis

   The purchase price ratio analysis provides enterprise value multiples and
equity value multiples of key operating statistics for a range of transaction
values. Based upon the exchange ratio, the closing price of Olin common stock
on May 7, 2002 of $18.00 represented a value to be received by holders of

Chase shares of $11.52 per share. Based on this implied equity value per share,
Lehman Brothers calculated the ratio of enterprise value to revenue, earnings
before interest and taxes ("EBIT"), earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") and equity value per share to fully
diluted earnings per share. The enterprise value of Chase was obtained by
adding the implied equity value to short- and long-term debt, and then
subtracting Chase's cash and cash equivalents balance. Based upon the purchase
price ratio analysis, the implied equity value per share yielded a discount to
market price of 20.6% below the closing price of Chase shares of $14.50 on May
7, 2002. The ratio of the enterprise value to 2001 and latest twelve months
("LTM") ended March 31, 2002 Revenue, EBITDA, EBIT, and Earnings per Share
yielded multiples of 0.75x, 6.7x, 9.2x and 14.7x and 0.76x, 6.8x, 9.5x and
15.1x, respectively. The use of the purchase price ratio analysis enabled
Lehman Brothers to compare the implied multiple of the metrics detailed above
to be paid to Chase given the 0.6400 fixed exchange ratio, with (1) the current
trading level of Chase common stock, (2) the current trading levels of
companies that Lehman Brothers deemed comparable to Chase as detailed
in "--Comparable Company Analysis" below and; (3) the multiples of those
metrics paid in similar transactions as detailed in "--Comparable Transaction
Analysis" below.

Comparable Company Analysis

   In order to assess how the public market values shares of similar publicly
traded companies, Lehman Brothers reviewed and compared specific financial and
operating data relating to Chase with selected companies that Lehman Brothers
deemed comparable to Chase, including Special Metals Corp., Quanex Corp.,
Mueller Industries, General Cable Corp., Encore Wire Corp., Commonwealth
Industries, Century Aluminum Co. and Wolverine Tube Inc. Using publicly
available information, Lehman Brothers calculated and analyzed each company's
current stock price to its historical and projected earnings per share
(commonly referred to as a price earnings ratio, or P/E) and each company's
enterprise value to certain historical financial criteria (such as revenue,
EBITDA and EBIT). The enterprise value of each company was obtained by adding
its short and long-term debt to the sum of the market value of its common
equity, the value of any preferred stock (at liquidation value) and the book
value of any minority interest, and subtracting its cash and cash equivalents.
As of May 7, 2002, the last trading date prior to the delivery of the Lehman
Brothers Opinion, the comparable companies' median enterprise value multiple of
LTM Revenues, LTM EBITDA and LTM EBIT were 0.67x, 6.6x and 11.1x, respectively.
Additionally, the comparable companies' median multiple of the current stock
price to the projected 2002, and 2003 earnings per share based upon data from
First Call (a service which reports equity analysts' consensus earnings
estimates) were 14.0x and 11.0x, respectively.

   Lehman Brothers determined that, because multiples of EBITDA are the most
consistent of the metrics across the comparable set of companies, and because
EBITDA is easily calculated using the same methodology for each comparable
company, the use of an EBITDA multiple range was the most appropriate multiple
in analyzing how the public market values shares of similar publicly traded
companies. Using these multiples, Lehman Brothers calculated the implied equity
values per share of Chase common stock for a range of LTM EBITDA multiples from
6.5x to 7.5x, which Lehman Brothers deemed appropriate for Chase's business.
That range of LTM EBITDA multiples yielded a range of per share values from
$11.03 to $12.65. Lehman Brothers noted that the $11.52 per share offered in
the merger was within the range implied by the comparable company analysis.
Additionally, Lehman Brothers considered the values implied by incorporating an
illustrative 30% premium to the trading values of the comparable companies, as
derived from the "--Transaction Premia Analysis" detailed below. Lehman
Brothers calculated the implied equity values per share of Chase common stock
for the median LTM EBITDA which yielded per share values ranging from $14.34 to
$16.45.

   However, because of the inherent differences between the business,
operations and prospects of Chase and the business, operations and prospects of
the companies included in the comparable companies, Lehman Brothers believed
that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on

the quantitative results of the comparable company analysis and accordingly
also made qualitative judgments concerning differences between the financial
and operating characteristics and prospects of Chase and the companies included
in the comparable company analysis that would affect the public trading values
of each.

Comparable Transaction Analysis

   Lehman Brothers reviewed nine acquisitions of companies that Lehman Brothers
deemed comparable to Chase. Lehman Brothers considered the transaction values
as multiples of LTM (prior to the acquisition) Sales, EBITDA and EBIT. The
comparable acquisitions median multiple of transaction values to LTM Sales, LTM
EBITDA and LTM EBIT were 0.83x, 8.1x, and 12.4x, respectively. Lehman Brothers
deemed the multiple of EBITDA to be a more appropriate benchmark than the other
metrics, because multiples of EBITDA are the most consistent of the metrics
across the comparable set of transactions, and because EBITDA is easily
calculated using the same methodology for each comparable transaction. Using
this multiple of EBITDA, Lehman Brothers calculated an implied per Chase share
equity value of approximately $16.33. Lehman Brothers noted that the exchange
ratio (which as of May 7, 2002 represented a value of $11.52 per share) to be
paid in the merger was below the value implied by the comparable transaction
analysis.

Transaction Premia Analysis

   Lehman Brothers reviewed the premia paid in all publicly reported
transactions (excluding financial and technology transactions) between $100
million and $500 million from February 1, 2000 to February 28, 2002. Lehman
Brothers calculated the premium per share paid by the acquirer compared to the
share price of the target company prevailing (1) one day, (2) one week and (3)
one month prior to the announcement of the transaction. This analysis produced
the following median premiums and implied equity values for Chase:

                                                   Period Prior to Announcement
                                                   -------------------------
                                                   One Day   One Week One Month
                                                   -------   -------- ---------

Chase share price................................. $14.50     $14.00   $11.04
Median premiums...................................  28.59%     33.15%   37.89%
Implied equity value per share.................... $18.65     $18.64   $15.22

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

   As part of its analysis, Lehman Brothers prepared a discounted free cash
flow model that was based upon financial projections prepared by management of
Chase as adjusted by the management of Olin. Lehman Brothers used discount
rates of 10.0% to 12.0% and a terminal value based on a range of multiples of
estimated EBITDA in 2006 of 5.0 to 7.0x. Based on these discount rates and the
midpoint of the terminal values, Lehman Brothers calculated the implied equity
value per share of Chase common stock at approximately $13.00 to $14.00.

Pro Forma Analysis

   Lehman Brothers analyzed the pro forma effect of the transaction on the
earnings per share of Olin. For the purposes of this analysis, Lehman Brothers
assumed (1) an $11.52 share price for Chase common stock acquired pursuant to
the merger, (2) an $18.00 share price for Olin common stock (closing market
price per share on May 7, 2002), (3) a transaction structure with 100% stock
consideration, (4) financial projections for Chase as adjusted by the
management of Olin, and estimates of future financial performance for Olin
supplied by management of Olin, and (5) cost savings and synergies from the
transaction expected by the management of Olin. Lehman Brothers

estimated that, based on the assumptions described above, that the transaction
would be accretive to Olin's earnings per share in both 2002 and 2003. The
projections and estimates that underlie this analysis are subject to
substantial uncertainty and, therefore, actual results may be substantially
different.

   Lehman Brothers is an internationally recognized investment banking firm
and, as part of its investment banking activities, is regularly engaged in the
valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and
valuations for corporate and other purposes. The Olin board of directors
selected Lehman Brothers because of its expertise, reputation and familiarity
with Olin and the metals and chemicals industries generally, and because its
investment banking professionals have substantial experience in transactions
comparable to the merger.

   As compensation for its services in connection with the merger, Olin has
agreed to pay Lehman Brothers customary fees. A portion of Lehman Brothers'
fees have been paid to Lehman Brothers by Olin and the remainder will be
payable upon the closing of the merger. In addition, Olin has agreed to
reimburse Lehman Brothers for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with its engagement and to indemnify Lehman Brothers and related
person(s) for certain liabilities that may arise out of its engagement by Olin
and the rendering of the Lehman Brothers Opinion. Lehman Brothers has
previously rendered investment banking services to Olin and received customary
fees for such services.

   In the ordinary course of its business, Lehman Brothers may actively trade
in the debt or equity securities of Olin and Chase for its own account and for
the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or
short position in such securities.

Chase Reasons for the Merger and the Chase Board of Directors Recommendation

   At its meeting on May 7, 2002, the Chase Board, with the assistance of
outside financial and legal advisors, considered the financial, legal and other
terms of the merger. The Chase Board voted to adopt the merger agreement and to
approve the voting agreement by a vote of seven directors for such approval and
one director, Mr. Alonzo, against such approval. Mr. Alonzo's reasons for
voting against such approval are discussed below. The decision of the Chase
Board to adopt the merger agreement and to approve the merger, the voting
agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, along with its conclusion
that the merger, the merger agreement and the other transactions contemplated
thereby are advisable, was based on several potential benefits of the merger
and involved the consideration of a number of factors, including:

   . The opportunity for Chase stockholders to an own equity interest in a
     larger organization operating with strong market positions in the metals
     and chlor alkali businesses in addition to the brass rod business and to
     participate in any growth or appreciation of value of such equity
     interest, particularly from an anticipated turn-around in chlor alkali
     pricing and demand

   . That Credit Suisse First Boston delivered an oral opinion, subsequently
     confirmed in writing, as to the fairness to Chase stockholders from a
     financial point of view, of the 0.6400 exchange ratio pursuant to the
     merger agreement

   . The opportunity for Chase stockholders to own a more liquid stock which
     has Wall Street equity research analyst coverage (as opposed to Chase
     stock, which has minimal liquidity and trading volume and no equity
     research analyst coverage)

   . That CVC/Court Square Capital was supportive of the merger and willing to
     enter into the voting agreement with respect to the merger

   . The fact that over a period of approximately seventeen months,
     representatives of Chase contacted numerous third parties regarding a
     potential business combination transaction with

     Chase, which resulted in written non-binding indications of interest from
     CVC/Chase Acquisition, Olin, and seven other potential financial and
     strategic acquirors, the results of which are discussed above under
     "--Background to the Merger"

   . That Olin has historically paid dividends on its common stock, and that
     Chase has not paid dividends on its common stock

   . The ability for the Chase brass rod business to benefit from Olin's
     significant research and development resources to enhance its current
     product offering, benefitting the business and its customers

   . A merger with Olin would offer Chase employees stability of ownership and
     career development opportunities, as Olin is a leader in a complementary
     market segment, with 85 years of experience in the brass industry, and
     understands Chase's business

   . The ability to realize cost savings through increased purchasing power as
     a result of a merger with Olin

   . The opportunity for Chase stockholders to own an equity interest in a
     company with no controlling shareholder

   . The dilution of CVC/Court Square Capital's ownership interest in Olin
     after the merger from its existing equity interest of approximately 47.6%
     ownership of Chase to an equity interest of approximately 8% in Olin,
     particularly in light of the fact that for a number of years CVC/Court
     Square Capital has expressed its desire for greater liquidity with respect
     to its investment in Chase and would be able to sell its shares of Olin in
     a registered secondary offering, thereby gaining greater liquidity with
     respect to its equity interest

   . That Chase can terminate the merger agreement under certain circumstances
     to accept an unsolicited superior proposal by paying a $7.5 million
     termination fee to Olin

   . That Olin must pay to Chase a termination fee of $7.5 million (and under
     certain circumstances $15.0 million) if Olin shareholders do not approve
     the issuance of Olin common stock in the merger and the merger agreement
     is terminated and

   . That Chase does not have to complete the merger unless the average of the
     volume weighted averages of the trading prices of Olin common stock, as
     reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets (or such other source as Olin and
     Chase shall agree in writing), for the five trading days ending on the
     second trading day immediately preceding the closing date is equal to or
     greater than $14.50, and can terminate the merger agreement if Olin's
     share price remains significantly depressed for an extended period of time
     after the mailing of this proxy statement/prospectus.

   The Chase Board also reviewed with its financial and legal advisors other
matters relating to the merger and their impact on Chase shareholders including:

   . Evaluated in light of the implied value of Olin common stock representing
     a discount to the market price of Chase common stock on May 7, 2002, the
     36% increase in the trading price of Chase common stock from the date
     Olin's proposal was received on April 9, 2002 through May 3, 2002 on
     limited volume (approximately 200,000 shares, or approximately $2.2
     million of aggregate dollar trading volume) and the lack of fundamental
     valuation changes or market changes explaining such increase

   . That while Chase is a market leader in the brass rod industry and has
     recently added significant new capital investments which should benefit
     Chase if industry demand increases, the brass rod industry is highly
     competitive

   . The fact that the voting agreement with CVC/Court Square Capital will make
     it very likely for Chase to obtain the approval of its stockholders

   . Historical information concerning Olin's and Chase's respective
     businesses, financial performance and condition, operations and management
     and

   . The terms and conditions of the merger agreement and the voting agreement.

   The Chase Board also considered a number of potentially negative factors in
its deliberations concerning the merger, including:

   . The risk that, because the share exchange ratio would not be adjusted for
     changes in the market price of either Olin or Chase, the per share value
     of consideration to be received by Chase stockholders might be up to 20%
     less than the per share price implied by the exchange ratio immediately
     prior to the announcement of the merger

   . A merger with Olin would expose Chase to the volatility of chlor alkali
     pricing and demand and could negatively impact the earnings per share of
     the combined entity

   . That Chase is nearly debt-free while Olin has significant financial
     leverage and

   . The risk that the benefits sought to be achieved by the merger may not be
     realized.

   At the Chase Board meeting on May 7, 2002, Mr. Alonzo, who attended the Olin
due diligence meeting, presented his reasons for voting against the merger. His
reasons for so voting are discussed below:

   . The implied value of Olin's offer represents a discount to the current
     market price of Chase common stock on May 7, 2002 and is lower than the
     all cash non-binding proposal previously made to Chase by Olin in January

   . That Olin failed to meet the earnings estimates of Wall Street equity
     research analysts for the second and third quarters of 2001 and expects to
     have a loss in the second quarter of 2002

   . That Olin has a substantial amount of debt, while Chase has almost no debt

   . That Olin lacks financial flexibility as a result of its significant
     financial leverage, and is consequently limited in its ability to make
     acquisitions, as well as its ability to make certain capital expenditures

   . A merger with Olin could expose Chase to an expected low point in the
     chlor alkali pricing and demand cycle throughout 2002 and could negatively
     impact the earnings per share and the financial position of the combined
     entity and

   . Olin is a party to various governmental and private environmental actions
     associated with its waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities.
     Olin's environmental related costs could materially increase in view of
     the uncertainties associated with environmental exposures.

   Recommendation of the Chase Board of Directors.  At its meeting on May 7,
2002, a majority of the Chase Board approved the merger agreement and
determined that the merger and the terms of the merger agreement are advisable.
A majority of the Chase Board recommends that Chase stockholders vote FOR the
adoption of the merger agreement.

Opinion of Chase's Financial Advisor

   Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, or CSFB, has acted as Chase's
exclusive financial advisor in connection with the merger. Chase selected CSFB
based on CSFB's experience, reputation and familiarity with Chase's business.
CSFB is an internationally recognized investment banking firm and is regularly
engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, negotiated underwritings,
competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted
securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes.

   CSFB, in its role as financial advisor to Chase, was asked to render an
opinion to the Chase Board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view,
to the holders of Chase common stock of the exchange ratio set forth in the
merger agreement. On May 7, 2002, CSFB delivered to the Chase Board its oral
opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of that
date, based on and subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications
set forth in its written opinion, the exchange ratio was fair to the holders of
Chase common stock from a financial point of view.

   The full text of the CSFB written opinion, which sets forth, among other
things, assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by CSFB in rendering its
opinion is attached as Annex 4 to this proxy statement/prospectus and is
incorporated by reference in its entirety. Chase stockholders are urged to, and
should, read the CSFB opinion carefully and in its entirety. The CSFB opinion
addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date
of the opinion, of the exchange ratio to the holders of Chase common stock and
does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such
stockholder should vote or act on any matter relating to the proposed merger.
The summary of the CSFB opinion in this document is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the full text of the CSFB opinion.

   In arriving at its opinion, CSFB:

   . reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information
     relating to Chase and Olin, as well as the merger agreement and certain
     related documents

   . reviewed certain other information, including financial forecasts,
     provided to or discussed with CSFB by Chase and Olin, and met with Chase's
     and Olin's management to discuss the business and prospects of Chase and
     Olin, respectively

   . considered certain financial and stock market data of Chase and Olin, and
     compared those data with similar data for other publicly held companies in
     businesses similar to Chase and Olin

   . considered the financial terms of certain other business combinations and
     other transactions which have recently been effected

   . considered such other information, financial studies, analyses and
     investigations and financial, economic and market criteria which CSFB
     deemed relevant and

   . relied upon the views of Chase's and Olin's management concerning the
     business, operational and strategic benefits and implications of the
     merger.

   In connection with its review, CSFB did not assume any responsibility for
independent verification of any of the foregoing information and relied on its
being complete and accurate in all material respects. CSFB has been advised and
has assumed that (1) the financial forecasts with respect to Chase prepared and
provided to CSFB by Chase have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the
best currently available estimates and judgments of Chase's management as to
the future financial performance of Chase and (2) the publicly available
financial forecasts with respect to Olin, including adjustments thereto,
reviewed by CSFB and discussed with management of Olin, represented reasonable
estimates with respect to the future financial performance of Olin.

   With Chase's consent, CSFB assumed the merger would be consummated in
accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, without waiver, amendment or
modification of any material term, condition or agreement therein and that in
the course of obtaining any necessary regulatory and third party approvals and
consents for the merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition will be
imposed that will have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits
of the merger. Chase informed CSFB and CSFB assumed that the merger would be
treated as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes. CSFB was
not requested to make, and has not made, an independent

evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise)
of Chase or Olin, nor has CSFB been furnished with any such evaluations or
appraisals.

   CSFB's opinion was necessarily based upon information available to CSFB and
financial, economic, market and other conditions as they existed and could be
evaluated on May 7, 2002. CSFB's opinion did not address the merits of the
merger as compared to other transactions or business strategies that may have
been available to Chase or Chase's underlying decision to engage in the merger.
CSFB did not express any opinion as to the actual value of Olin common stock
when issued pursuant to the merger or the prices at which Olin common stock
will trade at any time. In connection with its engagement, CSFB approached
third parties to solicit indications of interest in a possible acquisition of
Chase and held preliminary discussions with certain of these parties prior to
May 7, 2002. Although CSFB evaluated the exchange ratio from a financial point
of view, CSFB was not requested to, and did not, recommend the specific
consideration payable in the merger, which was determined in arms length
negotiations between Chase and Olin.

   In preparing its opinion to the Chase Board, CSFB performed a variety of
financial and comparative analyses, including those described below. The
preparation of a fairness opinion is complex and is not readily susceptible to
partial analysis or summary description. Accordingly, CSFB believes that its
analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its
analyses and factors, or the narrative description of the analyses, could
create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying its analyses
and opinion.

   No company, transaction or business used in CSFB's analyses as a comparison
is directly comparable to Chase, Olin or the proposed merger, and an evaluation
of the results of those analyses is not entirely mathematical. Rather, the
analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and
operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the merger or the
other values of the companies, business segments or transactions being
analyzed. The estimates contained in CSFB's analyses and the ranges of
valuations resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily
indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which
may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by the
analyses. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices
at which businesses actually may be sold.

   CSFB's opinion and financial analyses were among many factors considered by
the Chase Board in its evaluation of the proposed merger and should not be
viewed as determinative of the views of the Chase Board or the managements of
Chase or Olin with respect to the merger or the exchange ratio.

  Summary of Financial Analyses Performed by CSFB

   The following is a summary of the financial analyses CSFB presented to the
Chase Board on May 7, 2002 in connection with the preparation of CSFB's
opinion. The financial analyses summarized below include information presented
in tabular format. In order to fully understand CSFB's financial analyses, the
tables must be read together with the text of each summary. Considering the
data set forth in the tables below without considering the full narrative
description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and
assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete
view of CSFB's financial analyses.

  Chase Historical Stock Price Analysis

   CSFB analyzed the historical evolution of Chase's stock price for the three
years ended May 3, 2002 (1) on a stand-alone basis, (2) relative to an index of
five companies comparable to Chase (Amcast Industrial Corp., Brush Engineered
Materials Inc., Mueller Industries Inc., Wolverine Tube Inc., and Olin
Corporation), and (3) relative to Mueller Industries Inc., its closest peer
company. During the

time period from May 3, 1999 to May 3, 2002, Chase's stock price reached a high
of $15.00 per share (on May 3, 2002) and a low of $6.38 per share (on November
2, 2000). CSFB noted that, for the period from May 3, 1999 to April 9, 2002,
Chase performed in line with its peer group, including Mueller Industries Inc.
During that period, Chase's stock price reached a high of $11.77 per share (on
January 31, 2002) and a low of $6.38 per share (on November 2, 2000). However,
from April 9, 2002 to May 3, 2002, Chase outperformed its peer group and
Mueller Industries Inc. During that period, Chase's stock price increased 36.4%
from $11.00 to $15.00, while the index decreased by 0.7% and the stock price of
Mueller Industries Inc. decreased by 4.6%.

   CSFB calculated and compared Chase and Mueller's historical multiples of
enterprise value to LTM EBITDA, for the periods from June 1998 to March 2002.
LTM means the last twelve-month period for which financial data for the company
at issue has been reported. EBITDA means earnings before interest expense,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, and excluding earnings in equity
affiliates as well as non-recurring charges or income. CSFB noted that,
although Chase was trading at a premium multiple to Mueller as of May 6, 2002,
Chase had historically traded at a discount multiple to Mueller for the periods
from June 1998 to December 2001.

  Valuation Analysis

   Based on CSFB's estimated reference ranges for the common stock values of
Chase and Olin, described in further detail hereafter, CSFB derived an exchange
ratio reference range as follows:

  Exchange Ratio--Summary Analysis

                                                       Low    High
                                                      ------ ------

             Chase Reference Range................... $10.00 $13.00
             Olin Reference Range.................... $14.50 $20.50
             Exchange Ratio Reference Range..........  0.488  0.897

  Analysis of Chase

   Comparable Publicly Traded Company Analysis.  CSFB analyzed the market
values and trading multiples of selected publicly traded U.S. metals and
manufacturing companies that CSFB believed were reasonably comparable to Chase
on the basis of their business activity and geographic presence. These
comparable companies consisted of:

   . Amcast Industrial Corporation
   . Brush Engineered Materials Inc.
   . Mueller Industries Inc.
   . Olin Corporation
   . Wolverine Tube Inc.

   In examining these companies, CSFB calculated the enterprise value of each
company as a multiple of certain relevant figures including LTM EBITDA, as well
as projected 2002 and 2003 EBITDA. The enterprise value of a company is equal
to the value of its fully-diluted common equity plus debt, minority interests,
and the liquidation value of outstanding preferred stock, if any, minus cash,
marketable securities, and minority investments in other entities. CSFB also
calculated the price per share of each company as a multiple of its respective
projected calendar year 2002 and 2003 earnings per share. Chase management
provided all historical and projected data for Chase. All historical data was
derived from publicly available sources and all projected data was obtained
from First Call where available, or from equity research reports. Projected
figures for Olin were based on

publicly available data subject to certain adjustments, which were discussed
with Olin management. CSFB's analysis of the comparable companies yielded the
following multiple ranges, among others:

                                Enterprise Value /              Stock Price
                       -----------------------------------  ------------------
                       LTM EBITDA 2002E EBITDA 2003E EBITDA EPS 2002E EPS 2003E
                       ---------- ------------ ------------ --------- ---------

Average...............    8.8x         8.8x        5.0x       12.3x     14.2x
Median................    8.9          8.8         5.0        12.3      11.4
High..................    9.8         11.2         5.7        14.5      22.0
Low...................    7.7          6.5         4.3        10.1       9.2

   Based on an analysis of this data and Chase's actual and projected results
for comparable periods, CSFB estimated a value per share of Chase common stock
ranging from $9.50 to $11.50.

   Precedent Merger and Acquisition Transaction Analysis.  CSFB reviewed
selected acquisitions involving companies in the metals and manufacturing
industries that CSFB believed are reasonably comparable to the merger. These
transactions involved: (target/acquiror) (date of close)

   . Precision Tube Holding Corporation/Maverick Tube Corporation (February
     2002)
   . Monarch Brass & Copper Corp./Olin Corporation (June 2001)
   . Leavitt Tube Company, Inc./Pinkert Industrial Group, LLC (March 2001)
   . Engelhard Corporation--Joining Products business/Wolverine Tube, Inc.
     (September 2000)
   . Milcor/Gibraltar Steel (August 2000)
   . Commercial Intertech/Parker Hannifin (April 2000)
   . Citation Corporation/Kelso & Co. (December 1999)
   . Copperweld Corporation/LTV Corporation (November 1999)
   . Welded Tube Co./LTV Corporation (October 1999)
   . Warner Electric/Colfax Corporation (October 1999)

   . J.L. French Automotive Castings/Hidden Creek Industries (April 1999)
   . Honsel AG/The Carlyle Group (March 1999)

   In examining these acquisitions, CSFB calculated the enterprise value of the
acquired company implied by each of these transactions as a multiple of (1) LTM
sales, (2) LTM EBITDA and (3) LTM EBIT. EBIT means earnings before interest
expense and taxes, and excluding earnings in equity affiliates as well as
non-recurring charges or income. CSFB's analysis of these relevant acquisitions
yielded the following multiple ranges:

                                                        Enterprise Value /
                                                   ----------------------------
                                                   LTM Sales LTM EBITDA LTM EBIT
                                                   --------- ---------- --------

Average...........................................    0.9x      6.7x      11.2x
Median............................................    0.9       6.9       11.6
High..............................................    2.0       8.4       13.1
Low...............................................    0.3       3.6        8.7

   Based on an analysis of this data and Chase's historical operating results,
CSFB estimated a value per share of Chase common stock ranging from $9.00 to
$11.50.

   Discounted Cash Flow Analysis--Exit Value Based on EBITDA in Exit
Year.  CSFB performed a discounted cash flow, or DCF, analysis of the projected
cash flows of Chase for the nine months ending December 31, 2002 and each
subsequent annual period through December 31, 2006, using projections and
assumptions provided by the management of Chase. The DCF value for Chase was
estimated using discount rates ranging from 10.75% to 13.75%, based on
estimates related to the weighted average cost of capital of Chase, and
terminal multiples of estimated EBITDA for Chase's fiscal year ending December
31, 2006 ranging from 4.0x to 6.0x. Based on this analysis, CSFB estimated a
value per share of Chase common stock ranging from $13.00 to $18.50.

   Discounted Cash Flow Analysis--Exit Value Based on Average EBITDA Over Prior
5 Years.  CSFB performed a discounted cash flow, or DCF, analysis of the
projected cash flows of Chase for the nine months ending December 31, 2002 and
each subsequent annual period through December 31, 2006, using projections and
assumptions provided by the management of Chase. The DCF value for Chase was
estimated using discount rates ranging from 10.75% to 13.75%, based on
estimates related to the weighted average cost of capital of Chase, and
terminal multiples of estimated average EBITDA for Chase's fiscal years ending
December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2006, ranging from 3.5x to 5.5x. Based on
this analysis, CSFB estimated a value per share of Chase common stock ranging
from $10.50 to $14.50.

  Analysis of Olin

   CSFB performed a sum-of-the-parts analysis for the three segments of Olin:
Chlor Alkali, Metals, and Winchester. Based on this analysis, CSFB estimated a
value per share of Olin common stock ranging from $14.50 to $20.50.

  Chlor Alkali segment

   To determine the value of the Chlor Alkali segment of Olin, CSFB performed a
comparable publicly traded company analysis and a precedent merger and
acquisition transaction analysis.

   Comparable Publicly Traded Company Analysis.  CSFB analyzed the market
values and trading multiples of selected publicly traded commodity chemicals
companies in the United States that CSFB believed were reasonably comparable to
the Chlor Alkali segment. These comparable companies consisted of:

          Low...........................    0.3        3.1       5.0

   Based on these analyses, CSFB estimated the value of the Chlor Alkali
segment to range between $325 and $425 million.

  Metals segment

   To determine the value of the Metals segment of Olin, CSFB performed a
comparable publicly traded company analysis and a precedent merger and
acquisition transaction analysis.

  Winchester segment

   To determine the value of the Winchester segment of Olin, CSFB performed a
precedent merger and acquisition transaction analysis.

   Precedent Merger and Acquisition Transaction Analysis.  CSFB reviewed
selected acquisitions involving companies in the ammunitions sector that CSFB
believed are reasonably relevant to valuing Olin's Winchester segment. These
transactions consisted of: (target/acquiror)(date of close)

   . Blount International Inc.--Ammunition Business/Alliant Techsystems Inc.
     (December 2001)

   . Federal Cartridge Corp./Blount International Inc. (November 1997)
   . Remington Arms Co./Clayton Dubilier & Rice (December 1993)

   In examining these acquisitions, CSFB calculated the enterprise value of the
acquired company implied by each of these transactions as a multiple of (1) LTM
sales, (2) LTM EBITDA and (3) average EBITDA over 1997-2001.

   Based on an analysis of this data and Olin's Winchester segment's historical
and projected operating results, CSFB estimated a value for Olin's Winchester
segment ranging from $100 to $150 million.

  Engagement Letter

   Pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement dated October 27, 1999, as
amended by the letter agreements dated December 18, 2000, September 10, 2001,
and April 11, 2002, or the Agreement, Chase agreed to pay CSFB a fee that is
customary in transactions of this nature, a portion of which is contingent upon
the consummation of the merger. A portion of CSFB's fees under the Agreement
were paid during the period from December 2000 to July 2001, during which time
CSFB advised Chase on courses of action in response to an unsolicited offer by
CVC announced on December 18, 2000. With respect to the offer by CVC, CSFB
rendered an inadequacy opinion to the Chase Board on January 24, 2001.

   In addition, Chase agreed to reimburse CSFB, upon CSFB's request from time
to time, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel) CSFB incurred in connection with its engagement thereunder
and to indemnify CSFB and certain related persons against certain liabilities
in connection with its engagement, including liabilities under U.S. federal
securities laws. CSFB and Chase negotiated the terms of the fee arrangement.

  Other Relationships

   In the ordinary course of business, CSFB and its affiliates may own or
actively trade the securities of Chase and Olin for their own accounts and for
the accounts of their customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long
or short position in Chase or Olin securities.

   CSFB has performed investment banking services for Chase in the past,
including acting as Chase's co-manager in Chase's initial public offering in
1994.

Interests of Chase's Directors and Management in the Merger

   In considering the recommendation of the Chase Board in favor of the merger,
Chase stockholders should be aware that certain directors and executive
officers of Chase have interests in the merger that are different from, or in
addition to, the interests of Chase stockholders, as described below. The Chase
Board was aware of, and considered the interests of, its directors and
executive officers when it considered and approved the merger agreement and the
merger.

  Employment and Change of Control Arrangements for Messrs. Steadman and Slater

   Steadman Employment Agreement.  Chase Brass, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Chase, and Mr. Steadman are parties to an employment agreement, dated as of
September 1, 2001, and amended as of February 14, 2002, which is effective
through December 31, 2002, and automatically will be extended on a year-to-year
basis unless terminated by Chase Brass or Mr. Steadman on 60 days' notice
before the start of the following year. The employment agreement provides for
an annual salary

of $280,000, and is subject to future annual increases at the discretion of
Chase's Compensation Committee. Mr. Steadman is also entitled to cash bonuses
at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.

   The employment agreement provides that if Mr. Steadman's employment is
terminated in certain circumstances, including a termination by Chase Brass in
violation of the employment agreement or a termination by Mr. Steadman for
"good reason" (as defined in the employment agreement), Chase Brass will be
required to pay Mr. Steadman a severance payment in an amount equal to Mr.
Steadman's then current base salary and continue to provide medical and dental
insurance coverage for one year. If Mr. Steadman's employment is terminated by
Chase Brass in violation of the agreement or by Mr. Steadman for good reason
within one year after a "change of control" of Chase, Mr. Steadman will be
entitled to receive continued medical and dental insurance coverage for two
years and a severance payment equal to two times the sum of (1) Mr. Steadman's
base salary immediately prior to the change of control (or, if greater, Mr.
Steadman's base salary at the time of his termination or, if applicable, at the
time of the event giving rise to his resignation for good reason), plus (2) the
bonus awarded to Mr. Steadman for the calendar year prior to the change of
control or, if such bonus has not yet been determined, the prior calendar year
(or, if greater, the average of the bonuses awarded to Mr. Steadman for the two
calendar years ended prior to the change of control or, if bonuses for the most
recent calendar year have not been determined as of the date of the change of
control, the average of the bonuses awarded to Mr. Steadman for the two
calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which the change of
control occurs); provided that such amount plus the value of any other
compensation subject to Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code shall not
exceed $100 less than 3.00 times Mr. Steadman's annualized includable
compensation (determined within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal
Revenue Code).

   For purposes of Mr. Steadman's employment agreement, a "change of control"
is defined generally to include the occurrence of any of the following:

   . any unrelated party (other than Chase and certain affiliates) acquires 50%
     or more of the combined voting power of Chase's outstanding voting
     securities

   . the stockholders of Chase or Chase Brass approve a merger or consolidation
     of Chase or Chase Brass with any other corporation or partnership, other
     than a transaction in which the voting securities of Chase or Chase Brass,
     as applicable, outstanding immediately prior to the transaction continue
     to represent a majority of the combined voting power of the voting
     securities of the surviving entity (or its parent) outstanding immediately
     after such transaction

   . Chase or Chase Brass liquidates or sells all or substantially all its
     assets or the Chase or Chase Brass stockholders approve such a liquidation
     or sale

   . public announcement is made of a tender offer by an unrelated party for
     50% or more of Chase's outstanding voting securities and the Chase Board
     approves or does not oppose the tender or exchange offer, provided an
     event described in one of the preceding bullets occurs within one year of
     such tender offer

   . Chase ceases to be the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of
     securities of Chase Brass representing at least a majority of the Chase
     Brass outstanding voting securities or

   . incumbent members of the Chase Board cease to constitute a majority of the
     Chase Board.

   If Mr. Steadman's employment is terminated by Mr. Steadman other than for
good reason within one year after a "change of control" of Chase, Mr. Steadman
will be entitled to receive continued medical and dental insurance coverage for
one year and a severance payment equal to the sum of the amounts determined
under clauses (1) and (2) in the preceding sentence.

   Mr. Steadman's employment agreement also provides that during the term of
the agreement, subject to certain exceptions:

  .  Mr. Steadman will not employ any person who was an employee of Chase Brass
     during the six-month period preceding his employment or induce, request,
     advise, attempt to influence, or solicit, directly or indirectly, any
     person who is an employee to terminate his or her employment with Chase
     Brass

  .  Mr. Steadman will not be employed by, associated with or have any interest
     in, directly or indirectly, any person that engages in the business or
     manufacture of copper alloy rod or any other products manufactured by
     Chase Brass (excluding products manufactured after the change of control
     that were not manufactured prior to the change of control), or any person
     which otherwise is directly competitive with Chase Brass or any of its
     subsidiaries, in any geographical area in which Chase Brass or such
     subsidiary engages in business or has evidenced in writing its intention
     to engage in such business

  .  Mr. Steadman will not induce, request, advise, attempt to influence, or
     solicit, directly or indirectly, any person to purchase such products from
     any person other than Chase Brass if Chase Brass provides, or negotiated
     to provide, such products to that person during the term of his employment
     agreement and

  .  Mr. Steadman will not induce, request, advise, attempt to influence, or
     solicit, directly or indirectly, any customer with whom he had personal
     contact in connection with performing his duties as an employee of Chase
     Brass to purchase products from any person other than Chase Brass.

   Chase Brass also has agreed to reimburse Mr. Steadman for reasonable legal
fees and costs that Mr. Steadman incurs in connection with the resolution in
Mr. Steadman's favor of any dispute or controversy under his employment
agreement.

   In connection with the signing of the merger agreement, Mr. Steadman has
agreed to certain modifications in his employment agreement. See "-- New
Employment Arrangements with Messrs. Steadman and Slater".

   Slater Change of Control Agreement.  Todd A. Slater, Vice President, Chief
Financial Officer, Treasurer and Corporate Secretary of Chase, has entered into
a change of control agreement with Chase which is effective through September
25, 2002 or, if a "change of control" of Chase occurs, the first anniversary of
the change of control. Under the agreement, if Mr. Slater's employment is
terminated by Chase Brass without cause (as defined in the change of control
agreement) or by Mr. Slater for good reason (as defined in the change of
control agreement) within one year following a "change of control" of Chase,
Chase will be required to pay to Mr. Slater a lump sum severance payment in an
amount equal to two times the sum of (1) Mr. Slater's then current base salary
(or, if greater, the base salary at the time of the change of control or, if
applicable, the occurrence of the event giving rise to Mr. Slater's right to
terminate his employment for good reason) and (2) Mr. Slater's bonus for the
calendar year prior to the change of control, or, if bonuses for such year have
not been determined, for the prior calendar year (or, if greater, the average
of the bonus for the two calendar years prior to the change of control, or, if
bonuses for the most recent calendar year have not been determined, the average
of the bonus for the two calendar years prior to the calendar year prior to the
change of control), and to maintain for two years health insurance for the
benefit of Mr. Slater and his family as in effect prior to the termination of
his employment. For purposes of the change in control agreement, the definition
of "change of control" is substantially the same as the definition of change of
control under Mr. Steadman's employment agreement.

   The change of control agreement also provides for non-competition provisions
and other restrictive covenants that are substantially similar to the
corresponding provisions in Mr. Steadman's employment agreement.

   Chase also has agreed to reimburse Mr. Slater for reasonable legal fees and
costs that he incurs in connection with the resolution in Mr. Slater's favor of
any dispute or controversy under his change of control agreement.

   In connection with the signing of the merger agreement, Mr. Slater has
agreed to certain modifications in his change of control agreement. See "--New
Employment Arrangements with Messrs. Steadman and Slater".

   Severance Pay Plan.  The Chase Industries Inc. Severance Pay Plan provides
severance benefits to Messrs. Steadman and Slater if their employment is
terminated under certain circumstances during the one year period beginning on
the first anniversary of a "change of control" of Chase. For purposes of the
Severance Pay Plan, the definition of change of control is substantially the
same as the definition of change of control under Mr. Steadman's employment
agreement. If during the one year period following the first anniversary of a
change of control, the executive's employment is terminated by Chase Brass
without cause (as defined in the Severance Pay Plan) or by the executive for
good reason (as defined in the Severance Pay Plan), Chase shall pay to the
executive a lump sum severance payment equal to 12 times the executive's then
current monthly salary (of, if greater, the executive's monthly salary at the
time of the change of control or, if applicable, the occurrence of the event
giving rise to the employee's right to terminate his employment for good
reason), and shall maintain for 12 months health insurance for the benefit of
the executive and his family as in effect prior to the termination of his
employment.

   In connection with the signing of the merger agreement, Messrs. Steadman and
Slater have agreed to certain modifications in their agreements under the
Severance Pay Plan. See "--New Employment Arrangements with Messrs. Steadman
and Slater".

   New Employment Arrangements with Messrs. Steadman and Slater.  In connection
with the execution of the merger agreement, Olin and Chase entered into letter
agreements with Messrs. Steadman and Slater which, upon the completion of the
merger, will modify the terms and conditions of the employment, change of
control and severance pay agreements described above. The letter agreements
provide that each officer will waive any severance benefits that he would
otherwise be entitled to under his existing employment, change of control and
severance pay agreements, and provide generally that the officer will not have
"good reason" to terminate his employment as a result of the completion of the
merger so long as Olin complies with the terms of the letter agreements as set
forth below.

   The letter agreements provide that during the two year period immediately
following the completion of the merger, each officer will be entitled (1) to
receive a base salary in an amount not less than his current base salary; (2)
to be eligible to earn an annual bonus under the annual bonus plans of Olin and
its subsidiaries, with an annual bonus standard equal to an amount not less
than such officer's annual bonus earned in respect of calendar year 2001 (the
"2001 Bonus"); provided that such officer's minimum actual annual bonus in
respect of calendar year 2002 shall not be less than the 2001 Bonus; and (3) to
receive a long-term incentive award consistent with Olin's then current
practice for similarly situated executives. In addition, each officer will be
eligible to receive a retention bonus in an amount equal to one times the sum
of such officer's base salary plus his 2001 Bonus, if and only if (1) he
remains continuously employed by Olin or its subsidiaries or affiliates through
the expiration of the two year period following the completion of the merger;
or (2) prior to the expiration of the two year period following the completion
of the merger, either (x) his employment with Olin and its subsidiaries and
affiliates is terminated other than for cause and other than as a result of his
death or disability or retirement or (y) the officer voluntarily terminates his
employment for good reason as defined for purposes of the letter agreements.
The letter agreements further provide that if during the two year period
following the completion of the merger, (1) the officer's employment is
terminated other than for cause and other than as a result of his death,
disability or retirement, or (2) he voluntarily terminates

his employment for good reason, he will be entitled to receive a lump sum
payment in an amount equal to the amount of the retention bonus, divided by 12,
multiplied by the number of months remaining until the expiration of the two
year period following the completion of the merger, and continuation of medical
and dental benefits for the remainder of the two year period following the
completion of the merger.

   Messrs. Steadman and Slater have each agreed that notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in his employment agreement or change in control agreement, as
the case may be, his covenant not to compete with Chase as described above,
shall continue to apply at least until the expiration of the two year period
following the completion of the merger.

   The letter agreements also provide for the continuation of customary
perquisites following the completion of the merger in a manner no less
favorable than the manner in which such arrangements are currently in effect.
The letter agreement with Mr. Steadman provides that the amounts payable to him
shall be reduced to the maximum amount as will result in no portion of such
payments being nondeductible by reason of the application of Section 280G of
the Internal Revenue Code.

   Options and Other Equity-Based Compensation.  For a description of the
treatment in the merger of options to acquire shares of Chase common stock and
other equity-based awards held by directors and executive officers of Chase,
see "--Effect on Awards Outstanding Under Chase Stock Plans".

   Indemnification and Insurance.  Under the merger agreement and subject to
certain limitations, Olin has agreed that the surviving corporation in the
merger will assume the same obligations with respect to indemnification of
directors or officers of Chase or its subsidiaries as were contained in the
restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated by-laws of Chase
or its subsidiaries and any indemnification or other agreements as of the date
of signing the merger agreement. In addition, the surviving corporation will
maintain, with certain limitations, the directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies currently maintained by Chase, or policies no less favorable
than such policies for a period of at least four years following the merger
except that the surviving corporation is not required to spend an amount more
than 200% of the annual premiums paid in 2001 by Chase in any one year.

Form of the Merger

   Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement and in
accordance with Delaware law, at the effective time of the merger, Plumber
Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Olin formed for purposes of the
merger and a party to the merger agreement, will be merged with and into Chase,
and Chase will survive the merger as a subsidiary of Olin, and will continue
its corporate existence under Delaware law.

Merger Consideration

   At the effective time of the merger, each share of Chase common stock,
except for stock held by Olin, Plumber Acquisition Corp. or Chase, will be
converted into the right to receive 0.6400 shares of Olin common stock. Cash
will be paid instead of fractional shares. As of the effective time of the
merger, all shares of Chase common stock to be exchanged for the merger
consideration will no longer be outstanding, will automatically be canceled and
will cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any of these
shares will cease to have any rights in respect of those shares except the
right to receive the merger consideration. See "--Conversion of Shares;
Procedures for Exchange of Certificates; Fractional Shares". The merger
consideration was determined through arms'-length negotiations between Olin and
Chase.

   Any shares of Chase common stock owned immediately before the merger by
Olin, Plumber Acquisition Corp. or Chase will be canceled and no consideration
will be delivered in exchange for these shares.

Conversion of Shares; Procedures for Exchange of Certificates; Fractional Shares

   The conversion of each share of Chase common stock into the right to receive
0.6400 shares of Olin common stock will occur automatically at the effective
time of the merger. As soon as reasonably practicable after the merger, Mellon
Investor Services LLC, the exchange agent, will send a transmittal letter to
each former Chase stockholder. The transmittal letter will contain instructions
with respect to obtaining the merger consideration in exchange for shares of
Chase stock. CHASE STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD NOT RETURN STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH THE
ENCLOSED PROXY.

   After the merger, each certificate that previously represented shares of
Chase common stock will represent only the right to receive the merger
consideration, including cash for any fractional shares of Olin common stock.

   Holders of certificates previously representing Chase stock will not be paid
dividends or distributions on the Olin stock into which their Chase stock has
been converted with a record date after the merger, and will not be paid cash
for any fractional shares of Olin common stock, until their certificates are
surrendered to the exchange agent for exchange. When their certificates are
surrendered, any unpaid dividends and any cash instead of fractional shares
will be paid without interest.

   In the event of a transfer of ownership of Chase stock which is not
registered in the records of Chase's transfer agent, a certificate representing
the proper number of shares of Olin stock may be issued to a person other than
the person in whose name the surrendered certificate is registered if:

   . the certificate is properly endorsed or otherwise is in proper form for
     transfer and

   . the person requesting such payment and issuance will:

       1) pay any transfer or other taxes resulting from the issuance of shares
          of Olin stock to a person other than the registered holder of the
          certificate or

       2) establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Olin that any taxes have
          been paid or are not applicable.

   All shares of Olin common stock issued upon surrender of certificates
representing shares of Chase common stock and any cash paid instead of any
fractional shares of Olin common stock, will be deemed to have been issued and
paid in full satisfaction of all rights relating to those shares of Chase
common stock. If certificates are presented to Olin or the exchange agent after
the effective time of the merger, they will be canceled and exchanged as
described above.

   No fractional shares of Olin common stock will be issued to any Chase
stockholder upon surrender of certificates previously representing Chase common
stock. Promptly after the merger, the exchange agent will pay to each
stockholder who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of Olin common stock an amount in cash without interest equal to (1) the
fractional share interest to which the holder would otherwise be entitled
multiplied by (2) the closing price for a share of Olin common stock on the New
York Stock Exchange on the closing date of the merger.

Effective Time of the Merger

   The effective time of the merger will be the time of the filing of the
certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State or a later time if
agreed upon by Olin and Chase and specified in the

certificate of merger. The filing of the certificate of merger will occur as
soon as practicable following the closing.

Listing of Olin Common Stock

   Prior to the completion of the merger, Olin has agreed to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to have its common stock issuable to Chase
stockholders in the merger approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange,
subject to official notice of issuance.

Delisting and Deregistration of Chase Common Stock

   If the merger is completed, Chase common stock will be delisted from the New
York Stock Exchange and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934.

Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

   In the opinion of Cahill Gordon & Reindel, tax counsel to Chase, the
following discussion summarizes the material United States federal income tax
consequences of the merger that will generally apply to U.S. holders of stock
in Chase.

   For purposes of this discussion, a U.S. holder means:

   . an individual citizen or resident of the United States

   . a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation created or
     organized under the laws of the United States or any of its political
     subdivisions

   . a trust, if a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the
     administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the
     authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or

   . an estate that is subject to United States federal income tax on its
     income regardless of its source.

   This discussion does not address tax consequences arising under the laws of
any state, locality or foreign jurisdiction. This discussion is not a
comprehensive description of all of the tax consequences that may be relevant
to you. For example, we have not described tax consequences that arise from
rules that apply to some classes of taxpayers. We have also not described tax
consequences that we assume to be generally known by investors. This discussion
is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, the
regulations of the United States Treasury Department and court and
administrative rulings and judicial decisions in effect on the date of this
proxy statement/prospectus. These laws may change, possibly retroactively, and
any change could affect the continuing validity of this discussion.

   This discussion assumes that you hold your shares of stock in Chase as a
capital asset and does not address the tax consequences that may be relevant to
you in light of your particular circumstances. In addition, it does not present
a description of the United States federal income tax laws applicable to you if
you are subject to special treatment under the United States federal income tax
laws, including if you are:

   . a financial institution

   . a tax-exempt organization

   . an S corporation or other pass-through entity

   . an insurance company

   . a dealer in securities or foreign currencies

   . a trader in securities that elects the mark-to-market method of accounting
     for your securities

   . a person that has a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar

   . an investor in a pass-through entity

   . a stockholder who received stock in Chase through the exercise of employee
     stock options or otherwise as compensation

   . a stockholder who holds stock in Chase as part of a hedge, straddle or
     conversion transaction or

   . a person subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Code.

   The summary that follows sets out the material United States federal income
tax consequences to U.S. holders who exchange their stock in Chase for common
stock in Olin. As a condition to the closing, Cahill Gordon & Reindel, tax
counsel to Chase, must render a tax opinion prior to the time at which this
proxy statement/prospectus is declared effective by the Securities and Exchange
Commission and on the closing date, in each case dated as of such respective
date, to the effect that (1) the merger will qualify for United States federal
income tax purposes as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code and (2) Chase, Olin and Plumber Acquisition Corp. will each be a
"party to a reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code.
The tax opinion will be conditioned upon receipt of certain representation
letters made by Chase and Olin and will be based upon certain assumptions
including that the transactions described herein will be consummated in
accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. Neither Chase nor Olin will
seek a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, concerning the tax
consequences of the transactions described herein. An opinion of counsel is not
binding on the IRS and we can give no assurance that the IRS will not take a
position contrary to one or more positions reflected in the opinion or that the
courts will uphold such opinion if challenged by the IRS.

   If (1) the merger qualifies for United States federal income tax purposes as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (2)
each of Chase, Olin and Plumber Acquisition Corp. is a "party to a
reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code:

   . you will not recognize gain or loss when you exchange your stock in Chase
     solely for common stock in Olin

   . if you receive cash instead of a fractional share of Olin common stock you
     will be treated as having received the cash in exchange for the fractional
     share interest and generally will recognize capital gain or loss on the
     deemed exchange in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of
     cash received and the basis of the stock in Chase allocable to that
     fractional share

   . the aggregate tax basis of Olin common stock you receive will be the same
     as the aggregate tax basis of the stock in Chase you surrender in the
     exchange, decreased by the tax basis allocated to any fractional share
     interest exchanged for cash and

   . the holding period of Olin common stock you receive will include the
     holding period of shares of stock in Chase you surrender in the exchange.

   Backup Withholding.  If you are a noncorporate holder of stock in Chase you
may be subject to backup withholding on any cash payments received in lieu of a
fractional share interest. You will not be subject to backup withholding,
however, if you:

   . furnish a correct taxpayer identification number and certify that you are
     not subject to backup withholding on the substitute Form W-9 or successor
     form included in the letter of transmittal to be delivered to you
     following the completion of the merger

   . provide a certification of foreign status on Form W-8BEN or a successor
     form or

   . are otherwise exempt from backup withholding.

   Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a
refund or credit against your United States federal income tax liability,
provided you furnish the required information to the IRS.

   Reporting Requirements.  You may be required to retain records relating to
your stock in Chase, and file with your U.S. federal income tax return a
statement setting forth facts relating to the merger.

   Tax matters are very complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to
you will depend upon the facts of your particular situation. We encourage you
to consult your own tax advisors regarding the specific tax consequences of the
merger, including tax return reporting requirements, the applicability of
federal, state, local and foreign tax laws and the effect of any proposed
change in the tax laws.

Regulatory Matters

   United States Antitrust.  Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and its rules,
certain transactions, including the merger, may not be completed unless certain
waiting period requirements have been satisfied. On May 22, 2002, Olin and
Chase each filed a Notification and Report Form under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act
with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade
Commission. The waiting period with respect to each of Olin and Chase will
expire at 11:59 p.m. on June 24, 2002, unless shortened as a result of early
termination or extended by a request for further information. At any time
before or after the effective time of the merger, the Antitrust Division, the
Federal Trade Commission or others could take action under the antitrust laws
with respect to the merger, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the
merger, to rescind the merger or to conditionally approve the merger upon the
divestiture of substantial assets of Olin or Chase. A challenge to the merger
on antitrust grounds could be made and, if such a challenge is made, it could
be successful.

Accounting Treatment

   The merger is to be accounted for as a purchase with Olin being deemed to
have acquired Chase in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
Statement Number 141 which addresses the accounting and reporting for business
combinations. The acquisition cost will be allocated to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, with any remaining,
unallocated acquisition cost being goodwill.

Appraisal Rights

   Under Virginia law, Olin shareholders are not entitled to dissenters' rights
in connection with the merger.

   Under Delaware law, Chase common stockholders are not entitled to appraisal
rights in connection with the merger because on the Chase record date Chase
common stock will be designated and quoted for trading on the New York Stock
Exchange and will be converted into the right to receive shares of Olin common
stock, which at the effective time of the merger will be listed on the New York
Stock Exchange.

Employee Benefits Matters

   Except as otherwise provided below, from and after the effective time of the
merger, Olin will, and will cause the surviving corporation to, honor in
accordance with their respective terms (as in effect on

the date of the merger agreement, including any reserved right to amend or
terminate) all Chase employment, severance and termination agreements, plans
and policies disclosed to Olin.

   Except as provided below, from the effective time of the merger through June
30, 2003, Olin shall either:

   . maintain or cause the surviving corporation to maintain for the benefit of
     employees of Chase and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective
     time of the merger who continue to be employed by the surviving
     corporation and its subsidiaries, the existing Chase benefit plans (other
     than the Chase stock plans (except to the extent described in "--Effect on
     Awards Outstanding Under Chase Stock Plans") and any other plans providing
     for the issuance of Chase common stock or based on the value of Chase
     common stock) at the benefit levels in effect on the date of the merger
     agreement or

   . provide or cause the surviving corporation to provide benefits to such
     employees who continue to be employed by the surviving corporation and its
     subsidiaries that, taken as a whole, are not materially less favorable in
     the aggregate to such employees than those provided to them immediately
     prior to the effective time of the merger.

   Neither Olin nor the surviving corporation shall have any obligation to
issue, or adopt any plans or arrangements providing for the issuance of, shares
of capital stock, warrants, options, stock appreciation rights or other rights
in respect of any shares of capital stock of any entity or any securities
convertible or exchangeable into such shares pursuant to any such plans or
arrangements. Any plans or arrangements of Chase providing for such issuance
shall be disregarded in determining whether employee benefits are not
materially less favorable in the aggregate.

   In addition, Olin shall maintain or cause the surviving corporation to
maintain such employee benefit plans, policies and arrangements as may be
required pursuant to each collective bargaining agreement to which Chase or any
of its subsidiaries may be a party immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger in accordance with the terms of such collective bargaining
agreements for the period beginning at the effective time of the merger and
extending at least until the expiration of the applicable collective bargaining
agreement. Olin shall make in cash or cause the surviving corporation to make
in cash all contributions to the trust under Chase's Savings Plan for Hourly
Employees in accordance with the terms of such plan as in effect immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger with respect to the period extending
at least until the currently scheduled expiration of the applicable collective
bargaining agreement pursuant to which such plan is maintained immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger (but only to the extent such
contributions have not already been made prior to the effective time of the
merger). Olin shall make in cash or cause the surviving corporation to make in
cash all contributions to the trust under Chase's Savings and Profit Sharing
Plan for Salaried Employees and to the trust under Chase's Benefit Restoration
Plan with respect to the period extending at least until the effective time of
the merger in accordance with the terms of such plans as in effect immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger (but only to the extent such
contributions have not already been made prior to the effective time of the
merger).

   Subject to applicable collective bargaining agreements, with respect to any
"employee benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, maintained by
Olin or any of its subsidiaries and made available to employees of Chase and
its subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective time of the merger who
continue to be employed by the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries
(including any severance plan), solely for purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting, service with Chase or any of its subsidiaries shall be
treated as service with Olin and its subsidiaries to the extent such service
was recognized for such purposes under the corresponding Chase benefit plan;
provided, however, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that
such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.

   Except as specifically set forth above, nothing in the merger agreement
requires Olin or the surviving corporation to continue any specific plans or
agreements or to continue the employment of any specific person.

Effect on Awards Outstanding Under Chase Stock Plans

   Pursuant to the merger agreement, each stock option and other stock-based
award of Chase will be converted into a stock option to acquire, or right in
respect of, a number of shares of Olin common stock equal to the number of
shares Chase common stock subject to the Chase stock option or stock-based
award multiplied by 0.6400. The exercise price or base price of each Chase
stock option and Chase stock-based award that is converted into an Olin stock
option or Olin stock-based award will be equal to the exercise price or base
price of the applicable Chase stock option or Chase stock-based award divided
by 0.6400. The terms and conditions of the Olin options and Olin stock-based
awards will otherwise be the same as were applicable under the stock option or
stock-based award of Chase, as the case may be, but taking into account any
changes, including acceleration, provided for in the applicable stock plan of
Chase or in any applicable award agreement or as a result of the merger
agreement or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Resale of Olin Common Stock

   Olin common stock issued in the merger will not be subject to any
restrictions on transfer arising under the Securities Act of 1933, except for
shares issued to any Chase stockholder who may be deemed to be an "affiliate"
of Olin or Chase for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. It is
expected that each such affiliate will agree not to transfer any Olin stock
received in the merger except in compliance with the resale provisions of Rule
144 or 145 under the Securities Act or as otherwise permitted under the
Securities Act. The merger agreement requires Chase to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its affiliates to enter into these agreements. This
proxy statement/prospectus does not cover resales of Olin common stock received
by any person upon completion of the merger, and no person is authorized to
make any use of this proxy statement/prospectus in connection with any resale.

                  THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND RELATED DOCUMENTS

   The following description summarizes the material provisions of the merger
agreement and the voting agreement. You are urged to read carefully the merger

     Internal Revenue Code and (2) Chase, Olin and Plumber Acquisition Corp.
     will each be a "party to a reorganization" within the meaning of Section

     conditioned upon the receipt by Cahill Gordon & Reindel of representation
     letters that are attached as exhibits to the merger agreement from each of
     Olin and Chase.

   The merger agreement provides that a "material adverse effect" means, when
used in connection with Olin or Chase, any state of facts, change, effect,
event, occurrence, condition (or any development

or developments which individually or in the aggregate could reasonably be
expected to result in any such state of facts, change, effect, event,
occurrence or condition) that (1) is materially adverse to the business,
properties, assets, liabilities (contingent or otherwise), financial condition
or results of operations of such party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or (2) could reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede, interfere
with, hinder or delay the consummation of the merger or the other transactions
contemplated by the voting agreement, except to the extent any such state of
facts, effect, event, occurrence, condition or development results from:

     or the transactions contemplated thereby

     obligations under the merger agreement

     common stock or

not, and shall use its best efforts to cause its subsidiaries and any of its or
their respective directors, officers or employees or any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, consultant, accountant or other representative
retained by it or any of its subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly
through another person:

   . solicit, initiate or encourage, or take any other action to facilitate,
     any inquiries or the making of any takeover proposal, as described below or

   . enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
     negotiations regarding any takeover proposal or furnish to any person any
     information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any
     takeover proposal.

   The merger agreement provides that the term "takeover proposal" means any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any person relating to or that is reasonably
likely to lead to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one
transaction or a series of transactions, of assets or businesses that
constitute 15% or more of the revenues, net income, EBITDA or assets of Chase
and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 15% or more of Chase common stock or
any other class of capital stock or other equity or voting interests in Chase
or any of its subsidiaries, any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 15% or more of Chase
common stock or any other class of capital stock of, or any other equity or
voting interests in Chase or any of its subsidiaries or any merger,
consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset
acquisition, binding share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or similar transaction involving Chase
or any of its subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement or the voting agreement.

   None of the board of directors of Chase nor any committee thereof will:

   . unless a majority of the disinterested members of the Chase Board
     determines in good faith as required by law as advised by counsel,
     withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner
     adverse to Olin or Plumber Acquisition Corp. the approval or
     recommendation by such board of directors or such committee of the merger
     or the merger agreement

   . cause Chase to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
     understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
     agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
     agreement or other similar agreement related to any takeover proposal or

     takeover proposal.

   The merger agreement also provides that Chase will promptly advise Olin of
any request for information or of any takeover proposal, the material terms and
conditions of such request or takeover proposal and the identity of the person
making such request or takeover proposal.

   Termination.  The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the effective time of the merger:

      1. by mutual written consent of Olin and Chase

      2. by Olin or Chase, if the merger has not been completed by December 31,
   2002, provided, that such right to terminate the merger agreement will not
   be available to a party whose failure to perform any of its obligations
   under the merger agreement has resulted in the failure of the merger to be
   completed by that date

      3. by Olin or Chase, if the Chase stockholders have not adopted the
   merger agreement at a Chase stockholders meeting

      4. by Olin or Chase, if the Olin shareholders have not approved the
   issuance of shares of Olin common stock in the merger at an Olin
   shareholders meeting

      5. by Olin or Chase, if any legal restraint or prohibition is in effect
   and has become final and nonappealable (1) preventing the completion of the
   merger or (2) which otherwise has had or could reasonably be expected to
   have a material adverse effect on Olin or Chase

      6. by Olin or Chase, if the other party has breached or failed to perform
   any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
   contained in the merger agreement, which breach or failure to perform would
   give rise to the failure of a condition to the merger that is incapable of
   being cured by December 31, 2002

      7. by Olin if there exists a final, nonappealable legal restraint or
   prohibition arising from a governmental suit, action or proceeding that
   prohibits completion of the merger, limits Olin's or Chase's ownership or
   operation of either company's current business or current assets, compels
   Olin or Chase to divest or hold separate any current business or current
   assets as a result of the merger, prevents Olin from effectively controlling
   in any material respect the business or operations of Chase or otherwise has
   or is reasonably expected to have, a material adverse effect on Chase

      8. by Chase if the closing price of Olin common stock is less than
   $11.78, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions
   Tape, on each of the New York Stock Exchange trading days in any thirty
   consecutive New York Stock Exchange trading day period commencing on or
   after [  .  ], 2002 or

      9. by Chase if prior to June 28, 2002, the board of directors of Chase
   shall have provided written notice to Olin that Chase is prepared, upon
   termination of the merger agreement, to enter into a binding written
   definitive agreement for a superior proposal, provided, that (1) Chase shall
   have complied with its no solicitation requirements in the merger agreement
   in all respects, (2) the board of directors of Chase shall have reasonably
   concluded in good faith (prior to giving effect to any offer which may be
   made to Chase by Olin pursuant to clause (3) below) in consultation with its
   financial advisors and outside counsel, that such proposal is a superior
   proposal and (3) Olin does not make, within ten business days after receipt
   of Chase's written notice referred to above an offer that the board of
   directors of Chase shall have reasonably concluded in good faith in
   consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel is at least as
   favorable to the stockholders of Chase than the superior proposal.

   The merger agreement provides that the term "superior proposal" means a bona
fide, written proposal made by a third party (not affiliated or associated with
Court Square Capital or its affiliates or

any current director or officer of Chase) to acquire, directly or indirectly,
including pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, all or
substantially all of the shares of Chase common stock then outstanding or all
or substantially all the assets of Chase, which the board of directors of Chase
shall have reasonably concluded in good faith (based on the advice of its
financial advisors and outside counsel) (1) is on terms which are more
favorable to the stockholders of Chase than the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and for which financing, to
the extent required, is then committed, (2) is reasonably likely of being
consummated and (3) is not subject to due diligence.

reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets (or such other source as Olin and Chase
shall agree in writing), for the thirty consecutive New York Stock Exchange

the Olin shareholders do not approve the Olin stock issuance is greater than
$25, Olin then must pay to Chase an additional termination fee in the amount of

          UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

   The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet at March
31, 2002 reflect the merger as if it had occurred on the balance sheet date.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income for the year
ended December 31, 2001 and the three months ended March 31, 2002 reflect the
merger as if it had occurred on the first day of the respective periods
presented.

   The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are based on
the historical financial statements of Olin and Chase and give effect to the
merger under the purchase method of accounting and apply the assumptions and
adjustments as discussed in the accompanying notes to such statements,
including assumptions relating to the allocation of the consideration paid for
the assets and liabilities of Chase based on preliminary estimates of their
fair value. The actual allocation of such consideration may differ from that
reflected in the pro forma financial statements after final valuation
procedures are completed following the closing of the merger. In the opinion of
Olin and Chase, all adjustments necessary to present fairly the unaudited pro
forma condensed combined financial statements have been made based on the
proposed terms and structure of the merger.

   The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data do not give effect
to any potential cost savings or other synergies that could result from the
merger. Olin is in the process of developing a plan to integrate the operations
of Chase with the operations of Olin. On a combined basis, there were no
material transactions between Olin and Chase during the periods presented.
There are no material differences between the accounting policies of Olin and
Chase.

   The pro forma adjustments made in connection with the development of the pro
forma information are preliminary and have been made solely for purposes of
developing such pro forma information for illustrative purposes necessary to
comply with the disclosure requirements and are not necessarily indicative of
the operating results or financial position that would have occurred if the
merger had been consummated on any of the assumed dates referred to in the
first paragraph above, nor is it necessarily indicative of future operating
results or financial position.

   You should read the financial information in this section along with Olin's
and Chase's historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes
incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus. See "Where You
Can Find More Information" on page 85.

   The total merger consideration will be allocated to the assets and
liabilities of Chase based on their estimated fair value. The excess of the
total merger consideration over the historical book value of Chase's net assets
has been allocated to goodwill and fixed assets. The final allocation of the
merger consideration to the Chase assets acquired and liabilities assumed
depends upon certain valuations and studies that have not progressed to a stage
where there is sufficient information to make a final allocation in the
accompanying pro forma condensed combined financial information. In accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets", Olin ceased amortizing goodwill as of January 1, 2002. We
anticipate that a portion of the purchase price up to $20 million will be
allocated to fixed assets. The estimated life for these fixed assets which
includes buildings and machinery and equipment, is 20 years.

                       DESCRIPTION OF OLIN CAPITAL STOCK

   The following summary of the capital stock of Olin is subject in all
respects to applicable provisions of Virginia law, the Olin restated articles
of incorporation, as amended, which are referred to in this proxy
statement/prospectus as the articles of incorporation, and by-laws, as amended,
which are referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the by-laws, and
the Olin rights agreement. See "Comparison of Rights of Olin Shareholders and
Chase Stockholders" on page 73 and "Where You Can Find More Information" on
page 85.

General

   The total authorized shares of capital stock of Olin consist of (1)
120,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, and (2)
10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share. The Olin board
of directors has designated 250,000 shares of its preferred stock as series A
participating cumulative preferred stock. At the close of business on April 30,
2002, approximately 46,893,701 shares of Olin common stock were issued and
outstanding, and no shares of Olin preferred stock were issued and outstanding.

Common Stock

   Holders of Olin common stock are entitled to dividends as declared by the
Olin board of directors from time to time after payment of, or provision for,
full cumulative dividends on and any required redemptions of shares of
preferred stock then outstanding. Holders of Olin common stock are entitled to
one vote per share on all matters submitted for action by the shareholders and
may not cumulate votes for the election of directors. Holders of Olin common
stock have no preemptive or subscription rights and have no liability for
further calls or assessments. In the event of the liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of our business, holders of Olin common stock are entitled to
receive pro rata all of Olin's remaining assets available for distribution,
after satisfaction of the prior preferential rights of the preferred stock and
the satisfaction of all of Olin's debts and liabilities.

   The transfer agent and registrar for the Olin common stock is Mellon
Investor Services LLC.

Preferred Stock

   The Olin board of directors is authorized, without further shareholder
action, to provide for the issuance from time to time of Olin preferred stock
in one or more series and, as to each series, to fix the designation, the
dividend rate and the date or dates from which such dividends will be
cumulative, the times when and the prices at which shares will be redeemable,
the voluntary and involuntary liquidation prices, the sinking fund provisions,
if any, applicable to such series, voting powers, if any, of such series, the
conversion terms, if any, of such series, terms of participation in common
stock dividends in excess of the preferred dividend, and any other preferences
and relative, participating, optional and other special rights and
qualifications, limitations and restrictions with respect to any such series.
To the extent that some or all of these features may be present when shares of
Olin preferred stock are issued, they could have an adverse effect on the
availability of earnings for distribution to the holders of Olin common stock
or for other corporate purposes.

Olin Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock

   Olin series A participating cumulative preferred stock was designated in
connection with the Olin rights agreement. No shares of Olin series A
participating cumulative preferred stock are outstanding. For a description of
the rights to acquire Olin series A participating cumulative preferred stock
that are attached to shares of Olin common stock, see "Comparison of Rights of
Olin Shareholders and Chase Stockholders--Rights Plans--Olin".

   Shares of Olin's series A preferred stock may only be purchased after the
rights have become exercisable, and each share of the Olin series A preferred
stock:

  .  is nonredeemable

  .  will have a preferential dividend in an amount equal to 1,000 times any
     dividend declared on each share of Olin common stock

  .  in the event of liquidation, will entitle its holder to receive a
     preferred liquidation payment equal to the greater of $0.01 per share or
     1,000 times the payment made per share of Olin common stock

  .  will have 1,000 votes and, except as otherwise provided by applicable law,
     will vote, voting together with the Olin common stock and any other
     capital stock with general voting rights and

  .  in the event of an merger, consolidation or other transaction in which
     shares of Olin common stock are converted or exchanged, will be entitled
     to receive 1,000 times the amount and type of consideration received per
     share of Olin common stock.

   The rights of Olin series A preferred stock as to dividends, liquidation and
voting, and in the event of mergers and consolidations, are protected by
customary antidilution provisions.

       COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF OLIN SHAREHOLDERS AND CHASE STOCKHOLDERS

   The rights of Olin shareholders are currently governed by Virginia law and
the Olin articles of incorporation and by-laws. The rights of Chase
stockholders are currently governed by Delaware law and the Chase restated
certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws. Upon completion
of the merger, the rights of Chase stockholders who become shareholders of Olin
in the merger will be governed by Virginia law and the Olin articles of
incorporation and by-laws.

   The following description summarizes the material differences which may
affect the rights of Olin shareholders and Chase stockholders but does not
purport to be a complete statement of all such differences, or a complete
description of the specific provisions referred to in this summary. The
identification of specific differences is not intended to indicate that other
equally or more significant differences do not exist. Olin shareholders and
Chase stockholders should read carefully the relevant provisions of Virginia
law and Delaware law, the Olin articles of incorporation and by-laws, and the
Chase certificate of incorporation and by-laws.

Capitalization

   Olin.  Olin's authorized capital stock is described above under "Description
of Olin Capital Stock".

   Chase.  The total authorized shares of capital stock of Chase consist of (1)
36,310,000 shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, (2) 12,300,000
shares of non-voting common stock, par value $.01 per share and, (3) 1,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per share. Of the 1,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, 36,310 shares have been designated as Chase series A junior
participating preferred stock.

   At the close of business on April 30, 2002, 15,306,095 shares of Chase
common stock were issued and outstanding. No other shares of non-voting common
stock or preferred stock were issued and outstanding.

   The Chase Board is authorized to issue preferred stock from time to time in
series, to set forth the voting powers of each series, and to fix the
designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other
special rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions to the times
when and the prices at which shares will be redeemable, the sinking fund
provisions, if any, applicable to such series, the dividend rate, the
conversion, if any, of such series, and any other special rights and protective
provisions of each series of preferred stock. The Chase Board, without
stockholder approval, can issue Chase preferred stock with voting, conversion
or other rights that could dilute the voting power and other rights of the
holders of Chase common stock. Chase preferred stock could also be issued
quickly with terms that could delay or prevent a change in control of Chase or
make removal of management more difficult. Additionally, issuing Chase
preferred stock may cause the market price of Chase common stock to decrease.

Voting Rights

   Olin.  Each holder of Olin common stock is entitled to one vote for each
share held of record and may not cumulate votes for the election of directors.

   Chase.  Each holder of Chase common stock is entitled to one vote for each
share held of record and may not cumulate votes for the election of directors.

Number, Election, Vacancy and Removal of Directors

   Olin.  Virginia law provides that the board of directors of a Virginia
corporation shall consist of a number of individuals specified in or fixed in
accordance with the by-laws of the corporation or, if not specified or fixed in
accordance with the by-laws, then a number specified in or fixed in accordance
with the articles of incorporation of the corporation.

   The Olin articles of incorporation provide that the number of directors
shall be specified in the by-laws, but will in any event not exceed 18. The
Olin by-laws provide that the board of directors shall consist of eight
directors, but the number of directors may be increased to any number, not more
than 18 directors, or decreased to any number, not less than three directors,
by amendment of the Olin by-laws.

   Virginia law provides that a corporation's board of directors may be divided
into two or three classes with staggered terms of office. The Olin articles of
incorporation provide that the Olin board of directors shall consist of three
classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, each of which shall serve for
three years with one class being elected each year.

   Under Virginia law, unless a corporation's articles of incorporation provide
otherwise, vacancies, including a vacancy resulting from an increase in the
number of directors, may be filled by a plurality of the votes cast by the
shares entitled to vote in the election at a meeting at which a quorum is
present or by a majority of the directors remaining in office, even though less
than a quorum. If the board of directors fills a vacancy, the director's term
expires at the next shareholders' meeting at which directors are elected even
if the corporation has a classified board of directors with staggered terms and
the new director is filling an unexpired term with more than one year
remaining. Virginia law also provides that a decrease in the number of
directors does not shorten an incumbent director's term.

   The Olin articles of incorporation provide that vacancies, including a
vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors, shall be filled
by a plurality of the votes cast by the shares entitled to vote in the election
at an annual meeting at which a quorum is present or by a majority of the
directors remaining in office, even though less than a quorum. If the board of
directors fills a vacancy, the director's term expires at the next
shareholders' meeting at which directors are elected.

   Under Virginia law, except as otherwise provided in a corporation's articles
of incorporation, a director may be removed from office, with or without cause,
by the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of
directors. Under the Olin articles of incorporation, any director may be
removed from office only for cause by the holders of a majority of the shares
entitled to vote in the election of directors.

   Chase.  The Chase board of directors has eight members. The Chase by-laws
provide that the Chase board of directors will consist of a number of directors
to be fixed from time to time pursuant to a resolution adopted by the board of
directors but will, in any event, not be less than one. Neither the Chase
certificate of incorporation nor the Chase by-laws provides for a staggered
board of directors.

   Vacancies on the Chase board of directors and newly-created directorships
resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled
by a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum. If,
at the time of filling of any vacancy or newly-created directorship, the
directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board of
directors (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), the Chancery
Court for the State of Delaware may, upon application of any stockholder or
stockholders holding at least 10% of the total number of shares outstanding
having the right to vote for such director, order an election to be held to
fill such vacancy or newly-created directorship or replace the directors
selected by the directors then in office.

   Under Delaware law and the Chase by-laws, any director or the entire Chase
board of directors may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding
voting power of Chase.

Amendments to the Olin Articles of Incorporation and Chase Certificate of
Incorporation

   Olin.  Under Virginia law, unless a Virginia corporation's articles of
incorporation provide for a greater or lesser vote, amendments of the articles
of incorporation must be approved by each voting group entitled to vote on the
proposed amendment by more than two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast
by that voting group. However, the vote specified in the articles of
incorporation may not be reduced to less than a majority of all votes cast by
the voting group at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group exists.

   The Olin articles of incorporation provide that any amendment to the Olin
articles of incorporation shall be approved by a majority of the votes entitled
to be cast by each voting group that is entitled to vote on the matter, unless
in submitting an amendment or restatement to the shareholders the board of
directors shall require a greater vote.

   Chase.  Under Delaware law, an amendment to the certificate of incorporation
of a corporation requires the approval of the board of directors and the
approval of holders of a majority of the outstanding stock entitled to vote
upon the proposed amendment. Holders of the outstanding shares of a class are
entitled to vote as a separate class on a proposed amendment that would:

   . increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of such
     class (unless this class voting right has been eliminated in the
     certificate of incorporation in certain circumstances)

   . increase or decrease the par value of the shares of such class or

   . alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the shares of
     such class, so as to affect them adversely.

   The Chase certificate of incorporation does not contain any provisions
regarding the amendment of the certificate of incorporation and therefore may
be amended as described above under Delaware law.

Amendments to the Olin By-laws and Chase By-laws

   Olin.  Under Virginia law, a corporation's shareholders or board of
directors may amend or repeal by-laws, except to the extent that the
corporation's articles of incorporation or Virginia law reserve the power
exclusively to the shareholders. A corporation's shareholders may amend or
repeal by-laws even though the by-laws may also be amended or repealed by its
board of directors.

   Virginia law expressly addresses an amendment or repeal of a by-law
provision that fixes a greater quorum or voting requirement for the board of
directors than the quorum or voting requirement fixed by Virginia law. If the
shareholders originally adopted the provision, only they may amend or repeal
it. If the board of directors originally adopted the provision, either the
shareholders or the board of directors may amend or repeal it.

   A by-law adopted or amended by the shareholders that fixes a greater quorum
or voting requirement for the board of directors may provide that it may be
amended or repealed only by a specified vote of either the shareholders or the
board of directors.

   The Olin by-laws may be altered, amended or repealed by the board of
directors, subject to the power of the shareholders to alter or repeal the
by-laws made by the board of directors at any annual or special meeting of the
shareholders.

   Chase.  Under Delaware law, the stockholders have the power to adopt, amend
or repeal the by-laws and the directors may also have such power if it is
conferred upon them by the certificate of incorporation. The Chase certificate
of incorporation and by-laws allow the directors and stockholders to amend or
repeal the by-laws.

Shareholder/Stockholder Action

   Olin.  Virginia law provides that any action which may be authorized or
taken at a meeting of shareholders may be authorized or taken without a meeting
by unanimous written consent of the shareholders who would be entitled to vote
on the action.

   Chase.  Delaware law and the Chase by-laws provide that any action which may
be taken at an annual meeting or special meeting of stockholders may be taken
without a meeting, if a consent in writing is signed by the holders of
outstanding stock having the minimum number of votes necessary to authorize
such action at a meeting of stockholders.

Notice of Certain Shareholder/Stockholder Action

   Olin.  Under Virginia law, notice of a shareholders' meeting must be given
not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the meeting, except that notice
of a shareholders' meeting to act on an amendment to the articles of
incorporation, a plan of merger, share exchange, a proposed sale of all or
substantially all of the corporation's assets or a dissolution of the
corporation must not be given less than 25 nor more than 60 days before the
meeting.

   The Olin by-laws provide that written notice of the date, time, place and
purpose or purposes of every meeting of shareholders must be given not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting, except that in
the case of a special meeting called by shareholders, notice of the special
meeting must be given at least 50 days before the meeting, either personally or
by mail to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. The Olin
by-laws further provide that the only matters that may be considered and acted
upon at a meeting of shareholders are those matters brought before the meeting:

   . through the notice of meeting

   . by Olin's board of directors or

   . by a shareholder as provided in the following paragraph.

   Generally, the Olin by-laws require a shareholder who intends to bring
matters before an annual meeting to provide advance notice of such intended
action not less than 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the
prior year's annual meeting. The notice must contain a brief description of the
business desired to be brought before the meeting, the identity of the
shareholder and the number of shares of Olin common stock held by the
shareholder and must identify any personal or other material interest of the
shareholder in such proposed business. The chairman of the meeting has the
discretion to determine whether any item of business was brought before such
meeting in compliance with the above procedures.

   Chase.  The Chase by-laws provide that a written notice of the place, day
and time, and in the case of a special meeting, the purpose, of the meeting
must be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting not less than
10 days nor more than 60 days prior to the meeting. Pursuant to the Chase
by-laws, the only matters that may be considered and acted upon at an annual or
special meeting of the stockholders are those matters brought before the
meeting:

   . through the notice of the meeting

   . by Chase's board of directors or

   . by any record stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting.

   Generally, the Chase by-laws require a stockholder who intends to propose
new business at any annual meeting to provide advance notice of such intended
action not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first
anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting. The notice must contain a
brief description of the matter to be considered and must state the number of
shares of Chase common stock held by, and the identity of, the stockholder
giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the
proposal is being made and any material interest of such stockholder in such
proposed business. The chairman at the meeting will have the discretion to
determine whether a matter was brought before a meeting in compliance with the
above procedures.

Special Shareholder/Stockholder Meetings

   Olin.  Under Virginia law, a special meeting of shareholders may be called
by the chairman of the board of directors, the president, the board of
directors or any other person authorized to do so in the corporation's articles
of incorporation or by-laws. Virginia law further provides that the only
matters that may be considered and acted upon at a special meeting of
shareholders are those described in the notice of the special meeting.

   The Olin by-laws provide that a special meeting of the shareholders may be
called by the chairman of the board, president, by resolution of the board of
directors or by resolution of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
voting power of Olin.

   Chase.  The Chase by-laws provide that a special meeting of the stockholders
may be called by the chairman of the board, president, or at the request of a
majority of the board of directors or at the written request of the holders of
ten percent of the outstanding capital stock of Chase.

Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification

   Olin.  Under Virginia law, to the extent provided in the articles of
incorporation or an amendment to the by-laws approved by shareholders, a
corporation may eliminate a director's or an officer's personal liability for
monetary damages in any proceeding brought by or in the right of a corporation
or brought by or on behalf of shareholders, except for liability resulting from
such director's or officer's willful misconduct or a knowing violation of
criminal law or of any federal or state securities law.

   The Olin by-laws provide that the directors and officers shall not be liable
for monetary damages to Olin or its shareholders with respect to any
transaction, occurrence or course of conduct, except for liability resulting
from such director's or officer's wilful misconduct or a knowing violation of
the criminal law or any federal or state securities law.

   Under Virginia law, a corporation may indemnify any person made a party to a
proceeding because he is or was a director or officer against liability
incurred in the proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and
in the case of any criminal proceeding, he had no reasonable cause to believe
his conduct was unlawful, except that a corporation may not indemnify a
director or officer if either:

   . the director or officer has been adjudged to be liable to the corporation
     or

   . in connection with any other proceeding charging improper personal benefit
     to him, whether or not involving action in his official capacity, in which
     he was adjudged liable on the basis that personal benefit was improperly
     received by him.

   The Olin amended by-laws provide that Olin shall indemnify any director,
officer or employee of Olin, or any person who, at the request of Olin, serves
or has served in any such capacity with another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise, in each case
against any and all liability and reasonable expense that may be incurred by
him in connection with or resulting from any claim, action or proceeding
(whether brought in the right of Olin or any such other corporation, entity,
plan or otherwise), civil or criminal, in which he may become involved, as a
party or otherwise, by reason of his being or having been a director, officer
or employee of Olin, or such other corporation, entity or plan while serving at
the request of Olin, whether or not he continues to be such at the time such
liability or expense shall have been incurred, unless such person engaged in
willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the criminal law.

   Virginia law provides that any indemnification for a director or officer,
unless ordered by a court, is subject to a determination that the director or
officer has met the applicable standard of conduct. The determination will be
made by either:

   . a majority vote of a quorum of the directors who are not parties to such
     proceeding

   . if there is not a quorum of such directors, by majority vote of a
     committee, consisting of two or more directors who are not parties to such
     proceeding, duly designated by the directors

   . by special legal counsel or

   . by the shareholders.

   The Olin by-laws provide that any indemnification of a director, officer or
employee shall be made unless:

   . the board of directors, acting by a majority vote of those directors who
     were directors at the time of the occurrence giving rise to the claim for
     indemnification and who are not at the time parties to such claim
     (provided that there are at least five such directors), finds that the
     person seeking indemnification has not met the standards of conduct set
     forth in the Olin by-laws or

   . if there are not five such directors, Olin's principal Virginia legal
     counsel, as last designated by the board of directors before the
     occurrence of the event giving rise to the claim for indemnification, or
     in the event such Virginia legal counsel is unwilling to serve, then
     Virginia legal counsel mutually acceptable to Olin and the person seeking
     indemnification, delivers to Olin its written legal advice that, in such
     counsel's opinion, the person seeking indemnification has not met the
     standards of conduct set.

   Under Virginia law, a corporation may advance expenses before the final
disposition of a proceeding if:

   . the director or officer furnishes a written statement of his good faith
     belief that he has met the proper standard of conduct

   . he undertakes to repay the amount if it is ultimately determined that the
     director or officer is not entitled to indemnification and

   . determination made on the facts then known would not preclude
     indemnification.

   Under Virginia law, to the extent that a director or officer has been
successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of the proceeding, the
director or officer must be indemnified against reasonable expenses incurred by
him in connection with that proceeding.

   Under the Olin by-laws, Olin shall advance expenses incurred by a director,
officer or employee prior to the final disposition of the proceeding if the
director, officer or employee furnishes to Olin an

undertaking to repay the amount of the expenses advanced in the event it is
ultimately determined that he is not entitled to indemnification under the Olin
by-laws. The Olin by-laws do not require that the director, officer or employee
furnish any security for such undertaking and provide that such undertaking
shall be accepted without reference to the director's, officer's or employee's
ability to make repayment. Olin may refrain from, or suspend, payment of
expenses if the Olin board of directors or Virginia legal counsel determines
that the director, officer or employee has not met the standards of conduct set
forth in the Olin by-laws.

   Virginia law gives a corporation the power to purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any director or officer against any liability asserted
against, and incurred in his capacity as a director or officer, whether or not
the corporation would have the power to indemnify the director or officer
against this liability under Virginia law.

   Chase.  The Chase certificate of incorporation provides that no director
will be personally liable to Chase or its stockholders for monetary damages for
breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except, if required by law, for
liability:

   . for any breach of a director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its
     stockholders

   . for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
     misconduct or a knowing violation of law

   . for violation of Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
     regarding unlawful payment of dividends or unlawful stock purchases or
     redemptions or

   . for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
     benefit.

   Under Delaware law, a corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to any proceeding, other than an
action by or on behalf of the corporation, because the person is or was a
director or officer against liability incurred in connection with the
proceeding if either:

   . the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner the director
     or officer reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
     interests of the corporation or

   . with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, the director or officer
     had no reasonable cause to believe the director's or officer's conduct was
     unlawful.

   Under Delaware law, a corporation may not indemnify a director or officer in
connection with any proceeding brought by or on behalf of the corporation in
which the director or officer has been adjudged to be liable to the corporation
unless and only to the extent that the director or officer satisfies the
conduct standard set forth above and the court in which the proceeding was
brought determines that, in view of all the circumstances of the case, the
director or officer is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such
expenses which the court deems proper.

   Delaware law provides that any indemnification for a director or officer,
unless ordered by a court, is subject to a determination that the director or
officer has met the applicable standard of conduct. The determination will be
made by either:

   . a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit
     or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or by a committee of such
     directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less
     than a quorum

   . if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct,
     independent legal counsel in a written opinion or

   . the stockholders.

   Under Delaware law, a corporation may advance expenses before the final
disposition of a proceeding if the director or officer undertakes to repay the
amount if it is ultimately determined that the director or officer is not
entitled to indemnification. Expenses incurred by former directors or officers
may be paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the corporation deems
appropriate.

   Under Delaware law, to the extent that a present or former director or
officer of a corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in
defense of the proceeding, that person must be indemnified against expenses
actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any claim.

   Delaware law gives a corporation the power to purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any director or officer against any liability asserted
against, and incurred in his or her capacity as a director or officer whether
or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify the director or
officer against this liability under Delaware law.

   The Chase by-laws provide that Chase will indemnify every director or
officer of Chase to the fullest extent allowed by law.

Dividends

   Olin.  Virginia law provides that a corporation may make distributions to
its shareholders, unless, after giving effect to the distribution, the
corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual
course of business, or the corporation's total assets would be less than the
sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if the
corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy
the preferential rights upon the dissolution of shareholders whose preferential
rights are superior to those receiving the distribution.

   Chase.  Delaware law provides that a corporation may pay dividends out of
its surplus or if there is no surplus out of its net profits for the fiscal
year in which the dividend is declared and/or for the preceding fiscal year.
Delaware law also provides that dividends may not be paid out of the net
profits if, after the payment of the dividend, the corporation's capital would
be less than the capital represented by the issued and outstanding stock of all
classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets.

Conversion

   Olin.  Holders of Olin common stock do not have the right to convert their
shares into any other securities.

   Chase.  Holders of Chase common stock do not have the right to convert their
shares into any other securities.

Rights Plans

   The following descriptions of the rights agreements of Olin and Chase are
qualified in their entirety by reference to the terms and conditions of the
rights agreements. See "Where You Can Find More Information" on page 85.

   Olin.  Under the Olin rights agreement, rights attach to each share of Olin
common stock outstanding and, when exercisable, entitle the registered holder
to purchase from Olin one-one thousandth of a share of Olin series A
participating cumulative preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share, at a
purchase price of $240 per one-one thousandth of a share, subject to
adjustment, or the "purchase price".

   The rights will not be exercisable until the close of business on the
earlier to occur of:

   . such time as Olin learns that a person or group, including any affiliate
     or associate of such person or group, has become the beneficial owner of
     more than 15% of Olin common stock then outstanding (such person or group
     being an "acquiring person"), or an acquiring person, unless provisions
     preventing accidental triggering of the rights apply or

   . the close of business on such date, if any, as may be designated by the
     Olin board of directors following the commencement of, or first public
     disclosure of an intent to commence, a tender or exchange offer by any
     person, other than Olin, its subsidiaries or its employee benefit plans,
     or any person holding shares of common stock for or pursuant to the terms
     of any such employee benefit plan, for shares of Olin outstanding common
     stock, if upon consummation of such tender or exchange offer such person
     could be the beneficial owner of more than 15% of the outstanding shares
     of Olin common stock.

The rights will expire on February 27, 2006, unless the rights are earlier
redeemed or exchanged by Olin, in each case as summarized below.

   In the event Olin is acquired in a merger or other business combination by
an acquiring person or an associate or affiliate of an acquiring person that is
not a publicly traded entity or 50% or more of Olin's assets or assets
representing 50% or more of Olin's revenues or cash flow are sold, leased,
exchanged or otherwise transferred (in one or more transactions) to an
acquiring person or an associate or affiliate of an acquiring person that is
not a publicly traded entity, each right will entitle its holder (subject to
the next paragraph) to purchase, at the purchase price, at such holder's option:

   . the number of shares of the surviving corporation in the transaction with
     such entity (which surviving corporation could be Olin) which at the time
     of the transaction would have a book value of twice the purchase price

   . that number of shares of such entity which at the time of the transaction
     would have a book value of twice the purchase price or

   . if such entity has an affiliate which has publicly traded common shares,
     that number of common shares of such affiliate which at the time of the
     transaction would have a market value of twice the purchase price.

   Any rights that are at any time beneficially owned by an acquiring person
(or any affiliate or associate of an acquiring person) will be null and void
and nontransferable and any holder of any such right (including any purported
transferee or subsequent holder) will be unable to exercise or transfer any
such right.

   At any time prior to a person or group becoming an acquiring person, the
Olin board of directors may redeem the rights in whole, but not in part, at a
redemption price of $.01 per right, subject to adjustment, or amend the terms
of the rights, in each case without the consent of the holders of the rights,
at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Olin board of
directors may establish. However, no amendment may decrease the redemption
price of the rights or provide for an earlier expiration date of the rights.

   Olin series A participating cumulative preferred stock purchasable upon
exercise of the rights is not redeemable. Olin series A participating
cumulative preferred stock has dividend, voting and liquidation rights that are
intended to result in the value of an Olin one-one thousandth interest in a
share of Olin series A participating cumulative preferred stock purchasable
upon exercise of each right approximating the value of one share of Olin common
stock.

   The rights plan is designed to protect Olin shareholders in the event of
unsolicited offers to acquire Olin and other coercive takeover tactics which,
in the opinion of the Olin board of directors, could impair its ability to
represent shareholder interests. The provisions of the rights plan may render
an unsolicited takeover of Olin more difficult or less likely to occur or might
prevent such a takeover, even though such takeover may offer Olin stockholders
the opportunity to sell their stock at a price above the prevailing market rate
and may be favored by a majority of Olin stockholders. The rights should not
interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by Olin board
of directors since Olin can redeem the rights as described above.

   Chase.  Under the Chase rights agreement, rights attach to each share of
Chase common stock outstanding and, when exercisable, entitle the registered
holder to purchase from Chase one one-thousandth of a share of Chase series A
junior participating preferred stock, par value $.01 per share, at a purchase
price of $30 per one one-thousandth of a share, subject to adjustment.

   The rights will not be exercisable until the earlier to occur of:

   . 10 days following a public announcement that a person or group has
     acquired, obtained the right to acquire, or otherwise obtained beneficial
     ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Chase common stock or

   . 10 business days, or such later date as may be determined by the Chase
     board of directors, following the commencement of, or first public
     announcement of an intention to commence, a tender offer or exchange offer
     the consummation of which would result in a person or group acquiring,
     obtaining the right to acquire or otherwise obtaining, beneficial
     ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Chase common stock.

The rights will expire on December 26, 2010, unless such date is extended or
unless the rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by Chase, in each case as
summarized below.

   In the event that a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 20% or
more of the outstanding shares of Chase common stock, each holder of a right,
other than rights beneficially owned by such person or group, which become
void, will have the right to receive upon exercise that number of shares of
Chase common stock having a market value of two times the purchase price
provided for in the right. In the event that Chase is acquired in a merger or
other business combination transaction or 50% or more of its consolidated
assets or earning power is sold after a person or group acquires beneficial
ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Chase common stock, each
holder of a right will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise that
number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company which at the time of
such transaction will have a market value of two times the purchase price
provided for in the right.

   At any time after a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 20% or
more of the outstanding shares of Chase common stock and prior to the
acquisition by such person or group of 50% or more of the then outstanding
shares of Chase common stock, the Chase board of directors may exchange the
rights (other than rights owned by such person or group which have become
void), in whole or in part, for Chase common stock or Chase series A junior
participating preferred stock.

   At any time prior to a person or group acquiring beneficial ownership of 20%
or more of the outstanding shares of Chase common stock, the Chase board of
directors may redeem the rights in whole, but not in part, at a redemption
price of $.0001 per right, subject to adjustment, or amend the terms of the
rights, in each case without the consent of the holders of the rights, at such
time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Chase board of directors
may establish.

   Chase series A junior participating preferred stock purchasable upon
exercise of the rights is not redeemable. Chase series A junior participating
preferred stock has dividend, voting and liquidation rights that are intended
to result in the value of a one one-thousandth interest in a share of Chase
series A junior participating preferred stock purchasable upon exercise of each
right approximating the value of one share of Chase common stock.

   The rights may have antitakeover effects. The rights will cause substantial
dilution to a person or group of persons that attempts to acquire Chase by a
stock acquisition on terms not approved by the Chase board of directors. The
rights should not interfere with any merger or other business combination
approved by the Chase board of directors prior to the time that a person or
group has acquired 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Chase common stock
since the rights may be redeemed or amended by Chase until such time.

Antitakeover Provisions

   Olin.  Olin has opted out of the Virginia anti-takeover law regulating
"control share acquisitions." Under that Virginia statute, shares acquired in a
control share acquisition have no voting rights unless granted by a majority
vote of all outstanding shares other than those held by the acquiring person or
any officer or employee director of the corporation, or the articles of
incorporation or by-laws of the corporation provide that this regulation does
not apply to acquisitions of its shares. An acquiring person that owns five
percent or more of the corporation's voting stock may require that a special
meeting of the shareholders be held, within 50 days of the acquiring person's
request, to consider the grant of voting rights to the shares acquired in the
control share acquisition. If voting rights are not granted and the
corporation's articles of incorporation or by-laws permit, the acquiring
person's shares may be repurchased by the corporation, at its option, at a
price per share equal to the acquiring person's cost. Virginia law grants
dissenters' rights to any shareholder who objects to a control share
acquisition that is approved by a vote of disinterested shareholders and that
gives the acquiring person control of a majority of the corporation's voting
shares. This regulation was designed to deter certain takeovers of Virginia
public corporations.

   Under the Virginia anti-takeover law regulating "affiliated transactions,"
material acquisition transactions between a Virginia corporation and any holder
of more than 10% of any class of its outstanding voting shares are required to
be approved by the holders of at least two-thirds of the remaining voting
shares. Affiliated transactions subject to this approval requirement include
mergers, share exchanges, material dispositions of corporate assets not in the
ordinary course of business, any dissolution of the corporation proposed by or
on behalf of a 10% holder or any reclassification, including reverse stock
splits, recapitalization or merger of the corporation with its subsidiaries,
that increases the percentage of voting shares owned beneficially by a 10%
holder by more than five percent.

   Chase.  Chase is subject to the provisions of Delaware law described below
regarding business combinations with interested stockholders because there is
no opt-out provision in the Chase certificate of incorporation with respect to
these provisions.

   Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law applies to a broad range
of business combinations between a Delaware corporation and an interested
stockholder. The Delaware law definition of "business combination" includes
mergers, consolidations, sales of assets, issuance of voting stock and certain
other transactions. An "interested stockholder" is defined as any person who
directly or indirectly beneficially owns or has certain rights, agreements,
arrangements or understandings with respect to 15% or more of the outstanding
voting stock of a corporation and the affiliates or associates of such person.

   Section 203 prohibits a corporation from engaging in a business combination
with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date
on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless:

   . before the stockholder became an interested stockholder, the board of
     directors approved the business combination or the board of directors
     approved the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an
     interested stockholder

   . upon completion of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder
     becoming an interested stockholder, such stockholder owned at least 85% of
     the voting stock outstanding when the transaction began other than shares
     held by directors who are also officers and by certain employee stock plans

   . prior to a stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, a corporation
     opted out of Section 203 in its certificate of incorporation or

   . the board of directors approved the business combination after the
     stockholder became an interested stockholder and the business combination
     was approved at a meeting by at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting
     stock not owned by such stockholder.

These limitations on business combinations with interested stockholders do not
apply to a corporation that does not have a class of voting stock listed on a
national securities exchange or held by at least 2,000 holders of record.

   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") dated as of May 7, 2002,
among OLIN CORPORATION, a Virginia corporation ("Parent"), PLUMBER ACQUISITION
CORP., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Sub"),
and CHASE INDUSTRIES INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

   WHEREAS the respective Boards of Directors of Sub and the Company have
approved and declared advisable, and the Board of Directors of Parent has
approved, this Agreement and the merger of Sub with and into the Company (the
"Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock"), other than any
such shares directly owned by Parent, Sub or the Company, will be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration;

   WHEREAS for United States Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that
(a) the Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, (b) this Agreement will
constitute a plan of reorganization and (c) Parent, Sub and the Company will
each be a party to such reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of
the Code;

   WHEREAS simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Sub to enter
into this Agreement, Parent and certain stockholders of the Company are
entering into a voting agreement (the "Voting Agreement") pursuant to which,
among other things, such stockholders have agreed to vote to adopt this
Agreement and to take certain other actions in furtherance of the Merger upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein; and

   WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to
prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree
as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                  THE MERGER

   SECTION 1.01.  THE MERGER.  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate
existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall succeed to
and assume all the rights and obligations of Sub in accordance with the DGCL.

   SECTION 1.02.  CLOSING.  The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take
place on the second Business Day after satisfaction or (to the extent permitted
by applicable law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than

subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), at the offices of
Cravath, Swaine & Moore, Worldwide Plaza, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York
10019, unless another time, date or place is agreed to by Parent and the
Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement
as the "Closing Date".

   SECTION 1.03.  EFFECTIVE TIME.  Prior to the Closing Parent shall prepare,
and on the Closing Date or as soon as practicable after the Closing Date, the
parties shall file a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger")
executed and acknowledged in accordance with the relevant provisions of the

                                      1-1

DGCL and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger
shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such other time as
Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger.
The time the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the
"Effective Time".

   SECTION 1.04.  EFFECTS OF THE MERGER.  The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

   SECTION 1.05.  ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS.  (a) The Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the "Company Certificate") shall
be amended at the Effective Time to be in the form of Exhibit A and, as so
amended, the Company Certificate shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein or by applicable law.

   (b) The By-laws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

   SECTION 1.06.  BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION.  The
directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors
of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their death, resignation or
removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as
the case may be.

   SECTION 1.07.  OFFICERS.  The officers of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until
the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

                                  ARTICLE II

               EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE
              CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

   SECTION 2.01.  EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK.  At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
capital stock of the Company, Parent or Sub:

   (a) Capital Stock of Sub.  Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Sub shall be converted into a validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

   (b) Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock.  Each share of
Company Common Stock that is directly owned by the Company, Parent or Sub shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

   (c) Conversion of Company Common Stock.  Except as otherwise provided in
Section 2.02(e), each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in
accordance with Section 2.01(b)) shall be converted into the right to receive
that number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common
stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") equal to
the Exchange Ratio (the "Merger Consideration"). The "Exchange Ratio" means
0.6400. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to

                                      1-2

exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (a "Certificate")
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, certain dividends or other distributions in
accordance with Section 2.02(c) and any cash in lieu of any fractional share of
Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.02(e), in each case upon the
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.02(b) and in each
case without interest.

   (d) Anti-Dilution Provisions.  In the event Parent changes (or establishes a
record date for changing) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued
and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding
Parent Common Stock and the record date therefor shall be prior to the
Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect
such stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, subdivision,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction.

   SECTION 2.02.  Exchange of Certificates.  (a) Exchange Agent.  Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for
the payment of the Merger Consideration and shall deposit with the Exchange
Agent as of the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, through
the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable pursuant to Section 2.01(c) in exchange for outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock, and Parent shall provide to the Exchange Agent, on a
timely basis, as and when needed after the Effective Time, cash necessary to
pay dividends or other distributions in accordance with Section 2.02(c) and any
cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with
Section 2.02(e).

   (b) Exchange Procedure.  As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c),
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such person
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent
and shall be in such form and have such other reasonable and customary
provisions as Parent may specify) and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering
the Certificates in exchange for (A) the Merger Consideration, (B) any
dividends or other distributions to which holders of Certificates are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and (C) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section
2.02(e). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancelation to the Exchange Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (x) certificates representing that number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II after taking into account all the shares of
Company Common Stock then held by such holder under all such Certificates so
surrendered, (y) any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and (z) cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.02(e), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered
in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper
number of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a person other than
the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock
to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish
to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such tax

                                      1-3

has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.02(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration that the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant
to the provisions of this Article II, any dividends or distributions to which
the holder of such Certificate is entitled under Section 2.02(c) and any cash
in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which the holder of
such Certificate is entitled under Section 2.02(e). No interest shall be paid
or shall accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

   (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Payment for Fractional
Shares.  No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu
of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder
in accordance with Section 2.02(e), until the surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable escheat or
similar laws, following surrender of any such Certificate there shall be paid
to the record holder of any certificate representing whole shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after
the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock and the amount of any cash in lieu of any
fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled in
accordance with Section 2.02(e), and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent
to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock.

   (d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.  All shares of
Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this Article II (including any cash paid pursuant
to this Article II) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificates. At the close of business on the day
on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.02(f), if, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
for transfer or any other reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

   (e) No Fractional Shares.  (i) No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution of Parent shall relate to
such fractional share interests and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder of Parent.
For purposes of this Section 2.02(e), all fractional shares to which a single
record holder of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled shall be
aggregated and calculations shall be rounded to three decimal places.

      (ii) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to
   the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
   share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all such shares held
   by such holder), shall be entitled to receive cash (without interest) in an
   amount, less the amount of any withholding taxes which may be required
   thereon, equal to such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock
   multiplied by the closing sales price for a share of Parent Common Stock on
   the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") Composite Transactions Tape
   (as reported by The Wall Street Journal (Northeast edition), or, if not
   reported thereby, as reported in another authoritative source selected by
   Parent) (the "NYSE Composite Transaction Tape"), on the Closing Date.

                                      1-4

      (iii) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of
   cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Certificates with respect to any
   fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall make available such
   amounts, without interest, to such holders subject to and in accordance with
   the terms of Section 2.02(c).

   (f) Termination of Merger Consideration Obligation.  Any portion of the
Merger Consideration which remains undistributed to the holders of Company
Common Stock for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand. Any holders of Company Common Stock who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent
for the shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.01(c), any dividends and other distributions to which they are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e).
If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to two years after the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger
Consideration, any dividends and other distributions payable in accordance with
Section 2.02(c) or any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.02(e), would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration,
dividends or distributions in respect thereof or such cash shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

   (g) No Liability.  None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any person in respect of any Merger Consideration, any
dividends and other distributions thereon payable in accordance with Section
2.02(c) or any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable
in accordance with Section 2.02(e), in each case delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

   (h) Lost Certificates.  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent, Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in the form of Parent
Common Stock, any unpaid dividends and other distributions to which such holder
would be entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would be entitled
pursuant to Section 2.02(e), in each case pursuant to this Agreement.

   (i) Withholding Rights.  Parent, Sub or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as
may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority by Parent, Sub or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was paid by Parent, Sub or the Exchange Agent.

                                  ARTICLE III

                        REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

   SECTION 3.01.  Representations and Warranties of the Company.  Except as
expressly set forth in the disclosure schedule (with specific reference to the
particular Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the information
stated in such disclosure schedule relates, with such disclosure to

                                      1-5

be applicable to other Sections or subsections of this Agreement to the extent
a matter is disclosed in such a way as to make its relevance to the information
called for by such other Sections or subsections readily apparent) delivered by
the Company to Parent in connection with the execution of this Agreement (the
"Company Disclosure Schedule"), the Company represents and warrants to Parent

as now being conducted and as currently proposed by its management to be

standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary other than where the failure to be so qualified or licensed
or in good standing individually or in the aggregate has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The
Company has delivered to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement true,
complete and correct copies of the Company Certificate and its by-laws, in each
case as amended to the date of this Agreement.

   (b) Subsidiaries.  Section 3.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets

or voting interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company have been validly issued
and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned directly or indirectly by
the Company, free and clear of all mortgages, claims, liens, pledges,
encumbrances, charges or security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever
(collectively, "Liens") and free of any restriction on the right to vote, sell
or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other equity or voting interests.
Except for the capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, its
Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, of record or beneficially, directly or

   (c) Capital Structure.  The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
of 36,310,000 shares of Company Common Stock, 12,300,000 shares of nonvoting
common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Company Nonvoting Common Stock")
and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the
"Company Preferred Stock"), of which 36,310 shares of Company Preferred Stock
have been designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the
"Company Series A Preferred Stock"). As of the close of business on April 30,
2002, (i) 15,306,095 shares of Company Common Stock (excluding shares held by

Option Plan (such plans, collectively, the "Company Stock Plans"), (iv)
1,458,610 shares of Company Common Stock were subject to outstanding options or
other rights to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under the
Company Stock Plans (the "Company Stock Options"), (v) 36,310 shares of Company
Series A Preferred Stock were authorized for issuance upon the exercise of the

Common Stock subject to each Company Stock Option, the grant dates, exercise
prices, expiration dates and vesting schedule of each Company

Stock Option and the names of the holders thereof. All Company Stock Options
may, by their terms, be converted into an option to acquire Parent Common Stock
in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 5.05. Each Company
Stock Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" under Section
422 of the Code so qualifies. Except as set forth above, as of the close of

Subsidiaries of shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests
in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than issuances of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of Company Stock Options
outstanding on such date as required by their terms as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, and (B) there have been no issuances by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries of options, warrants or other rights to acquire shares of
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. There are no outstanding stock appreciation rights, "phantom"
stock rights, performance units or other rights (other than the Rights and the
Company Stock Options) that are linked to the price of Company Common Stock
granted under the Company Stock Plans or otherwise. All outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock are, and all shares that may be issued pursuant to the
Company Stock Plans will be, when issued in accordance with the terms thereof,
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject
to preemptive rights. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and, except as set
forth above, no securities or other instruments or obligations of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case having the right to vote (or
convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on
any matters on which stockholders of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may
vote. Except as set forth above, there are no securities, options, warrants,
calls, rights or Contracts of any kind to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
bound obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or
sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital
stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, or securities convertible
into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or
enter into any such security, option, warrant, call, right or Contract. There
are not outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to (1) repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or (2) vote or dispose of any shares of the capital stock of,
or other equity or voting interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
As of the date of this Agreement, there are no irrevocable proxies and no
voting agreements to which the Company is a party with respect to any shares of
the capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. As of the date of this Agreement, the outstanding
indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries is as set forth on Section
3.01(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. There are no outstanding guarantees
(or any similar instruments or contracts) of indebtedness by the Company or any

of this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach
of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or
give rise to a right of, or result in, termination, cancelation or acceleration
of any obligation or loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any
Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under, or give rise to any increased, additional, accelerated or
guaranteed rights or entitlements under, any provision of (A) the Company
Certificate or the by-laws of the Company or the comparable organizational
documents of any of its Subsidiaries, (B) any loan or credit agreement, note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, guarantee, lease or other contract, commitment,

(C), any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, rights, losses, Liens
or entitlements that individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. No consent,

registration, declaration or filing with, any domestic or foreign (whether
national, Federal, state, provincial, local or otherwise) government or any
court, administrative, regulatory or other governmental agency, commission or
authority or any non-governmental self-regulatory agency, commission or
authority (each a "Governmental Entity") is required by or with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company, or the consummation by the Company
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Voting Agreement, except for (1) the filing of a premerger notification and
report form by the Company under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act") or any other applicable competition,
merger control, antitrust or similar law or regulation; (2) the filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") of (x) a proxy statement
relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement, together
with the proxy statement relating to the Parent Shareholders Meeting, in each
case as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Joint Proxy Statement")
and (y) such reports under Section 13(a), 13(d), 15(d) or 16(a) of the

filings the failure of which to be made or obtained individually or in the
aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company.

   (e) Company SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities.  The Company has filed
with the SEC all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
(including exhibits and all other information incorporated therein) required to
be filed with the SEC since January 1, 2001 (collectively, the "Company SEC
Documents"). None of the Subsidiaries of the Company are, or have at any time
since January 1, 2001, been, subject to the reporting requirements of Sections
13(a) and 15(d) of the

                                      1-8

Exchange Act. As of their respective dates, the Company SEC Documents complied
in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and
the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such
Company SEC Documents, and none of the Company SEC Documents when filed
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Except to the extent that information contained in any Company
SEC Document filed and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement
(a "Company Filed SEC Document") has been revised or superseded by a later
filed Company SEC Document, none of the Company SEC Documents contains any
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The consolidated financial statements (including the related notes)
included in the Company SEC Documents comply as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") (except, in the case of
unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the
related notes) and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the
dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows
for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments). Except as set forth in the
most recent financial statements included in the Company Filed SEC Documents,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise)
which individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

   (f) Information Supplied.  None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries specifically for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in (i) the registration statement on Form S-4 to
be filed with the SEC by Parent in connection with the issuance of shares of
Parent Common Stock in the Merger (as amended or supplemented from time to
time, the "Form S-4") will, at the time the Form S-4 becomes effective under
the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at
the date it is first mailed to each of the Company's stockholders and Parent's
shareholders and at the time of each of the Company Stockholders Meeting and
the Parent Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy
Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements
of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. No representation
or warranty is made by the Company with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 based on
information supplied by Parent or Sub in writing specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4, as the
case may be.

Company Filed SEC Documents, from December 31, 2001, to the date of this

businesses only in the usual and ordinary course consistent with past practice,
and during such period there has not been (i) any Material Adverse Effect
relating to the Company, (ii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any
dividend or other distribution (whether in cash, stock, property or otherwise)

distributions (including liquidating distributions) by a direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company to its parent, (iii) any purchase,
redemption or other acquisition of any shares of capital stock or any other

Subsidiaries or any rights, warrants, calls or options to acquire such shares
or other equity or voting interests or securities, (iv) any split, combination
or reclassification of any of the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' capital

interests or securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (v) (A) any
granting by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any current or former

Filed SEC Documents or that has been provided to Parent, (B) any granting by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any current or former director,

                                     1-10

   (h) Litigation.  Except as disclosed in the Company Filed SEC Documents,
there is no suit, action, proceeding, claim, grievance, demand or investigation
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets,
properties, businesses or operations that individually or in the aggregate has
had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company, nor is there any statute, law, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment,
decree, injunction, writ, stipulation or order of any Governmental Entity or
arbitrator outstanding against or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
investigation, proceeding, notice of violation, order of forfeiture or
complaint by any Governmental Entity involving, the Company or any of its

of noncompliance or possible noncompliance that individually or in the
aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material

it to own, lease or operate its properties and other assets and to carry on its
business and operations as presently conducted and as currently proposed by its
management to be conducted, except where the failure to so have in effect,

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. There has occurred
no default under, or violation of, any such Permit, except individually or in
the aggregate as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement, in

Permit that individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

      (ii) Except for those matters disclosed in the Company Filed SEC
   Documents and those matters that individually or in the aggregate would not

       to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, against the Company or any

       any building, structure, facility or fixture.

      (j) Contracts.  (i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
   violation or breach of or in default under (nor does there exist any
   condition that upon the passage of time or the giving of notice or both
   would cause such a violation or breach of or default under) any Contract to
   which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties or assets is
   bound, except for violations, breaches or defaults that individually or in
   the aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a

       any geographic area;

          (B) all Contracts of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with any
       Affiliate of the Company (other than any of its Subsidiaries);

          (C) all joint venture, partnership or other similar agreements to
       which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (including all
       amendments and modifications thereto); and

          (D) all loan agreements, credit agreements, notes, debentures, bonds,
       mortgages, indentures and other Contracts (collectively, "debt
       obligations") pursuant to which any indebtedness of the Company or any
       of its Subsidiaries is outstanding or may be incurred and all guarantees
       of or by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any debt obligations
       of any other person (other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries),
       including the respective aggregate principal amounts outstanding as of
       the date of this Agreement.

   (k) Absence of Changes in Benefit Plans; Labor Relations.  Since December
31, 2001, there has not been any material change in any actuarial or other
assumption used to calculate funding obligations with respect to any Company
Pension Plans, or any change in the manner in which contributions to any
Company Pension Plans are made or the basis on which such contributions are
determined. Except as disclosed in the Company Filed SEC Documents, there exist
no currently binding Company Benefit Agreements. There are no collective
bargaining or other labor union agreements to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
bound. None of the employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are
represented by any union with respect to their employment by the Company or
such Subsidiary and there is no request for labor representation pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to the employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2001, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has experienced any labor strikes or disputes,
union organization attempts, slowdowns or work stoppage due to labor
disagreements that individually or in the aggregate have had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The
Company has not received notice of any unfair labor practice charge or
complaint against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which is pending and,
to the Knowledge of the Company, there is no unfair labor practice charge or
complaint against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries threatened before the
National Labor Relations Board or any comparable state or foreign agency or
authority except for complaints and charges that individually or in the
aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. No employment-related grievances that are
individually or in the aggregate reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company, nor any arbitration proceedings arising out of
collective bargaining agreements, are pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
individually or in the aggregate have had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

   (l) ERISA Compliance.  (i) Section 3.01(l)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule contains a complete and accurate list of each Company Benefit Plan
that is an "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"))
(sometimes referred to herein as a "Company Pension Plan"), each Company
Benefit Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section
3(1) of ERISA) and all other Company Benefit Plans. The Company has provided to
Parent true, complete and correct copies of (A) each Company Benefit Plan (or,
in the case of any unwritten Company Benefit Plans, descriptions thereof),

                                     1-13

(B) the two most recent annual reports on Form 5500 required to be filed with
the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") with respect to each Company Benefit
Plan (if any such report was required), (C) the most recent summary plan
description for each Company Benefit Plan for which such summary plan
description is required and (D) each trust agreement and insurance or group
annuity contract relating to any Company Benefit Plan. Each Company Benefit
Plan has been administered in accordance with its terms except for failures to
so administer that individually or in the aggregate have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The
Company, its Subsidiaries and all the Company Benefit Plans are all in
compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other
applicable laws, including laws of foreign jurisdictions, and the terms of all
collective bargaining agreements except for failures to comply that
individually or in the aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

      (ii) All Company Pension Plans intended to be tax-qualified have received
   favorable determination letters from the IRS with respect to "TRA" (as
   defined in Section 1 of Rev. Proc. 93-39) to the effect that such Company
   Pension Plans are qualified and exempt from Federal income taxes under
   Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, no such determination
   letter has been revoked (or, to the Knowledge of the Company, has revocation
   been threatened) and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred
   since the date of the most recent determination letter or application
   therefor relating to any such Company Pension Plan that would adversely
   affect the qualification of such Company Pension Plan or materially increase
   the costs relating thereto or require security under Section 307 of ERISA.
   The Company has timely amended each Company Pension Plan to the extent
   necessary to comply with the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, the
   Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and
   Reform Act of 1998, and other recent laws including GATT and the Uniformed
   Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act except to the extent the
   period prescribed by the IRS for making such amendments has not expired. All
   Company Pension Plans required to have been approved by any foreign
   Governmental Entity have been so approved, no such approval has been revoked
   (or, to the Knowledge of the Company, has revocation been threatened) and,
   to the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred since the date of the
   most recent approval or application therefor relating to any such Company
   Pension Plan that would materially affect any such approval relating thereto
   or materially increase the costs relating thereto. The Company has delivered
   to Parent a true, complete and correct copy of the most recent determination
   letter received with respect to each Company Pension Plan intended to be
   tax-qualified, as well as a true, complete and correct copy of each pending
   application for a determination letter, if any. The Company has also
   provided to Parent a true, complete and correct list of all amendments to
   any Company Pension Plan intended to be tax-qualified as to which a
   favorable determination letter has not yet been received.

      (iii) With respect to each Company Pension Plan subject to Title IV of
   ERISA (a "Title IV Plan"), the Company has provided to Parent true, complete
   and correct copies of the two most recent actuarial valuation reports, and,
   to the Knowledge of the Company, there has been no material adverse change
   in the financial condition of any Company Pension Plan since its last such
   annual valuation date. No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of
   ERISA that individually or in the aggregate has had or would be reasonably
   expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company has been or is
   reasonably expected to be incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
   with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single- employer plan"
   (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA) currently or formerly
   maintained by any of them, or the single-employer plan of any Commonly
   Controlled Entity.

      (iv) All reports, returns and similar documents with respect to all
   Company Benefit Plans required to be filed with any Governmental Entity or
   distributed to any Company Benefit Plan participant have been duly and
   timely filed or distributed except for failures to file or distribute that

                                     1-14

   individually or in the aggregate have not had and would not be reasonably
   expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. None of the
   Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received notice of, and to the
   Knowledge of the Company, there are no investigations by any Governmental
   Entity with respect to, termination proceedings or other claims (except
   claims for benefits payable in the normal operation of the Company Benefit
   Plans), suits or proceedings against or involving any Company Benefit Plan
   or asserting any rights or claims to benefits under any Company Benefit Plan
   that could give rise to any liability that individually or in the aggregate
   has had or would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
   the Company, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there are not any facts
   that could give rise to any liability that individually or in the aggregate
   would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
   Company in the event of any such investigation, claim, suit or proceeding.

      (v) To the Knowledge of the Company all contributions, premiums and
   benefit payments under or in connection with the Company Benefit Plans that
   are required to have been made as of the date of this Agreement in
   accordance with the terms of the Company Benefit Plans have been timely made
   or have been reflected on the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed
   or incorporated by reference into the Company Filed SEC Documents. Neither
   any Company Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of any Commonly
   Controlled Entity subject to Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code
   has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as such term is defined in Section
   302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived.

      (vi) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, (A) to the Knowledge of
   the Company, there has not occurred any prohibited transaction (within the
   meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) in which the
   Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective employees, or
   any trustee or administrator of such Company Benefit Plan, or any agent of
   the foregoing, has engaged that could subject the Company or any of its
   Subsidiaries or any of their respective employees, or a trustee,
   administrator or other fiduciary of any trust created under any Company
   Benefit Plan, to the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by
   Section 4975 of the Code or the sanctions imposed under Title I of ERISA and
   (B) to the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Company, any of its
   Subsidiaries, any of their respective employees, any trustee, administrator
   or other fiduciary of any Company Benefit Plan or any agent of any of the
   foregoing, has engaged in any transaction or acted in a manner that could,
   or failed to act so as to, subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
   any such trustee, administrator or other fiduciary to any liability for
   breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA or any other applicable law. No Title
   IV Plan or related trust has been terminated, nor has there been any
   "reportable event" (as that term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) for
   which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived with respect to
   any Title IV Plan during the last five years, and no notice of a reportable
   event will be required to be filed in connection with the transactions
   contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any of its
   Subsidiaries has incurred a "complete withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal"
   (as such terms are defined in Sections 4203 and 4205, respectively, of
   ERISA) since the effective date of such Sections 4203 and 4205 with respect
   to any Company Pension Plan that is a multiemployer plan within the meaning
   of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA or has incurred or could reasonably be
   expected to incur any "withdrawal liability" (within the meaning of Subtitle
   E of Title IV of ERISA) in respect of any such plan that has had or would
   reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

      (vii) Section 3.01(l)(vii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule discloses
   whether each Company Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan
   is (A) unfunded, (B) funded through a "welfare benefit fund", as such term
   is defined in Section 419(e) of the Code, or other funding mechanism or (C)
   insured. Subject to applicable collective bargaining agreements, the terms
   of each such welfare benefit plan provide that it may be amended or
   terminated (including with respect to benefits provided to retirees and
   other former employees) without material liability to the Company or any of
   its Subsidiaries at any time after the Effective Time and, to the

                                     1-15

   Knowledge of the Company, there has not been any communication to
   participants in any such plan that would adversely affect such result. Each
   of the Company and its Subsidiaries complies with the applicable
   requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code or any similar state statute
   with respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is a group health plan, as
   such term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code or such state
   statute, except for failures to comply that individually or in the aggregate
   have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
   Effect on the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
   any material obligations for retiree health or life insurance benefits under
   any Company Benefit Plan (other than for continuation coverage required
   under Section 4980B(f) of the Code).

      (viii) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
   obtaining of the Company Stockholder Approval or the consummation of the
   Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting
   Agreement (including as a result of any termination of employment on or
   following the Effective Time) will (A) entitle any current or former
   director, officer, employee or consultant of the Company or any of its
   Subsidiaries to severance or termination pay, (B) accelerate the time of
   payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor
   trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount
   payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any Company
   Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement or (C) result in any breach or
   violation of, or a default under, any Company Benefit Plan or Company
   Benefit Agreement.

      (ix) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability or
   obligations that individually or in the aggregate has had or would
   reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,
   including under or on account of a Company Benefit Plan, arising out of the
   hiring of persons to provide services to the Company or any of its
   Subsidiaries and treating such persons as consultants or independent
   contractors and not as employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

      (x) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries maintains any
   compensation plans, programs or arrangements the payments under which would
   not reasonably by expected to be deductible by reason of the limitations
   under Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations thereunder.

   (m) No Excess Parachute Payments.  Other than payments or benefits that may
be made to the persons listed in Section 3.01(m) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule ("Primary Company Executives"), no amount or other entitlement or
economic benefit that could reasonably be expected to be received (whether in
cash or property or the vesting of property) as a result of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the obtaining of the Company Stockholder Approval
or the Parent Stockholder Approval, the consummation of the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting Agreement (including
as a result of termination of employment on or following the Effective Time) by
or for the benefit of any director, officer, employee or consultant of the
Company or any of its Affiliates who is a "disqualified individual" (as such
term is defined in proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any
Company Benefit Plan, Company Benefit Agreement or otherwise would be an
"excess parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of
the Code), and no disqualified individual is entitled to receive any additional
payment from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation
or any other person in the event that the excise tax required by Section
4999(a) of the Code is imposed on such disqualified individual (a "Parachute
Gross Up Payment"). Section 3.01(m) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth, calculated as of the date of this Agreement, (i) the "base amount" (as
such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for each Primary
Company Executive and (ii) the estimated amount that could be paid or provided
to each Primary Company Executive as a result of the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the obtaining of the Company Stockholder Approval or the Parent
Stockholder Approval, the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including as a result of any termination of
employment on or following the Effective Time).

                                     1-16

   (n) Taxes.  (i) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has filed or has
caused to be filed all material tax returns and reports required to be filed by
it and all such returns and reports are complete and accurate in all material
respects. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has paid or caused to be
paid all material taxes due and owing, and the most recent financial statements
contained in the Company Filed SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve
(excluding any reserves for deferred taxes) for all taxes payable by the
Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof
accrued through the date of such financial statements.

      (ii) No deficiencies, audit examinations, refund litigation, proposed
   adjustments or matters in controversy for any taxes have been proposed,
   asserted or assessed in writing against the Company or any of its
   Subsidiaries, except for any such deficiencies, examinations, litigation,
   adjustments or matters that have been resolved with the applicable tax
   authority. The Federal income tax returns of the Company and its
   Subsidiaries have been examined by and settled with the U.S. Internal
   Revenue Service, or the period of limitations on assessment has expired, for
   all taxable years through December 31, 1997. All assessments for taxes due
   and owing by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to
   completed and settled examinations or concluded litigation have been paid.
   There is no currently effective agreement or other document extending, or
   having the effect of extending, the period of assessment or collection of
   any taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

      (iii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to
   include in a taxable period ending after the Effective Time taxable income
   attributable to income that accrued in a prior taxable period but was not
   recognized for tax purposes in any prior taxable period as a result of the
   installment method of accounting, the completed contract method of
   accounting, the long-term contract method of accounting, the cash method of
   accounting or Section 481 of the Code or similar provisions of domestic or
   foreign (whether national, Federal, state, provincial, local or otherwise)
   tax law.

      (iv) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken or agreed
   to take any action, or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other
   circumstance, that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from
   qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
   Code.

      (v) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has constituted
   either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a
   distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of
   the Code in the two years prior to the date of this Agreement.

      (vi) The Company and its Subsidiaries have complied in all material
   respects with all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules and
   regulations relating to the withholding of taxes (including withholding of
   taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 3121 and 3402 of the Code and similar
   provisions under any Federal, state, local or foreign tax laws) and have,
   within the time and the manner prescribed by law, withheld from and paid
   over to the proper Governmental Entity all amounts required to be so
   withheld and paid over under applicable laws.

      (vii) As used in this Agreement, "taxes" shall include all (x) domestic
   or foreign (whether national, Federal, state, provincial, local or
   otherwise) income, property, sales, excise, withholding and other taxes and
   similar governmental charges, including any interest, penalties and
   additions with respect thereto, (y) liability for the payment of any amounts
   of the type described in clause (x) as a result of being a member of a
   consolidated, combined or similar group and (z) liability as a result of any
   tax sharing or similar contractual agreement.

   (o) Intellectual Property.  To the Knowledge of the Company and except as,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, (i) none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has infringed upon, misappropriated or
otherwise come into conflict with any intellectual property or other
proprietary information of any other person and (ii) no person or persons are
infringing or have misappropriated or otherwise come

                                     1-17

into conflict with the rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to any intellectual property in a manner which, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company.

   (p) Voting Requirements.  The affirmative vote at the Company Stockholders
Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof of the holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock in favor of adopting this
Agreement (the "Company Stockholder Approval") is the only vote of the holders
of any class or series of the Company's capital stock necessary to adopt this
Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated hereby. No other approval
of the stockholders of the Company is required with respect to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Voting Agreement.

   (q) State Takeover Statutes.  The Board of Directors of the Company has
approved and declared advisable the terms of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and has approved the Voting Agreement, and such approval represents
all the action necessary to render inapplicable to this Agreement, the Voting
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or by the Voting Agreement, the provisions of Section 203 to the extent, if
any, Section 203 would otherwise be applicable to this Agreement, the Voting
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or by the Voting Agreement. To the Knowledge of the Company, no other state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation or similar provision of the
Company Certificate applies or purports to apply to this Agreement, the Voting
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or by the Voting Agreement.

   (r) Brokers.  No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other
person, other than Credit Suisse First Boston, the fees, commissions and
expenses of which will be paid by the Company, is entitled to any broker's,
finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission, or the
reimbursement of expenses, in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Voting Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company has furnished to
Parent true, complete and correct copies of all agreements under which any such
fees, commissions or expenses are payable and all indemnification and other
agreements related to the engagement of the persons to whom such fees,
commissions or expenses are payable.

   (s) Opinion of Financial Advisor.  The Company has received the opinion of
Credit Suisse First Boston, dated the date of this Agreement, to the effect
that, as of such date, the Exchange Ratio is fair from a financial point of
view to the stockholders of the Company, a signed copy of which opinion has
been delivered to Parent.

   (t) Rights Agreement.  The Company has taken all actions necessary to cause
the Rights Agreement to be amended to (i) render the Rights Agreement
inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting Agreement, (ii) ensure that (A)
none of Parent, Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent is an "Acquiring Person"
(as defined in the Rights Agreement) pursuant to the Rights Agreement and (B) a
"Distribution Date" (as defined in the Rights Agreement) does not occur solely
by reason of the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting
Agreement, and (iii) provide that the "Final Expiration Date" (as defined in
the Rights Agreement) shall occur immediately prior to the Effective Time.

   SECTION 3.02.  Representations and Warranties of Parent and Sub.  Except as
expressly set forth on the disclosure schedule (with specific reference to the
Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the information stated in such
disclosure schedule relates, with such disclosure to be

                                     1-18

applicable to other Sections or subsections of this Agreement to the extent a
matter is disclosed in such a way as to make its relevance to the information
called for by such other Sections or subsections readily apparent) delivered by
Parent to the Company in connection with the execution of this Agreement (the
"Parent Disclosure Schedule"), Parent and Sub represent and warrant to the
Company as follows:

   (a) Organization, Standing and Power.  Each of Parent and Sub (i) is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized, (ii) has the requisite corporate power
and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted and as currently
proposed by its management to be conducted and (iii) is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary other than where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing individually or in
the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent. Parent has made available to the Company prior to the
execution of this Agreement true, complete and correct copies of its Restated
Articles of Incorporation and its by-laws and of the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of Sub, in each case as amended to the date of this
Agreement.

   (b) Subsidiaries.  Section 3.02(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a true and complete list of all Subsidiaries of Parent as of the date of
this Agreement and, for each such Subsidiary, the state of incorporation. All
the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests
in, each Subsidiary of Parent have been validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable and are owned directly or indirectly by Parent, free and clear of
all Liens and free of any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise
dispose of such capital stock or other equity or voting interests. Except for
the capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, its Subsidiaries,

for issuance or outstanding. During the period from April 30, 2002, to the date
of this Agreement (A) there have been no issuances by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries of shares of capital

corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and,

compliance with the provisions hereof and thereof do not and will not conflict
with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of, or result
in, termination, cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or loss of a
material benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of Parent or Sub under, or give rise to any increased,
additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements under, any

Subsidiaries or their respective properties, operations or assets, other than,
in the case of clauses (B) and (C), any such conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults, rights, losses, Liens or entitlements that individually or in the
aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, action by or in
respect of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental
Entity is required by or with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Sub

that are to be issued in connection with the Merger to be listed on the NYSE;
and (5) such other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,

Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

   (e) Parent SEC Documents.  Parent has filed with the SEC all reports,
schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including exhibits and all
other information incorporated therein) required to be filed by Parent since
January 1, 2001 (collectively, "Parent SEC Documents"). None of the
Subsidiaries of Parent are, or have at any time since January 1, 2001, been,
subject to the reporting requirements of Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the
Exchange Act. As of their respective dates, the Parent SEC Documents complied
in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC Documents, and none of the
Parent SEC Documents when filed contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Except to the extent
that information contained in any Parent SEC Document filed and publicly
available prior to the date of this Agreement (a "Parent Filed SEC Document")
has been revised or superseded by a later filed Parent SEC Document, none of
the Parent SEC Documents contains any untrue statement of a material fact or
omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. The consolidated financial statements
(including the related notes) of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents
comply as to form, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all
material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC relating thereto, have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted
by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the related notes) and fairly present
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the
case of unaudited statements, to normal recurring year-end audit adjustments).
Except as set forth in the most recent financial statements included in the
Parent Filed SEC Documents, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent
or otherwise) which individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

                                     1-21

   (f) Information Supplied.  None of the information supplied or to be

omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement
will, at the date it is first mailed to each of the Company's stockholders and
Parent's shareholders or at the time of each of the Company Stockholders
Meeting and the Parent Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy
Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements
of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and the Form S-4
will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. No representation or
warranty is made by Parent with respect to statements made or incorporated by
reference in the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 based on information
supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4, as the case may be.
