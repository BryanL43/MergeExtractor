SUBJECT TO COMPLETION, DATED ________________, 2001

PROPOSED CONSOLIDATION - YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT

     Citadel Holding Corporation, or Citadel, Craig Corporation, or Craig, and
Reading Entertainment, Inc., or Reading, have entered into a consolidation
agreement under which we have agreed to combine our three companies by merging
Craig and Reading with subsidiaries of Citadel.  Before we can complete the
consolidation, we must obtain the approval of the companies' voting common
stockholders.  We are sending you this joint proxy statement/prospectus to ask
you to vote in favor of the consolidation transaction and related matters.

     In the consolidation, Craig common stockholders and common preference
stockholders will receive 1.17 shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock for each
Craig share they own, and Reading common stockholders will receive 1.25 shares
of Citadel nonvoting common stock for each Reading share they own.  Each
outstanding option to purchase Craig common stock and common preference stock
and each outstanding option to purchase Reading common stock will become an
option to purchase an equivalent number (based on the foregoing conversion
ratios) of either Citadel voting common stock or nonvoting common stock, at each
option holder's election.  The shares of Citadel voting common stock and
nonvoting common stock outstanding at the time of effectiveness of the
consolidation will remain outstanding and not be affected by the consolidation.

     On August 21, 2001, the closing price of Citadel nonvoting common stock as
reported on the American Stock Exchange was $1.65 per share, the closing prices
of Craig common stock and common preference stock as reported on the New York
Stock Exchange were $2.00 per share and $1.80 per share and the closing price of
Reading common stock as reported on The Nasdaq Stock Market was $1.87 per share.
We encourage you to obtain more recent quotations.  Following the consolidation,
Citadel will change its name to "Reading International, Inc.," and Citadel
nonvoting common stock and voting common stock will be listed for trading on the
American Stock Exchange under the symbols "_____" and "_____."  Craig common
stock and common preference stock and Reading common stock will be delisted if
the  consolidation is completed.

     We will hold the annual meeting of Citadel jointly with special meetings of
Craig stockholders and Reading stockholders to consider and vote on the
consolidation.  At Citadel's annual meeting, Citadel will ask its stockholders
to consider and vote on:

          .    The issuance of Citadel shares in the consolidation, including
               Citadel voting shares and nonvoting shares issuable upon the
               exercise of Craig and Reading stock options to be assumed by
               Citadel in the consolidation.

          .    A related amendment to increase the number of shares of Citadel
               common stock reserved for issuance under Citadel's 1999 stock
               option plan upon completion of the consolidation.

          .    A related amendment to Citadel's articles of incorporation to
               change the name of Citadel to "Reading International, Inc." upon
               completion of the consolidation.

          .    A separate proposal to ratify and approve the form of Citadel
               indemnification agreement.

          .    The election of directors of Citadel.

     At Craig's special meeting, Craig will ask its stockholders to consider and
vote on the approval of the consolidation agreement and the Craig merger.

     At Reading's special meeting, Reading will ask its stockholders to consider
and vote on the approval of the consolidation agreement and the Reading merger.

     Approval of the proposals relating to the consolidation is a prerequisite
to completion of the consolidation.  The holders of a majority of the voting
power of both Craig and Reading and approximately 49% of the voting power of
Citadel are obligated to vote in favor of the consolidation and related matters.
We anticipate, therefore, that each of the proposals will be approved at the
joint meetings of stockholders.

     None of these proposals, other than the proposals to elect directors of
Citadel and to ratify and approve the form of Citadel indemnification agreement,
will become effective unless the consolidation is approved and completed.  None
of the stockholders of Citadel, Craig or Reading are entitled to dissenters' or
appraisal rights in connection with the consolidation.  TO CAST YOUR VOTE AT
YOUR ANNUAL OR SPECIAL MEETING, PLEASE COMPLETE, SIGN AND DATE YOUR PROXY CARD
AND RETURN IT IN THE ENCLOSED ENVELOPE.

     The date, time and place of our joint stockholders' meetings are as
follows:

                                October 24, 2001

statement/prospectus and the other documents furnished with or referenced in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus for a more complete understanding of the
consolidation.  In particular, you should read the documents attached to this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the consolidation agreement, which
is attached as ANNEX A, and the opinion of Marshall & Stevens Incorporated,
which is attached as ANNEX B.

                       We Are Proposing A Consolidation
                         Of Citadel, Craig And Reading

Q:   WHAT IS THE CONSOLIDATION?  (See page ___)

     A:   The proposed consolidation will combine Citadel, Craig and Reading.
Upon completion of the consolidation, Craig and Reading will become wholly owned
subsidiaries of Citadel, and Citadel, under the new name "Reading International,
Inc.," will continue to conduct its business and will carry on the businesses
currently being conducted by Craig and Reading.

Q:   WHAT WILL I RECEIVE IN THE CONSOLIDATION?  (See pages ___ and ___)

     A:   In the consolidation:

          .  Each outstanding share of Craig common stock and common preference
stock will automatically be converted into the right to receive 1.17 shares of
Citadel nonvoting common stock.

          .  Each outstanding share of Reading common stock will automatically
be converted into the right to receive 1.25 shares of Citadel nonvoting common
stock.

     No fractional shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock will be issued in
the consolidation.  Instead of fractional shares, the former Craig stockholders
and Reading stockholders will receive cash in an amount to be determined by
multiplying the fraction of a share of Citadel nonvoting common stock to which
they otherwise would be entitled by the average closing price for Citadel
nonvoting common stock as reported on the American Stock Exchange for the five
trading days immediately preceding the effective date of the consolidation.

Q:   WILL THE CONVERSION RATIOS CHANGE?  (See page ____)

     A:   There is no provision in the consolidation agreement for changing the
conversion ratios of 1.17 shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock for each
share of Craig common stock and common preference stock and 1.25 shares of
Citadel nonvoting common stock for each share of Reading common stock. If
Citadel, Craig and Reading agree to change the conversion ratios in light of
developments at the companies prior to the joint meetings at which the
consolidation will be considered, this joint proxy statement/prospectus will be
supplemented accordingly and your vote will be resolicited, if necessary.

Q:   WHAT PERCENTAGE OF CITADEL WILL BE RECEIVED BY CRAIG STOCKHOLDERS AND
     READING STOCKHOLDERS IN THE CONSOLIDATION? (See page ___)

     A:   The answer to this question is complicated by the fact that some of
the stockholders of Craig and Reading are also stockholders of Citadel.  For
example, James J. Cotter is the beneficial owner of approximately 52.2% of the
outstanding Craig common stock and approximately 28.6% of the outstanding Craig
common preference stock and owns approximately 16.5% of the Citadel common
stock.  Generally speaking, stockholders of Craig and Reading indirectly own,
through the Citadel common stock held by Craig and Reading, approximately 32.4%
of the outstanding common stock of Citadel.  Based on the number of shares of
stock of Citadel, Craig and Reading outstanding on July 31, 2001, and treating
Mr. Cotter and all other stockholders who own both Craig stock and Citadel
stock, or who own both Reading stock and Citadel stock, as former Craig
stockholders and former Reading stockholders only to the extent of their current
beneficial holdings in Craig and Reading, the former Craig stockholders and
former Reading stockholders will have the following aggregate stock ownership
interests in Citadel immediately following the consolidation:

                                                                          Percent of Citadel
                                     Number of Outstanding Shares            Common Stock
                                       of Citadel Common Stock               Outstanding
                                   --------------------------------  ----------------------------
                                      Nonvoting       Voting            Nonvoting       Voting
                                      ---------       ------            ---------       ------

Craig stockholders...............    12,239,622         --                 60%            0%
Reading stockholders.............     2,854,810         --                 14%            0%

Q:   WHAT PERCENTAGE OF CITADEL WILL BE OWNED BY THE EXISTING CITADEL
     STOCKHOLDERS FOLLOWING THE CONSOLIDATION?  (See page ____)

     A:   The answer to this question also is complicated by the overlapping
ownership of the three companies.  Based on the number of shares of stock of
Citadel, Craig and Reading outstanding on July 31, 2001, and treating those
stockholders who own both Craig stock and Citadel stock, or who own both Reading
stock and Citadel stock, as former Citadel stockholders only to the extent of
their current holdings of Citadel common stock, the existing Citadel
stockholders will have the following aggregate ownership interests in Citadel
immediately following the consolidation:

                                                                                  Percent of Citadel
                                      Number of Outstanding Shares                   Common Stock
                                        of Citadel Common Stock                       Outstanding
                                   ---------------------------------     -----------------------------------
                                     Nonvoting        Voting                   Nonvoting        Voting
                                     ---------        ------                   ---------        ------

Citadel stockholders.............    5,390,556        1,336,331                   26%             100%

Q:   DO THESE PERCENTAGES GIVE EFFECT TO STOCK OPTIONS?  (See page ____)

     A:   No. The percentages shown above do not give effect to outstanding
stock options of Citadel, Craig and Reading. Citadel currently has outstanding
options to purchase 155,000 shares of nonvoting common stock at the weighted-
average exercise price of $2.76 per share. Craig currently has outstanding
options to purchase 664,940 shares of Craig common stock at the weighted-average
exercise price of $6.04 per share and 65,000 shares of Craig common preference
stock at the weighted-average exercise price of $6.65 per share. Reading
currently has outstanding options to purchase 790,232 shares of Reading common
stock at the weighted-average exercise price of $12.79 per share. Accordingly,
all of the currently outstanding stock options of the three companines have
exercise prices materially above the current market prices of the underlying
shares.

     The percentages shown above also do not give effect to outstanding
convertible preferred stock of Reading, since Citadel will own all of the
Reading preferred shares after the consolidation.

Q:   HOW WILL THE CONSOLIDATION AFFECT STOCK OPTIONS?  (See page ____)

     A:   In the consolidation:

          .  Each option to purchase Craig common stock and common preference
stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the consolidation will
automatically become an option to purchase either Citadel voting common stock or
nonvoting common stock, at each option holder's election. The number of shares
of Citadel voting common stock or nonvoting common stock purchasable under the
option will be determined by multiplying 1.17 by the number of shares of Craig
common stock or common preference stock that were purchasable under the option
before the consolidation. The exercise price per share of each option to
purchase Citadel shares will be the pre-consolidation exercise price divided by
1.17, so the aggregate exercise prices of the outstanding Craig options will not
be affected by the consolidation.

          .  Each option to purchase Reading common stock that is outstanding
immediately prior to the consolidation also will automatically become an option
to purchase either Citadel voting common stock or nonvoting common stock, at
each option holder's election.  The number of shares of Citadel voting common
stock or nonvoting common stock purchasable will be determined by multiplying
1.25 by the number of shares of Reading common stock that were purchasable under
the option before the consolidation.  The exercise price per share of each
option to purchase Citadel shares will be the pre-consolidation exercise price
divided by 1.25, so the aggregate exercise prices of the outstanding Reading
options will not be affected by the consolidation.

Q:   WHAT PERCENTAGE OF CITADEL WILL BE OWNED BY FORMER CRAIG AND READING
     STOCKHOLDERS AND OPTION HOLDERS AND EXISTING CITADEL STOCKHOLDERS AND
     OPTION HOLDERS ASSUMING THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS?  (See page ___)

     A:   Based on the number of stock options of Craig and Reading outstanding
on July 31, 2001, and assuming that each holder of Craig stock options and
Reading stock options elects to convert Craig and Reading options into options
to purchase Citadel voting common stock in the consolidation, Citadel will have
outstanding immediately following the consolidation options to purchase
1,841,820 Citadel voting shares at exercise prices ranging from approximately
$4.49 to $11.20 per share, representing a weighted-average exercise price of
$7.90 per share. These options will be in addition to currently outstanding
options to

purchase 155,000 shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock at the weighted-
average exercise price of $2.76 per share. Assuming these options were exercised
in full, immediately following the consolidation the former Craig stockholders
and option holders, former Reading stockholders and option holders and existing
Citadel stockholders and option holders will have the following fully-diluted
aggregate ownership interests in Citadel:

                                                                   Percentage of Citadel
                                            Number of              Common Stock Assuming
                                        Shares of Citadel       Exercise of All Outstanding
                                           Common Stock                    Options
                                  ---------------------------  ------------------------------
                                     Nonvoting       Voting        Nonvoting        Voting
                                     ---------       ------        ---------        ------

Craig stockholders
  and option holders............     12,239,622      854,030           59.3%           26.9%
Reading stockholders
  and option holders............      2,854,810      987,790           13.8%           31.1%
Citadel stockholders
  and option holders............      5,545,556    1,336,330           26.9%           42.0%

     For purposes of this table, we have treated option holders as former Craig,
Reading or Citadel option holders according to whether their options were
initially granted by Craig, Reading or Citadel.

     You should note that, of the options to purchase Citadel voting common
stock to be received in the consolidation by former Craig and Reading option
holders, James J. Cotter will hold options to purchase 1,490,120 Citadel voting
shares. Mr. Cotter is currently the controlling stockholder of Citadel.
Directly, through his ownership of approximately 16.5% of the currently
outstanding Citadel voting common stock, and indirectly through his control of
Craig and Reading, Mr. Cotter has voting control over approximately 49% of the
currently outstanding Citadel voting common stock. Furthermore, given the
weighted average exercise price of Mr. Cotter's options to purchase Citadel
common stock immediately following the consolidation ($8.03 per share), the
exercise of his options and the issuance of his option shares would be
antidilutive both from a market price and a book value point of view.
Accordingly, we believe that the assumption by Citadel of the Craig and Reading
stock options held by Mr. Cotter will have no practical effect upon the control
of Citadel.

Q:   WHO WILL BE THE DIRECTORS OF CITADEL? (See page ____)

     A:   Following the consolidation, the board of directors of Citadel will
consist of five members to be elected at the annual Citadel meeting as described
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.  Each nominee for director is an
incumbent director of Citadel.

Q.   WHO WILL BE THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF CITADEL? (See page ___)

     A:   Following the consolidation, the executive officers of Citadel are
expected to include:

          .  James J. Cotter, as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer. Mr. Cotter currently holds the same positions at Citadel, Craig and
Reading.

          .  S. Craig Tompkins, as Vice Chairman and Corporate Secretary. Mr.
Tompkins currently holds the same positions at Citadel and Reading and currently
is the President and a director at Craig.

          .  Andrzej Matyczynski, as Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Matyczynski
currently holds the same position at Citadel, Craig and Reading.

          .  Brett Marsh, as Vice President - Real Estate. Mr. Marsh currently
holds the same position at Citadel, Craig and Reading

          .  Ellen M. Cotter, as Vice President - Business Affairs. Ms. Cotter,
the daughter of James J. Cotter, currently holds the same position at Craig and
Reading.

Q:   ARE THERE RISKS INVOLVED IN THE CONSOLIDATION? (See page ___)

     A:   Yes.  In evaluating the consolidation, you should carefully consider
the factors discussed in the section entitled "RISK FACTORS" beginning on page
____.

Q:   WHAT STOCKHOLDER APPROVALS ARE NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE CONSOLIDATION?
     (See pages ____ and ____)

     A:   For Citadel, the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Citadel voting common stock present and voted at the Citadel annual
meeting is required to approve the issuance of Citadel shares in connection with
the consolidation and the related amendment to Citadel's 1999 stock option plan.
The approval of the related amendment to Citadel's articles of incorporation to
change the name of Citadel will require the affirmative vote of a majority of
the outstanding shares of Citadel voting common stock.

          For Craig, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding voting power of Craig common stock and common preference stock,
voting as a single class, is required to approve the consolidation agreement and
the Craig merger.

          For Reading, the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of
the outstanding shares of Reading common stock and preferred stock, voting as a
single class, is required to approve the consolidation agreement and the Reading
merger.

Q:   ARE STOCKHOLDERS BEING ASKED TO APPROVE ANY OTHER MATTERS?  (See pages
     __ and __)

     A:   Yes.  In addition to the issuance of Citadel shares in connection with
the consolidation and the related amendments to Citadel's stock option plan and
articles of incorporation, Citadel stockholders are being asked to approve:

          .  A proposal to ratify and approve the form of indemnification
agreement between Citadel and its directors and officers.

          .  The election of five individuals to serve on the Citadel board of
directors for the ensuing year.

Q:   HAVE ANY STOCKHOLDERS ALREADY COMMITTED TO VOTING IN FAVOR OF THE
     CONSOLIDATION? (See page _____)

     A:   Yes.  James J. Cotter, Craig and Reading, who together hold
approximately 49% of the outstanding shares of Citadel voting common stock, are
obligated under the consolidation agreement to vote in favor of the issuance of
Citadel shares in connection with the consolidation and related matters.  Mr.
Cotter, who owns or has the right to vote a majority of the outstanding voting
power of Craig common stock and common preference stock, also is obligated under
the consolidation agreement to vote in favor of the consolidation agreement and
the Craig merger.  Craig, which holds a majority of the voting power of the
outstanding shares of Reading common stock and preferred stock, likewise is
obligated to vote in favor of the consolidation agreement and the Reading
merger.  As a result, we expect that all matters relating to the consolidation
will be approved at the joint meetings of stockholders of the three companies.

Q:   WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE CONSOLIDATION TO BE COMPLETED?  (See page ___)

     A.   We expect to complete the consolidation promptly following the joint
meetings of stockholders of Citadel, Craig and Reading.

Q.   WHOM SHOULD I CALL WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CONSOLIDATION?  (See page
     ___)

     A:   Stockholders should call Andrzej Matyczynski, our Chief Financial
Officer, at (213) 239-0540.

Q.   WHERE WILL THE STOCK OF THE COMPANIES BE LISTED FOLLOWING THE
     CONSOLIDATION? (See page ___)

     A.   Craig common stock and common preference stock and Reading common
stock will be delisted following the consolidation. Citadel nonvoting common
stock and voting common stock will be listed for trading on the American Stock
Exchange under the new trading symbols "___" and "___," respectively.

Q:   WHERE CAN I GET ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT CITADEL, CRAIG AND READING?
     (See pages i and ________)

on Form 10-Q of Citadel, Craig and Reading are being furnished with this joint
proxy statement/prospectus.  These reports contain important business and

statement/prospectus also incorporates by reference additional information about
the companies from documents that are not being delivered with this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.  You may obtain any of these other documents incorporated
by reference, without charge, by following the instructions in the section
entitled "DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE" on page ______.

                  Our Reasons For Proposing The Consolidation
                       Of Craig And Reading With Citadel

Q:   WHY ARE CITADEL, CRAIG AND READING EACH PROPOSING THE CONSOLIDATION? (See
     page ___)

     A:   Citadel, Craig and Reading have substantially overlapping ownership
and management, and each of the companies is engaged, directly or indirectly, in
the cinema exhibition, live theater and real estate businesses.  The purpose of
the consolidation is to eliminate the overlapping ownership and management and
combine the businesses of the companies, which we believe will achieve the
following benefits to stockholders of the companies:

          .  Eliminate Duplicative Costs - Once the businesses and operations of
the three companies are fully consolidated, we will save at least $1 million
annually of duplication of SEC reporting costs, audit expenses, directors' fees
and other administrative expenses. It will also free up for more productive uses
management and staff time which is currently consumed dealing with the related-
party transactions and potential conflict-of-interest issues that are inherent
in our overlapping ownership and management.

          .  Simplify Our Capital Structure and Increase Market Understanding -
The consolidation will substantially simplify our capital structure. This should
lead to a better understanding and appreciation of the consolidated company's
value by investors and others.

          .  Facilitate Better Use of Assets and Liquidity - The consolidation
will allow us to take advantage of Citadel's U.S. asset base and liquidity to
provide needed capital to advance opportunities in Australia and New Zealand at
what we believe to be very favorable currency exchange rates. At the present
time, the U.S. Dollar is near a ten-year high compared to the Australian Dollar
and the New Zealand Dollar, and we believe that there are favorable
opportunities in these countries to invest the consolidated company's capital
resources in real estate-related assets.

          .  Enhance Stockholder Liquidity - The current stockholders of Craig
and Reading, as the holders of Citadel nonvoting common stock, should enjoy
greater liquidity in their investment than they currently enjoy as the holders
of Craig common stock or common preference stock or Reading common stock. The
current holders of Citadel nonvoting common stock also should enjoy the greater
liquidity that will result from the issuance of nonvoting common stock to the
current holders of Craig common stock and common preference stock and Reading
common stock in the consolidation.

          .  Increase in Book Value of Net Assets - Citadel will account for the
consolidation of Craig and Reading using the purchase method of accounting.
Under purchase accounting, Citadel will record the fair value of the
consideration given for Craig common stock and common preference stock and
Reading common stock , plus the amount of direct transaction costs, as the cost
of acquiring Craig and Reading. Citadel will allocate these costs to the Craig
and Reading assets and liabilities acquired based on their respective fair
values, which we believe exceed these costs. As a result, we expect the net
assets of the consolidated company for financial reporting purposes to exceed
the sum of the current net assets of Citadel, Craig and Reading.

Q:   DO THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS OF CITADEL, CRAIG AND READING EACH RECOMMEND
     VOTING IN FAVOR OF THE CONSOLIDATION? (See pages ___ and ___)

     A:   Yes.

          .  The conflicts committee of the Citadel board of directors, which
consists entirely of independent directors, unanimously recommended that the
board approve the consolidation. After careful consideration, the Citadel board
of directors unanimously approved the consolidation agreement and recommends
that Citadel stockholders vote in favor of approval of the issuance of Citadel
shares and other matters in connection with the consolidation.

          .  The conflicts committee of the Craig board of directors, which
consists entirely of independent directors, unanimously recommended that the
board approve the consolidation. After careful consideration, the Craig board of
directors unanimously approved the consolidation agreement and recommends that
Craig stockholders approve the consolidation agreement and the Craig merger.

          .  The conflicts committee of the Reading board of directors, which
consists of an independent director, recommended that the board approve the
conversion ratio of 1.25 shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock for each share
of Reading common stock provided for in the consolidation agreement. After
careful consideration, the Reading board of directors unanimously approved the
consolidation agreement and recommends that Reading stockholders approve the
consolidation agreement and the Reading merger.

Q:   HAVE THE COMPANIES RECEIVED A FAVORABLE OPINION FROM THEIR FINANCIAL
     ADVISOR CONCERNING THE CONSOLIDATION? (See page ___)

     A:   Yes.  In deciding to approve the consolidation, the boards of
directors of Citadel, Craig and Reading considered the opinion of their joint
financial advisor, Marshall & Stevens Incorporated, or Marshall & Stevens, to
the effect that the consolidation, and the consideration to be received in the
consolidation are fair, from a financial point of view, to the public
stockholders of each of the companies.

          The full text of Marshall & Stevens' written opinion is attached to
this joint proxy statement/prospectus as ANNEX B.  You should read this opinion
carefully and completely for a description of the assumptions made, matters
considered and the limitations of the review by Marshall & Stevens.  The opinion
of Marshall & Stevens is directed to the boards of directors and the conflicts
committees of the boards of the three companies.  The opinion does not address
the prices at which Citadel's nonvoting common stock will trade after the
consolidation and is not a recommendation as to how to vote on any matter
relating to the consolidation.

Q:   DO PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE CONSOLIDATION HAVE INTERESTS THAT DIFFER FROM
     MINE? (See pages _____ and _____)

     A:   Yes.  These interests include the following:

          .  Interests of Controlling Stockholder - James J. Cotter owns or
controls, directly or indirectly, a majority of the voting power of both Craig
and Reading and approximately 49% of the voting power of Citadel. As such, he is
the principal controlling stockholder of Craig, Reading and Citadel. Mr. Cotter
has advised the directors of the three companies that he favors a consolidation
of the companies, but would not support a transaction which, in his view, would
materially and adversely affect his control position with respect to the three
companies. This advice was influential in the determination to issue Citadel
nonvoting common stock, as opposed to Citadel voting common stock, in the
consolidation.

             Mr. Cotter receives significant benefits from the three companies
not shared by other stockholders. Mr. Cotter is paid approximately $545,000
annually by the three companies in director's fees and consulting fees and
serves as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of each of the three
companies. Two of Mr. Cotter's children - Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter -
serve as officers or directors of one or more of the three companies, and
Margaret Cotter provides certain theater management services to an affiliate of
Citadel on an independent contractor basis. Over the twelve months ended July
31, 2001, the aggregate payments to Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter (and her
affiliates) totaled approximately $163,800 and $257,000, respectively.

             Mr. Cotter is a significant creditor of Citadel.  He:

               -  Holds a $2.25 million Citadel promissory note, which bears
                  interest at the current rate of 8.125% per annum and matures
                  in July 2002.

               -  Is a 50% member in Sutton Hill Capital, LLC, which is the
                  landlord to Citadel with respect to its Manhattan-based
                  cinemas (other than the Angelika) and to which Citadel has
                  granted a $28 million line of credit, available for draw by
                  Sutton Hill Capital beginning in July 2007.

             One of the effects of the consolidation will be to increase
Citadel's equity, which may enhance its ability to repay these obligations.

             Mr. Cotter has advised the directors of the three companies that he
considers his investment in the companies to be long-term in nature, and that he
intends to pass his investment on to his estate for the benefit of his children,
including Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter.  Mr. Cotter has further advised the
directors of the three companies that he believes that the three companies
should be operated on a combined basis, and that, in his view, the best
opportunity for the three companies is to use the companies' assets to advance
the opportunities in Australia and New Zealand which he believes are reasonably
available to Reading.  Given the overlapping nature of Mr. Cotter's existing
ownership interests in Citadel, Craig and Reading, he has, in effect, already
assumed the risks of an investment in the combined companies.  Accordingly, he
may view the attractiveness of the consolidation differently than stockholders
who only have an investment in one or two of the three companies.  Also, given
his level of personal involvement in the direction of Reading's activities in
Australia and New Zealand, he may view the opportunities there as more
attractive than would Citadel or Craig stockholders, who might prefer a domestic
focus to their investments.

          .  Stock Options - As of July 31, 2001, executive officers and
directors of Craig held options to purchase a total of 664,940 shares of Craig
common stock at the weighted-average exercise price of $6.04 per share and total
of 65,000 shares of Craig common preference stock at the weighted-average
exercise price of $6.65 per share. A total of 22,500 shares under these options
were unvested. As of July 31, 2001, current and former executive officers and
directors of Reading held options to purchase a total of 790,232 shares of
Reading common stock at the weighted-average exercise price of $12.79 per share.
A total of 30,500 shares under these

options were unvested. Pursuant to the consolidation agreement, these options
will be assumed by Citadel and become options to purchase an equivalent number
(based on the conversion ratios used in the consolidation for Craig common stock
and common preference stock and for Reading common stock) of shares of either
Citadel voting common stock or nonvoting common stock, at each option holder's
election.

             Mr. Cotter currently holds options to acquire 635,232 shares of
Reading common stock at the weighted-average exercise price of $13.30 per share
and 594,940 shares of Craig common stock at the weighted-average exercise price
of $5.92 per share.  If Mr. Cotter elects to convert his Reading stock options
and Craig stock options into options to purchase Citadel voting common stock in
the consolidation, he would, immediately following the consolidation, hold
options to purchase 1,490,120 shares of Citadel voting common stock, or 52.7% of
the outstanding Citadel voting common stock assuming his options were exercised
in full, at the weighted-average exercise price of $8.03 per share. Taking into
account his current Citadel stock holdings, as well, this would give Mr. Cotter
total beneficial ownership of 64.3% of the voting power of Citadel after taking
into effect the exercise of his Citadel stock options.

          .  Indemnity Arrangements - Under the consolidation agreement, Citadel
has agreed to assume Craig's and Reading's obligations under the indemnification
agreements between Craig and Reading and their respective directors and
officers, which are identical to indemnification agreements currently in place
between Citadel and its directors and officers. For more information on the
Citadel indemnification agreement, see the discussion under "PROPOSAL TO RATIFY
AND APPROVE FORM OF CITADEL INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT" on page ____.

          .  Compensation Arrangements - In addition to Mr. Cotter, some other
executive officers of Craig and Reading will benefit from the consolidation in
that their employment agreements with Craig and Reading and the benefits
packages Craig and Reading provide to them will be assumed by the consolidated
company in the consolidation.

Q.   WHY ARE CRAIG AND READING STOCK OPTION HOLDERS BEING GIVEN AN ELECTION TO
     HAVE THEIR OPTIONS CONVERTED INTO OPTIONS TO PURCHASE EITHER CITADEL VOTING
     SHARES OR NONVOTING SHARES. (See page ___)

     A.   The election to give Craig and Reading stock option holders the right
to elect in the consolidation to have the options converted into options to
acquire either Citadel voting common stock or Citadel nonvoting common stock was
made:

          .  To mitigate to some extent the loss of voting power to be realized
by James J. Cotter as a consequence of the consolidation.

          .  Giving weight to the fact that some of the Craig and Reading
executives had received options to purchase voting Craig and Reading stock
as a part of the original compensation arrangements with Craig or Reading.

          .  With the expectation that most of the Craig and Reading stock
option holders (other than, perhaps, Mr. Cotter) would elect to have their
options converted into options to acquire Citadel nonvoting common stock given
the limited practical value of the voting rights attached to the Citadel voting
common stock as compared to the value represented by the anticipated greater
liquidity that should be enjoyed by the holders of Citadel nonvoting common
stock.

     The conversion ratio is the same (1.17 shares of Citadel stock for each
share of Craig stock and 1.25 shares of Citadel stock for each share of Reading
stock), whether an option holder elects to receive options to acquire Citadel
voting shares or nonvoting shares.

                             Steps For You To Take

Q:   WHEN AND WHERE WILL THE VOTES TAKE PLACE? (See pages _____and _____)

     A:   We will hold a joint annual meeting of Citadel stockholders and
special meetings of Craig stockholders and Reading stockholders at
______________________, ____________________, California, on October 24, 2001,
starting at 10:00 a.m., Pacific time.

Q:   WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW? (See pages _______ and ______)

     A:   After carefully reading and considering the information contained in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the accompanying annual reports and
quarterly reports of Citadel, Craig and Reading, please mail your signed
Citadel, Craig or Reading proxy card in the enclosed return envelope as soon as
possible so that your shares may be represented at the joint meetings.
Alternatively, you may attend the joint meetings and vote in person.  Even if
you plan to attend the joint meetings, we ask that you return your signed proxy
in order to ensure that your shares are voted.

Q:   SHOULD I SEND IN MY STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW? (See pages _____ and _____)

     A:   No.  After the consolidation is completed, Citadel will send you
written instructions for exchanging your Craig and Reading stock certificates
for Citadel stock certificates.

Q:   IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY MY BROKER, WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY
     SHARES FOR ME? (See pages _____ and _____)

     A:   Your broker will not be able to vote your shares without instructions
from you.  You should instruct your broker as to how to vote you shares by
following the procedures provided by your broker.

Q:   WHAT IF I WANT TO CHANGE MY VOTE? (See pages _____ and _____)

     A:   You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the
joint meetings. There are three ways for you to do this:

          .  Send notice to the secretary of Citadel, Craig or Reading (as
appropriate) that you wish to revoke your proxy.

          .  Send notice to the secretary of Citadel, Craig or Reading (as
appropriate) that you wish to change your proxy.

          .  Attend the joint meetings and vote in person.

     If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, however,
you must contact the brokerage firm or bank if you wish to change your vote.

Q:   WHAT IF I DON'T VOTE? (See pages _____ and _____)

     A:   Your failure to vote your Citadel shares will not affect the outcome
of the voting by the Citadel stockholders on the issuance of Citadel shares in
connection with the consolidation and related matters, except for the amendment
to Citadel's articles of incorporation.  If you are a Craig stockholder or a
Reading stockholder and fail to vote, it will have the same effect as a vote
against the consolidation; however, stockholders who have the right to vote a
majority of the outstanding voting power of Craig common stock and common
preference stock and of Reading common stock and preferred stock have agreed in
the consolidation agreement to vote in favor of the consolidation agreement and
related Craig merger and Reading merger, so these matters are expected to be
approved by Craig stockholders and Reading stockholders at the joint meetings
regardless of the vote of other stockholders.

     If you return your proxy and do not indicate how you want to vote, your
proxy will be counted as a vote FOR approval of the matters at the joint
meetings.

Q:   AM I ENTITLED TO DISSENTERS' OR APPRAISAL RIGHTS? (See page _____)

     A:   No.  Under Nevada law, there are no dissenters' or appraisal rights
relating to the consolidation.

                           Other Matters To Consider

Q:   HOW DO THE MARKET PRICES OF CITADEL, CRAIG AND READING COMMON STOCK
     COMPARE? (See page _____)

     A:   Citadel nonvoting common stock and voting common stock are listed on
the American Stock Exchange under the symbols "CDL.A." and "CDL.B."  Craig's
common stock and common preference stock are traded on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbols "CRG" and "CRGpf."  Reading common stock is traded on
The Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol "RDGE."  On July 18, 2001, the last
full trading day prior to the public announcement of the agreement in principle
to accomplish the consolidation, the last reported sale prices of Citadel voting
common stock and nonvoting common stock, Craig common stock and common
preference stock and Reading stock were:

          .  $1.50 per share of Citadel voting common stock.

          .  $1.31 per share of Citadel nonvoting common stock.

          .  $2.05 per share of Craig common stock.

          .  $1.50 per share of Craig common preference stock.

          .  $1.90 per share of Reading common stock.

     On September __, 2001, the last reported sale prices of shares of Citadel
voting common stock and nonvoting common stock, Craig common stock and common
preference stock and Reading common stock were:

          .  $__________ per share of Citadel voting common stock.

          .  $__________ per share of Citadel nonvoting common stock.

          .  $__________ per share of Craig common stock.

          .  $__________ per share of Craig common preference stock.

          .  $__________ per share of Reading common stock.

     We urge you to obtain current market quotations.

Q:   WERE TRADING PRICES CONSIDERED IN ESTABLISHING THE CONVERSION RATIOS? (See
     page ____)

     A:   Yes.  In establishing the conversion ratios, we took into account,
among other things, the trading prices of the Citadel nonvoting common stock,
Craig common stock and common preference stock and Reading common stock at the
time we signed the agreement in principle to accomplish the consolidation and
the average trading prices over a period of approximately six months preceding
the signing.  The average trading prices for this period were as follows:

          .  $1.92 per share for Citadel nonvoting common stock.

          .  $2.14 per share for Craig common stock.

          .  $1.80 per share for Craig common preference stock.

          .  $2.22 per share for Reading common stock.

Q:   WILL I RECOGNIZE INCOME TAX GAIN OR LOSS ON THE CONSOLIDATION? (See page
     __)

     A:   For both Craig stockholders and Reading stockholders, gain or loss
will be recognized for United States federal income tax purposes in connection
with the consolidation to the extent that the value of the Citadel nonvoting
common stock (plus any cash received for fractional shares) exceeds your tax
basis in your Craig and Reading shares.  Stockholders are urged to consult their
own tax advisors to determine their particular tax consequences.

Q:   WHAT IS THE INTENDED ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE CONSOLIDATION? (See page
     _____)

     A:   Citadel will account for the consolidation as a purchase of Craig and
Reading by Citadel, using the purchase method of accounting.

Q:   WHAT IS THE LEGAL STRUCTURE OF THE CONSOLIDATION?  (See page _____)

     A:   The consolidation will be accomplished by two separate mergers that
will happen simultaneously. A new, wholly owned subsidiary of Citadel will merge
with and into Craig, resulting in Craig becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of
Citadel.  Simultaneously, another new, wholly owned subsidiary of Citadel will
merge with and into Reading, resulting in Reading becoming a wholly owned
subsidiary of Citadel.  Thus, when we refer to the consolidation throughout this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, we are speaking of the simultaneous Craig
merger and Reading merger.

          The consolidation agreement is attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as ANNEX A.  You are encouraged to read the consolidation
agreement carefully.

Q:   ARE THERE CONTRACTUAL CONDITIONS TO COMPLETION OF THE CONSOLIDATION? (See
     page ____)

     A:   Yes.  The respective obligations of Citadel, Craig and Reading to
complete the consolidation are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of closing
conditions.  The conditions that must be satisfied or waived before the
completion of the consolidation include the following, subject to exceptions and
qualifications:

          .  The Citadel stockholders must approve the issuance of Citadel
shares in connection with the consolidation and the related amendments to
Citadel's 1999 stock option plan and articles of incorporation.

          .  The consolidation agreement must be approved by both the Craig
stockholders and the Reading stockholders.

          .  No injunction or order preventing the completion of the
consolidation may be in effect.

          .  The shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock to be issued in the
consolidation must have been approved for listing on the American Stock
Exchange.

          .  The parties' respective representations and warranties in the
consolidation agreement must be true and correct, unless the failure to be true
and correct would not have a material adverse effect.

          .  The parties must have complied in all material respects with the
agreements and covenants that each has made in the consolidation agreement.

          .  There must have been no material adverse change in the business,
assets or financial condition of any of the companies.

          .  Marshall & Stevens must not have withdrawn its fairness opinion, or
modified it in any materially adverse way.

     If any of the companies waives any condition to completion of the
consolidation, they will each consider the facts and circumstances at that time
and make a determination whether a resolicitation of proxies from their
stockholders is appropriate.

Q:   DOES THE CONSOLIDATION AGREEMENT PERMIT TERMINATION OF THE CONSOLIDATION?
     (See page __).

     A:   Yes.  The consolidation agreement may be terminated prior to the
effectiveness of the consolidation under the following conditions:

          .  By our mutual written consent.

          .  By any of us in certain circumstances if the effective time has not
occurred on or before January 30, 2002.

          .  By any of us if there has been a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the other parties set forth in
the consolidation agreement, which has not have been cured within 20 business
days after notice of such breach.

          .  By any of us if any applicable law, rule or regulation makes the
consummation of the consolidation illegal or if any judgment, injunction, order
or decree of any court or other governmental authority restrains or otherwise
prohibits the consummation of the consolidation and such governmental order
becomes final and nonappealable, provided that the party seeking to terminate
the consolidation agreement has used its reasonable best efforts to remove or
lift such restrain or prohibition.

          .  By any of us if the requisite stockholder approval is not obtained
upon a vote at a duly held meeting of stockholders or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof.

Q:   COULD PAYMENT OF TERMINATION FEES BE REQUIRED? (See page __)

     A:   No.  There are no termination or breakup fees payable in connection
with a termination of the consolidation; however, Citadel, Craig and Reading
have agreed in the consolidation agreement to share the fees and expenses of
preparing this joint proxy statement/prospectus and filing the registration
statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part in the event
the consolidation is not completed for any reason.  Also, none of the companies
has waived any rights it may have against a company that breaches the
consolidation agreement.

Q:   MAY CITADEL, CRAIG OR READING NEGOTIATE WITH OTHER PARTIES? (See page __)

     A:   The consolidation agreement does not prohibit negotiations with other
parties; however, we are not proposing to sell Citadel, Craig or Reading, or
effect a change of control of any of the companies.  Further, any such
transaction would likely require the approval of the stockholders of one or more
of the companies.  Since stockholders representing 49% of the voting power of
Citadel and a majority of the voting power of both Craig and Reading are
contractually bound to vote in favor of the consolidation and related matters,
it is unlikely that any third party will come forward with any alternative
transaction.

                          FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

     This joint proxy statement/prospectus contains forward-looking statements
within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act.  These statements include statements with respect to the financial
condition, results of operations and businesses of Citadel, Craig and Reading
and the expected impact of the consolidation on Citadel's consolidated financial
condition and performance.  Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans,
believes, seeks, estimates and similar expressions identify forward-looking
statements.

     These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance
and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking
statements.  In evaluating the consolidation, you should carefully consider the
discussion of these and other factors in the section entitled "RISK FACTORS"
beginning on page __.

                  PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL DATA

     The following tables present selected historical financial data of Citadel,

shareited historical financial statements as of June 30, 2001 and for the six
months ended June 30, 2000 and 2001.  The selected historical financial data for
the six months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000 are unaudited and are derived from
the consolidated financial information included in Citadel's quarterly report on
Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2001; however, in the opinion of

             Craig Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Data
                    (In Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)

     The selected historical consolidated financial data of Craig have been
derived from the audited historical consolidated financial statements and
related notes of Craig for each of the years in the five-year period ended
December 31, 2000 and the unaudited consolidated financial statements for the
six months ended June 30, 2000 and 2001.  The selected historical financial data
for the six months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000 are unaudited and are derived
from the consolidated financial information included in the Craig's quarterly
report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2001, and, in the opinion of
Craig's management, contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring
adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation.  The historical consolidated
data are only a summary, and you should read them in conjunction with the
historical consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in the
annual and quarterly reports of Craig that have been furnished with this joint
proxy statement/prospectus.  Since October 1996, Craig has reported its
financial information on a consolidated basis with Reading.

        Selected Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Data
                   (In Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)

     The selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data of
Citadel are derived from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements, which give effect to the consolidation using the purchase method of
accounting, and should be read in conjunction with the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information for
Citadel gives effect to the consolidation, based on a preliminary allocation of
the total purchase cost.  The historical financial information has been derived
from the respective historical financial statements of Citadel, Craig and
Reading, and should be read in conjunction with these financial statements and
the related notes contained in the annual and quarterly reports of Citadel,
Craig and Reading that have been furnished with this joint proxy statement/
prospectus.

     Citadel will account for the consolidation as a purchase of Craig and
Reading using the purchase method of accounting.  Citadel will record the fair
value of the consideration given for Craig and Reading stock and for options to
purchase Craig and Reading stock assumed by Citadel, plus the amount of direct
transaction costs, as the cost of acquiring Craig and Reading.

     The total estimated purchase cost of the consolidation has been allocated
on a preliminary basis to Craig's and Reading's assets and liabilities based on
management's best estimates of their fair value.  We do not expect that any
significant amount of goodwill will result from our accounting for the
consolidation.  This allocation is subject to change pending a final analysis of
the total purchase cost and the fair value of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed.  The impact of such changes could be material.

     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data is presented for
illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating
results or financial position that would have occurred if the consolidation had
been consummated at the times indicated, nor is it necessarily indicative of
future operating results or financial condition of Citadel.

         COMPARATIVE HISTORICAL AND UNAUDITED PRO FORMA PER SHARE DATA

          The following table sets forth:

 .    Historical book value per share and historical net loss per share data of
     Citadel, Craig and Reading.

 .    Unaudited pro forma condensed combined book value per share and unaudited
     pro forma condensed combined net loss per share data of Citadel after
     giving effect to the consolidation.

 .    Unaudited pro forma equivalent condensed combined book value per share and
     unaudited pro forma equivalent condensed combined net loss per share data
     of Craig and Reading based on the conversion ratios of 1.17 shares of
     Citadel nonvoting common stock for each share of Craig common stock and
     common preference stock and 1.25 shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock
     for each share of Reading common stock.

          The information in the table should be read in conjunction with the
historical financial statements of Citadel, Craig and Reading and the related
notes contained in the annual and quarterly reports of Citadel, Craig and
Reading that have been furnished with this joint proxy statement/prospectus and
the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and related
notes included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.  The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data is not necessarily
indicative of the net loss per share or book value per share that would have
been achieved had the consolidation been consummated as of the beginning of the
periods presented and should not be construed as representative of these amounts
for any future dates or periods.

          The information in the table is only a summary and you should read it
in conjunction with the "UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS" beginning on page ____ and the audited and unaudited historical
financial statements of Citadel, Craig and Reading, including the notes thereto,
contained in the annual and quarterly reports that have been furnished with this
joint proxy statement/prospectus.

     The Craig pro forma equivalent per share amounts are calculated by
multiplying the Citadel pro forma amounts per nonvoting common share by the
fixed conversion ratio of 1.17 Citadel nonvoting shares for each share of Craig
common stock and common preference stock.

     The Reading pro forma equivalent per share amounts are calculated by
multiplying the Citadel pro forma amounts per nonvoting common share by the
fixed conversion ratio of 1.25 Citadel nonvoting shares for each share of
Reading common stock.

(1)  Historical book value per share is computed by dividing stockholders'
     equity, less goodwill and other intangible assets, by the number of shares
     of Craig common stock and common preference stock or Reading common stock,
     as the case may be, outstanding at December 31, 2000 and June 30, 2001.

(2)  The Craig pro forma equivalent per share amounts are calculated by
     multiplying the Citadel pro forma book value and net loss per share amounts
     by the conversion ratio of 1.17 shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock
     for each share of Craig common stock for each share of common stock and
     common preference stock.

(3)  Net of the stated value of outstanding preferred stock of Reading, plus
     accrued dividends.

(4)  The Reading pro forma equivalent per share amounts are calculated by
     multiplying Citadel pro forma book value and net loss per share amounts by
     the conversion ratio of 1.25 shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock for
     each share of Reading common stock.

(5)  The pro forma book value per share is computed by dividing pro forma
     stockholders' equity, less goodwill and other intangible assets, including
     the effect of pro forma adjustments, by the pro forma number of shares of
     Citadel nonvoting common stock and voting common stock which would have
     been outstanding had the consolidation been completed as of December 31,
     2000 or June 30, 2001.

                                 RISK FACTORS

     The consolidation involves a high degree of risk. By voting in favor or the
issuance of Citadel shares and the related consolidation proposals, Citadel
stockholders will, upon completion of the consolidation, be changing the overall
mix of Citadel's assets and liabilities which may involve a high degree of risk.
By voting in favor of the consolidation agreement, Craig and Reading
stockholders will be choosing to invest in Citadel nonvoting common stock.  An
investment in Citadel nonvoting common stock involves a high degree of risk.  In
addition to the other information contained in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus or the accompanying documents, you should carefully
consider the following risk factors in deciding whether to vote in favor of the
consolidation.

                      Risks Relating to the Consolidation

The consolidation will expose the current stockholders of Citadel, Craig and
Reading to the risks and liabilities of the other companies.

     The consolidation will, in effect, merge all of the assets and all of the
liabilities, including the potential contingent liabilities, of Citadel, Craig
and Reading.  Accordingly, after the consolidation, your investment will be
subject to all of the various business risks of such current and contingent
liabilities.  These include tax, litigation, currency and environmental risks,
as discussed in the annual and quarterly reports of Citadel, Craig and Reading
being furnished with this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

The market value of Citadel nonvoting common stock after the consolidation could
be less than the market values of Citadel, Craig or Reading before the
consolidation.

     Based on recent trading prices, shares of Craig common stock and common
preference stock and shares of Reading common stock have a greater market value
than the shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock to be received by Craig
stockholders and Reading stockholders in the consolidation.

You will receive a fixed number of shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock
despite any changes in the market values of Craig common stock and common
preference stock, Reading common stock or Citadel nonvoting common stock.

     Upon completion of the consolidation, each share of Craig common stock and
common preference stock will be automatically converted into the right to
receive 1.17 shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock, and each share of Reading
common stock will be automatically converted into the right to receive 1.25
shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock.  The boards of directors of the
companies have no discretion to unilaterally adjust these conversion ratios due
to changes in the market prices of Craig common stock or common preference
stock, Reading common stock or Citadel nonvoting common stock, or for other
reasons.  In addition, neither Craig, Reading nor Citadel may terminate the
consolidation agreement, or "walk away" from the consolidation, solely because
of changes in the market price of the stock of one or more of the companies.
The market prices of Craig common stock and common preference stock, Reading
common stock and Citadel nonvoting common stock are by nature subject to the
general price fluctuations in the market for publicly traded equity securities,
and you should obtain recent market quotations.  We cannot predict or give any
assurances as to the market price of Citadel nonvoting common stock before or
after the completion of the consolidation.

The consolidation could adversely affect combined financial results.

     Citadel, Craig and Reading expect to incur direct transaction costs of
approximately $600,000 in connection with the consolidation. If the benefits of
the consolidation do not exceed the costs associated with the consolidation,
including any dilution to Citadel stockholders resulting from the issuance of
shares of nonvoting common stock in the consolidation, the consolidated
company's financial results, including earnings per share, could be adversely
affected.

             Risks Relating to the Consolidated Company's Business

The consolidated company has only limited experience in the cinema, live theatre
and real estate development business.  Furthermore, its real estate activities
will be largely developmental in nature.

     Although the consolidated company's executives will include a number of
individuals with extensive experience in the cinema exhibition, live theater and
real estate businesses, the consolidated company, itself, will be a relatively
new entrant into these businesses. Reading has been in the cinema exhibition
business only since 1994, and has only been involved in Australia and New
Zealand since 1995 and 1997, respectively. Citadel has only been involved in the
cinema exhibition and live theater businesses since 2000. Craig and Citadel have
no experience in real estate development, and while Reading has in its past
developed commercial properties, it did not begin construction of its first
entertainment center until 1999. The consolidated company will face
competition in these markets from competitors with significantly greater
experience and financial and management resources.

Investments in the cinema exhibition, live theater and real estate businesses
each involve special risks.

     In the cinema exhibition business, the principal risks include the
availability and popularity of film product, the ability to obtain such film
product on reasonable terms and potentially ruinous competition from the
overbuilding of cinema markets.  In recent years, the cinema exhibition industry
has suffered greatly from increased costs of film and the overbuilding of
markets.  In the live theater business, the principal risks include the
availability and popularity of plays, the rising costs of production and
competition from other entertainment sources.  Both the cinema and live theater
industries are exposed to uncertainty as to the ultimate impact of government
regulation, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, on their businesses.
In the real estate business, the risks include leasing risk and market risks
related to the general demand for space in the markets in which the consolidated
company will own assets.

     Furthermore, a significant portion of initial assets of the consolidated
company will be invested in undeveloped land in Australia.  This land was
originally purchased by Reading as possible entertainment center locations and
does not currently provided any meaningful cash flow.  Accordingly, the
consolidated company will be exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership and
development of raw land.  These risks include the risks of obtaining necessary
permits and entitlements, the risks of construction and, thereafter, the risks
of sale or lease-up and operation.  Given the anticipated liquidity of the
consolidated company, it may be necessary for the consolidated company to incur
additional indebtedness, bring on partners or sell assets in order to develop
these properties.  Alternatively, the consolidated company may find it necessary
to either defer development of one or more of these properties or to sell these
non-cash flowing assets.

The consolidated company is likely to experience fluctuations in operating
results.

     Citadel, Craig and Reading have historically experienced substantial
fluctuations in operating results, on a quarterly and an annual basis.  These
fluctuations will likely continue for the consolidated company in the future.
Operating results for the consolidated company will be affected by a number of
factors, including, but not limited to:

 .    Delays in entering into leases or obtaining permits for new multiplex
     cinemas.

 .    Delays and other risks in the construction of the new cinemas.

 .    The time and availability of new film releases and level of acceptance by
     movie goers.

 .    The timing of sales of properties.

 .    The timing of investments.

 .    Delays in connection with the development and leasing of its commercial
     real estate.

 .    The opening of competing cinemas.

 .    The availability of plays for our theaters and level of acceptance by
     theater goers.

          The consolidated company's operating results also will be affected by
seasonal trends and by general conditions in the film exhibition and real estate
markets.  The third and fourth quarters generally have higher net sales levels
due to new film releases during the holiday season.  Because both Citadel's and
Reading's businesses and operating results have depended to a significant extent
on the general conditions in the film exhibition market, any adverse change in
that market could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated company's
business, financial condition and results of operations.  Citadel also has
experienced, and the consolidated company may experience, some degree of
seasonality due to fluctuations in the market for fruit produced by the
agriculture partnerships in which Citadel has an interest.

          We believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of the historical
financial results of Citadel, Craig and Reading are not necessarily meaningful
indicators of the consolidated company's future operating results, and you
should not rely on them as an indication of the consolidated company's future
performance. If the consolidated company's quarterly operating results fail to
meet the expectations of equity research analysts, the market prices of the
Citadel nonvoting common stock and voting common stock could be adversely
affected.

Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could result in currency
conversion losses.

          The bulk of our consolidated operations and assets will, immediately
after the consolidation, be located in Australia and New Zealand. Our business
plan for the consolidated company will be, at least initially, to use the
resources of the consolidated company principally to advance opportunities in
Australia and New Zealand. Accordingly, while the consolidated company's
operating results will be denominated in U.S. Dollars and while a significant
portion of the consolidated company's general and administrative expense and
cost of borrowing will be U.S.-based and paid in U.S. Dollars, the consolidated
company's operating revenues are likely to be denominated principally in
Australian Dollars and New Zealand Dollars. This means that the consolidated
company will be exposed to a considerable amount of currency risk, in the event
that the Australian Dollar and the New Zealand Dollar should continue their
slide against the U.S. Dollar. No assurances can be given as to the future
relative strength of the Australian Dollar, the New Zealand Dollar and the U.S.
Dollar. We do not currently contemplate using any hedging programs to protect
against risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.

The anticipated focus of the consolidated company on foreign operations poses
special risks.

          Most of the consolidated operations of Craig and Reading are located
abroad.  There are special risks attendant to doing business in foreign
countries.  For example, the acquisition of real property in Australia by
Reading is subject to the review and approval of that country's Foreign
Investment Review Board, which may impose restrictions or conditions on the
acquisition of real property by foreign corporations.  Also, the distance and
time differences between Los Angeles, the location of the executive offices of
each of the three companies, and Reading's operations in Australia and New
Zealand impose special challenges.

          Furthermore, Reading is, and the consolidated company will be, a
relatively new competitor in the Australian and New Zealand markets for cinema
exhibition and real estate development. In these markets, Reading is, and the
consolidated company will be, faced with substantial competition from more
established companies owned and operated in those local markets, which have
significantly greater financial assets than Reading and the consolidated
company.

The consolidated company will have concentrated ownership and control.

     At the present time, James J. Cotter beneficially owns a majority of the
outstanding voting power of Craig. Craig, in turn, holds a majority of the
voting power of Reading. Mr. Cotter, together with Craig and Reading, owns
approximately 49% of the voting power of Citadel. Although immediately following
the consolidation Mr. Cotter will control only slightly less than 25% of the
voting power of Citadel, his long-time partner, Mr. Michael Forman, also will
own slightly less than 25% of Citadel's voting power. Accordingly, these two
individuals, assuming they were to act in concert regarding the consolidated
company's matters, will effectively be in control of the consolidated company.
Also, since there will only be approximately 1,330,000 shares of Citadel voting
common stock outstanding immediately after the consolidation, Mr. Cotter and Mr.
Forman may be able, at a relatively modest cost, to increase their holdings to a
position of majority voting control. Furthermore, Mr. Cotter currently holds
options to purchase up to 635,232 shares of Reading common stock at the
weighted-average exercise price of $13.30 per share and up to 594,940 shares of
Craig common stock at the weighted-average exercise price of $5.92 per share. If
Mr. Cotter elects to have his Reading stock options and Craig stock options
converted into options to purchase Citadel voting common stock in the
consolidation, he would hold options to purchase up to 1,490,120 shares of
Citadel voting common stock, or 52.7% of the outstanding shares of Citadel
voting common stock assuming his stock options were exercised in full, at the
weighted-average exercise price of $8.03 per share. Taking into account his
current stock holdings, after voting into effect the exercise of his Citadel
stock options as well, this would give Mr. Cotter total beneficial
ownership of 64.3% of the voting power of Citadel.

     Mr. Cotter is also the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of each of
Citadel, Craig and Reading, and it is currently anticipated that he will be the
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the consolidated company.  Mr. Cotter
has advised us that he views his equity interest in each of the three companies
as a long-term family investment, and his daughters, Margaret Cotter and Ellen
Cotter, currently are actively involved as directors and officers or consultants
of the three companies and their affiliates.  It is anticipated that these
relationships will continue after the consolidation.  The interests of Mr.
Cotter and his family may differ from the interests of public stockholders.

The nonvoting common stock will likely be subject to price and volume
fluctuations which may prevent stockholders from reselling their shares at or
above the price at which they purchased their shares.

     Fluctuations in the price and trading volume of Citadel's nonvoting common
stock may prevent stockholders from reselling their shares above the price at
which they purchased their shares. Stock prices and trading volumes for many
companies fluctuate widely for a number of reasons, including some reasons which
may be unrelated to their businesses or results of operations. This market
volatility, as well as general domestic or international economic, market and
political conditions, could materially adversely affect the market price of
Citadel's nonvoting common stock without regard to operating performance. In
addition, operating results may be below the expectations of public market
analysts and investors. If this were to occur, the market price of Citadel's
nonvoting common stock would likely significantly decrease.

               consolidation agreement among Citadel, Craig and Reading, dated
               as of August 17, 2001, under which Craig and Reading will each

               owned subsidiary of Citadel.

          .    To consider and vote upon a related proposal to amend Citadel's
               stock option plan to increase the related number of shares of
               Citadel common stock reserved for issuance under the plan from
               666,000 to 1,600,000 upon completion of the consolidation.

          .    To consider and vote upon a related proposal to adopt an

          .    To conduct such other business as may properly come before the
               annual meeting.

     The Citadel board does not expect any other business to come before the
annual meeting.

     The consolidation agreement is included as ANNEX A to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.  The amendment to Citadel's stock option plan is attached
as ANNEX C to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the amendment to
Citadel's articles of incorporation is attached as ANNEX D to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.  The form of Citadel indemnification agreement is attached
as ANNEX E to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Record Date and Outstanding Shares

     Citadel's board of directors has fixed the close of business on September
21, 2001, as the record date for the annual meeting. Only holders of record of
Citadel voting common stock at the close of business on the record date are
entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting. As of the close of business on
September 21, 2001, there were ______________ shares of Citadel voting common
stock outstanding and entitled to vote, held of record by approximately ____
stockholders, although Citadel has been informed that there are in excess of
_______ beneficial owners.

Vote and Quorum Required

     Holders of Citadel voting common stock are entitled to one vote for each
share held as of the record date. Approval of the proposals to approve the
issuance of Citadel shares in connection with the consolidation and the related
amendment to Citadel's stock option plan and the separate proposal to ratify and
approve the form of Citadel indemnification agreement, each requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding Citadel voting common stock
represented and voted at the Citadel annual meeting. The adoption of the
amendment to Citadel's articles of incorporation to change the name of Citadel
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Citadel voting common stock. In the election of directors, the
directors receiving a plurality of the votes cast at the annual meeting will be
elected. Attendance at the meeting in person or by proxy of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Citadel voting common stock is required for a quorum.

     James J. Cotter, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Citadel,
together with Craig and Reading, owns approximately 49% of the outstanding
shares of Citadel voting common stock. Under the consolidation agreement, Mr.
Cotter, Craig and Reading are obligated under the consolidation agreement to
vote their shares in favor of the issuance of Citadel shares in connection with
the consolidation and related matters. As a result, they are expected to
determine the outcome of the vote on these matters at the annual meeting.

Abstentions; Broker Non-Votes

     Abstentions will be included in determining the number of shares present at
the annual meeting for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum for
the transaction of business, but will have no effect on the outcome of voting on
the proposals other than the proposal to adopt the amendment to Citadel's
articles of incorporation.

     If a broker, bank, custodian, nominee or other record holder of Citadel
voting common stock indicates on a proxy that it does not have discretionary
authority to vote certain shares on a particular matter, which is called a
broker non-vote, those shares will not be considered for purposes of determining
the number of shares entitled to vote with respect to a particular proposal on
which the broker has expressly not voted. These shares will be counted for
purposes of determining the presence of a quorum, but will have no effect on the
outcome of voting on the proposals other than the proposal to adopt the
amendment to Citadel's articles of incorporation. As to the proposal to adopt
the amendment to Citadel's articles of incorporation, these broker non-votes
will have the same effect as a vote against adoption of the proposal.

Expenses of Proxy Solicitation

     Citadel, Craig and Reading will share the expenses of soliciting proxies
from the stockholders of all three companies to be voted at the joint meetings
of Citadel, Craig and Reading. Following the original mailing of the proxies and
other soliciting materials, Citadel and its agents also may solicit proxies by
mail, telephone, facsimile or in person. Following the original mailing of the
proxies and other soliciting materials, Citadel will request brokers,
custodians, nominees and other record holders of Citadel voting common stock to
forward copies of the proxy and other soliciting materials to persons for whom
they hold shares of Citadel

voting common stock and to request authority for the exercise of proxies. In
such cases, upon the request of the record holders, Citadel will reimburse such
holders for their reasonable expenses.

Proxies

     The Citadel proxy accompanying this joint proxy statement/prospectus is
solicited on behalf of the Citadel board of directors for use at the annual
meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof. Please complete, date and
sign the accompanying Citadel proxy and promptly return it in the enclosed
envelope or otherwise mail it to Citadel. All properly signed Citadel proxies
that Citadel receives prior to the vote at the annual meeting and that are not
revoked will be voted at the meeting according to the instructions indicated on
the proxies or, if no direction is indicated, will be voted FOR approval of each
of the matters to be voted on as described in this joint proxy

Citadel proxy at any time before it is exercised at the annual meeting by taking
any of the following actions:

          .    Delivering a written notice to the secretary of Citadel by any
means, including facsimile, bearing a date later than the date of the proxy,
stating that the proxy is revoked.

          .    Signing and delivering a proxy relating to the same shares and
bearing a later date prior to the vote at the meeting.

          .    Attending the meeting and voting in person, although attendance
at the meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy. Please note, however, that
if your shares are held of record by a broker, bank or other nominee and you
wish to vote at the annual meeting, you must bring to the meeting a letter from
the broker, bank or other nominee confirming your beneficial ownership of the
shares.

     Citadel's board of directors does not know of any matter that is not
referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus to be presented for action
at the annual meeting. If any other matters are properly brought before the
meeting, the persons named in the proxies will have discretion to vote on such
matters in accordance with their best judgment.

No Dissenters' or Appraisal Rights

     Under Nevada law, Citadel stockholders have no dissenters' or appraisal
rights in connection with the issuance of Citadel nonvoting common stock
pursuant to the consolidation agreement.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors as to the Consolidation

     The conflicts committee of the Citadel board of directors, consisting
entirely of independent directors, unanimously recommended that the board
authorize and approve the issuance of Citadel nonvoting common stock in the
consolidation. After careful consideration, the board of directors of Citadel
unanimously approved the issuance and determined that the terms of the
consolidation agreement and the consolidation are fair to and in the best
interests of Citadel and the stockholders of Citadel. Accordingly, the Citadel
board of directors recommends that Citadel stockholders vote FOR the proposal to
approve the issuance of Citadel nonvoting common stock in the consolidation.

TO ASSURE THAT YOUR CITADEL SHARES ARE REPRESENTED AT THE JOINT MEETINGS, PLEASE
COMPLETE, DATE AND SIGN THE ENCLOSED CITADEL PROXY AND MAIL IT PROMPTLY IN THE
POSTAGE-PAID ENVELOPE PROVIDED, WHETHER OR NOT YOU PLAN TO ATTEND THE JOINT
MEETINGS. YOU MAY REVOKE YOUR PROXY AT ANY TIME BEFORE IT IS VOTED. RETURNING

YOUR CITADEL SHARES IN PERSON. IF YOUR SHARES ARE HELD IN AN ACCOUNT AT A
BROKERAGE FIRM OR BANK, YOU MUST INSTRUCT THEM HOW TO VOTE YOUR SHARES.

                           THE CRAIG SPECIAL MEETING

     This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being furnished to you in
connection with the solicitation of Craig proxies by Craig's board of directors
for use at the special meeting of Craig stockholders called in connection with
the proposed consolidation of Craig and Reading with Citadel, and at any
adjournment or postponement thereof.

Date, Time and Place of Craig's Special Meeting

     The Craig special meeting will be held jointly with the annual meeting of
stockholders of Citadel and special meeting of stockholders of Reading. The
date, time and place of the joint meetings are as follows:

                                October 24, 2001
                            10:00 a.m., Pacific time

                            ________________________
                            ________________________
                            ____________, California

Purpose of the Special Meeting

     The special meeting of Craig stockholders is being held for the sole
purpose of considering and voting upon the proposal to approve the consolidation
agreement, dated as of August 17, 2001, among Craig, Citadel and Reading, and to
approve Craig's merger with a wholly owned subsidiary of Citadel. Under Craig's
bylaws, no matter that is not referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus can be presented for action at the special meeting.

     The consolidation agreement is included as ANNEX A to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. If the consolidation agreement is approved, among other
things, upon completion of the consolidation each outstanding share of Craig
common stock and common preference stock will be automatically converted into
the right to receive 1.17 shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock.

Record Date and Outstanding Shares

     Craig's board of directors has fixed the close of business on September 21,
2001, as the record date for the special meeting. Only holders of record of
Craig common stock and common preference stock at the close of business on the
record date are entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting. As of the
close of business on September 21, 2001, there were ______________ shares of
Craig common stock and ________ shares of common preference stock outstanding
and entitled to vote, held of record by approximately ____ stockholders and ____
stockholders, respectively.

Vote and Quorum Required

     Holders of Craig's common stock are entitled to 30 votes and holders of
Craig common preference stock are entitled to one vote for each share held as of
the record date. Approval of the proposal to approve the consolidation agreement
and the Craig merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the total voting power of the outstanding common stock and common preference
stock of Craig, voting as a single class. Attendance at the meeting in person or
by proxy of a majority of the outstanding voting power of Craig is required for
a quorum.

     James J. Cotter, the Chairman of Craig, owns or is entitled to vote shares
of Craig common stock and common preference stock representing a majority of the
total voting power of the outstanding common stock and common preference stock
of Craig. Under the consolidation agreement, Mr. Cotter is obligated to vote
these shares in favor of the consolidation agreement and the Craig merger, so
this proposal is expected to be approved at the special meeting without regard
to the vote of the other stockholders. As discussed elsewhere

in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the stockholders of Citadel and of
Reading also are expected to approve the consolidation agreement and related
proposals at the joint meetings.

Abstentions; Broker Non-Votes

     Abstentions will be included in determining the number of shares present
and voting at the meeting for the purpose of determining the presence of a
quorum for the transaction of business and will have the same effect as votes
against the proposal to approve the consolidation agreement and the Craig
merger. If a broker, bank, custodian, nominee or other record holder of Craig
common stock or common preference stock indicates on a proxy that it does not
have discretionary authority to vote certain shares on a particular matter,
which is called a broker non-vote, those shares also will be counted for
purposes of determining the presence of a quorum and will have the same effect
as a vote against the proposal to approve the consolidation agreement and the
Craig merger.

Expenses of Proxy Solicitation

     Craig, Citadel and Reading will share the expenses of soliciting proxies
from the stockholders of all three companies to be voted at the joint meetings
of Citadel, Craig and Reading. Following the original mailing of the proxies and
other soliciting materials, Craig and its agents also may solicit proxies by
mail, telephone, facsimile or in person. Following the original mailing of the
proxies and other soliciting materials, Craig will request brokers, custodians,
nominees and other record holders of Craig common stock and common preference
stock to forward copies of the proxy and other soliciting materials to persons
for whom they hold shares of Craig common stock or common preference stock and
to request authority for the exercise of proxies. In such cases, upon the
request of the record holders, Craig will reimburse such holders for their
reasonable expenses.

Proxies

     The Craig proxy accompanying this joint proxy statement/prospectus is
solicited on behalf of the Craig board of directors for use at the special
meeting and any postponement or adjournment thereof. Please complete, date and
sign the accompanying Craig proxy and promptly return it in the enclosed
envelope or otherwise mail it to Craig. All properly signed Craig proxies that
Craig receives prior to the vote at the meeting and that are not revoked will be
voted at the meeting according to the instructions indicated on the proxies or,
if no direction is indicated, will be voted FOR approval of the consolidation
agreement and the Craig merger. You may revoke your proxy at any time before it
is exercised at the meeting by taking any of the following actions:

          .    Delivering a written notice to the secretary of Craig by any
means, including facsimile, bearing a date later than the date of the proxy,
stating that the proxy is revoked.

          .    Signing and delivering a proxy relating to the same shares and
bearing a later date prior to the vote at the meeting.

          .    Attending the meeting and voting in person, although attendance
at the meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy. Please note, however, that
if your shares are held of record by a broker, bank or other nominee and you
wish to vote at the meeting, you must bring to the meeting a letter from the
broker, bank or other nominee confirming your beneficial ownership of the
shares.

You should not send in any stock certificates with your Craig proxy. A
transmittal form with instructions for the surrender of stock certificates for
shares of Citadel will be mailed to you as soon as practicable after completion
of the consolidation.

No Dissenters' Rights

     Under Nevada law, there are no dissenters' or appraisal rights in
connection with the consolidation or the Craig merger.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors

     The conflicts committee of the Craig board of directors, consisting
entirely of independent directors, unanimously recommended that the board
authorize and approve the consolidation.  The board of directors of Craig
unanimously determined that the terms of the consolidation agreement and the
consolidation are fair to and in the best interests of Craig and the
stockholders of Craig.  Accordingly, the Craig board of directors recommends
that Craig stockholders vote FOR the proposal to approve the consolidation
agreement and the Craig merger.

                          THE READING SPECIAL MEETING

     This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being furnished to you in
connection with the solicitation of proxies by Reading's board of directors for
use at the special meeting of Reading stockholders called in connection with the
proposed consolidation of Reading and Craig with Citadel, and at any
postponement or adjournment thereof.

Date, Time and Place of Reading's Special Meeting

     The Reading special meeting will be held jointly with the annual meeting of
stockholders of Citadel and special meeting of stockholders of Craig. The date,
time and place of the joint meetings are as follows:

                                October 24, 2001
                            10:00 a.m., Pacific time

                             _______________________
                             _______________________
                             ___________, California

Purpose of the Special Meeting

     The special meeting of Reading stockholders is being held for the sole
purpose of considering and voting upon the proposal to approve the consolidation
agreement, dated as of August 17, 2001, among Reading, Citadel and Craig, and to
approve Reading's merger with a wholly owned subsidiary of Citadel. Under
Reading's bylaws, no matter that is not referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus can be presented for action at the special meeting.

     The consolidation agreement is included as ANNEX A to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. If the consolidation agreement is approved, among other
things, upon completion of the consolidation each outstanding share of Reading
common stock will be automatically converted into the right to receive 1.25
shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock. By approving the consolidation
agreement, Reading common stockholders also will be deemed to have approved a
change in Reading's name to "Reading Holdings, Inc."

Record Date and Outstanding Shares

     Reading's board of directors has fixed the close of business on September
21, 2001, as the record date for the special meeting. Only holders of record of
Reading common stock and preferred stock at the close of business on the record
date are entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting. As of the close of
business on September 21, 2001, there were ______________ shares of Reading
common stock outstanding and entitled to vote, held of record by approximately
____ stockholders, although Reading has been informed that there are in excess
of _____ beneficial owners. As of the close of business on September 21, 2001,
there were 70,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 550,000 shares of
Series B Preferred Stock outstanding, which shares were held by Citadel and
Craig, respectively.

Vote and Quorum Required

     Holders of Reading common stock are entitled to one vote for each share
held as of the record date. Holders of Reading preferred stock are entitled to
9.64 votes per share. Approval of the proposal to approve the consolidation
agreement and the Reading merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of
a majority of the total voting power of the outstanding common stock and
preferred stock of Reading, voting as a single class. Attendance at the meeting
in person or by proxy of a majority of the outstanding voting power of Reading
common stock and preferred stock is required for a quorum.

     Craig owns a majority of the total voting power of the outstanding Reading
common stock and preferred stock. Under the consolidation agreement, Craig is
obligated to vote these shares in favor of the consolidation agreement and the
Reading merger, so this proposal is expected to be approved at the special
meeting without regard to the vote of the other stockholders. As discussed
elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the stockholders of Citadel
and of Craig also are expected to approve the consolidation agreement and
related matters at the joint meetings.

Abstentions; Broker Non-Votes

     Abstentions will be included in determining the number of shares present
and voting at the meeting for the purpose of determining the presence of a
quorum for the transaction of business and will have the same effect as votes
against the proposal to approve the consolidation agreement and the Reading
merger. If a broker, bank, custodian, nominee or other record holder of Reading
common stock indicates on a proxy that it does not have discretionary authority
to vote certain shares on a particular matter, which is called a broker non-
vote, those shares also will be counted for purposes of determining the presence
of a quorum and will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to
approve the consolidation agreement and the Craig merger.

Expenses of Proxy Solicitation

     Reading, Citadel and Craig will share the expenses of soliciting proxies
from the stockholders of all three companies to be voted at the joint meetings
of Citadel, Craig and Reading. Following the original mailing of the proxies and
other soliciting materials, Reading and its agents also may solicit proxies by
mail, telephone, facsimile or in person. Following the original mailing of the
proxies and other soliciting materials, Reading will request brokers,
custodians, nominees and other record holders of Reading common stock to forward
copies of the proxy and other soliciting materials to persons for whom they hold
shares of Reading common stock and to request authority for the exercise of
proxies. In such cases, upon the request of the record holders, Reading will
reimburse such holders for their reasonable expenses.

Proxies

     The Reading proxy accompanying this joint proxy statement/prospectus is
solicited on behalf of the Reading board of directors for use at the special
meeting and at any adjournment or postponement thereof. Please complete, date
and sign the accompanying Reading proxy and promptly return it in the enclosed
envelope or otherwise mail it to Reading. All properly signed Reading proxies
that Reading receives prior to the vote at the meeting and that are not revoked
will be voted at the meeting according to the instructions indicated on the
proxies or, if no direction is indicated, will be voted FOR approval of the
consolidation agreement and the Reading merger. You may revoke your proxy at any
time before it is exercised at the meeting by taking any of the following
actions:

          .    Delivering a written notice to the secretary of Reading by any
means, including facsimile, bearing a date later than the date of the proxy,
stating that the proxy is revoked.

          .    Signing and delivering a proxy relating to the same shares and
bearing a later date prior to the vote at the meeting.

          .    Attending the meeting and voting in person, although attendance
at the meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy. Please note, however, that
if your shares are held of record by a broker, bank or other nominee and you
wish to vote at the meeting, you must bring to the meeting a letter from the
broker, bank or other nominee confirming your beneficial ownership of the
shares.

You should not send in any stock certificates with your Reading proxy. A
transmittal form with instructions for the surrender of stock certificates for
shares of Citadel will be mailed to you as soon as practicable after completion
of the consolidation.

No Dissenters' Rights

     Under Nevada law, there are no dissenters' or appraisal rights in
connection with the consolidation or the Reading merger.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors

     The conflicts committee of the Reading board of directors, consisting of an
independent director, recommended that the board approve the conversion ratio of
1.25 shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock for each share of Reading common
stock provided for in the consolidation agreement. The board of directors of
Reading unanimously determined that the conversion ratio and other terms of the
consolidation are fair to and in the best interests of Reading and the
stockholders of Reading. Accordingly, the Reading board of directors recommends
that Reading stockholders vote FOR the proposal to approve the consolidation
agreement and the Reading merger.

                               THE CONSOLIDATION

     This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes the proposed
consolidation. While we believe that the description covers the material terms
of the consolidation and related transactions, this summary may not contain all
of the information that is important to you. You should carefully read this
entire joint proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents we refer to for
a more complete understanding of the consolidation.

     Important business and financial information about Citadel, Craig and
Reading is contained in the annual reports and quarterly reports of Citadel,
Craig and Reading being furnished with this joint proxy statement/prospectus or
in other documents incorporated in this joint proxy statement/prospectus by
reference. You may obtain any documents incorporated by reference in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus that are not being delivered with this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, without charge, by following the instructions in the
section entitled "DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE" that begins on page ___
of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Background of the Consolidation

     Citadel, Craig and Reading have substantially overlapping management and
ownership. While the three companies operate essentially as a group of related
companies, they are separate and distinct companies and, as such, have separate
SEC reporting obligations, file separate tax returns with the IRS, and have
their own boards of directors, including one or more independent directors. We
have attempted to operate efficiently given this three-company structure, by
among other things, consolidating the general and administrative functions of
the three companies at the Craig level and in common offices located in Los
Angeles. However, the three-company structure necessarily results in certain
inefficiencies and increased costs. In our view, among the detriments of the
current structure are the following:

          .    The need for and cost of three separate outside audits.

          .    The need for and cost of filing separate SEC reports and separate
tax returns for each of the three companies.

          .    The need for and cost of maintaining three separate boards of
directors, each with at least one or more separate independent directors, and of
holding separate board meetings and annual stockholder meetings for each of the
three companies.

          .    Inefficiencies resulting from the need to maintain separate books
and records for three public companies, and to institute and maintain procedural
safeguards to protect the interests of the separate minority interests in each
of the three companies.

          .    The relative illiquidity of the common equity of the three
companies, when compared to the liquidity that would be offered if all of the
common equity of the three companies were traded as a single common security.

          .    Difficulties in explaining to the capital markets the companies'
business plan and story on a company-by-company basis, as opposed to a
consolidated basis, and the interrelations between the ownership, businesses and
management of the three companies.

          .    The difficulties of matching the available assets with the
available opportunities of the three companies on a company-by-company basis, as
opposed to a consolidated basis.

     No doubt recognizing these difficulties in operating in a three-company
structure, our stockholders increasingly have expressed the view that it would
be in the best interests of the three companies and their respective
stockholders to combine the companies into a single public company. Also, as the
stock prices of the Craig common stock, Craig common preference stock and
Reading common stock began to decline, there was a substantial risk that one or
more of the companies' securities would be delisted from trading on the stock
exchanges on which they trade.

     Beginning last year, we began a comprehensive consideration of various
means to combine the assets and operations of two or more of the three companies
into one publicly traded company. We considered a variety of transaction
structures, but focused primarily on the following:

          .    A merger of equals consolidation, in which all of the current
holders of the common equity of the three companies would end up owning common
stock of a single publicly traded parent company.

          .    A merger of equals transaction limited to only two of the three
companies and which would result in two, rather than the current three, public
companies.

          .    The purchase of the minority interests in one or more of the
companies for cash, for notes, for preferred stock, and/or for some combination
of cash, notes and/or preferred stock.

          .    The merger or combination of one or more of the companies with
another public company - National Auto Credit, Inc.

          .    In developing the proposed consolidation, we considered, among
other things:

          .    The benefits and detriments to public stockholders of the various
possible transactions.

          .    The expressed interest of our controlling stockholder, Mr. James
J. Cotter, that he and his family retain a significant control interest in the
combined company.

          .    The capital needs and capital resources of the three companies,
both on an individual and on a combined basis.

          .    The respective business opportunities available to the three
companies, both on an individual and on a combined basis.

          .    The tax attributes and tax assets of the three companies, both on
an individual and on a consolidated basis.

          .    The respective transaction costs of the various alternatives.

     In refining this analysis, we determined that we should focus on developing
a transaction which satisfied each of the following guidelines:

          .    No stockholder should be involuntarily cashed out.

          .    Given the capital and liquidity needs of the three companies, no
leverage, either in the form of debt or preferred stock, should be taken on to
bring about the transaction.

          .    All three companies should be combined under a single public
company.

          .    The current control position of Mr. Cotter should not be
adversely affected, without his approval.

          .    All stockholders should, to the extent possible, receive the same
consideration in the transaction.

          .    The existing tax attributes and tax benefits of the three
companies should, to the extent possible, be preserved.

     At the meetings of the boards of directors of Citadel, Craig and Reading
held on March 15, 2001, we presented to the boards a proposal for a merger of
equals consolidation transaction, in which Craig and Reading would be merged
with subsidiaries of Citadel and in which all of the holders of the common
equity of Craig and Reading would receive the same form of consideration -
Citadel nonvoting common stock - in exchange for their Craig common stock, Craig
common preference stock and Reading common stock. We noted, among other things,
that such a consolidation would:

          .    Simplify the day-to-day administration of the three companies,
thereby reducing general and administrative expense.

          .    Remove, from the point of view of the public stockholders of the
combined company, the potential for conflicts-of-interest as between the three
companies and the need for board involvement in transactions which would, but
for the conflict-of-interest element, be immaterial or otherwise in the ordinary
course of business of the three companies.

          .    Result in a single combined company that should be easier to
understand from the point of view of outside investors.

          .    Result in a publicly held security with a greater public float
and, hopefully, greater liquidity than the various public securities of the
individual companies.

     We estimated that the fully phased-in annual cost savings will be at least
$1 million. We also discussed with the directors the benefits that could
potentially be achieved by bringing together the combined capital resources and
the combined opportunities of the three companies together under a single public
entity.

     Following discussion of the proposed transaction, the board of directors of
each of Citadel, Craig and Reading determined that such a merger of equals
transaction would be in the best interests of their respective companies and
stockholders, so long as the allocation of ownership of the combined company
among the stockholders of the three companies was fair. In light of the
overlapping management and membership of the boards of directors of the three
companies, each of the boards of directors delegated the proposal to their
respective conflicts committees for further review and action. The board of
directors of Citadel and Craig each unanimously resolved that our proposal for
the consolidation of Citadel, Craig and Reading be delegated to their respective
conflicts committees to review and take such action as their respective
conflicts committees determined to be appropriate with respect to the
consolidation proposal and to make a recommendation to the full board of
directors as to an appropriate structure for and conversion ratio for the
transaction, and that their respective conflicts committees be authorized to
retain such professional advisors as they may, in their respective discretion,
require to carry out such delegated authority, including, without limitation,
the retention of attorneys, appraisers and financial advisors. The board of
directors of Reading unanimously resolved that our proposal for the
consolidation of Citadel, Craig and Reading be delegated to its conflicts
committee to review and take such action as it determined to be appropriate with
respect to the consolidation proposal and to make a recommendation to the full
board of directors as to an appropriate conversion ratio for the transaction,
and that the conflicts committee be authorized to retain such professional
advisors as it may, in its discretion, require to carry out such delegated
authority, including attorneys, appraisers and financial advisors.

     We did not propose, and accordingly no consideration was given by the
directors of the three companies, to the possible sale of any one or more of the
companies, or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of any one or
more of the companies, or of any other type transaction which would involve a
change of control of any of the companies. The consolidation transaction
proposed by us, and delegated to the conflicts

committees for further review and consideration, was as a merger of equals in
which all common stockholders of Citadel, Craig and Reading would continue as
stockholders of the consolidated company and share in the benefits and synergies
and risks of such a consolidation.

     On March 20, 2001, the three companies filed a joint press release
disclosing the action of their respective boards of directors with respect to
our consolidation proposal. At the time of the delegation, the conflicts
committees were comprised of the following independent directors: Craig, Messrs.
William Gould (Chairman) and Gerard Laheney; Citadel, Messrs. William Soady
(Chairman) and Alfred Villasenor; and Reading, Messrs. Kenneth McCormick
(Chairman) and John Hunter. Mr. Hunter subsequently resigned from the Board of
Directors of Reading and, consequently, from the Reading conflicts committee due
to his decision to accept a consulting position with a competitor of Reading.
Accordingly, the Reading conflict committee proceeded as a committee of one.

     During the week following the delegation, the conflicts committees each
retained separate legal counsel. The Citadel conflicts committee retained Kummer
Kaempfer Bonner & Renshaw, a law firm that has represented the Citadel conflicts
committee in prior matters. The Craig conflicts committee retained Troy & Gould
Professional Corporation, which has represented Craig from time to time in a
variety of matters. The Reading conflicts committee retained Jones Vargas, a law
firm not previously retained by Reading, the Reading conflicts committee, Craig,
Citadel or any of their respective affiliates, but a firm experienced in
representing the boards of directors of companies organized, like Reading, under
the laws of Nevada.

     During this time period, Mr. S. Craig Tompkins worked with the Chairmen of
the conflicts committees and with counsel for the various committees to identify
possible financial advisors to assist the conflicts committees and to develop
the parameters of the work to be done and the advice to be given by any such
financial advisor or advisors. Among the matters discussed with the conflict
committees and their respective counsel were the benefits and detriments of
selecting a single financial advisor to provide expert advice as to the value of
the three companies and to recommend conversion ratios which would be fair to
the public stockholders of the three companies. During these discussions, it was
noted that:

          .    The members of the conflicts committees were already familiar
with the assets and businesses of the three companies, due to the overlapping
ownership of the three companies.

          .    Since the transaction being considered was a merger of equals and
not a sale, the focus should be upon achieving a fair allocation of the
ownership of the consolidated company, rather than on the negotiation of a
possible sale or cash-out price. Accordingly, what the members of the conflicts
committee needed particularly was advice as to the fair allocation of ownership
of the consolidated company among the stockholders of the three companies.

          .    To retain three financial advisors would likely be prohibitably
expensive, given the limited resources of the three companies.

          .    Each conflicts committee would have the right to obtain
additional expert advice from other advisors if a single financial advisor were
retained on a joint basis and if any conflict committee needed or wanted
separate advice.

     Ultimately, it was determined by the members of the conflict committees
that they would engage a single financial advisor to represent the three
conflict committees. Thereafter, requests for proposal were sent to ten firms,
resulting in nine written engagement proposals. Mr. Tompkins interviewed, in
person or by telephone, each of the firms submitting proposals. Mr. Matyczynski
participated in a number of these interviews, but was unable to participate in
all of the interviews due to schedule conflicts. None of the potential advisors
interviewed expressed any material concern about the joint nature of the
engagement, and each advisor indicated during the interviews that it was
comfortable with proceeding on the basis of such a joint representation and was
prepared to proceed on that basis.

     On April 23, 2001, the Chairmen of the conflicts committees met with
Messrs. Tompkins and Matyczynski to review the proposals received, and to
discuss again the benefits and detriments of engaging a single financial advisor
to jointly represent the three conflict committees. Messrs. Tompkins and
Matyczynski gave their views as to the strengths and weaknesses of the various
proposals and recommended, from management's point of view, that a single
advisor be retained to represent the committees on a joint basis. Following
discussion, and a review of the various proposals, it was determined that
Marshall & Stevens, Incorporated should be invited to make a personal
presentation to the full membership of the three conflict committees and their
respective counsel, for the position of joint financial advisor to the three
conflict committees.

     On May 3, 2001, the full membership of the three conflicts committees met,
together with their counsel and Messrs. Tompkins and Matyczynski to receive the
Marshall & Stevens presentation. During this presentation, representatives of
Marshall & Stevens discussed their background and experience, the work they
would do in order to be in a position to advise the conflicts committees with
respect to the matters set out in the request for proposals, and the procedures
and methodologies that they would apply, and responded to questions. Marshall &
Stevens specifically advised the members of the conflicts committees that it was
appropriate for Marshall & Stevens to be engaged jointly by the three conflicts
committees, and that this would not affect the work that they would be doing or
the advice that they would be giving. Prior to and following the presentation,
the conflicts committees met both jointly and separately, and following
discussion and consultation with counsel, determined to jointly engage Marshall
& Stevens. For a further discussion of the terms and scope of the engagement,
see "Arrangements with Financial Advisor" below.

     On June 21, 2001, the full membership of the three conflicts committees
met, together with their counsel and Messrs. Tompkins and Matyczynski, to
receive the report and advice of Marshall & Stevens. At this meeting, Marshall &
Stevens reviewed the work they had done and the procedures and methodologies
that they had applied in preparing their advice, responded to questions, and
advised the members of the conflicts committees that, in their preliminary
opinion:

          .  The consolidation transaction was in the best interests of the
three companies and their stockholders.

          .  The holders of Craig and Reading common equity securities should
all receive the same form of consideration in the consolidation transaction.

          .  The holders of Craig common stock and Craig common preference stock
should receive the same per share value in the consolidation transaction.

          .  Conversion ratios of 1.16 shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock
for each share of Craig common stock and Craig common preference stock and 1.27
shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock for each share of Reading common stock
would be fair to the public stockholders of each of the three companies from a
financial point of view.

     Following the presentation, the conflicts committees met with counsel and
directed certain additional requests for information and advice to Marshall &
Stevens and to management, to which Marshall & Stevens and management responded,
and met separately with Marshall & Stevens and members of management. Also, the
Chairmen of the conflicts committees had various discussions among themselves.

     During the week of July 12, 2001, Marshall & Stevens updated their
preliminary analysis to July 11, 2001, and issued a revised report. In this
report, Marshall & Stevens concluded that, updating their information, they now
recommended conversion ratios of 1.17 shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock
for each share of Craig common stock and Craig common preference stock and 1.25
shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock for each share of Reading common stock.

     On July 17, 2001, the boards of directors of Craig and Reading each met,
and on July 18, 2001, the board of directors of Citadel met, to consider the
reports of management, their respective conflicts committees and Marshall &
Stevens with respect to the proposed consolidation transaction and to consider a
proposed form of agreement in principle, prepared by Mr. Tompkins in
consultation with counsel for the respective conflict committees. At its meeting
on July 17, beginning at approximately 10:00 a.m., the Craig board of directors
was advised by management that it recommended a merger of equals transaction
structured as mergers of newly-formed subsidiaries of Citadel with Craig and
Reading. Messrs. Tompkins and Matyczynski reviewed the benefits and detriments
of the transaction with the board of directors, and Mr. Tompkins reviewed with
the directors on a section-by-section basis the terms of the proposed agreement
in principle. Mr. Tompkins further advised the directors that there had not
been, insofar as management was aware, any material change in circumstances with
respect to any of the three companies, or their subsidiaries, which had not been
previously communicated to Marshall & Stevens, that management was not proposing
any sale or change of control transaction, and that no offers or expressions of
interest had been solicited or received by management from any third party
concerning any extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, or acquisition of
all or any substantial portion of the assets of any one or more of the
companies). Mr. Tompkins also reviewed with the directors the letter that had
been received from the New York Stock Exchange regarding the failure of Craig to
satisfy the New York Stock Exchange criteria for the continued listing on that
exchange of the Craig common stock and Craig common preference stock, and
updated the directors on his conversations with the New York Stock Exchange on
this issue. Mr. Tompkins told the directors that he had reviewed with the New
York Stock Exchange the proposed consolidation transaction and that he had been
orally advised by representatives of the New York Stock Exchange that the
Exchange would not take action to delist Craig's common stock and common
preference stock while that transaction was pending, assuming that the
transaction moved forward expeditiously.

     Following the presentation by management, the Craig conflicts committee
made its recommendation to the Craig board of directors. Relying on the advice
of Marshall & Stevens, the Craig conflicts committee recommended that the
consolidation transaction be structured as a merger of equals, with Citadel
being the surviving entity, as set forth in the proposed agreement in principle,
that the holders of Craig common stock and common preference stock receive the
same value per share in the consolidation transaction, and that the conversion
ratios be 1.17 shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock for each share of Craig
common stock and Craig common preference stock and 1.25 shares of Citadel
nonvoting common stock for each share of Reading common stock. Following the
recommendation of the Craig conflicts committee, Marshall & Stevens presented
its report to the board of directors. Marshall & Stevens orally advised the
board of directors that, in its opinion, the consolidation transaction, as set
forth in the agreement in principle, and the conversion ratios described by the
conflicts committee were fair to the Craig public stockholders from a financial
point of view.

     Mr. Cotter also advised the directors that he was in favor of the
consolidation transaction as described in the agreement in principle, that he
believed that the consolidation transaction was in the best interests of the
three companies and their respective stockholders and that he was prepared to
execute the agreement in principle and to commit to vote the Craig common stock
and the Craig common preference stock under his control in favor of the
consolidation and to vote the Citadel voting common stock under his control in
favor of the issuance of Citadel nonvoting common stock in connection with the
consolidation.

     There followed a discussion between the directors during which various
questions were asked of management and of Marshall & Stevens. Following this
discussion, the Craig board of directors voted unanimously to enter into the
agreement in principle and authorized management to take all steps reasonably
necessary or convenient to consummate the consolidation as contemplated by the
agreement in principle, provided that Marshall & Stevens confirm in writing
their oral advice to the board regarding the fairness of the consolidation from
a financial point of view and that the execution and delivery of the definitive
merger agreement be subject to the review and approval of the Craig board of
directors.

     The Reading board meeting began at approximately 3:00 p.m. on July 17,
2001. Immediately preceding the board meeting, Mr. McCormick and counsel for the
Reading conflicts committee met with Messrs. Cotter and Tompkins to review the
transaction as outlined in the agreement in principle and to gather further
information as to the direction of and the strategic opportunities available to
Reading. Messrs. Cotter and Tompkins advised the Reading conflicts committee
that management was not considering any transaction that would involve a change
of control of Reading and that the only transaction that currently had the
support of management and Mr. Cotter was a consolidation transaction along the
lines set forth in the agreement in principle. Mr. Cotter advised Mr. McCormick
that, as the controlling stockholder of Craig, he would not support a
transaction which would use the limited resources of the group to cash-out
public stockholders or which would be characterized as a "purchase" transaction
as opposed to a "merger of equals transaction." Messrs. Cotter and Tompkins also
reviewed with Mr. McCormick the business reasons which, in their view, supported
such a consolidation of the three companies under a single public entity. These
reasons were essentially the same reasons that we explained to the boards of
directors of the three companies at their March meetings as supporting our
decision to recommend the consolidation of the three companies.

     During the Reading Board Meeting, management, Marshall & Stevens and Mr.
Cotter made essentially the same presentations as they had made to the Craig
directors at the Craig board of directors meeting.  Mr. McCormick delivered the
report of the Reading conflicts committee and, based upon the advice of Marshall
& Stevens and the advice of Mr. Cotter that he would not support a sale
transaction or a transaction which liquidated Reading or cashed out any Reading
stockholders, recommended to the board of directors a conversion ratio of 1.25
shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock for each share of Reading common stock.
Following discussion, during which the directors asked various questions of
management, Mr. Cotter and Marshall & Stevens, the Reading board of directors
voted unanimously to enter into the agreement in principle and authorized
management to take all steps reasonably necessary or convenient to consummate
the consolidation as contemplated by the agreement in principle, provided, that
Marshall & Stevens confirm in writing their oral advice to the board regarding
the fairness of the consolidation from a financial point of view and that the
execution and delivery of the definitive consolidation agreement be subject to
the review and approval of the Reading board of directors.

     The following day, on July 18, 2001, at approximately 2:00 P.M., the
Citadel board of directors met and considered the consolidation transaction. At
this meeting, management, Mr. Cotter and Marshall & Stevens made essentially the
same presentations as they had the previous day to the boards of directors of
Craig and Reading. Mr. William Soady presented the report of the Citadel
conflicts committee and recommended to the full Board of Directors the structure
set forth in the agreement in principle and conversion ratios of 1.17 shares of
Citadel nonvoting common stock for each share of Craig common stock and Craig
common preference stock and 1.25 shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock for
each share of Reading common stock. Following discussion, members of management,
including directors Cotter and Tompkins, were excused from the meeting so that
the remaining directors could ask various questions of Marshall & Stevens and
counsel. Following these additional questions, members of management were asked
to rejoin the meeting. Thereafter during which the directors asked various
questions of management, Mr. Cotter and Marshall & Stevens, the Citadel board of
directors voted unanimously to enter into the agreement in principle and
authorized management to take all steps reasonably necessary or convenient to
consummate the consolidation as contemplated by the agreement in principle,
provided, that Marshall & Stevens confirm in writing their oral advice to the
board regarding the fairness of the consolidation from a financial point of view
and that the execution and delivery of the definitive consolidation agreement be
subject to the review and approval of the Citadel board of directors.

     That day, the agreement in principle was executed and delivered by Citadel,
Craig, Reading and Mr. Cotter. A press release announcing the execution and
delivery of the agreement in principle was released after the close of the
market, for release before the opening of the market on the following day. A
current report on Form 8-K was also filed that day by each of the three
companies.

     Following the execution and delivery of the agreement in principle,
management worked with counsel for the conflicts committees of the three
companies to negotiate and prepare a definitive consolidation agreement.
Management also worked with the tax advisors for the three companies to develop
a definitive tax structure for the consolidation and with counsel for the
conflicts committees and Marshall & Stevens to develop a recommendation as to
the conversion ratios to be used in connection with the assumption by Citadel of
the outstanding stock options of Craig and Reading. Ultimately, management
recommended to the boards of directors of the three companies that:

     .  The transactions be structured as transactions in which gain or loss
would be currently recognized by stockholders for federal income tax purposes.

     .  The same conversion ratios adopted for purposes of the conversion of
Craig stock and Reading stock into Citadel nonvoting stock be used for purposes
of the conversion of Craig stock options and Reading stock options into Citadel
stock options.

     .  The same conversion ratios be used regardless of whether the holders of
Craig and Reading stock options elect to have their options converted into
options to acquire Citadel voting common stock or nonvoting common stock in the
consolidation.

     The boards of directors of the three companies met on August 16, 2001 to
consider the definitive consolidation agreement and to consider management's
recommendations with respect to tax structure and the treatment of outstanding
Craig and Reading stock options.

     The Citadel board meeting began at approximately 1:00 P.M. Attending the
meeting were all directors other than Mr. Loeffler. Attending the meeting at the
invitation of the Citadel board were Mr. Matyczynski, a representative of
Marshall & Stevens and representatives of Kummer Kaempfer Bonner & Renshaw,
counsel for the Citadel conflicts committee. During the meeting, Mr. Tompkins
reviewed with the directors the terms and structure of the proposed
consolidation agreement and management's recommendations with respect to the tax
structure and the treatment of outstanding stock options. Marshall & Stevens
advised that its recommendation as to the treatment of outstanding stock options
was the same as that made by management and rendered its opinion that the
consolidation was in the best interests of the companies and their respective
stockholders and that the conversion ratios provided for in the consolidation
agreement were fair to the public stockholders of each of the three companies
from a financial point of view. Kummer Kaempfer Bonner & Renshaw responded to
questions of the directors concerning the proposed consolidation agreement, the
filings that would need to be made and the steps that would have to be taken in
order to consummate the transactions contemplated by the consolidation agreement
and the treatment of the outstanding stock options. Mr. Cotter advised the
directors that he continued to favor the consolidation and that he was prepared
to execute and deliver the consolidation agreement.

     Unlike other beneficial owners of Craig common stock, Craig common
preference stock and Reading common stock, the holders of holding options to
acquire Craig common stock, Craig common preference stock and Reading common
stock, all of whom are directors or officers of one or more of the companies,
will have the right to elect to have their Craig and Reading stock options
converted into options to acquire either Citadel voting or Citadel nonvoting
common stock. The conversion ratio is the same (1.17 shares of Citadel stock for
each share of Craig stock and 1.25 shares of Citadel stock for each share of
Reading stock), whether the holder elects to receive options to acquire Citadel
voting or Citadel nonvoting common stock.

     The decision to give option holders the right to elect to have their
options converted into options to acquire either Citadel voting common stock or
Citadel nonvoting common stock was made:

     .   To mitigate to some extent the loss of voting power to be realized by
Mr. Cotter as a consequence of the consolidation.

     .   To reflect the fact that the options to acquire voting stock in Craig
or Reading were granted as a part of the original employment relationships
between Craig or Reading and the option holders.

     .   With the expectation that most of the officers and directors (other
than, perhaps, Mr. Cotter) would elect to convert their options into options to
acquire Citadel nonvoting common stock given the limited practical value of the
voting rights attached to the Citadel voting common stock as compared to the
value represented by the anticipated greater liquidity that should be enjoyed by
the Citadel nonvoting common stock.

     The decision to have the same conversion ratio apply to both the Citadel
voting common stock and the Citadel nonvoting stock was based principally upon
the recommendation of Marshall & Stevens, who advised the boards of directors
that:

     .   After the consolidation, the market prices of the Citadel voting and
nonvoting stock may converge as the practical value of the increased liquidity
of the Citadel nonvoting common stock gains in relative value to the theoretical
value of the voting rights attached to the Citadel voting common stock.

     .   To some extent, this convergence has been reflected in the trading
activity in the Citadel common stock since the announcement of the agreement in
principle relating to the consolidation.

     .   That the current value to the public stockholders of Citadel of a
differential tied to the historic trading prices of the Citadel voting and
nonvoting common stock was not significant, given that the exercise prices of
the Craig and Reading stock options to be assumed will exceed the current market
prices of Citadel voting shares and nonvoting shares.

     The Craig and Reading directors also considered that the use of the same
conversion ratio for both options to acquire Citadel voting and nonvoting common
stock had been approved by the directors of Citadel, including the members of
the Citadel conflicts committee, who hold only options to acquire Citadel
nonvoting common stock and who held no options to acquire either Craig stock or
Reading stock.

     Following discussion, the directors present unanimously approved the
execution and delivery of the consolidation agreement, which included provisions
for the tax structure and the treatment of the outstanding stock options
recommended by management.

     The Reading board meeting began at approximately 2:00 P.M. Attending the
meeting were all directors other than Mr. Loeffler. Attending the meeting at the
invitation of the Reading board were Mr. Matyczynski, a representative of
Marshall & Stevens and a representative of Jones Vargas, counsel for the Reading
conflicts committee. During the meeting, essentially the same events transpired
and essentially the same action was taken as in the case of the meeting of the
Citadel board of directors.

     The Craig board meeting began at approximately 3:00 P.M. Attending the
meeting were all directors other than Mr. Loeffler. Attending the meeting at the
invitation of the Craig board were Mr. Matyczynski, a representative of Marshall
& Stevens and a representative of Troy & Gould Professional Corporation, counsel
for the Craig conflicts committee. During the meeting, essentially the same
events transpired and essentially the same action was taken as in the case of
the prior meetings of the Citadel and Reading boards of directors.

     On Friday, August 17, 2001, the consolidation agreement was executed and
delivered by Craig, Reading, Citadel and the Citadel merger subsidiaries, and by
Mr. Cotter. With respect to Mr. Cotter, the consolidation agreement relates only
to the requirement that he vote all shares of Craig common stock and common
preference stock, Reading common stock and Citadel voting common stock under his
control in favor of the transactions contemplated by the consolidation
agreement. A press release announcing the execution and delivery of the
consolidation agreement was issued that same day, for release before the opening
of the markets on Monday, August 20, 2001. Current reports on Form 8-K, which
included a copy of the consolidation agreement, were filed by the companies with
the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 20, 2001.

Citadel's Reason for the Consolidation

     The Citadel board of directors has unanimously determined that the
consolidation and the transactions contemplated by it are advisable and in the
best interests of Citadel and its stockholders. In reaching its decision, the
Citadel board of directors consulted with and relied upon the recommendation of
its conflicts committee, who together with its separate legal counsel, consulted
with and relied upon Marshall & Stevens and Citadel management. The Citadel
board of directors considered a number of material factors, including:

          .   Creates Synergies and Cost Savings. The consolidation is expected
to result in a single public company that will be able to take advantage of
simplified day-to-day administration and operation. The consolidation is
expected to reduce general and administrative expenses, including fully phased-
in annual cost savings across the three companies, of more than $1 million.

          .   Reduce Conflicts of Interest. The consolidation is expected to
reduce the potential for conflict of interest issues arising out of certain
intra-company or related transactions by and between the related public
companies which, but for the conflict of interest element, would be otherwise
ordinary course of business of the three companies. Placing all business
operations of the three companies under a single public company structure should
substantially reduce the administrative and procedural burdens of reviewing such
transactions on a potential conflict of interest basis.

          .   Clarify Business of Company. The consolidation is expected to
create a single public company that operates in the cinema exhibition, live
theater and real estate businesses. The business of the company following
consolidation should be easier to understand from the point of view of outside
investors and the capital markets.

          .   Provide Greater Liquidity for Stockholders. The trading volume and
market capitalization of Citadel prior to the consolidation has been small. The
consolidation is expected to create a greater public float for the Citadel non-
voting common stock, and, hopefully, greater liquidity for Citadel's
stockholders.

The Citadel board of directors also considered the following material factors:

          .   Information reviewed by Marshall & Stevens on the three companies'
financial condition, results of operations, prospects and businesses, including
analyses of the classes of equity outstanding, historic stock trading prices and
trading volumes for the publicly traded securities of the three companies;
valuation analyses based on an adjusted market value analysis, business unit
analysis and real estate analysis for each of the three companies and
recommended ratios for the respective publicly traded securities of the three
companies.

          .   Presentations from, and discussions with, senior management
executives of Citadel, Craig and Reading regarding business plans and due
diligence issues with respect to the three companies, including the
opportunities afforded by bringing the Australia and New Zealand cinema
exhibition and real estate businesses, together with Citadel's domestic
operations, under the single public company structure.

          .   The analysis of Marshall & Stevens and the Citadel board of
directors' receipt of Marshall & Stevens' opinion, dated August 16, 2001 that
the consolidation is fair from a financial point of view.

          .   The views expressed by Mr. James J. Cotter, the principal
controlling stockholder of Citadel, that he favors the consolidation, but would
not favor a transaction that would significantly affect his control interest in
Citadel or other alternative transaction.

     The consolidation also includes certain risks and disadvantages. The
material potential risks and disadvantages considered by Citadel's board of
directors and management in considering the consolidation include primarily
those other risks and uncertainties described in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus under the caption "RISK FACTORS" beginning on page ___.

     This discussion of the factors considered by the Citadel board of directors
is not intended to be exhaustive. Because of the wide variety of factors
considered in connection with its evaluation of the consolidation, the Citadel
board of directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or
otherwise attempt to assign relative significance to the specific factors
considered in reaching its conclusions. In addition, individual directors may
have given different significance to different factors.

Recommendation of Citadel's Board of Directors

     For the reasons discussed above, the Citadel board of directors has
determined that the terms of the consolidation agreement and the transactions
contemplated by it are advisable and in the best interests of Citadel and its
stockholders. Accordingly, the members of the Citadel board of directors have
unanimously approved the consolidation agreement and recommend that Citadel
stockholders vote at the Citadel annual meeting to approve the consolidation
agreement and related proposals.

     In considering the recommendation by Citadel's board of directors, you
should be aware that some directors and officers of Citadel have interests in
the consolidation that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests
of Citadel's stockholders generally. Please see the section entitled "Interests
of Directors, Officers and Affiliates in the Consolidation" on page ___ of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Craig's Reasons for the Consolidation

     The board of directors of Craig has unanimously approved the consolidation
agreements and determined that the consolidation is in the best interests of
Craig and its stockholders. In reaching its determination, the directors
consulted with management of Craig and the Craig conflicts committee, and relied
on the recommendation of the conflicts committee, which was advised by its own
legal counsel, and on the advice of Marshall & Stevens, regarding the
appropriate conversion ratios and the fairness of the consolidation to Craig's
public stockholders. The board considered a number of factors, but did not
assign any specific or relative weight to the factors it considered, and
different factors may have been weighted differently by individual directors.

     Among the most important benefits of the consolidation identified by the
Craig board were:

          .   The consolidation will substantially reduce the potential for
conflicts of interest in the day-to-day business and operations of Craig and the
other companies and free up management time for more productive activities. The
existing overlapping ownership and management of Citadel, Craig and Reading pose
an inherent potential for conflicts of interest in the normal business and
operations of Craig. Management of Craig, and the directors themselves, spend an
inordinate amount of time and energy addressing these potential conflicts of
interest in managing Craig's day-to-day business. These inherent potential
conflicts also make it more difficult for stockholders and the investing public
to understand and appreciate the business of Craig, as well as the businesses of
Citadel and Reading.

          .   Craig's management estimates that the consolidation will save the
consolidated company at least $1 million annually in general and administrative
costs and expenses once the businesses and operations of the three companies are
fully consolidated.

          .   The consolidation will result in substantially more Citadel
nonvoting shares in the hands of public stockholders and should enhance the
liquidity of the Citadel nonvoting shares held by former Craig shareholders
compared to their current investment in Craig shares. The greater liquidity of
Citadel shares also may facilitate future acquisitions and other business
transactions by the combined company. The number of

shares of Craig common stock and common preference stock in the hands of public
stockholders is relatively small, and there is little trading volume and no
active market for the common stock and common preference stock.

          .   Craig stockholders, as holders of Citadel nonvoting common stock,
will be able to participate ratably in any growth of the consolidated company,
and in any sale of assets of the consolidated company, after the consolidation.

          .   The consolidation will result in a single publicly traded company
that integrates the cinema exhibition, live theater and real estate operations
currently being conducted separately by Craig, Citadel and Reading. This should
make the combined company's business easier to understand and evaluated from the
standpoint of the investing public.

     In evaluating the consolidation, the Craig board of directors considered
the following, among other information:

          .   The views expressed by James J. Cotter, the principal controlling
stockholder of Craig, that he favors the consolidation, but would not favor a
transaction that would significantly affect his control interest in Craig or
other alternative transaction.

          .   Management's views of Craig's prospects as a separate company
within the controlled group of Craig, Citadel and Reading, and of the
anticipated financial condition and business and operations of the consolidated
company following the consolidation.

          .   Notification from the New York Stock Exchange that Craig common
stock and common preference stock will soon be delisted, and management's views
of Craig's prospects for bringing itself in compliance with the exchange's
ongoing listing criteria.

          .   Recent historical financial information of Craig, Citadel and
Reading.

          .   The taxable nature of the consolidation.

          .   The accounting treatment of the consolidation.

          .   Presentations from management and discussions with legal counsel
regarding the business plans, any due diligence issues and any possible adverse
consequences of the consolidation.

          .   The detailed analyses of Marshall & Stevens regarding the
historical assets and stock prices of the companies and the current fair values
of the companies' assets and the conversion ratios in the consolidation,
including Marshall & Stevens' opinion, dated August 16, 2001, that the
consolidation, and the consideration to be received by Craig stockholders in the
consolidation, are fair, from a financial point of view, to the public
stockholders of Craig.

          .   The interests of the directors, officers and affiliates of Craig
in the consolidation, including the matters discussed below under "Interests of
Directors, Officers and Affiliates in the Consolidation."

     The Craig board of directors also considered risks posed by the
consolidation, including

          .   The fact that, as of July 17, 2001, based on recent trading prices
of Citadel nonvoting common stock and of Craig common stock and common
preference stock and given the conversion ratio of 1.17 shares of Citadel
nonvoting common stock for each share of Craig common stock and common
preference stock provided for in the consolidation agreement, the market value
of the Citadel nonvoting shares to be received by Craig stockholders in their
consolidation was less than the market value of the Craig common stock.

          .   The other risks and uncertainties described in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus under the caption "RISK FACTORS" beginning on page ___.

     The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the
Craig board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the
material factors considered by the directors. In view of the complexity and wide
variety of information and factors, the Craig board of directors did not find it
practical to quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative or specific weights to
the factors considered. In addition, the Craig board did not reach any specific
conclusion with respect to each of the factors considered, or any aspect of any
particular factor. Instead, the Craig board of directors conducted an overall
analysis of the factors described above, including discussions with Craig's
management and legal and financial advisors.

     After taking into consideration all of the factors set forth above, Craig's
board of directors concluded that the consolidation is fair to, and in the best
interests of, Craig and its stockholders and that Craig should proceed with the
consolidation.

Recommendation of Craig's Board of Directors

     After careful consideration, the Craig board of directors has determined
that the consolidation is fair to and in the best interests of Craig's
stockholders, has approved the consolidation agreement, and recommends that
Craig stockholders vote in favor of approval of the consolidation agreement and
the Craig merger.

     In considering the recommendation by Craig's board of directors, you should
be aware that some directors and officers of Craig have interests in the
consolidation that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of
Craig's stockholders generally. Please see the section entitled "Interests of
Directors, Officers and Affiliates in the Consolidation" on page ___ of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Reading's Reasons for the Consolidation

     The Reading board of directors approved the proposed consolidation
primarily for the following reasons:

          .   The potential administrative benefits to be derived from the
consolidation of the businesses and management of Reading, Craig and Citadel
into one entity, including possible annual cost savings projected by management
at more than $1 million.

          .   The potential benefits to the common stockholders of Reading of
the shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock to be received in the consolidation
being traded on the American Stock Exchange, including higher trading volume and
greater liquidity than currently exists for Reading shares.

          .   The absence of other available alternatives to maximize Reading
shareholder value, given (1) the view of Mr. Cotter and Reading management that
it would not be desirable to pursue a sale of Reading, either as an entity or by
individual assets followed by liquidation, and (2) the advice of management that
Reading had not received any expressions of third-party interest in acquiring
Reading or any of its significant assets following the public disclosure of the
consolidation proposal in a joint press release on March 21, 2001.

          .   The specific analysis and recommendations contained in the report
of Marshall & Stevens presented on June 21, 2001.

  Additional factors considered by the Reading board of directors in approving
the proposed consolidation include:

          .   The recommendation of the Reading conflicts committee that if the
Reading board elected to effect the proposed consolidation, it would be fair to
the common stockholders of Reading to receive 1.25 shares of Citadel voting
common stock for each share of Reading common stock owned by them.

          .   Management's support of the proposed consolidation in light of
their knowledge of the business, prospects and financial condition of Reading.

          .   The opinion of Marshall & Stevens, dated August 16, 2001, that the
proposed consolidation and related conversion ratios are fair to the Reading
public stockholders from a financial point of view.

     In assessing the consolidation, the Reading conflicts committee and board
of directors also considered certain risks associated with the transaction. In
particular, the conflicts committee explored the possibility of strategic
alternatives to the proposed consolidation in detail with management, including
Mr. Cotter, given that the Marshall & Stevens report suggested that Reading
stockholders could possibly receive substantial cash values from a sale or
liquidation as opposed to the proposed consolidation. The conflicts committee
also considered the relative weight given to Reading's stock price in
calculating the exchange ratio, given the comparatively thin public market for
Reading common stock and the values ascribed to the Reading preferred stock for
purposes of that calculation. It analyzed the conversion ratio for Reading
common stock, both giving primary weight to adjusted market values rather than
stock price variables, and also assuming Craig held common as opposed to
preferred stock of Reading, and concluded that neither of these alternative
approaches significantly affected the conversion ratio. Ultimately, the Reading
board of directors determined that the proposed consolidation, taken as a whole,
is in the best interest of Reading and its public stockholders.

     In view of the variety of factors considered in its evaluation of the
proposed consolidation, the Reading board of directors did not find it
practicable to assign relative weights to the factors considered in reaching its
decision. This discussion does not recite every factor that may have been
considered by the Reading board in detail, nor does it represent the degree of
significance given by individual directors to specific factors.

Recommendation of the Reading Board of Directors

     The Reading board of directors has approved the consolidation agreement and
believes that the consolidation is in the best interests of Reading and its
public stockholders. The Reading board of directors unanimously recommends that
Reading stockholders vote FOR approval of the consolidation agreement and the
Reading merger.

     In considering the recommendation by Reading's board of directors, you
should be aware that some directors and officers of Reading have interests in
the consolidation that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests
of Reading's stockholders generally. Please see the section entitled "Interests
of Directors, Officers and Affiliates in the Consolidation" on page ___ of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Opinion of the Companies' Financial Advisor

     The companies asked Marshall & Stevens Incorporated, in its role as joint
financial advisor to the companies, to render an opinion to the boards of
directors of the companies and to the conflicts committees of the boards as to
whether the consolidation and the consideration to be received in the
consolidation are fair to the public stockholders of Craig, Reading and Citadel,
from a financial point of view, pursuant to the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the consolidation agreement. Marshall & Stevens was also
asked to give advice with respect to the relative values of the three companies,
fair conversion ratios of Citadel nonvoting common stock for shares of Reading
common stock, Craig common stock and Craig common preference stock, whether the
consolidation is in the best interest of the three companies and whether the
same consideration (i.e., common equity) should be provided to all stockholders.

     On June 21, 2001 Marshall & Stevens delivered to the conflicts committees
of the boards of directors of the companies its preliminary findings with
respect to the relative values of the three companies, fair conversion ratios of
Citadel nonvoting common stock for shares of Reading common stock, Craig common
stock and Craig common preference stock, whether the consolidation is in the
best interest of the three

companies and whether common equity should be provided to all stockholders. On
July 17 and 18, 2001, Marshall & Stevens delivered to the boards of directors of
the companies its oral opinion to the effect that, as of those dates, the
consolidation and the consolidation consideration were fair to the public
stockholders of Craig, Reading and Citadel from a financial point of view. This
opinion was subsequently confirmed in the written Marshall & Stevens opinion,
dated August 16, 2001, to the effect that, as of that date, and based on and
subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications set forth in such
opinion, the consolidation and the consolidation consideration are fair to the
public stockholders of Craig, Reading and Citadel from a financial point of
view. Marshall & Stevens also advised the boards of directors and the conflicts
committees of the boards:

          .   As to the relative values of the three companies.

          .   As to the fair conversion ratios of Citadel nonvoting common stock
for shares of Reading common stock, Craig common stock and Craig common
preference stock.

          .   That the consolidation is in the best interests of the three
companies.

          .   That the Craig common stock and Craig common preference stock
should be treated as having the same value for purposes of the consolidation.

          .   That the same consideration should be provided to all stockholders
of Craig and Reading.

     The full text of Marshall & Stevens' opinion is attached as ANNEX B to this
joint proxy statement/prospectus. The foregoing summary of Marshall & Stevens'
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. You
are urged to read Marshall & Stevens' opinion carefully and in its entirety for
the procedures followed, assumptions made, other matters considered and limits
of the review by Marshall & Stevens in connection with its opinion.

     Marshall & Stevens prepared its opinion for the boards of directors of the
companies and for the conflicts committees of the boards. The opinion addresses
only whether the consolidation and the consolidation consideration are fair to
the public stockholders of Craig, Reading and Citadel from a financial point of
view, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
consolidation agreement. Marshall & Stevens expressed no opinion as to the
prices at which the equity securities of Craig, Reading or Citadel would
actually trade at any time. Marshall & Stevens was not requested to address and,
accordingly, Marshall & Stevens' opinion does not address, alternative business
strategies or the decision by the boards of directors to pursue the
consolidation as opposed to some other business strategy. Marshall & Stevens'
opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how to
vote on the consolidation or any other matter.

     The conflicts committees of the boards of directors of the companies
selected Marshall & Stevens as their financial advisor because, among other
things, of the view of the directors serving on the conflicts committees based
on the various background materials provided by Marshall & Stevens that Marshall
& Stevens is an internationally recognized valuation and financial consulting
firm that has substantial experience providing valuation and financial
consulting services. Marshall & Stevens was not retained as an advisor or agent
to the stockholders of any of the companies or any other person. As part of its
valuation and financial consulting business, Marshall & Stevens is regularly
engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with
mergers, acquisitions, underwritings, sales and distributions of listed and
unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate, tax, and
other purposes. Marshall & Stevens was not requested to solicit, nor did
Marshall & Stevens solicit, the interest of any other party in acquiring or
engaging in a business combination with any of the companies.

     In arriving at its opinion, Marshall & Stevens:

          .    Reviewed the information attached to its opinion as Exhibit A.

          .    Analyzed daily stock prices and trading volumes for Craig common
stock, Craig common preference stock, Reading common stock, Citadel nonvoting
common stock and Citadel voting common stock for the period June 1, 2000 through
July 11, 2001.

          .    Considered the nature of the business and the history of the
companies and their strategic business units, or SBUs; the economic outlooks of
the United States, Puerto Rico, Australia, and New Zealand, in general; the
outlooks for the cinema and theater industries, in particular; the SBUs earnings
before interest and taxes, or EBIT, earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, revenues, book capital, and total
assets for the past five years (1996-2000) and the three-month interim period
ended March 31, 2001; the outlook for future EBIT, EBITDA and revenues; the net
book value and adjusted market value of the companies; the companies' financial
condition; and the companies' dividend-paying capacity.

          .    Considered the nature of the underlying real estate holdings of
the companies, relevant cost data, the local real estate markets for such
holdings; and the income and cash generating capacity of the holdings.

          .    Analyzed financial statements, prices and other materials
regarding guideline publicly traded companies in the cinema industry; multiples
of EBIT, EBITDA revenues, book capital and total assets of such guideline
publicly traded companies; required rates of return on debt and equity capital;
and such other relevant material as deemed appropriate.

          .    Analyzed the financial terms, operating results, financial
condition and multiples of EBIT, EBITDA, revenues, book capital and total assets
of companies, to the extent publicly available, involved in certain recent
business combinations in the cinema industry.

          .    Compared certain statistical and financial information of the
companies with similar information for certain guideline publicly traded
companies and industry composites in the cinema industry.

          .    Analyzed the terms of certain real estate transactions, to the
extent publicly available, for properties considered comparable to the
underlying real estate holdings of the Companies.

          .    Conducted discount cash flow analyses and capitalization of
income/cash flow on various SBUs and underlying real estate holdings of the
companies.

          .    Visited the companies' headquarters in Los Angeles, California,
and conducted interviews with and relied upon the representations of Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer James J. Cotter; Reading and Citadel Vice Chairman
and Craig President, S. Craig Tompkins; Chief Financial Officer, Andrzej
Matyczynski; and Vice President-Real Estate, Brett Marsh concerning the
operations, financial condition, future prospects, and projected operations and
performance of the companies and their SBUs and underlying real estate holdings.

          .    Visited certain other offices and real estate holdings of the
companies and conducted interviews with other employees of the companies
concerning the SBUs and underlying real estate holdings.

          .    Conducted such other financial studies, analyses and inquiries,
and considered such other matters as deemed necessary and appropriate for their
opinion.

          .    In rendering its opinion, Marshall & Stevens did not
independently verify the accuracy and completeness of the financial information
or other information furnished by the companies orally or in writing, or other
information obtained from publicly available sources.

     With respect to the financial projections for the companies referred to
above, Marshall & Stevens reviewed the best currently available estimates and
judgments of management of the companies as to the expected future financial and
operating performance of the companies and their SBUs and underlying real estate
holdings, and did not undertake any obligation independently to verify the
underlying assumptions made in connection with such forecasts, estimates or
judgments.

     Marshall & Stevens' opinion was based on business, economic, market and
other conditions as they existed as of the date of its opinion. Marshall &
Stevens states in its opinion that they have assumed that the factual
circumstances and terms, as they existed at the date of this opinion, will
remain substantially unchanged through the time the consolidation is completed.

Valuation and Financial Analyses Performed by Marshall & Stevens

     The following is a discussion of the financial and valuation analyses
presented by Marshall & Stevens to the conflicts committees of the boards of
directors of the companies on June 21, 2001, and to the full boards of directors
on July 17 and 18, 2001, in connection with the approval of the agreement in
principle, and on August 16, 2001, in connection with the approval of the
consolidation agreement. The information summarized in the tables which follow
should be read in conjunction with the accompanying text.

     The implied relative conversion ratios estimated pursuant to the historical
stock price analysis and the adjusted market value analysis summarized below
were each based on:

          .    3,402,808 shares of Craig common stock outstanding.

          .    7,058,408 shares of Craig common preference stock outstanding.

          .    7,449,364 shares of Reading common stock outstanding.

          .    7,958,379 shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock outstanding.

          .    1,989,585 shares of Citadel voting common stock outstanding.

     Common Stock Trading History

     Marshall & Stevens examined the historical closing prices of the companies'
securities from January 12, 2001 to July 11, 2001. Marshall & Stevens reviewed
the closing prices on July 11, 2001, as well as the six-month average trading
prices and six-month average trading volumes for each security during the
aforementioned period.

     Current And Historical Implied Conversion Ratio Analysis

     Marshall & Stevens reviewed the current and historical conversion ratios
implied by the daily closing prices per share of each security for the period
beginning January 12, 2001 and ending on July 11, 2001. The implied conversion
ratios based upon the July 11, 2001 closing prices and the six-month average
prices were considered most appropriate to the analysis.

     Adjusted Market Value Analysis

     Marshall & Stevens analyzed the underlying SBUs, real estate and other
specific assets of the companies. The estimated market values of such SBUs, real
estate and other specific assets of the companies were substituted for their
book values on each of the respective company's March 31, 2001 balance sheets to
provide an indication of the adjusted market value of each company. The March
31, 2001 financial statements and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q were the latest
available financial information provided by the management of the companies. The
market values were estimated on a "most likely", a "low" and a "high" basis to
provide a range of market values for consideration. Based upon the analysis, the
market values per

common share (considering total common shares outstanding) of each company under
each of the above three scenarios were calculated. The implied conversion ratios
were then determined under each of the three scenarios.

     Strategic Business Unit Analysis

     Market Approach--Comparable Publicly Traded Company Analysis

     Marshall & Stevens identified and selected several publicly traded
companies similar in business type and operations to Citadel's and Reading's
cinema operations. Guideline publicly traded companies were identified using
Moody's Company Data on CD-ROM. Data on the selected companies was obtained
using Moody's Company Data on CD-ROM and Compustat's (North American) Company
Database. The comparable publicly traded companies selected are listed below:

           Company Name                   Ticker Symbol
           ------------                   -------------

           AMC Entertainment Inc.             AEN

           Carmike Cinemas Inc.               CKECQ

           Cinema Ride Inc.                   MOVE

           Cinemastar Luxury Thetrs.          LUXYQ

           ITEC Attractions Inc.              ITAT

     Marshall & Stevens calculated the invested capital to the trailing twelve
months revenue and EBITDA for each of the comparable companies. The total
invested capital is defined as the price per share multiplied by the common
equity outstanding, plus debt and preferred stock.

     Market Approach--Comparable Transaction Analysis

     Marshall & Stevens reviewed prior transactions made by Citadel and Reading
and multiples of revenue and EBITDA paid in such transactions as well as
transactions that took place in the market over the past year. Marshall &
Stevens also reviewed an investment banking bulletin for Village Roadshow which
indicated various transaction multiples.

     Market Approach--Summary

     Given the ranges of multiples indicated and the differences between the
comparable companies and the companies involved in the transactions in
comparison to the SBUs of Citadel and Reading, certain multiples were adjusted
to account for such differences before applying them to the SBUs of Citadel and
Reading. In addition, the market approach was not used in instances where the
comparables were insufficient to provide a meaningful indication of value.

     Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

     Marshall & Stevens prepared a discounted cash flow analysis, on a debt-free
basis, for each of the SBUs.  In developing the discounted cash flow analysis,
cash flows for each business unit were forecasted five years into the future
using projections provided by management where available. Where projections were
unavailable, cash flows were forecasted based on discussions with management, a
review of the SBUs' historical financial statements and a review of economic and
industry outlooks.

     Marshall & Stevens discounted the projected cash flows and terminal values
to present value. The discount rate reflects the time value of money and the
risk inherent to receipt of the cash flows. The terminal value was based on the
Gordon growth model, using the discount rate and a long-term growth rate.

     Correlation

     The values indicated by the market and income approaches were correlated
into a final conclusion of value for each SBU based upon the applicability of
each approach.

     Real Estate Analysis

     Marshall & Stevens reviewed the appraisals, purchase agreements and other
data furnished by management of the companies on numerous properties.
Discussions were held with Brett Marsh--Vice President of Real Estate of the
companies, regarding the companies' real estate assets.  Further discussions
were held with representatives of Reading regarding the Reading properties. A
visual inspection was made of the fee simple theaters in New York City, as well
as a confirmation of the zoning. Market participants were contacted to obtain
insights into the market place for the real estate being reviewed. Telephonic
inquiries to brokers, appraisers and market participants were made into the
Australian and New Zealand markets to obtain data on the various markets where
the Reading developments were located. The accumulated data have been summarized
in the Marshall & Stevens opinion.

Summary of Conclusions

     Marshall & Stevens, in reaching their conclusions, placed equal (one-third)
weight on the conversion ratios indicated by the current (July 11, 2001) stock
prices, six-month average (January 12, 2001 - July 11, 2001) stock prices and
adjusted market value - most likely scenario, which yielded a conversion ratio
conclusion of 1.17 for both Craig common stock and common preference stock and
1.25 for Reading common stock.

     The summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete description
of the analyses performed by Marshall & Stevens but describes, in summary form,
the material elements of the presentations made by Marshall & Stevens to the
conflicts committees of the boards of directors of the companies on June 21,
2001, and to the full boards of directors on July 17 and 18, 2001, in connection
with the preparation of the Marshall & Stevens' opinion. The preparation of an
opinion involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant
methods of financial analysis and the application of these methods to the
particular circumstances and, therefore, such an opinion is not readily
susceptible to summary description. Each of the analyses conducted by Marshall &
Stevens was carried out in order to provide a different perspective on the
transaction and to add to the total mix of information available. Marshall &
Stevens did not form a conclusion as to whether any individual analysis,
considered in isolation, supported or failed to support an opinion as to
fairness from a financial point of view. Rather, in reaching its conclusion,
Marshall & Stevens considered the results of the analyses in light of each other
and ultimately reached its opinion based on the results of all analyses taken as
a whole.  Accordingly, notwithstanding the separate factors summarized above,
Marshall & Stevens has indicated to the companies that it believes that its
analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its
analyses and the factors considered by it, without considering all analyses and
factors, could create an incomplete view of the evaluation process underlying
its opinion.

Fee Arrangements with Financial Advisor

     Pursuant to an engagement letter dated May 9, 2001, Marshall & Stevens is
entitled to receive a fee of $207,500 in connection with the preparation and
delivery of its fairness opinion, which will be shared equally by Citadel, Craig
and Reading.  Of the fee, $200,000 has been paid to date.  Citadel, Craig and
Reading also agreed to indemnify Marshall & Stevens against certain liabilities,
which may include liabilities under the federal securities laws, relating to or
arising out of Marshall & Stevens' engagement as financial advisor.

     There was no material relationship between any of the three companies and
Marshall & Stevens in the two years prior to Marshall & Stevens' engagement in
connection with the consolidation.  Marshall & Stevens may in the future provide
investment banking or other financial advisory services to the combined company.

Interests of Directors, Officers and Affiliates in the Consolidation

     When considering the recommendations of the boards of directors of Citadel,
Craig and Reading, you should be aware that some of the directors and officers
have interests in the consolidation that are different from, or are in addition
to, your interests.  The boards of directors were aware of these differing
interests and considered them in making their recommendations.

     James J. Cotter is the principal controlling stockholder of Craig, Reading
and Citadel.  He owns or controls, directly or indirectly, a majority of the
voting power of both Craig and Reading and approximately 49% of the voting power
of Citadel.  Mr. Cotter has advised the directors of the three companies that
while he favors a consolidation of the companies, he would not support a
transaction which, in his view, would materially and adversely affect his
control position with respect to the three companies.  This advice significantly
influenced the determination to issue Citadel nonvoting common stock, as opposed
to Citadel voting common stock, in the consolidation.

     Mr. Cotter receives significant benefits from the companies not shared by
other stockholders.  Mr. Cotter is paid an aggregate of approximately $545,000
annually by the companies in director fees and consulting fees, and serves as
the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of each of the companies.  Two of Mr.
Cotter's children - Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter - serve as officers or
directors of one or more of the companies, and Margaret Cotter provides certain
theater management services to an affiliate of Citadel on an independent
contractor basis.  Over the twelve months ended July 31, 2001, the aggregate
payments to Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter (and her affiliates) totaled
approximately $163,800 and $257,000, respectively.

     Mr. Cotter is a significant creditor of Citadel.  He:

     .    Holds a $2.25 million Citadel promissory note, which bears interest at
          the current rate of 8.125% per annum and matures in July 2002.

     .    Is a 50% member in Sutton Hill Capital, LLC, which is the landlord to
          Citadel Cinemas with respect to its Manhattan-based cinemas (other
          than the Angelika) and to which Citadel has granted a $28 million line
          of credit, available for draw by Sutton Hill Capital beginning in July
          2007.

     One of the effects of the consolidation will be to increase Citadel's
equity, which may enhance its ability to repay these obligations.

     Mr. Cotter has advised the directors of Citadel, Craig and Reading that he
considers his investment in the companies to be long-term in nature, and that he
intends to pass on his investment to his estate for the benefit of his children,
including Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter.  Mr. Cotter has further advised the
directors of the three companies that he believes that the three companies
should be operated on a combined basis, and that in his view the best
opportunity for the three companies is to use the assets available to them to
advance the opportunities in Australia and New Zealand which he believes are
reasonably available to Reading.  Given the overlapping nature of his existing
ownership interests in Citadel, Craig and Reading.  Mr. Cotter has, in effect,
already assumed the risks of an investment in the combined companies, and
accordingly may view the attractiveness of the consolidation differently than
stockholders who only have an investment in one or two of the three companies.
Also, given his level of personal involvement in the direction of Reading's
activities in Australia and New Zealand, he may view the opportunities there as
more attractive than would Citadel or Craig stockholders, who might prefer a
domestic focus to their investments.

     As of July 31, 2001, Craig's executive officers and directors held options
to purchase a total of 664,940 shares of Craig common stock at the weighted-
average exercise price of $6.04 per share and 65,000 shares of Craig common
preference stock at the weighted-average exercise price of $6.65 per share.  A
total of 22,500 shares under those options were unvested.  Under the terms of
the consolidation agreement, these options will be converted into options to
purchase the equivalent number of shares of either Citadel voting common stock
or nonvoting common stock, at each option holder's election.

     As of July 31, 2001, Reading's executive officers and directors held
options to purchase a total of 790,232 shares of Reading common stock at the
weighted-average exercise of price of $12.79 per share.  A total of 30,500
shares under those options were unvested.  Under the terms of the consolidation
agreement, these options will be converted into options to purchase the
equivalent number of shares of either Citadel voting common stock or nonvoting
common stock, at each option holder's election.

     James J. Cotter currently holds options to purchase 635,232 shares of
Reading common stock at the weighted-average exercise price of $13.30 per share
and 594,940 shares of Craig common stock at the weighted-average exercise
price of $5.92 per share. If Mr. Cotter elects to have his Reading and Craig
stock options converted into options to purchase Citadel voting stock in the
consolidation, he would, immediately following the consolidation, hold options
to purchase 1,490,120 shares of Citadel voting common stock, or 52.7% of the
outstanding Citadel voting common stock assuming we were to exercise his options
in full, at the weighted-average exercise price of $8.03 per share. Taking into
account his current stock holdings, as well, this would give Mr. Cotter total
beneficial ownership of 64.3% of the voting power of Citadel after taking into
effect the exercise of Citadel stock options.

     In addition to Mr. Cotter, some of the executive officers of Citadel, Craig
and Reading and their affiliates are also directors of one or more of the
companies, or were otherwise involved in the development of the consolidation
transaction.  In addition to Mr. Cotter, Mr. Tompkins is a director of each of
the three companies.  Mr. Smerling, the President of Reading and of Citadel
Cinemas, is also a director of Reading.  Mr. Matyczynski, while employed by
Craig, is the Chief Financial Officer of each of the three companies.  Messrs.
Tompkins, Smerling and Matyczynski received compensation aggregating $410,400,
$219,900 and $180,000 with respect to the year ended December 31, 2000 for their
services to the three companies and their affiliates.  Messrs. Tompkins,
Smerling and Matyczynski will benefit from the consolidation in that their
employment benefits, and severance arrangements with Craig (in the case of
Messrs. Tompkins and Matyczynski) and with Reading (in the case of Messrs.
Tompkins and Smerling) will be assumed by Citadel in the consolidation.

     Under the consolidation agreement, Citadel has agreed to honor Craig's and
Reading's obligations under the indemnification agreements between Craig and
Reading and their respective directors and officers.  The Craig indemnification
agreements are identical to indemnification agreements currently in effect
between Citadel and its directors and officers.  For more information on the
Citadel indemnification agreement, see the discussion under "PROPOSAL TO RATIFY
AND APPROVE THE FORM OF CITADEL INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT" beginning on page
____.

     As a result of the foregoing interests, the directors and officers of
Citadel, Craig and Reading could be more likely to vote to approve the
consolidation agreement and related matters than if they did not hold these
interests.  You should consider whether these interests may have influenced
these directors and officers to support or recommend the consolidation.

Completion and Effectiveness of the Consolidation

     The consolidation will be completed when all of the conditions to its
completion are satisfied or waived, including approval and adoption of the
consolidation agreement and the Craig merger by the stockholders of Craig and
the approval and adoption of the consolidation agreement and the Reading merger
 by the stockholders of Reading.  The consolidation will become effective upon
the filing of articles of merger with the State of Nevada.  We expect to
complete the consolidation promptly following the joint meetings of stockholders
of Citadel, Craig and Reading.

Structure of the Consolidation and Conversion of Stock and Options

     Citadel has formed two wholly owned subsidiaries, Craig Merger Sub, Inc.
and Reading Merger Sub, Inc.  As provided in the consolidation agreement, Craig
Merger Sub, Inc. will merge with and into Craig, and Reading Merger Sub, Inc.
will merge with and into Reading.  These two mergers are referred to in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Craig merger and the Reading merger.
The completion of the Craig merger and the Reading merger are conditioned on
completion of the other, so neither merger will occur unless both occur.

     On the effectiveness of the Craig merger and the Reading merger, Craig and
Reading will become wholly owned subsidiaries of Citadel, and Craig stockholders
and Reading stockholders will become stockholders of Citadel as described in the
following paragraphs.  In connection with and as part of the Reading merger,
Reading's name will be changed to "Reading Holdings, Inc."

     Craig Common Stock

     Upon effectiveness of the consolidation, each outstanding share of Craig
common stock and common preference stock will be automatically converted into
the right to receive 1.17 shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock.

     Craig Options

     Upon completion of the consolidation, each outstanding stock option of
Craig will be assumed by Citadel and become an option to purchase either Citadel
voting common stock or nonvoting common stock, at each option holder's election.
Each option will be exercisable for a number of whole shares of either Citadel
voting common stock or nonvoting common stock, at each option holder's election,
determined by multiplying 1.17 by the number of shares of Craig common stock or
common preference stock that were purchasable under the option immediately prior
to the consolidation.  The number of shares of Citadel common stock purchasable
under the option will be rounded down to the nearest whole share, without
payment of any cash for fractional shares.  The exercise price per share of each
option to purchase Citadel voting shares or nonvoting shares will be the pre-
consolidation exercise price divided by 1.17, so the aggregate exercise prices
of the outstanding Craig options will not be affected by the consolidation.  In
each case, the exercise price will be rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

     Reading Common Stock

     Upon completion of the consolidation, each outstanding share of Reading
common stock will be automatically converted into 1.25 shares of Citadel
nonvoting common stock.

     Reading Options

     Upon completion of the consolidation, each outstanding stock option of
Reading will be assumed by Citadel and become an option to purchase either
Citadel voting common stock or nonvoting common stock, at each option holder's
election.  Each option will be exercisable for a number of whole shares of
either Citadel voting common stock or nonvoting common stock, at each option
holder's election, determined by multiplying 1.25 by the number of shares of
Reading common stock that would have been purchasable under the option
immediately prior to the consolidation.  The number of shares of Citadel common
stock purchasable under the option will be rounded down to the nearest whole
share, without payment of any cash for fractional shares.  The exercise price
per share of each option to purchase Citadel voting shares or nonvoting shares
will be the pre-consolidation exercise price divided by 1.25, so the aggregate
exercise prices of the outstanding Reading options will not be affected by the
consolidation.  In each case, the exercise price will be rounded up to the
nearest whole cent.

     The total number of Citadel shares to be issued in the consolidation
includes up to 1,841,820 shares of Citadel voting common stock or nonvoting
common stock issuable upon the exercise of currently outstanding Craig and
Reading stock options to be assumed by Citadel in the consolidation. The
currently outstanding Craig and Reading stock options to be assumed by Citadel
in the consolidation consist of:

          .    Options to purchase 135,000 shares granted under Craig's stock
option plans.

          .    Options to purchase 594,940 shares under individual Craig option
agreements with Citadel's controlling stockholder, James J. Cotter.

          .    Options to purchase 420,232 shares granted under Reading's stock
option plans.

          .    Options to purchase 370,000 shares under individual Reading
option agreements with Mr. Cotter.

     As a result, there will be up to 1,841,820 shares of Citadel common stock
reserved for issuance pursuant to the replacement Citadel stock options that
will be issued in the consolidation. These shares will be either voting shares
or nonvoting shares, or a combination of voting and nonvoting shares, depending
on the election made by each option holder.

     The Citadel stock option plan is described below under "TO AMEND CITADEL
1999 STOCK OPTION PLAN" proposal. The material terms of the stock options to be
assumed and reissued in favor of Mr. Cotter are summarized below:

     Under the stock option agreement between Mr. Cotter and Craig, the options
granted under the agreement vested as of the date of the agreement.  The options
granted to Mr. Cotter may be exercised only by Mr. Cotter or by (1) any
partnership, corporation or limited liability company for the benefit of or
owned directly or indirectly by Mr. Cotter and/or his children or heirs, or (2)
any trust, foundation or not-for-profit corporation established by Mr. Cotter.
These options expire on June 11, 2005.

     In 1997, Mr. Cotter and Reading entered into a non-qualified option plan
entitling Mr. Cotter to purchase up to 370,000 shares of common stock.  These
options are divided into three components, which became exercisable in four
equal installments over a similar vesting schedule.  The exercise price of the
options exceeded the market price of the Reading common stock at the time the
options were granted.  Mr. Cotter's options under the agreement are transferable
only (1) by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or (2) by Mr. Cotter
during his lifetime to any immediate family member or certain entities owned or
controlled by, or for the benefit of, Mr. Cotter and his immediate family
members.  Mr. Cotter's option will terminate within 30 days after the date of
termination for cause or 120 days after the date of termination for any reason
other than for cause, death or retirement or disability of Mr. Cotter's
association with Reading.  Upon retirement or disability, Mr. Cotter may for a
period of three years (or longer if determined by the Reading compensation
committee) exercise any option which were exercisable prior to such retirement
or disability.  Upon Mr. Cotter's death, all vesting provisions which would be
satisfied solely by the passage of time will be accelerated and deemed
satisfied.

     No Fractional Shares of Citadel Nonvoting Common Stock

     No fractional shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock will be issued in
the consolidation.  Instead of fractional shares, former Craig stockholders and
Reading stockholders will be entitled to receive cash in an amount to be
determined by multiplying their fractional share amount, after aggregating all
fractional shares for a former holder of Craig common stock and common
preference stock and Reading common stock, by the average closing price of
Citadel nonvoting common stock as reported on the American Stock Exchange for
the five trading days immediately prior to the effectiveness of the
consolidation.

Exchange of Craig and Reading Stock Certificates for Citadel Stock Certificates

     When the consolidation is completed, Citadel's exchange agent will mail to
former Craig and Reading stockholders a letter of transmittal and instructions
for use in surrendering Craig and Reading stock certificates in exchange for
Citadel stock certificates.  When you deliver your Craig or Reading stock
certificates to the exchange agent along with an executed letter of transmittal
and any other required documents, your Craig or Reading stock certificates will
be canceled and you will receive Citadel stock certificates representing the
number of full shares of Citadel common stock to which you are entitled under
the consolidation agreement. You will receive payment in cash, without interest,
instead of any fractional share of Citadel nonvoting common stock which would
have otherwise been issuable to you in the consolidation.

     Citadel will only issue to former Craig and Reading stockholders a Citadel
stock certificate or a check in lieu of a fractional share in the name in which
the surrendered Craig or Reading stock certificate is registered.  If Craig and
Reading stockholders wish to have their stock certificates issued in another
name, they must present the exchange agent with all documents required to show
and effect the unrecorded transfer of ownership and show that they paid any
applicable stock transfer taxes.

Craig and Reading stockholders should not submit their Craig and Reading stock
certificates for exchange until they receive the transmittal instructions and a
form of letter of transmittal from the exchange agent.

No Dividends

     Craig and Reading stockholders are not entitled to receive any dividends or
other distributions on Citadel nonvoting common stock until the consolidation is
completed and they have surrendered their Craig and Reading stock certificates
in conversion for Citadel stock certificates.

     Subject to the effect of applicable laws, promptly following surrender of
Craig and Reading stock certificates and the issuance of the corresponding
Citadel certificates, former Craig and Reading stockholders will be paid the
amount of dividends or other distributions, if any, without interest, with a
record date after the completion of the consolidation which were previously paid
with respect to their whole shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock.  At the
appropriate payment date, former Craig and Reading stockholders will also
receive the amount of dividends or other distributions, without interest, with a
record date after the completion of the consolidation (but prior to the
surrender of Craig and Reading share certificates) and a payment date after they
surrender their Craig and Reading stock certificates for Citadel stock
certificates.

Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Consolidation

     The following discussion summarizes the material federal income tax
consequences of the consolidation that are generally applicable to holders of
Craig common stock and common preference stock and Reading common stock.  This
discussion is based on existing authorities.  These authorities may change, or
the Internal Revenue Service might interpret the existing authorities
differently.  In either case, the tax consequences of the consolidation to the
holders of Craig common stock and common preference stock and Reading common
stock could differ from those described below. This discussion is for general
information only and does not provide a complete analysis of all potential tax
considerations that may be relevant to particular stockholders because of their
specific circumstances, or because they are subject to special rules.  This
discussion does not describe the federal income tax consequences of transactions
other than the consolidation or the tax consequences of consolidation under
foreign, state or local law.  This discussion also does not address the federal
income tax consequences of the consolidation to holders of Craig stock options
or Reading stock options.

     Each holder of Craig common stock and common preference stock and each
holder of Reading common stock will recognize gain or loss measured by the
difference between the sum of the fair market value of the shares of Citadel
nonvoting common stock received in the consolidation, plus the amount of cash
received by the holder in lieu of a fractional share, and the holder's tax basis
in the Craig or Reading stock.

     Stockholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the specific
tax consequences of the consolidation, including the applicable federal, state,
local and foreign tax consequences to them of the consolidation in their
particular circumstances.

Accounting Treatment of the Consolidation

     Citadel intends to account for the consolidation as a purchase of Craig and
Reading by Citadel for financial reporting and accounting purposes, in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Regulatory Filings and Approvals Required to Complete the Consolidation

effectiveness of the registration statement of which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is a part, and compliance with applicable corporation laws
of Nevada.

Restrictions on Sales of Shares by Affiliates

     The shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock to be issued in the
consolidation will be registered under the Securities Act. These shares will be
freely transferable under the Securities Act, except for shares issued to any
person who is an affiliate of any of Craig or Reading (or of Citadel).  Persons
who may be deemed to be affiliates include individuals or entities that control,
are controlled by, or are under common control of Craig or Reading (or of
Citadel) and may include some of their respective officers and directors, as
well as their respective principal stockholders. Affiliates may not sell their

Delisting and Deregistration of Craig and Reading Common Stock After the
Consolidation

     If the consolidation is completed, Craig common stock and common preference
stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and Reading common stock
will no longer be quoted on The Nasdaq Stock Market, and the Craig common stock
and common preference stock and Reading common stock will be deregistered under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

     Craig stockholders also should bear in mind that, if the consolidation is
not completed, Craig common stock and common preferred stock is likely to be
delisted from the New York Stock Exchange as discussed under "THE CONSOLIDATION
- -  Background of the Consolidation" on page _____.

                          THE CONSOLIDATION AGREEMENT

     The following is a brief summary of the material provisions of the
consolidation agreement among Citadel, Craig and Reading, dated as of August 17,
2001, a copy of which is attached as ANNEX A to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.  This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the consolidation agreement.  Stockholders of Citadel, Craig and Reading are
urged to read the consolidation agreement in its entirety because it, and not
this joint proxy statement/prospectus, is the legal document that governs the
consolidation.

Effective Time of the Consolidation

     If the consolidation agreement is approved by the stockholders of Citadel,
Craig and Reading, and all the terms and conditions are satisfied, the
consolidation will become effective upon the filing of properly executed
articles of merger relating to the Craig merger and the Reading merger with the
Nevada Secretary of State, or at a later time as the parties will agree and set
forth in the articles of merger.

     The consolidation agreement provides that, subject to the terms and
conditions of the consolidation agreement, Craig Merger Sub, Inc. will merge
with and into Craig and the separate existence of Craig Merger Sub, Inc. will
cease to exist, and Craig will be the surviving corporation, and Reading Merger
Sub, Inc. concurrently will merge with and into Reading and the separate
existence of Reading Merger Sub, Inc. will cease to exist, and Reading will be
the surviving corporation.  The Craig merger and the Reading merger will not
occur unless both occur.

Manner and Basis of Converting Shares

     As of the effective time, by virtue of the consolidation and without any
action of the part of the holders of any capital stock:

          .   Each share of common stock, par value $0.25 per share, of Craig
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be converted
into the right to receive 1.17 shares of Class A nonvoting common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Citadel. All Craig common stock, when so converted,
will no longer be outstanding and will be automatically canceled and retired and
will cease to exist. The holder of a certificate of Craig common stock that,
immediately prior to the effective time, represented outstanding shares of Craig
common stock will no longer have any rights with respect to such Craig common
stock except the right to receive Citadel nonvoting common stock, without
interest, upon surrender of such Craig common stock certificate.

          .   Each share of Class A common preference stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Craig issued and outstanding immediately before the effective time
will be converted into the right to receive 1.17 shares of the nonvoting common
stock of Citadel. All Craig common preference stock, when so converted, will no
longer be outstanding, will be automatically cancelled and retired and cease to
exist. The holder of such certificate of Craig common preference stock that,
immediately before the effective time, represented outstanding shares of Craig
common preference stock will cease having any rights with respect to such shares
of Craig common preference stock except the right to receive Citadel nonvoting
common stock, without interest, upon the surrender of such Craig common
preference stock certificate.

          .   Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Reading
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be converted
into the right to receive 1.25 shares of the Citadel nonvoting common stock. All
such Reading common stock, when so converted, will no longer be outstanding and
will be automatically canceled and retired and will cease to exist. The holder
of a certificate of Reading common stock that, immediately prior to the
effective time, represented outstanding shares of Reading common stock will
cease having any rights with respect to such Reading common stock except the
right to receive Citadel nonvoting common stock, without interest, upon
surrender of such Reading common stock certificate.

          .   Each share of the Series A convertible redeemable preferred stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of Reading issued and outstanding immediately before
the effective time will remain outstanding and will not be affected by the
consolidation.

          .   Each share of Series B convertible preferred stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Reading issued and outstanding immediately before the
effective time will remain outstanding and will not be affected by the
consolidation.

          .   Each share of Citadel nonvoting common stock and each share of
Citadel Class B voting common stock, par value $0.01 per share, issued and
outstanding immediately before the effective time will remain outstanding and
will not be affected by the consolidation.

          .   All shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Craig
Merger Sub, Inc. issued and outstanding will be automatically converted into one
share of Craig common stock and will be the only Craig common stock issued and
outstanding after the consolidation.

          .   All shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Reading
Merger Sub, Inc. issued and outstanding will be automatically converted into one
share of Reading common stock and will be the only Reading common stock issued
and outstanding after the consolidation.

     No fractional shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock will be issued in
the consolidation, and fractional interests will not entitle the owner of such
fractional interests to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Citadel. All
former holders of Craig common stock and common preferred stock and of Reading
common stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive fractional shares will
instead receive a payment determined by multiplying the fraction of a share of
Citadel nonvoting common stock to which the holder otherwise would be entitled
by the average closing price of Citadel nonvoting common stock as reported by
American Stock Exchange for the five trading days immediately prior to the
effective time of the consolidation.

     All shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock issued upon the surrender of
certificates in accordance with the terms of the consolidation agreement will be
deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
those certificates and the Craig and Reading stock represented thereby.

Conversion Procedures

     Promptly following the effective time of the consolidation, an exchange
agent will send a letter of transmittal to each holder of record of Craig and
Reading stock certificates along with instructions for effecting the surrender
of such Craig and Reading stock certificates in exchange for certificates
representing shares of Citadel stock (plus cash in lieu of fractional shares as
provided above).  Upon the surrender of a Craig or Reading stock certificate for
cancellation, together with a duly executed and properly completed letter of
transmittal, the holder of the stock certificate will be entitled to receive
that number of whole shares of Citadel stock, and if applicable, cash pursuant
to the consolidation agreement.  CRAIG AND READING STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD NOT SEND
IN THEIR STOCK CERTIFICATES UNTIL THEY RECEIVE THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL.

     If your Craig or Reading stock certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, you may make an affidavit of that fact, and if required by Citadel,
post a bond in such reasonable amount as Citadel may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Craig or Reading
stock certificate.  Upon the receipt of the affidavit and bond, if any, the
exchange agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Craig
or Reading stock certificate, the requisite number of Citadel nonvoting common
stock, as set forth in the consolidation agreement, and if applicable, cash in
lieu of any fractional share.

Treatment of Stock Options

     At the effective time of the consolidation, automatically and without any
action on the part of the holder of a Craig or Reading stock option, each
outstanding stock option of Craig and Reading outstanding at the effective time
of the consolidation will be assumed by Citadel and become an option to purchase
shares of either Citadel nonvoting common stock or Citadel voting common stock,
as specified in a written election by the holder of such option.  If no election
is made, a Craig option holder or Reading option holder will receive options to
purchase Citadel nonvoting common stock.  The number of shares of Citadel
nonvoting common stock or voting common stock purchasable under the options will
be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Craig or Reading stock, as
applicable, issuable upon the exercise of such option by the applicable
conversion ratio for Craig stock or Reading stock in the consolidation.  The
number of shares of Citadel common stock purchasable under the options will be
rounded down to the nearest whole share, without payment of cash for any
fractional shares.  The options will be exercisable at an exercise price per
share equal to the per share exercise price of such Craig or Reading option
divided by the applicable conversion ratio for such stock in the consolidation,
and otherwise upon the same terms and conditions as such outstanding options to
purchase the Craig and Reading options.  In each case, the exercise price will
be rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

     Following the consolidation, Citadel will file a registration statement
with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering the shares of Citadel
common stock issuable with respect to the options assumed in the consolidation.

such shares by them must be registered or an exemption found thereto.  Further,
the affiliate agreement states that Citadel will be entitled to: (1) issue stop
transfer instructions to the transfer agent with respect to the transfer of such
affiliates' shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock and (2) place legends on
the such certificates, which state that such certificates were issued in a Rule
145 transaction and any resale of such stock must be in compliance with Rule 145
or an available exemption from registration under the Securities Act.

               PROPOSAL TO AMEND CITADEL'S 1999 STOCK OPTION PLAN

     This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes the proposal
to amend Citadel's 1999 stock option plan in connection with the consolidation.
The amendment will increase the number of shares of Citadel common stock
reserved for issuance under the plan from 666,000 to 1,600,000.  The purposes of
the amendment are to allow for Citadel's assumption of currently outstanding
Craig stock options and Reading stock options as provided in the consolidation
agreement and to afford the consolidated company more available options for
grant to participants in its options plan.  The amendment will become effective,
assuming it is approved at the joint meetings, concurrently with the
effectiveness of the consolidation, assuming it is completed.  The text of the
amendment is attached as ANNEX C to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

1999 Stock Option Plan

     Citadel's 1999 stock option plan was adopted by Citadel's board of
directors on November 18, 1999 and approved by the stockholders of Citadel on
September 12, 2000.

     The key terms of Citadel's stock option plan are outlined below:

          .    Currently, the plan provides that options covering no more than
666,000 shares of common stock may be granted under the plan; however, if the
proposed amendment to the plan is approved by Citadel stockholders at the joint
meetings, this limitation will be increased to 1,600,000.

          .    No eligible person may be granted options covering more than
100,000 shares in any twelve-month period.

          .    The stock option plan provides for the grant of options to
officers, directors, employees and consultants of Citadel and its affiliates.

          .    The plan is administered by the Citadel board of directors or a
committee of the board, which has discretion to select the optionees and to
establish the terms and conditions of each option, subject to the provisions of
the plan. If necessary in order to comply with Rule 16b-3 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, or the
Code, the committee will, in the board's discretion, be comprised solely of
"non-employee directors" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 and "outside
directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code.

          .    Options granted under the plan may be "incentive stock options"
as defined in Section 422 of the Code, or nonqualified options, as designated in
the relevant stock option agreement.

          .    The exercise price of incentive stock options may not be less
than the fair market value of Citadel's common stock as of the date of grant or
110% of the fair market value if the grant is to an employee who owns more than
10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of capital stock of
Citadel or of any affiliate.

          .    Nonqualified options may be granted under the plan at an exercise
price less than the fair market value of Citadel common stock on the date of
grant. The exercise price of any grant to any person who owns more than 10% of
the total combined voting power of all classes of capital stock of Citadel or of
any affiliate may not be less than 110% of the fair market value of the stock at
the time of the grant.

          .    In general, upon termination of employment of an optionee, all
options granted to such person that are not exercisable on the date of such
termination will immediately terminate, and any options that are exercisable may
be exercised within 90 days of the termination of employment.

          .    Options may not be exercised more than ten years after the grant
date (five years after the grant date if the grant is an incentive stock option
to any person who owns more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all
classes of Citadel capital stock).

          .    Except with the express approval of the administrator with
respect to nonqualified options, options granted under the stock option plan are
not transferable and may be exercised only by the respective grantees during
their lifetime or by their heirs, executors or administrators in the event of
death.

          .    Shares subject to options granted under the option plan which
expire, terminate or are cancelled without being exercised will be reserved for
subsequently granted options. The number and exercise prices of options
outstanding are subject to adjustment in the case of certain transactions such
as stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations,
combinations or reclassifications, or if Citadel effects a spin-off of a
subsidiary.

          .    The plan is effective for ten years, unless sooner terminated or
suspended.

Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences

     If an option is treated as an incentive stock option, the optionee will
recognize no income upon grant or exercise of the option unless the alternative
minimum tax rules apply.  Upon an optionee's sale of the shares (assuming that
the sale occurs at least two years after grant of the option and at least one
year after exercise of the option), any gain will be taxed to the optionee under
beneficial capital gains tax rates.  If the optionee disposes of the shares
prior to the expiration of the above holding periods, then the optionee will
recognize ordinary income in an amount generally measured as the difference
between the exercise price and the lower of the fair market value of the shares
at the exercise date or the sale price of the shares.  Any gain or loss
recognized on such a premature sale of the shares in excess of the amount
treated as ordinary income will be capital gain or loss.  The maximum federal
tax rate applicable to shares held for more than 12 months, but less than 18
months, is 28% and the maximum federal tax rate applicable to shares held for at
least 18 months is 20%.

     All other options granted under Citadel's stock option plan are
nonqualified stock options and will not qualify for any special tax benefits to
the optionee.  An optionee generally will not recognize any taxable income at
the time he or she is granted a nonqualified stock option.  However, upon
exercise of the nonqualified stock option, the optionee will recognize ordinary
income for federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the excess of the
then fair market value of each share over its exercise price.  Upon an
optionee's resale of such shares, any difference between the sale price and the
fair market value of such shares on the date of exercise will be treated as
capital gain or loss and will generally qualify for beneficial capital gains
rates depending on the length of the holding period.

     Subject to the limits on deductibility of employee remuneration under
Section 162(m) of the Code, Citadel will generally be entitled to a tax
deduction in the amount that an optionee recognizes as ordinary income with
respect to an option.  Options granted to executive officers under the plan are
intended to qualify as performance-based compensation for purposes of Section
162(m) of the Code, and Citadel will generally be entitled to a tax deduction in
the amount recognized by such officers upon exercise of the options.  No tax
authority or court has ruled on the applicability of Section 162(m) to the plan,
and any final determination of the deductibility of amounts realized upon
exercise of an option granted under the plan could ultimately be made by the
Internal Revenue Service or a court having final jurisdiction with respect to
the matter.  Citadel retains the right to grant options under the stock option
plan in accordance with the terms of the plan regardless of any final
determination as to the applicability of Section 162(m) of the Code to these
grants.

Vote Required

     Approval of the proposal to amend Citadel's 1999 stock option plan will
require the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Citadel
voting common stock present and voted at the Citadel annual meeting.  James J.
Cotter, Craig and Reading are obligated under the consolidation agreement to
vote 981,063 shares, representing approximately 49% of the outstanding shares of
Citadel voting common stock, in favor of the proposal.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors as to the Amendment

     The Citadel board of directors unanimously approved the amendment to
Citadel's 1999 stock option plan and recommends that Citadel stockholders vote
FOR the proposal to adopt the amendment to the plan.

             PROPOSAL TO AMEND CITADEL'S ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION

     This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes the proposal
to amend Citadel's articles of incorporation in connection with the
consolidation, assuming it is approved at the joint meetings and completed.  The
amendment to Citadel's articles of incorporation is attached as ANNEX D to this
joint proxy statement/prospectus.

     On August 16, 2001, in connection with its approval of the consolidation
agreement, the board of directors of Citadel approved an amendment to the
articles of incorporation of Citadel to change the name of the company from
Citadel Holding Corporation to "Reading International, Inc."  The amendment will
become effective, assuming it is approved at the joint meetings, concurrently
with the effective date of the consolidation, assuming it is completed.

     We believe that the new name will better reflect the consolidated company's
business following completion of the consolidation.

     Following the name change, Citadel's outstanding shares of common stock
will continue to be represented by existing stock certificates unless and until
they are submitted to Citadel's transfer agent in connection with a proposed
share transfer.  YOU SHOULD NOT SEND IN ANY STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH YOUR CITADEL
PROXY.

Vote Required

     Approval of the proposal to amend Citadel's articles of incorporation will
require the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Citadel
voting common stock.  James J. Cotter, Craig and Reading are obligated under the
consolidation agreement to vote 981,063 shares, representing approximately 49%
of the outstanding shares of Citadel voting common stock, in favor of the
proposal.

Recommendation of Board of Directors as to the Amendment

     The Citadel board of directors unanimously approved the amendment to
Citadel's articles of incorporation and recommends that Citadel stockholders
vote FOR the proposal to adopt the amendment.

                      PROPOSAL TO RATIFY AND APPROVE THE
                   FORM OF CITADEL INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT

     This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus provides a brief
summary of the material provisions of the form of indemnification agreement
between Citadel and its directors and officers.  The form of the Citadel
indemnification agreement is attached as ANNEX E to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.  This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the form of Citadel indemnification agreement.  The proposal to ratify and
approve the form of Citadel indemnification agreement is unrelated to the
consolidation and related proposals.

Indemnification

          .    The form of indemnification agreement provides that Citadel
agrees to hold harmless and indemnify its directors and officers:

          .    To the fullest extent authorized or permitted by Nevada Revised
Statutes Sections 78.751 and 78.7502, or any successor statute or amendment
thereof, or any other statutory provisions authorizing or permitting such
indemnification that is adopted after the date of the indemnification agreement.

          .    Against any and all expenses, judgment damages, fines, penalties
and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or for the
officer or director in connection with any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative to

which the officer or director is made a party as a result of the fact that at
the time of the act or omission, which is the subject matter of such action
covered by the indemnification agreement, the officer or director was an
officer, director, employee or agent of Citadel or serving at the request of
Citadel as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.

          .    To the fullest extent as may be provided under the non-
exclusivity indemnification provisions of the bylaws of Citadel and Nevada
Revised Statutes Sections 78.751 and 78.7502.

          .    The provisions of the form of indemnification agreement are in
addition to, and not in limitation of, the indemnification provisions of
Citadel's bylaws and the statutes mentioned.

Limitations on Indemnification

          .    Under the form of indemnification agreement, no indemnity will be
paid by Citadel to the extent that:

          .    Payment for indemnification is actually made to the officer or
director under a valid and collectible insurance policy or policies, except with
respect to any excess amount due beyond the amount of payment to the officer or
director under such insurance policy or policies. Notwithstanding the
availability of such insurance policy or policies, the officer or director also
may claim indemnification from Citadel pursuant to the indemnification agreement
by assigning to Citadel in writing any claims under such insurance policy or
policies to the extent of the amount paid by Citadel to the officer or director.

          .    The officer or director is indemnified by Citadel, otherwise than
pursuant to the indemnification agreement.

          .    Final judgment is rendered against the officer or director for
the payment of dividends or other distributions to stockholders of Citadel in
violation of the provisions of Subsection 2 of Nevada Revised Statutes Section
78.300, as amended.

          .    Final judgment is rendered against the officer or director for an
accounting of profits made from the purchase or sale by the officer or director
of securities of Citadel pursuant to the provisions of Section 16(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or other similar provisions of any
federal, state or local statutory law.

          .    The conduct of the officer or director giving rise to the claim
for indemnification is finally adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to
have been a breach of fiduciary duty which involved intentional misconduct,
fraud or a knowing violation of the law.

          .    Except as otherwise provided in the indemnification agreement, in
connection with all or any part of a suit or other proceeding which is initiated
or maintained by or on behalf of the officer or director, or any suit or other
proceeding by the officer or director against Citadel or its directors,
officers, employees or other agents, unless (1) such indemnification is
expressly required by Nevada law; (2) the suit or other proceeding was expressly
authorized by an official act of the board of directors of Citadel or (3) such
indemnification is provided by Citadel, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the
powers vested in it under Nevada law.

Advancement of Expenses

     Under the form of indemnification agreement, in the event the officer or
director incurs costs or expenses in connection with the defense of any such
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding,
Citadel agrees to pay such costs or expenses as they are incurred and in advance
of the final disposition of the action, suit or proceeding within 30 calendar
days of submission of bills or vouchers for such costs or expenses, provided
that the officer or director delivers to Citadel prior to such payment a written
undertaking to repay the amount paid if it is ultimately determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction that the officer or director is not entitled to
indemnification.  However, in the case of an action brought against the

officer or director by Citadel pursuant to the provisions of Section 16(b) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or other similar provisions of
any federal, state or local statutory law for an accounting of profits made from
the purchase or sale by the officer or director of securities of Citadel, the
costs and expenses of the officer or director will not be advanced unless such
advancement is approved by the board of directors of Citadel by a majority vote
of a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to the action, suit or
proceeding, or, if such a quorum cannot be obtained, by independent legal
counsel in a written opinion that such indemnification is proper in the
circumstances.

Vote Required

     Approval of the proposal to ratify and approve the form of Citadel
indemnification agreement will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Citadel voting common stock present and voted at the
Citadel annual meeting.  James J. Cotter, Craig and Reading are obligated under
the consolidation agreement to vote 981,063 shares, representing approximately
49% of the outstanding shares of Citadel voting common stock, in favor of the
proposal.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors as to the Form of Indemnification
Agreement

     The Citadel board of directors unanimously approved the form of
indemnification agreement between Citadel and its officers and directors and
recommends that Citadel stockholders vote FOR the proposal to ratify and approve
the form of Citadel indemnification agreement.

                      PROPOSAL TO ELECT CITADEL DIRECTORS

     This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes the proposal
to elect directors of Citadel.  At the joint meetings, Citadel voting common
stockholders will be asked to vote on the election of five directors.  The five
nominees receiving the highest number of votes will be elected directors of
Citadel, whether or not the consolidation is completed.  All directors elected

Meetings and Committees of the Board of Directors

the Citadel board of directors.  Each of the directors attended at least 75% of
the board meetings and of the meetings of the board committees held after the
election of such individual to the board or such committee.

     Citadel currently has standing audit, executive, conflicts, compensation
and stock option committees.  The Board of Directors does not have a nominating
committee.

     The members of the audit committee are Alfred Villasenor, Jr., who serves
as Chairman, Robert M. Loeffler and William C. Soady. During 2000, the audit
committee held one meeting. On May 23, 2000 the board adopted a new audit
committee charter, which requires the committee to meet at least four times
annually and at least once separately with the independent auditors and
management. The board of directors included additional provisions in the new
charter to strengthen the audit committee's function of overseeing the quality
and integrity of the accounting, audit, internal control and financial reporting
policies and practices of Citadel. The charter includes professional criteria
for the members of the audit committee and empowers the audit committee to
investigate any matter for which it has oversight authority. The audit
committee, among other things, makes recommendations to the board concerning the
engagement of Citadel's independent auditors; monitors and reviews the
performance of Citadel's independent auditors; reviews with management and the
independent auditor Citadel's financial statements, including the matters
required for discussion under Statement of Auditing Standards No. 61; monitors
the adequacy of Citadel's operating and internal controls; discusses with
management legal matters that may have a material impact on Citadel's financial
statements; and issues an annual report to be included in Citadel's proxy
statement as required by the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

     The members of the executive committee are James J. Cotter, who serves as
Chairman, S. Craig Tompkins and Alfred Villasenor, Jr. The executive committee
exercises the authority of the board of directors in the management of the
business and affairs of the Citadel between meetings of the board of directors.

     The members of the conflicts Committee are William C. Soady, the Chairman,
and Alfred Villasenor, Jr. The conflicts committee was chartered to consider and
make recommendations with respect to all matters as to which one or more
directors may have conflicts of interest.

     The compensation committee is currently comprised of William C. Soady, the
Chairman, and Alfred Villasenor, Jr. The compensation committee is responsible
for recommending to the board of directors remuneration for executive officers
of Citadel. It is currently Citadel's policy that directors who are executive
officers and whose compensation is at issue are not involved in the discussion
of, or voting on, such compensation. The compensation committee also currently
administers Citadel's stock option plans.

Vote Required

     The five nominees receiving a plurality of the votes cast, in person or by
proxy, at the Citadel annual meeting will be elected to the Citadel board of
directors. James J. Cotter, Craig and Reading have advised Citadel that they
intend to vote 981,063 shares, representing approximately 49% of the outstanding
shares of Citadel voting common stock, in favor of the election of the board
nominees named.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors as to the Election of Directors

     Stockholders are advised to obtain current market quotations. No assurance
can be given as to the market prices of Craig common stock or common preference
stock or of Reading common stock at any time before the consummation of
consolidation, or as to the market price of Citadel nonvoting common stock or
voting common stock at any time after consolidation. The conversion ratios are
fixed in the consolidation agreement, and we do not intend to adjust the
conversion ratios to compensate Craig stockholders simply for any decrease, in
the market price of Reading common stock or Citadel nonvoting common stock which
could occur before the consolidation becomes effective or simply to compensate
Reading stockholders for any decreases in the market prices of Craig common
stock or common preference stock or of Citadel nonvoting common stock which
might occur before the consolidation becomes effective. Similarly, the
conversion ratios will not be adjusted simply to compensate Citadel stockholders
for any decreases in the market prices of Craig common stock or common
preference stock or of Reading common stock which might occur before the
consolidation becomes effective.

Dividends

     None of the companies has ever declared or paid cash dividends on its
common stock.

     Pursuant to the consolidation agreement, each of the companies has agreed
not to pay cash dividends pending the consummation of consolidation. If the
consolidation is not completed, each of the boards of directors of Citadel,
Craig and Reading anticipates that it would continue its prior policy of
retaining all earnings to finance the operation and expansion of its business.
Citadel also expects to retain all earnings for use in the operation and
expansion of its business and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends
after the consolidation.

                  UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATION CONDENSED
                         COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     On August 17, 2001, Citadel, Craig and Reading entered into the
consolidation agreement providing for the consolidation of Craig and Reading
with Citadel. The transaction is to be accounted for as a purchase of Craig and
Reading by Citadel. Under the terms of the consolidation agreement, each issued
and outstanding share of Craig common stock and common preference stock will
automatically be converted into 1.17 shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock
and each issued and outstanding share of Reading common stock will automatically
be converted into 1.25 shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock. Additionally,
stock options to purchase common stock or common preference stock of Craig and
common stock of Reading will automatically be converted into stock options to
purchase an equivalent number of shares of either Citadel voting common stock or
nonvoting common stock, at each option holder's election.

     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements of Citadel
give effect to the consolidation, based on a preliminary allocation of the total
purchase cost. The historical financial information has been derived from the
respective historical financial statements of Citadel, Craig and Reading, and
should be read in conjunction with these financial statements and the related
notes contained in the companies' annual reports and quarterly reports that have
been furnished with this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations combines
Citadel's, Craig's and Reading's historical statements of operations for the
year ended December 31, 2000 and the six months ended June 20, 2001 and gives
effect to the consolidation, including the amortization of goodwill, as if the
consolidation occurred on January 1, 2000. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined balance sheet assumes the consolidation took place as of June 30, 2001,
and allocates the total purchase consideration to the fair values of the assets
and liabilities of Craig and Reading, based on a preliminary valuation.

     The total estimated purchase consideration of the consolidation has been
allocated on a preliminary basis to assets and liabilities based on management's
estimates of their fair value, with the excess costs over the net assets
acquired allocated to goodwill. This allocation is subject to change pending a
final analysis of the total purchase cost and the fair value of the assets and
liabilities acquired. The impact of these changes could be material.

     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is
presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of
the operating results or financial position that would have occurred if the
consolidation had been consummated at the dates indicated, nor is it necessarily
indicative of future operating results or financial position of the combined
company.

___________________________________

  (A)  The consolidated pro forma results presented above do not reflect the
       anticipated savings in the general and administrative expenses of
       approximately $1,000,000 per year. By combining the three companies,
       management expect to eliminate duplication of certain general and
       administrative expenses such as SEC filing and reporting costs, audit
       expenses, and directors' fees.
  (B)  Reading is a stand-alone publicly traded company. Craig owns
       approximately 78% of Reading and consolidates the accounts of Reading.
       Reading's income and expenses are eliminated here to avoid double
       counting of its results for the year ended December 31, 2000.
  (C)  Citadel owns all 70,000 shares issued and outstanding of Reading Series A
       convertible preferred stock, and is entitled to receive quarterly
       cumulative dividends at the annual rate of $455,000, or $113,570 per
       quarter. In consolidation, all dividends paid and received on the Series
       A preferred stock are eliminated.
  (D)  Reading and Craig own approximately 48.3% of the outstanding common stock
       of Citadel on a consolidated basis and record 48.3% of Citadel's net
       (loss) income as equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. In
       consolidation, the equity pick-up of Citadel's net loss by Craig and
       Reading is eliminated.
  (E)  Citadel, Craig and Reading have related party borrowings at December 31,
       2001. All interest expense and interest income recorded by the companies
       are eliminated in consolidation.
  (F)  The consolidated company will have 50% equity interest in the Angelika
       Film Center LLC, or AFC (with the other 50% equity interest owned by
       National Auto Credit, Inc.), and Citadel Cinemas Inc., a wholly owned
       subsidiary of Citadel, has the management rights to the Angelika Film
       Center & Cafe, the only operating assets of AFC. In the event of a
       deadlock between the members, the deciding vote is cast by the Chairman
       of Reading. Accordingly, the consolidated company will consolidate the
       operations of AFC for financial reporting purposes and eliminate the
       equity income recorded by Citadel and Reading during the year ended
       December 31, 2000. Prior to the sale of 50% interest in AFC on April 5,
       2000, Reading consolidated the results of AFC, since it owned a 5/6th
       interest in the Angelika Film Center. Subsequent to the sale, Reading
       accounted for its remaining 1/6th interest in Angelika Film Center as an
       equity investment for the period from April 6 to December 31, 2000. As a
       result, the AFC adjustment column above represents AFC's operating
       results for the period from April 6 to December 31, 2000.
  (G)  Management expects to incur direct transaction costs of approximately
       $600,000 in connection with the consolidation. Of this amount,
       approximately $200,000 will be capitalized as start-up costs and
       amortized over 20 years. Had the consolidation of the three companies
       taken place as of January 1, 2000, the consolidated company would have
       recorded an additional $22,000 in amortization of such start-up costs.
  (H)  Reading provided consulting service to Citadel during the year ended
       December 31, 2000. All such consulting fee income and expense recorded by
       the companies are eliminated in consolidation.
  (I)  Based on the exchange ratio of 1.17 shares of Citadel's nonvoting common
       stock for each share of Craig common stock and common preference stock
       and 1.25 shares of Citadel's nonvoting common stock for each share of
       Reading common stock, management expects post-consolidation shares
       outstanding of 21,821,318 (net of treasury shares).

________________________________

  (A)  The consolidated pro forma results presented above do not reflect the
       anticipated savings in the general and administrative expenses of
       approximately $1,000,000 per year. By combining the three companies,
       management expect to eliminate duplication of certain general and
       administrative expenses such as SEC filing and reporting costs, audit
       expenses and directors' fees.
  (B)  Reading is a stand-alone publicly traded company. Craig owns
       approximately 78% of Reading and consolidates the accounts of Reading.
       Reading's income and expenses are eliminated here to avoid double
       counting of its results for the six months ended June 30, 2001.
  (C)  Citadel owns all 70,000 shares issued and outstanding of Reading's Series
       A convertible preferred stock, and is entitled to receive quarterly
       cumulative dividends at the annual rate of $455,000, or $113,570 per
       quarter. In consolidation, all dividends paid and received on the Series
       A preferred stock are eliminated.
  (D)  Reading and Craig own approximately 48.3% of the outstanding common stock
       of Citadel on a consolidated basis and record 48.3% of Citadel's net
       (loss) income as equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. In
       consolidation, the equity pick-up of Citadel's net loss by Craig and
       Reading is eliminated.
  (E)  Citadel, Craig, and Reading have related party borrowings at June 30,
       2001. All interest expense and interest income recorded by the companies
       are eliminated in consolidation.
  (F)  The consolidated company will have 50% equity interest in the AFC (with
       the other 50% equity interest owned by National Auto Credit, Inc.) and
       Citadel Cinemas, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Citadel, has the
       management rights to the Angelika Film Center & Cafe, the only operating
       assets of AFC. In the event of a deadlock between the members, the
       deciding vote is cast by the Chairman of Reading. Accordingly, the
       consolidated company will consolidated the operations of AFC for
       financial reporting purposes and eliminate the equity income recorded by
       Citadel during the six months ended June 30, 2001.
  (G)  Management expects to incur direct transaction costs of approximately
       $600,000 in connection with the consolidation. Of this amount,
       approximately $200,000 will be capitalized as start-up costs and
       amortized over 20 years. Had the consolidation of the three companies
       taken place as of January 1, 2001, the consolidated company would have
       recorded an additional $11,000 in amortization of such start-up costs.
  (H)  Based on the exchange ratio of 1.17 shares of Citadel's nonvoting common
       stock for each share of Craig common stock and common preference stock
       and 1.25 shares of Citadel's nonvoting common stock for each share of
       Reading common stock, management expects post-consolidation shares
       outstanding of 21,821,318 (net of treasury shares)

 [A]  Reading is a stand-alone publicly traded company. Craig owns approximately
      78% of Reading and consolidates the accounts of Reading for financial
      reporting purposes. Accordingly, the accounts of Reading are eliminated as
      its assets and liabilities are already reflected in the consolidated
      balance sheet of Craig.
 [B]  The consolidated company will have 50% equity interest in the AFC (with
      the other 50% equity interest owned by National Auto Credit, Inc.) and
      Citadel Cinemas, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Citadel, has the
      management rights to the Angelika Film Center & Cafe, the only operating
      assets of AFC. In the event of a deadlock between the members, the
      deciding vote is cast by the Chairman of Reading. Accordingly, the
      consolidated company will consolidate AFC for financial reporting
      purposes. The adjustments represent Reading's and Citadel's step-up in
      basis amounting to approximately $1,639,000 and $160,000, respectively.
 [C]  Value estimates for Craig's and Reading's real estate and other investment
      assets have been calculated by Marshall & Stevens. As the consolidation of
      the three companies are recorded under the purchase accounting method, the
      fair value will replace the book value of certain assets.
 [D]  The amount represents additional miscellaneous contingent liabilities.
 [E]  The minority interest or Reading is duplicated on Craig's consolidated
      balance sheet. This is eliminated in consolidation.
 [F]  All cross-ownership of common and preferred stock, note payable/receivable
      transactions between Citadel, Craig and Reading are eliminated in
      consolidation.
 [G]  Record the par value of the estimated 18,696,517 shares of Citadel
      nonvoting common stock that will be issued and outstanding upon
      consolidation of the three companies. The 18,696,517 shares is calculated
      as 21,551,327 shares to be issued, less 2,854,810 treasury shares.
 [H]  Management expects to incur direct transaction costs of approximately
      $600,000 in connection with the consolidation. Of this amount,
      approximately $200,000 will be capitalized as start-up costs and amortized
      over 20 years. Had the consolidation of the three companies taken place as
      of January 1, 2001, the consolidated company would have recorded an
      additional $11,000 in amortization of such start-up costs.
 [I]  The pro forma balance sheet has been prepared to reflect the consolidation
      of Craig and Reading by Citadel for 21,551,327 shares of Citadel nonvoting
      common stock.

COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF CITADEL NONVOTING COMMON STOCK, CRAIG COMMON
                       STOCK AND COMMON PREFERENCE STOCK

                           AND READING COMMON STOCK

     This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes material
differences between the rights of holders of Craig common stock and common
preference stock and holders of Reading common stock and the rights of holders
of Citadel nonvoting common stock.  The rights compared are those found in the
respective companies' articles of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of the
corporation laws of Nevada, where each of the companies is incorporated.  While
we believe that these descriptions address the material differences, this
summary may not contain all of the information that is important to the
stockholders of Craig and Reading.  Craig and Reading stockholders should read
carefully this entire joint proxy statement/prospectus and the documents
referred to in this summary for a more complete understanding of the differences
between the rights of Craig stockholders and Reading stockholders, on the one
hand, and the rights of stockholders of Citadel, on the other.

     Craig's articles of incorporation and bylaws currently govern the rights of
stockholders of Craig.  Reading's articles of incorporation and bylaws currently
govern the rights of stockholders of Reading.  After completion of the
consolidation, the stockholders of both Craig and Reading will become
stockholders of Citadel.  As a result, the rights of the former Craig and
Reading stockholders will be governed by Citadel's articles of incorporation and
bylaws.

     As a result of the consolidation, Craig and Reading common stockholders
will become holders of Citadel nonvoting common stock.  The following is a
summary of a comparison among rights of holders of Citadel stock, Craig stock
and Reading stock.  Included in this summary is a comparison of the differences
between the articles and bylaws of each company and Nevada law as set forth in
the Nevada Revised Statutes.  This summary is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of Citadel's articles of incorporation and bylaws,
Craig's articles of incorporation and bylaws and Reading's articles of
incorporation and bylaws.  Furthermore, the description of the Nevada Revised
Statutes is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
Nevada Revised Statutes.

Authorized Common Stock

     Citadel

     The Citadel articles of incorporation authorize 20,000,000 shares of voting
common stock, $0.01 par value, and 100,000,000 shares of nonvoting common stock,
$0.01 par value.  There are currently shares of both classes of common stock
outstanding.

     The Citadel articles authorize 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01
par value, in one or more series comprising such number of shares and having
such voting power, or no voting power, and such rights, preferences and
limitations, as the Citadel board of directors may determine.  No preferred
shares have been issued or are outstanding.

     The holders of shares of the Citadel nonvoting common stock have no voting
rights except that the holders of the shares of Citadel nonvoting common stock
are entitled to vote as a separate class on any amendments to Citadel's articles
of incorporation or any merger if either would adversely affect such nonvoting
common stockholders' rights, privileges or preferences, or on any liquidation or
dissolution in which certain nonvoting common stockholders would receive
securities with rights, privileges or preferences less beneficial than those
held by them as holders of nonvoting common stock.

     Except for voting power, the Citadel articles entitle holders of Citadel
nonvoting common stock to the same rights, preferences, and privileges with
respect to dividends, distributions or any liquidation or dissolution as holders
of Citadel voting common stock.

     Craig

     Craig's articles of incorporation authorize 7,500,000 shares of Class A
common stock, $0.25 par value, and 20,000,00 shares of Class B common stock,
$0.01 par value.  Currently, only shares of the Class A common stock are issued
and outstanding.  Craig's articles of incorporation also authorize 50,000,000
shares of common preference stock.  There are currently no shares of common
preference stock issued and outstanding.

     Craig articles of incorporation authorize 1,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, $0.01 par value, in one or more series comprising such number of shares

shares have been issued or are outstanding.

     Under the Craig's articles of incorporation, holders shares of Craig common
stock are entitled to 30 votes per share of common stock on all matters
submitted to a vote of the Craig stockholders.  Holders of shares of common
preference stock are is entitled to only one vote per share of common preference

     The Craig articles of incorporation provide that holders of Craig common
stock are entitled to share ratably in any dividends declared by the Craig board
of directors, subject to the dividend rights of the holders of Craig common
preference stock and of any holders of preferred stock then outstanding.

     In the event of liquidation or dissolution, the Craig articles of
incorporation provide that all holders of Craig preference common stock will
receive a distribution of the assets in the amount of $5 per share; however,
such holders of Craig common preference stock will not be entitled to a payment
from the distribution of the assets of more than $5 until the holders of every
other class of stock ranking junior to such common preference stock are paid $5
per share.  After such payments have been made, the holders of the common stock
and common preference stock will be entitled to an equal share-for-share
distribution of any remaining assets, as if a single class.

     Reading

     The Reading articles of incorporation authorize 25,000,000 shares of common
stock, par value $0.001.

     The Reading articles of incorporation authorize 10,000,000 shares of
preferred stock.  Reading's certificate of designation creates two classes of
preferred stock: Series A convertible preferred stock, $0.001 par value, of
which 70,000 shares are authorized, issued and outstanding, and Series B
convertible preferred stock, $0.001 par value, of which 550,000 shares are
authorized and issued and outstanding.

     Under Nevada law, each share of Reading common stock is entitled to one
vote on all matters submitted to a vote of Reading stockholders.  Under the
Reading certificate of designation, the holders of convertible preferred stock
are entitled to 9.64 votes for each share of such convertible preferred stock on
all matters submitted to a vote of the Reading stockholders.  The holders of
common stock and convertible preferred stock shall vote together as one class on
all matter submitted to a vote of the Reading's stockholders.

     Under Reading's certificate of designation, each share of convertible
preferred stock is entitled to receive a cumulative dividend, when declared by
the board of directors but only out of the funds legally available for dividend
payments, at an annual rate of $6.50; however, the Series B convertible
preferred stock will rank junior to the Series A convertible preferred stock.
Subject to the preferences of the convertible preferred stock, each share of
Reading common stock shall be entitled to share ratably in any dividends
declared by the board of directors.

     Under Reading's certificate of designation, upon liquidation or dissolution
of Reading, holders of shares of convertible preferred stock will be entitled to
receive before any other distribution of assets is made, a distribution in the
amount of $100 per share plus all dividends accrued and unpaid; however, the
Series B

convertible preferred stock will rank junior to the Series A convertible
preferred stock. After such distribution is made, any payments of remaining
assets will be evenly distributed among all of Reading's classes of stock.

Directors

     Number and Term

     The Nevada Revised Statutes require that a corporation have at least one
director and permits the articles of incorporation or bylaws to govern the
number and term of directors.

     The Citadel bylaws provide that the number of directors comprising the
Citadel board of directors be five.  The number of directors may be decreased or
increased, but in no event less than one or greater than ten.  Citadel's
directors are elected at the annual meeting of Citadel stockholders, and each
director so elected will hold the office until his successor is duly elected and
qualified or until his earlier resignation or removal.  The bylaws specifically
state that directors need not also be stockholders.

     The Craig bylaws provide that the number of directors comprising the Craig
board of directors be five.  The number of directors may be decreased or
increased, but in no event less than one or greater than ten. Craig's directors
are elected at the annual meeting of Craig stockholders, and each director so
elected will hold the office until his successor is duly elected and qualified
or until his earlier resignation or removal.  The bylaws specifically state that
directors need not also be stockholders.

     The Reading bylaws provide that the number of directors comprising the
Reading board of directors be six.  The number of directors may be decreased or
increased, but in no event less than one or greater than ten.  Reading's
directors are elected at the annual meeting of Reading stockholders, and each
director so elected will hold the office until his successor is duly elected and
qualified or until his earlier resignation or removal.  The bylaws specifically
state that directors need not also be stockholders.

     The Reading articles of incorporation provide that in the event that the
quarterly dividends payable on a series of the Reading convertible preferred
stock are in arrears in an aggregate amount equal to six full quarterly
dividends (which quarters need not be consecutive), the number of directors
constituting Reading's board of director will be increased by one for each
series so in default.  The holders of such Reading convertible preferred stock,
whose dividends are so in default, will have the special right to vote
separately as a single class, to elect one director of Reading to fill the newly
created directorship, either at the next annual meeting or at a special meeting,
at the request of the holders of 25% or more of shares of such convertible
preferred stock outstanding.  Each director elected by the holders of a series
of convertible preferred stock will hold office until the annual meeting of
stockholders next succeeding his election, or until his successor, if any, is
elected by such holders and qualified.  Any director elected by the holders of a
series of Reading convertible preferred stock may be removed only by a vote of
the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of such series.

     Removal

     The Nevada Revised Statutes provide that any director may be removed by the
vote of stockholders representing not less than two-thirds voting power of
issued and outstanding stock.

     The Citadel, Craig and Reading bylaws each provide that a director may be
removed by the affirmative vote of a two-thirds majority of the voting power of
issued and outstanding stock at any meeting called for such purpose or by
consent filed with the secretary, or in his absence, with any other officer.
Such removal is effective immediately, even if a successor is not simultaneously
elected.

     Vacancies

     Under the Nevada Revised Statutes, all vacancies, including those caused by
an increase in the number of directors, may be filled by a majority of the
remaining directors, even if less than a quorum.

     Citadel's, Craig's and Reading's bylaws each provide that vacancies in the
board of directors may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors,
though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and each directors
so elected will hold office until his successor is elected at an annual or a
special meeting of the stockholders.  A vacancy or vacancies in the board of
directors will be deemed to exist in case of death, resignation or removal of
any directors, or if the authorized number of directors is increased, or if the
stockholders fail, at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders at which
any director or directors are elected, to elect the full authorized number of
directors to be voted for at that meeting.

Special Meetings

     The Nevada Revised Statutes do not distinguish between regular and special
meetings of stockholders, but instead provide that notice of all meetings of
stockholders must be in writing and signed by the president or the vice-
president, secretary, assistant secretary or by any such person as the
corporation's bylaws may prescribe, permit or the directors may designate.

     Under the Citadel bylaws, special meetings of the stockholders may be
called by the chairman of the board or president or by the chairman of the board
or president at the written request of stockholders owning outstanding shares
representing a majority of the voting power of Citadel.

     Craig's bylaws provide that special meetings of stockholders may be called
by the chairman of the board, president or secretary at the written request of
the majority of the board of directors or at the written request of stockholders
owning outstanding shares representing a majority of the voting power of Craig.

     Reading's bylaws provide that special meetings of stockholders may be
called by the chairman of the board, vice-chairman of the board, chief executive
officer, president or secretary, or any three or more members of the board by
resolution or at the written request of stockholders owning outstanding shares
representing a majority of the voting power of Reading.

Action by Consent

     The Nevada Revised Statutes provide that unless the articles or bylaws
provide otherwise, any action that may be taken at a properly held meeting of
the stockholders may be taken by written consent of such stockholders.

     Under Citadel's, Craig's and Reading's bylaws, any action which may be
taken by the vote of stockholders at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if
authorized by the written consent of stockholders holding at least a majority of
the voting power, unless the provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes or of
Citadel's, Craig's and Reading's articles of incorporation, respectively,
require a different proportion of voting power to authorize such action in which
case such proportion of written consents shall be required.

Indemnification

     The Nevada revised statutes provide that a corporation may indemnify any
person who was or is a party to any civil, criminal or administrative action by
reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or
agent of the corporation.  Such indemnification may be made by the corporation
if the stockholders, a majority role of disinterested directors, or in certain
circumstances, an opinion issued by counsel, determines that such
indemnification is proper in the circumstances.  Alternatively, the articles of
incorporation, bylaws or agreement made by the corporation may provide for the
payment of expenses of such officers, directors, employees and agents of the
corporation incurred in defending any civil or criminal action.

     Under Citadel's, Craig's and Reading's bylaws, every person who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by
reason of the fact that such person or a person of whom that person is the legal
representative is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of each company
or is or was serving at the request of the Citadel, Craig and Reading,
respectively, or for its benefit as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another

corporation, or as its representative in a partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, shall be indemnified and held harmless to the fullest extent
legally permissible under the Nevada Revised Statutes against all expenses,
liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid
or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in
connection therewith. The expenses of officers, directors, employee or agents
incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding must be
paid by the Citadel, Craig and Reading, respectively, as they are incurred and
in advance of the final disposition of the action, suit or proceeding upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director, officer, employee or
agent to repay the amount if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by Citadel,
Craig and Reading, respectively. Such right of indemnification shall be a
contract right which may be enforced in any manner desired by such person. Such
right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other right which such
directors, officers, employees or agents may have or hereafter acquire and,
without limiting the generality of such statement, they shall be entitled to
their respective rights of indemnification under any bylaw, agreement, vote of
stockholders, provision of law or otherwise.

               INFORMATION REGARDING CITADEL, CRAIG AND READING

Citadel Holding Corporation

     In the consolidation agreement, Citadel, Craig and Reading have agreed to

     The following table sets forth as of July 31, 2001, information with
respect to the beneficial ownership of the common stock of Reading as to:

          .  Each person known by Reading to own beneficially more than 5% of
the outstanding shares of its common stock.

          .  All of Reading's directors and executive officers as a group.

     Unless otherwise indicated below, each person or entity named below has an
address in care of Reading's principal executive offices. Beneficial ownership
is determined in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission.  Shares of common stock subject to options that are presently
exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of July 31, 2001 are deemed
outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of the person
or entity holding the options, but are not treated as outstanding for the
purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person or entity.
The numbers reflected in the percentage ownership columns are based on 7,449,364
shares of Reading common stock outstanding as of July 31, 2001.  The calculation
of the percent of voting stock gives effect to the voting rights of Reading's
outstanding shares of Series A convertible preferred stock, all of which are
owned by a subsidiary of Citadel, and Series B convertible preferred stock, all
of which are owned by Craig.  The holders of Reading Series A and Series B
convertible preferred stock are entitled to cast 9.64 votes per share, voting
together with the holders of Reading common stock as a single class, on any
matters presented to shareholders of  Reading, except as required by law.
Unless otherwise indicated below, the persons and entities named in the table

beneficially owned, subject to community property laws where applicable.  An
asterisk denotes beneficial ownership of less than 1%.

     ended December 31, 2000 reflects approximately 34% of Mr. Matyczynski's
     compensation which was allocated to Citadel. Mr. Matyczynski's total
     compensation earned in aggregate totaled approximately $180,000 plus
     $12,000 in bonus. Mr. Matyczynski's aggregate compensation did not exceed
     $100,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999.
(6)  Prior to September 20, 2000, City Cinemas, a third-party affiliate, and

     the assets of City Cinemas and appointed Mr. Smerling as its President. Mr.
     Smerling also serves as the President and a director of Reading. Mr.
     Smerling's salary shown above for the year ended December 31, 2000 reflects

Limitation on Directors' Liability and Indemnification

     The Citadel articles of incorporation limit the liability of directors to
the maximum extent permitted by Nevada law.  Nevada law provides that directors
of a corporation will not be personally liable for monetary damages for breach
of their fiduciary duties as directors, except liability for any of the
following acts:

     Nevada law provides that except for certain regulatory exceptions, a
director is not individually liable to the corporation or its stockholders for
any damages as a result of any act or failure to act in his capacity as a
director unless it is proven that:  (i) his act or failure to act constituted a
breach of his fiduciary duties as a director; and (ii) his breach of those
duties involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of the law.
This limitation of liability does not apply to liabilities arising under the
federal securities laws and does not affect the availability of equitable
remedies such as injunctive relief or rescission.

     The Citadel bylaws provide that Citadel will indemnify its directors and
executive officers and other corporate agents to the fullest extent permitted by
law. We believe that indemnification under the Citadel bylaws covers at least
negligence and gross negligence on the part of indemnified parties. Our bylaws
also permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director, employee
or other agent for any liability arising out of his or her actions in this
capacity, regardless of whether the bylaws would permit indemnification.

     We have entered into indemnification agreements to indemnify our directors
and executive officers, in addition to the indemnification provided for in our
certificate of incorporation and bylaws.  Stockholders of Citadel are being
asked to notify and approve the form of indemnification agreement as described
above in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.  These agreements, among other
things, provide for indemnification of our directors and executive officers for
many expenses, including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines and settlement
amounts incurred by any such person in any action or proceeding, including any
action by or in the right of Citadel, arising out of such person's services as a
director or executive officer of ours, any subsidiary of ours or any other
company or enterprise to which the person provided services at our request. We
believe that these provisions and agreements are necessary to attract and retain
qualified persons as directors and executive officers.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance

     Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires Citadel's
officers, directors and persons who own more than 10% of Citadel's common stock
to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.  The Securities and Exchange Commission rules also require
reporting persons to furnish Citadel with a copy of all Section 16(a) forms they
file.

     Based solely on a review of the copies of the forms which Citadel received
and written representations from Citadel officers and directors, we believe
that, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000, the reporting persons
complied with all applicable reporting requirements, with the exception of a
late report on Form 3 filed by Mr. Michael Foreman with respect to the
securities acquired by him in the merger of OBI described below under "Certain
Relationships and Related-Party Transactions."  We understand that the Form 3
was tardy because Mr. Forman realized only after the Form 3 was due that the
securities he had acquired put him over the 10% threshold for filing a Form 3.

Compensation Committee Report on Executive Compensation

     The report of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of
Citadel with respect to executive compensation shall not be deemed incorporated
by reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this
Proxy/Prospectus into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Securities Act"), or under the Exchange Act, except to the extent that
Citadel specifically incorporates this information by reference, and shall not
otherwise be deemed filed under such Acts.

     The Citadel Compensation Committee for the fiscal year ended December 31,
1999 was composed of James J. Cotter and Alfred Villasenor, Jr. In light of the
appointment of Mr. Cotter as the Chief Executive Officer of Citadel, and the
fact that Mr. Cotter's daughter Ellen Cotter had been appointed as the Vice
President of Citadel Cinemas and that it was anticipated that Mr. Cotter's
daughter Margaret Cotter would become the President of Liberty Theatres upon the
acquisition of that company by Citadel, Mr. Cotter resigned as a member of the
Citadel Compensation Committee on July 20, 2000 and was replaced by Mr. William
Soady. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee is now comprised entirely of
independent outside directors and has the same membership as the Citadel
Conflicts Committee.

     Historically, the Citadel Compensation Committee has been principally
responsible for reviewing the performance of, and determining the compensation
for, Citadel's executive officers. In this role, the Citadel Compensation
Committee has followed a philosophy that Citadel should have and maintain an
executive compensation program designed to attract and retain talented
executives and motivate them to achieve the business objectives of Citadel that
the Board of Directors believes will enhance stockholder value. Accordingly, the
Company's current compensation strategy is to pay a base salary sufficient to
attract and retain qualified executives and to supplement such base level
compensation with periodic cash bonuses in recognition of individual
performance, and from time-to- time, grant stock options designed to link the
executives' long-term compensation to appreciation in stockholder value. Citadel
has not, in recent periods, had any fixed bonus or incentive compensation plan.

     Citadel's compensation programs and the role of the Citadel compensation
committee are currently in a state of flux, as Citadel, Craig and Reading
recently have attempted to reduce general and administrative costs by
consolidating most of the general and administrative expense of the three
companies at the Craig level. Mr. Cotter is paid a director's fee of $45,000 for
his services as the Chairman of the Board. He receives no compensation for
serving as the President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Cotter is also paid an
annual consulting fee of $350,000 from Craig, of which approximately 34%, or
$119,000 was allocated to Citadel in 2000. In 2000, all of the executive
employees of the three companies became employees of Craig and are paid their
compensation and receive their employee benefits (other than stock options)
exclusively through Craig.. (The only exception to this was Mr. Robert Smerling
who, prior to the acquisition of the City Cinemas cinema chain by Citadel in
September 2000, was an employee of Reading and City Cinemas, and compensated
separately by, Reading and City Cinemas, Inc., and who, after the acquisition by
Citadel of the City Cinemas cinema chain, became an employee of both Reading and
Citadel Cinemas.) The cost of those Citadel executives employed by Craig have,
since January 2000, been allocated among Craig, Citadel and Reading based upon
the relative amount of time spent by each such executive on the business and
affairs of these companies. Initially, this allocation is done by the management
of the three companies (principally, by Mr. Andrzej Matyczynski, the Chief
Financial Officer of each of Citadel, Craig and Reading) and, thereafter, is
periodically reviewed and approved by the conflicts committees of Citadel, Craig
and Reading.

     Under this shared general and administrative structure, the compensation
programs of Citadel are principally overseen by Mr. James J. Cotter, the
Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and controlling stockholder of
Citadel, Craig and Reading, and the principal function of the committee has been
to serve as a sounding board for and advisor to Mr. Cotter with respect to
executive compensation matters. No discretionary bonuses were paid or awarded to
any of Citadel's executive officers by Citadel or by Craig in or with respect to
fiscal 2000, and no raises were given to any of Citadel's executive officers by
Citadel or by Craig in or with respect to fiscal 2000, other than discretionary
bonuses in the amount of $10,000 and $25,000 paid to Andrzej Matyczynski and
Brett Marsh, respectively, 34% of which was allocated to Citadel. These bonuses
were determined and authorized by Mr. Cotter, acting as the Chief Executive
Officer of Citadel, Craig and Reading. Also, Ms. Ellen Cotter, the daughter of
Mr. James J. Cotter, while an employee of Reading and prior to becoming an
executive of Citadel, did receive a raise, effective April 2000,in the base
salary paid to her by Reading from $147,600 to $150,000, annually. This raise
was authorized by Mr. Robert Smerling, the President of Reading. Ms. Cotter
became an executive officer of Citadel Cinemas in September 2000, and her
current compensation, at the annual rate referenced above, is included within
the general and administrative costs allocated among Citadel, Craig and Reading.
The Citadel Compensation Committee did not meet and has taken no action with
respect to executive compensation for fiscal 2000.

     In April 2000, stock options were granted to certain officers and directors
of Citadel. The grant of these stock options was recommended by Mr. Cotter, and
approved by the full Citadel Board of Directors, with each director receiving
options abstaining with respect to that portion of the approval relating to the
grant of options to such director. No options were granted to Mr. Cotter. Set
forth below is a table setting out the options granted.

Report of the Audit Committee

     The audit committee of the board of directors of Citadel has adopted a
written charter to govern its operation, a copy of which is attached hereto as
ANNEX F.  The audit committee currently is comprised of Messrs. Loeffler, Soady
and Villasenor, Jr., each of whom is an independent director as defined Section
121(A) of the American Stock Exchange listing standards.

     The audit committee of the Citadel board of directors oversees and monitors
the participation of Citadel's management and independent auditors throughout
the financial reporting process. No member of the Committee is employed by or
has any other material relationship with Citadel.

     In connection with its function to oversee and monitor the financial
reporting process, the audit committee has, among other things: reviewed and
discussed with Citadel's management the audited financial

statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000, discussed with Citadel's
independent auditors those matters required to be discussed by SAS 61
(Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards, AU 380); received the written
disclosures and letter from Citadel's independent auditors required by
Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1 (Independence Standards Board
Standard No. 1, Independence Discussions with Audit Committees); and discussed
with Citadel's independent auditors their independence in light of the nonaudit
services performed by them for Citadel.

     Based upon the foregoing, the audit committee recommended to the Citadel
board of directors that the audited financial statements be included in
Citadel's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2000.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

     Messrs. Soady and Villasenor, Jr. serve on Citadel's Compensation
Committee.  Mr. Cotter is the Chairman of the Board of Citadel, Craig and
Reading.  In addition, Mr. Cotter also served as the Chief Executive Officer of
the Citadel, Craig and Reading prior to October 16, 2000 and returned to such
positions following Mr. Braly's departure on December 27, 2000.  Mr. Cotter is
the controlling stockholder of Citadel.

Certain Relationships and Related-Party Transactions

     General

     Craig, Citadel and Reading operate as part of a group of commonly
controlled companies.  In part due to this overlapping ownership and control,
the companies have engaged in a significant number of related-party
transactions.

     We proposed the consolidation, in part, to address these related-party
transactions.  In the consolidation, the holders of outstanding common stock of
Craig and Reading, including Mr. Cotter, would receive shares of Citadel
nonvoting common stock.  As a result, Mr. Cotter's voting power will be reduced
from approximately 49% of Citadel currently to slightly under 25%.  This is due
to the fact that all of the Citadel voting common stock currently held by Craig
and Reading will become, in effect, treasury shares of Citadel after the
consolidation.

     However, in the consolidation, Citadel has agreed to assume the obligations
of Craig and Reading under their currently outstanding options, and has agreed
to allow the holders of such options an election to convert them into options to
acquire either Citadel voting or nonvoting common stock.  If Mr. Cotter elects
to receive options to acquire Citadel voting common stock then, in addition to
his beneficial ownership of slightly less than 25% of the outstanding shares of
Citadel voting common stock, he would hold options to acquire an additional
1,490,120 shares of Citadel voting common stock at the weighted-average exercise
price of $8.03 per share. If Mr. Cotter were to exercise these options in full,
the shares issued would increase Mr. Cotter's voting power to 64.3% of the total
voting power of Citadel after taking into account the effect of the issuance of
his option shares.

     Overlapping Management

     Prior to 2000, Citadel, Craig and Reading shared some common overhead and
administrative functions and provided various management services to one another
pursuant to various cost-sharing and consulting arrangements.  During 2000,
Reading moved its executive offices from Philadelphia to Los Angeles, and the
companies reorganized and consolidated their general and administrative staffs
at the Craig level.  Consequently, substantially all of the general and
administrative employees of Citadel and Reading are now employed directly by
Craig, and receive all of their health, medical, retirement and other benefits
from Craig.  The general and administrative expenses of Craig, Citadel and
Reading are periodically allocated, subject to the review and approval of the
conflicts committees of the boards of directors of Craig, Citadel and Reading,
in accordance with the amount of time spent by these employees providing
services for the respective companies.

     Entertainment Property Transactions

     In 1999, Reading determined that, in view of its limited capital resources
and the size and scope of its investments and commitments in Australia and New
Zealand, it should focus on its overseas activities and dispose of its domestic
entertainment assets.  During this same period, Citadel was searching for hard
asset investment opportunities in which to invest its cash ($21,440,000 at June
30, 1999).

     In the summer of that year, management began conversations with NAC, about
a potential transaction in which NAC would acquire, in partnership with Citadel,
all of the domestic cinema assets of Reading, including Reading's rights to
acquire the Manhattan-based City Cinemas chain.  In April 2000 Reading conveyed
a 50% membership interest in AFC to NAC in consideration of the issuance to it
of certain securities

and granted to NAC, in consideration of the payment by NAC to Reading of an
option fee of $500,000, an option to acquire the remainder of Readings domestic
cinema assets. That option was subject to the right of Citadel to participate as
a 50/50 partner with NAC in those assets, if Citadel were to so elect.
Ultimately, NAC determined not to exercise that option, and determined instead
to invest in a developmental "dot.com" company. Reading has resold to NAC the
securities it received in consideration of the transfer of the 50% membership
interest in AFC for gross proceeds of approximately $14,702,000.

     During this same period, Citadel determined to proceed with the acquisition
from Reading of the remainder of Reading's domestic entertainment assets.
During 2000 and the first quarter of 2001, Reading conveyed to Citadel the
following domestic entertainment assets:

     The City Cinemas and OBI Transactions.  In December, 1998 Reading entered
into an agreement (the "Sutton Agreement") with Messrs. James J. Cotter and
Michael Forman and certain of their affiliates (collectively referred to here in
as "Sutton") to acquire the City Cinemas chain (the "City Cinemas Transaction")
and OBI (now Liberty Theaters) (the "OBI Merger").  In 2000, Reading assigned
the Sutton Agreement to Citadel, and Citadel reimbursed Reading for the
$1,000,000 deposit Reading had made to Sutton under the Sutton Agreement.  In
September 2000, Citadel completed the City Cinemas Transaction and the OBI
Merger under which Citadel leased from Sutton, under a ten-year operating lease,
four cinemas, obtained certain management rights with respect to an additional
six cinemas, and purchased Sutton's 16.7% membership interest in AFC.  Citadel
also obtained an option, exercisable in ten years, to purchase the assets
subject to the lease, including two fee interests, for $48,000,000, and
committed to lending Sutton up to $28,000,000 in 2007.  Citadel also merged with
OBI, issuing Citadel common stock for all of the outstanding shares of OBI.  The
OBI stock was valued at $10,000,000 in the transaction.  As a result of the City
Cinemas Transaction, the management of Angelika Film Center & Cafe (Soho), and
two other domestic cinemas owned by Reading, was transferred from City Cinemas
to Citadel.

     The Domestic Cinema Transactions.  In September, 2000, Citadel also
acquired from Reading the rights to the Angelika Film Center & Cafe project in
Dallas, Texas - an eight screen Angelika style cinema currently under
construction and slated for opening in Summer, 2001 (the "Angelika Dallas"), in
a transaction in which Citadel reimbursed Reading its investment in the
development and assumed Reading's obligations under the lease.  Reading, in
turn, assigned to Citadel its interest in the lease and committed to reimburse
Citadel a portion of Citadel's investment in the Angelika Dallas if Citadel did
not achieve at least a 20% return on equity during the second year of operation
of the cinema.  In March 2001, Reading sold the remainder of its domestic cinema
assets (other than its residual 33.3% membership interest in AFC) to Citadel in
consideration of the issuance by Citadel of a two-year purchase-money promissory
note in the amount of $1,706,000.

     The Royal George Theatre Complex Transaction.  In March 1999, Reading
acquired the Royal George Theatre Complex for approximately $3,000,000.  The
Royal George was acquired in a newly formed limited liability company ("RGT").
In June 2000, Citadel lent to RGT, at an interest rate of 10% per annum, the
funds needed to retire the purchase-money note issued by RGT to purchase the
theater.  In September, 2000 Citadel acquired RGT from Reading at approximately
the same price as was paid by Reading for that complex in March 1999.

     Management of Live Theater Assets.  Prior to the OBI Merger, the live
theater assets of OBI and the Royal George Theatre Complex were booked and
managed by Union Square Management, Inc., a third party theatre management
company.  Ms. Margaret Cotter, the daughter of James J. Cotter, was at that time
the Senior Vice President of that company.  In 1998, Craig guaranteed a $100,000
bank loan to Mr. Alan Schuster, the principal stockholder and President of Union
Square Management.  Following the closing of the OBI Merger, OBI was renamed
Liberty Theaters, Inc.  Citadel's live theaters are now booked and managed by
Off Broadway Investments LLC ("OBI Management"), a company wholly owned by
Margaret Cotter.  Ms. Cotter is the President of that company, and of Liberty
Theaters but receives no compensation for her service as the President of
Liberty Theaters other than the compensation paid to OBI Management.  OBI
Management has been retained on an at-will basis, on substantially the same
terms as Union Square Management, pending negotiation of a definitive agreement
and the approval of these agreements by the Citadel conflicts committee.

OBI Management is a separate company and is not related to the OBI acquired by
Citadel in the OBI Merger and renamed Liberty Theaters.

     Investment in Plays.  From time to time the companies and Mr. Cotter and
the other members of management of the companies, are afforded the opportunity
to invest in the plays that play or may play in the live theatres owned by
Citadel.  These investments are monitored by Mr. Cotter, and periodically
reported to the conflicts committee of the respective boards of directors of the
companies.

     Agricultural Transactions

     Citadel, Craig and Reading collectively own approximately 40% of the equity
interest in three agricultural partnerships formed in 1997 to purchase
approximately 1,600 acres of agricultural land in Southern California commonly
know as the "Big 4 Ranch."  The property is principally improved with mature
citrus groves.  The transaction was originated and negotiated by Citadel.
However, in order to satisfy certain federal laws relating to access to federal
water supplies, ownership of the Big 4 Ranch was taken in the agricultural
partnerships, which are owned 40% by Citadel, 40% by Big 4 Ranch, Inc. and 20%
by Visalia LLC.  Visalia is owned 1% by Mr. Cotter and 99% by members of his
family.

     Big 4 Ranch was initially a wholly owned subsidiary of Citadel, and was
spun off to the stockholders of Citadel immediately prior to the acquisition by
the agricultural partnerships of Big 4 Ranch.  Accordingly, Craig and Reading
received their interests in Big 4 Ranch initially as a result of that spin-off.
Thereafter, Craig increased its holdings in Big 4 Ranch through the purchase of
additional Big 4 Ranch shares in privately-negotiated transactions.  Craig and
Reading own their interests in the agricultural partnerships indirectly through
their ownership of Citadel and Big 4 Ranch shares.  Craig and Reading currently
control Big 4 Ranch, owning 49% of its voting power.  In addition, Cecelia and a
trust for the benefit of one of Mr. Tompkins's children own an additional 3.2%
of Big 4 Ranch. Historically, the officers and directors of Craig have served as
the officers and directors of Big 4 Ranch.

     The Big 4 Ranch is farmed by Big 4 Ranch Farming, LLC, which is owned 80%
by Citadel and 20% by Visalia.  Farming is reimbursed by the agricultural
partnerships for all of its out-of-pocket costs and receives a fee equal to 5%
of the gross revenues of the agricultural partnerships, after deducting the
expenses of picking, packing and hauling. Farming, in turn, contracts with
Cecelia for certain bookkeeping and administrative services, for which it pays a
fee of $6,000 per month.  Farming is reimbursed for this expense from the
agricultural partnerships.  Cecelia also packs fruit for the agricultural
partnerships, and was paid $72,000 per annum for 1998, 1999, and 2000,
respectively.  Citadel, Craig and Reading provide various administrative
services for the agricultural partnerships and Big 4 Ranch, for which they
receive no compensation.

     Due to a variety of factors, principally bad weather and market conditions,
the agricultural partnerships have lost in excess of 100% of their equity, and
are being funded by loans from Citadel and Visalia. At the present time, we
intend to limit the activities of the agricultural partnerships to those that
can be covered by the cash flow from their operations. To date, Citadel and
Visalia have lent $4,840,000 and $820,000, respectively, to the agricultural
partnerships, and, in addition, have guaranteed (on an 80/20 basis) some
equipment leases entered into by the agricultural partnerships. Since December
1998, when the agricultural partnerships crop was wiped out by a freeze, Citadel
and Visalia have been funding the agricultural partnerships on an 80/20 basis.

     Certain Family Relationships

     Mr. Cotter, the principal controlling stockholder of Citadel, Craig and
Reading, has advised the companies boards of directors that he considers his
holdings in Craig and Citadel to be long-term investments to be passed to his
heirs.  The directors of Craig, Citadel and Reading believe that it is in the
best interests of these companies, and their respective stockholders, for Mr.
Cotter's heirs to become experienced in the operations and affairs of the
members of the companies.  Accordingly, Margaret Cotter is a member of the

boards of directors of Craig and Big 4 Ranch, Inc. and the President of Liberty
Theaters.  Margaret Cotter has also served as an officer of Cecelia and Union
Square Management, Inc., and is the owner and President of OBI Management.
Ellen Cotter is the Vice President - Business Affairs of Craig and Reading and
of Citadel's cinema subsidiary.  James J. Cotter, Jr., the son of James J.
Cotter, serves as a director of Gish Biomedical, Inc., a publicly traded company
in which Citadel has an approximate 16% ownership interest.

     Miscellaneous Transactions

     Reading has loaned Mr. Robert F. Smerling $105,000 pursuant to a non-
interest bearing demand promissory note.

                        INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

     Citadel expects that a representative of Deloitte & Touche LLP will attend
the Citadel annual meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement if
he or she desires to do so and to respond to appropriate questions.
