SUBJECT TO COMPLETION DATED AUGUST 31, 2001

JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS 

The Proposed MergersYour Vote Is Very Important

    divine, inc. has agreed to acquire eshare communications, Inc. and Open Market, Inc. in separate stock-for-stock transactions. As described in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, a meeting of the divine stockholders is being called to approve each of these mergers. In addition, a special meeting of eshare shareholders is being called to approve the eshare
merger, and a special meeting of Open Market stockholders is being called to approve the Open Market merger. At the divine stockholder meeting, divine stockholders may vote with respect to each of
these transactions; however, the two transactions are independent and are not conditioned upon each other. At the eshare shareholder meeting, the eshare shareholders may vote on the transaction
between divine and eshare. At the Open Market stockholder meeting, Open Market stockholders may vote on the transaction between divine and Open

Market. This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being furnished to divine stockholders, eshare shareholders and Open Market stockholders for use at their respective special meetings.

    The dates, times and places of the divine stockholder meeting, the eshare shareholder meeting and the Open Market stockholder meeting are as follows:

    This joint proxy statement/prospectus is dated    , 2001 and is first being mailed to divine stockholders, eshare shareholders
and Open Market stockholders on or about    , 2001.

    The proposed mergers are complex transactions and are discussed in detail in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Please read carefully this joint proxy statement/prospectus in its
entirety, particularly the "Risk Factors" section beginning on page 31, which discusses the potential risks involved in the mergers, in the operation of the combined company and in owning
divine common stock.

The divine/eshare Merger

    divine and eshare have agreed on a transaction whereby divine will acquire eshare in a stock-for-stock transaction. The transaction is structured as a merger
in which eshare will be merged into a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine. If we complete the eshare merger, eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine class A common stock for
each eshare common share they own. This number will be determined based on the average closing price of divine common stock on the Nasdaq National Market for the ten trading days ending two trading
days prior to the closing date of the eshare merger. We refer to the result of this calculation as the divine average closing price.

    If the divine average closing price is greater than $2.39 but less than $2.82, then eshare shareholders will receive 1.30 shares of divine common stock for each eshare common share
they own. If the divine average closing price is $2.82 or greater, then eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare common share they own equal to $3.653
divided by the divine average closing price. If the divine average closing price is $2.39 or less, then eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare
common share they own equal to $3.12 divided by the greater of the divine average closing price or $1.00. If the number of shares of divine common stock to be issued in the merger exceeds 28,546,506,
then divine may elect to pay cash instead of all or any portion of the divine common stock otherwise issuable to eshare shareholders in excess of 28,546,506 shares. The per share amount of these cash
payments will be equal to the divine average closing price. 

The divine/Open Market Merger

    divine and Open Market have agreed on a transaction whereby divine will acquire Open Market in a stock-for-stock transaction. The transaction is structured as
a merger in which a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine will be merged into Open Market. If we complete the Open Market merger, Open Market stockholders will receive a number of shares of divine
class A common stock for each share of Open Market common stock or Series E preferred stock they own. This number will be determined by dividing (1) 44,285,714 by (2) the total
number of shares of Open Market common stock deemed to be outstanding as of the closing of the

Open Market merger, but less any shares of Open Market common stock issued pursuant to options and warrants exercised after the signing of the Open Market merger agreement.

divine Shares to be Issued in the Mergers

    divine common stock, eshare common shares and Open Market common stock are traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbols "DVIN," "ESHR" and "OMKT,"
respectively. 
We urge you to obtain current market quotations for divine common stock, eshare common shares and Open Market common stock before making any decision on the
mergers.

    We will not know the exact number of shares of divine common stock to be issued in each of the mergers until after the dates of the divine, eshare and Open Market special meetings. As
of August 28, 2001, the divine average closing price was $1.23. Based on this closing price, the eshare exchange ratio would be 2.537, and the maximum number of shares of divine common stock to
be issued to eshare shareholders would be 55,647,791 shares, representing approximately 25.8% of the outstanding common stock of divine after the eshare merger, and representing approximately 21.4% of
the outstanding common stock of divine after both the eshare merger and the Open Market merger.

    Based on the volume weighted average price of Open Market common stock through August 27, 2001, the number of issued and outstanding shares of Open Market common stock,
including all shares that would be issued upon conversion of the Open Market Series E preferred stock, would be 53,392,546 shares, and the Open Market exchange ratio would be 0.8294. The number of
shares of divine common stock to be issued to Open Market stockholders would be 44,285,714 shares, plus any additional shares reflecting Open Market options and warrants exercised after the signing of
the Open Market merger agreement. Assuming no additional options and warrants are excercised prior to closing, these shares would represent approximately 20.7% of the outstanding common stock of
divine after the Open Market merger, and would represent approximately 15.4% of the outstanding common stock of divine after both the Open Market merger and the eshare merger.

The Special Meetings

    Under the rules of the Nasdaq National Market, each merger will require the approval of divine's stockholders if the number of shares of divine common stock to
be issued in each

merger will equal or exceed 20% of the number of shares of divine common stock outstanding immediately prior to each merger. Although we will not know the exact number of shares of divine common stock
to be issued in the Open Market merger, we are certain that it will exceed this amount. Therefore, the Open Market merger will require divine stockholder approval. The eshare exchange ratio is subject
to adjustment, and divine may elect to pay a portion of the eshare merger consideration in cash. Therefore, we are not certain that the number of shares of divine common stock to be issued in the
eshare merger will exceed the 20% threshold. If at any time on or prior to the date of the divine special meeting, divine determines that the number of shares of divine common stock to be issued in
connection with the eshare merger will not require divine stockholder approval, divine may elect to eliminate the proposal regarding the eshare merger from the divine special meeting, in which case,
divine will issue a press release to that effect.

    Whether or not you plan to attend a meeting, we encourage you to take the time to vote. divine stockholders may vote (1) by completing and mailing the enclosed proxy card,
(2) by telephone or (3) over the Internet. eshare shareholders and Open Market stockholders may vote by completing and mailing the appropriate enclosed proxy card. If you sign, date and
mail your proxy card without indicating how you want to vote, we will count your proxy as a vote in favor of the proposals and any other proposal properly submitted to stockholders or shareholders at
the applicable meeting. So long as there is a quorum at the divine special meeting, the failure to vote by a divine stockholder will have no effect on the outcome of the vote, but an abstention will
have the same effect as a vote against the proposal. If eshare shareholders or Open Market stockholders do not return their proxy card or abstain, the effect will be a vote against the relevant
merger. Returning your proxy card or, in the case of divine stockholders, voting by telephone or over the Internet, will not affect your right to vote in person if you choose to attend a special
meeting.

The boards of directors of divine, eshare and Open Market have approved the respective merger agreements and the mergers and recommend that their respective
stockholders or shareholders vote FOR the relevant proposals described in the attached materials.

    This joint proxy statement/prospectus serves as a proxy statement for divine, eshare and Open Market in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the
divine, eshare and Open Market boards of directors for use at the special meetings, and as divine's prospectus in connection with its issuance of divine common stock in the mergers.

  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGERS

Q.
What will happen in the eshare merger?

A.
eshare
will merge into a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine and will cease its separate corporate existence. eshare common shares will be exchanged for divine common stock based on
the eshare exchange ratio. divine stockholders will continue to own their divine common stock. All references to divine common stock in this joint proxy statement/prospectus are to divine's
class A common stock and the associated preferred stock purchase rights.

Q.
What will happen in the Open Market merger?

A.
A
wholly-owned subsidiary of divine will merge into Open Market and will cease its separate corporate existence. Open Market will then be a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine. Shares
of Open Market's common stock and Series E preferred stock will be exchanged for divine common stock based on the Open Market exchange ratio. divine stockholders will continue to own their
divine common stock.

Q.
What will eshare shareholders receive in the eshare merger?

A.
If
we complete the eshare merger, eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare common share they own. This number will be based on the
average closing price of divine common stock on the Nasdaq National Market for the ten trading days ending two trading days prior to the closing date of the eshare merger. We refer to the result of
this calculation as the divine average closing price.


If
the divine average closing price is greater than $2.39 but less than $2.82, then eshare shareholders will receive 1.30 shares of divine common stock for
each eshare common share they own.


If
the divine average closing price is $2.82 or greater, then eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare
common share they own equal to $3.653 divided by the divine average closing price.


If
the divine average closing price is $2.39 or less, then eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare
common share they own equal to $3.12 divided by the greater of the divine average closing price or $1.00. 

As
an example only, if the divine average closing price is $5.00, then eshare shareholders will receive 0.7306 shares of divine common stock for each eshare common share they own. Alternatively, if
the divine average closing price is $1.00, eshare shareholders will receive 3.12 shares of divine common stock for each eshare common share they own. 

If the number of shares of divine common stock to be issued in the eshare merger exceeds 28,546,506, then divine may elect to pay cash instead of all or any portion of the divine common stock
otherwise issuable to eshare shareholders in excess of 28,546,506 shares. However, because divine and eshare intend for the eshare merger to be a tax-free reorganization, divine will not pay cash in
excess of 50% of the total consideration paid to all eshare shareholders. The per share amount of these cash payments will be equal to the divine average closing price. divine will not issue
fractional shares. eshare

shareholders who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share will instead receive cash based on the market value of the fractional share of divine common stock. 

We urge you to obtain current market quotations for divine common stock and eshare common shares before making any decision on the eshare merger.

Q.
What will Open Market stockholders receive in the Open Market merger?

A.
If
we complete the Open Market merger, Open Market stockholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each share of Open Market common stock they own or have
the right to acquire upon conversion of the shares of Series E preferred stock they own. This number will be determined by dividing (1) 44,285,714 by (2) the number of issued and outstanding
shares of Open Market common stock as of the closing of the Open Market merger, including, for this purpose, all shares of Open Market common stock that would be issued upon conversion of all
outstanding shares of Open Market Series E preferred stock, but less any shares of Open Market common stock issued pursuant to options or warrants exercised after the signing of the Open Market
merger agreement. Based on the volume weighted average price of the Open Market common stock through August 27, 2001, the number of issued and outstanding shares of Open Market common stock
would be 53,392,546 (excluding Open Market options and warrants) and the exchange ratio would be 0.8294. The maximum exchange ratio will be 0.8362 and the minimum exchange ratio will be 0.8294.

We
urge you to obtain current market quotations for divine common stock and Open Market common stock before making any decision on the Open Market merger.

Q.
What do I need to do now?

A.
After
carefully reading and considering the information contained and incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, please vote your shares by completing,
signing and dating your proxy card and returning it in the enclosed postage paid envelope as soon as possible so that your shares may be represented at your special meeting. divine stockholders may
also vote by telephone or over the Internet instead of by mailing their proxy card. The divine, eshare and Open Market special meetings will take place on        , 2001.
The boards of directors of divine, eshare and Open Market recommend that their respective stockholders or shareholders vote in favor of the respective mergers.

Q.
How do I vote my divine shares by telephone or over the Internet?

A.
divine
stockholders may vote by telephone or over the Internet instead of by mailing their proxy cards. If you vote by telephone or over the Internet, you will be required to have
the control number appearing on your proxy card available in order to submit your vote. A properly completed telephone or Internet vote has the same effect as if you marked, signed and returned the
proxy card by mail. See the instructions on the proxy card for a detailed description of the telephone and Internet voting procedures.

Q.
If my shares are held in "street name" by my broker, will my broker vote my shares for me?

A.
Your
broker will only vote your shares if you provide instructions on how to vote. You should follow the directions provided by your broker regarding how to instruct your 

broker
to vote your shares. If you do not give your broker instructions on how to vote your shares, they will not be voted on the proposed mergers. For eshare shareholders and Open Market
stockholders, this will have the same effect as voting against the proposed mergers.

Q.
What vote is required to approve the mergers?

A.
For
divine, the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of divine common stock present and entitled to vote at the divine special meeting is required to approve the
issuance of divine common stock in each of the mergers. If you are a divine stockholder, you will be voting on two separate merger proposals, each of which is independent of the other. For eshare, the
affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding eshare common shares is required to approve and adopt the eshare merger agreement and the eshare merger. For Open Market, the affirmative vote of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Open Market common stock and Series E preferred stock, voting on an as converted basis (approximately 655 votes per share of outstanding Series E
preferred stock) and together with the common stock as a single class, entitled to vote at the special meeting is required to approve and adopt the Open Market merger agreement and the Open Market
merger.

Q.
Why is divine calling a special meeting?

A.
Under
the rules of the Nasdaq National Market, each merger will require the approval of the divine stockholders if the number of shares of divine common stock to be issued in each
merger will equal or exceed 20% of the number of shares of divine common stock outstanding immediately before the merger. We will not know the exact number of shares of divine common stock to be
issued in the eshare merger until after the dates of the special meetings. However, if at any time on or before the date of the divine special meeting, divine determines that the number of shares of
divine common stock to be issued in connection with

the
eshare merger will not require divine stockholder approval under the rules of the Nasdaq National Market, divine may elect to eliminate the proposal regarding the eshare merger from the divine
stockholder meeting, in which case, divine will issue a press release to that effect.

Although
we will not know the exact number of shares of divine common stock to be issued in the Open Market merger, we are certain that it will exceed 20% of the number of shares of divine common
stock outstanding immediately prior to the Open Market merger. Therefore, the Open Market merger will require divine stockholder approval.

Q.
Will I be able to change my vote?

A.
Yes.
If you are a stockholder or shareholder of record you may change your vote in any of the following ways:


by
sending a written notice to the secretary of either divine, eshare or Open Market, as applicable, prior to that company's special meeting, stating that
you would like to revoke your proxy;


by
completing, signing and dating another proxy card and returning it by mail to divine, eshare or Open Market, as applicable, prior to that company's
special meeting;


by
telephone or via the Internet, if you are a divine stockholder, by following the instructions provided on your proxy card; or


by
attending the applicable special meeting and voting in person.

If
your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other fiduciary, including under the divine employee stock purchase plan, and you have directed that person to vote your shares, you must
instruct that person if you want to change your vote.

Q.
Should eshare shareholders and Open Market stockholders send in their share certificates now?

A.
No.
After the relevant merger is completed, the exchange agent will send eshare shareholders and Open Market stockholders written instructions for exchanging their share
certificates for divine common stock.

Q.
Who is the exchange agent?

A.
Computershare
Investor Services, LLC is the exchange agent.

Q.
What if I don't vote by proxy or at the special meeting or I abstain?

A.
If
an eshare shareholder fails to respond by sending in his, her or its proxy card and fails to vote at the eshare special meeting, or sends in his, her or its proxy card and
abstains from voting, it will have the same effect as a vote against the proposed eshare merger. Assuming there is a quorum at the eshare special meeting, an eshare shareholder's failure to vote will
have no effect on the outcome of the voting on the proposal to amend the eshare employee stock purchase plan, while an abstention as to that proposal will have the same effect as a vote against the
amendment to the eshare employee stock purchase plan.

If
an Open Market stockholder fails to respond by sending in his, her or its proxy card and fails to vote at the Open Market special meeting, or sends in his, her or its proxy card and abstains from
voting, it will have the same effect as a vote against the proposed Open Market merger.

Assuming there will be a quorum at the divine special meeting, a divine stockholder's failure to vote will have no effect on the outcome of the voting, while an abstention as to a particular merger
proposal will have the same effect as a vote against that proposal.

If a divine or Open Market stockholder or an eshare shareholder sends in his, her or its executed proxy card but does not indicate how he, she or it wants to vote on any particular proposal, the proxy
will be counted as a vote in favor of that proposal.

Q.
When do you expect to complete the mergers?

A.
We
expect to complete the mergers shortly after the special meetings.

Q.
What are the tax consequences of the mergers?

A.
eshare
shareholders generally will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on the exchange of eshare common shares, except to the extent any cash is paid by
divine as part of the eshare merger consideration or for fractional shares. To review

the
tax consequences to eshare shareholders in greater detail, see "The eshare MergerUnited States Federal Income Tax Consequences" beginning on page 91. The tax consequences to
each particular eshare shareholder will depend on that shareholder's specific situation. Therefore, each eshare shareholder should consult his, her or its own tax advisor for an understanding of the
tax consequences to that shareholder resulting from the eshare merger.

Open
Market stockholders generally will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on the exchange of Open Market common stock, except to the extent any cash is paid by divine for
fractional shares. To review the tax consequences to Open Market stockholders in greater detail, see "The Open Market MergerUnited States Federal Income Tax Consequences" beginning on
page 116. The tax consequences to each particular Open Market stockholder will depend on that stockholder's specific situation. Therefore, each Open Market stockholder should consult his, her
or its own tax advisor for an understanding of the tax consequences to that stockholder resulting from the Open Market merger.

Q.
What will happen if either or both of the mergers are not completed?

A.
The
eshare merger and the Open Market merger are independent of each other. It is possible that one or both of the mergers will be completed, or that one or both mergers will not be
completed.

If
the eshare merger is not completed for any reason, both divine and eshare may be subject to a number of material risks. For example, under the terms of the eshare merger agreement, either party may
be required under limited circumstances to pay the other party a termination fee of $2,000,000. In addition, significant merger-related costs incurred by divine and eshare, such as legal, accounting
and financial advisor fees, must be paid by the parties even if the eshare merger is not completed. Also, the prices of divine common stock and eshare common shares may change to the extent that their
current market prices reflect a market assumption that the eshare merger will be completed.

If the Open Market merger is not completed for any reason, both divine and Open Market may be subject to a number of material risks. For example, under the terms of the Open Market merger agreement,
either party may be required under limited circumstances to pay the other party a termination fee of $2,600,000. In addition, if the Open Market merger agreement is terminated because divine's
stockholders do not approve the Open Market merger, the amounts owed to divine by Open Market under the credit agreement between divine and Open Market would be converted into Open Market common stock
at a conversion price equal to the Open Market exchange ratio in effect at the time of termination. If the Open Market merger agreement is terminated because Open Market's stockholders do not approve
the Open Market merger, the amounts owed to divine under the credit agreement would become due 90 days after date of that termination. If the board of directors of Open Market withdraws or changes its
recommendation regarding the Open Market merger, or if there is an alternative transaction proposed with respect to Open Market and the Open Market stockholders do not approve the Open Market merger,
those amounts owed under the credit agreement would be immediately due and payable. Furthermore, significant merger-related costs

incurred by divine and Open Market, such as legal, accounting and financial advisor fees, must be paid by the parties even if the Open Market merger is not completed. Also, the prices of divine and
Open Market common stock may change to the extent that their current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Open Market merger will be completed.

Q.
Why are eshare shareholders being asked to approve the amendment to the eshare employee stock purchase plan?

A.
The
eshare employee stock purchase plan will not be assumed by divine in the eshare merger. However, eshare shareholder approval of an amendment to this plan is being sought by the
eshare board of directors in order to ratify a previous increase in the total number of shares available for purchase under the plan from 250,000 to 301,760 in accordance with the requirements of
Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.

Q.
What if I have additional questions?

A.

you have any additional questions about the mergers or how to submit your proxy, or if you need additional copies of this joint proxy statement/prospectus or the enclosed proxy
card, you should contact one of the following:

eshare's Financial Advisor.

shareholders have approved the merger. Either of divine or eshare can also terminate the eshare merger agreement if:

Treatment of Outstanding eshare Stock Options (page 88)

    When the eshare merger is completed, each outstanding eshare stock option with an exercise price less than or equal to the product of the closing price of
divine common stock on the Nasdaq National Market on the date immediately prior to the closing date of the eshare merger multiplied by the eshare exchange ratio, will convert into a fully exercisable
option to purchase a number of shares of divine common stock equal to the number of eshare common shares underlying the stock option multiplied by the eshare exchange ratio. As of August 28,
2001, divine would grant options to purchase approximately 4,300,000 shares of divine common

stock upon conversion of these eshare options. The exercise price for the stock options to be granted by divine will be equal to the current exercise price of the corresponding eshare options divided
by the eshare exchange ratio. Each outstanding eshare stock option with an exercise price above the result of the divine closing price on the date immediately prior to the closing date of the eshare
merger multiplied by the eshare exchange ratio will be cancelled.

Treatment of Outstanding Open Market Stock Options and Warrants (page 114)

    When the Open Market merger is completed, each outstanding option and warrant to purchase shares of Open Market common stock will be converted into an option
or warrant to purchase the number of shares of divine's common stock equal to the number of shares of Open Market common stock subject to such option or warrant multiplied by the Open Market exchange
ratio, with an exercise price equal to the exercise price of that option or warrant divided by the Open Market exchange ratio. As of and based on the volume weighted average price of the Open Market
common stock through August 27, 2001, divine would grant options and warrants to purchase 9,756,671 shares of divine common stock.

Voting Agreement (page 128)

    divine has entered into a voting agreement with Szlam Partners, L.P., an entity beneficially owned by Aleksander Szlam, the chairman and chief executive
officer of eshare. Under the voting agreement, Szlam Partners has granted divine the right to vote 10,745,969 eshare common shares owned by Szlam Partners in favor of the approval and adoption of the 

eshare merger agreement and the eshare merger. As of the record date, the shares subject to this agreement represented approximately 49% of the outstanding eshare common shares entitled to vote at the
eshare special meeting.

Stockholder Agreements (page 140)

    Open Market, divine and certain of divine's stockholders have entered into stockholder agreements, pursuant to which certain of divine's stockholders have

approval and adoption of the Open Market merger agreement and the Open Market merger, and the issuance of shares of divine's common stock necessary to complete the Open Market merger. As of the record

Interests of Certain Persons in the eshare Merger (page 89)

    eshare shareholders and divine stockholders should be aware that certain members of the eshare and divine boards of directors and management have interests in
the eshare merger that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of other eshare shareholders and divine stockholders. In particular:

    The Stockholder Agreement.
  divine and Szlam Partners, along with Aleksander Szlam, entered into a stockholder agreement
under which (1) divine granted Szlam Partners the right to sell to divine a number of shares of divine common stock at a purchase price per share equal to the divine average closing price,
(2) Szlam Partners granted divine the right to purchase from Szlam Partners a number of shares of divine common stock at a purchase price per share equal to the divine average closing price,
and (3) Szlam Partners agreed to restrictions on its right to transfer shares of divine common stock, other than as described above, for a period of twelve months, in each case following
consummation of the eshare merger.

    The Employment Agreement.
  Pursuant to the stockholder agreement, divine and Mr. Szlam agreed to enter into an
employment agreement simultaneously with the closing of the merger. The terms of the employment agreement provide that Mr. Szlam will be employed by divine for an initial three-year
term as chief strategy officer and presidentCIM businesses and will receive a salary of $400,000 per year and a bonus of up to $600,000 per year subject to approval of the compensation
committee of divine's board of directors. divine has also agreed to appoint Mr. Szlam to its board of directors and nominate him to continue as a director at its 2002 annual meeting of
stockholders. Mr. Szlam's employment agreement contains customary confidentiality and non-solicitation provisions and prohibits Mr. Szlam 

from competing against the combined entity during the term of the agreement and for a period of three years after the termination of the agreement. 

    The Real Estate Option Agreement.
  Szlam Partners and Melita House, Inc., a corporation owned by
Mr. Szlam, own the properties at which eshare's U.S. and United Kingdom headquarters, respectively, are located. Pursuant to the stockholder agreement, divine agreed to enter into a real estate
option agreement with Szlam Partners and Melita House upon the closing of the merger under which divine will pay Szlam Partners $3,702,978 for a ten-year option to purchase eshare's
property in the U.S. for $14,560,000, and pay Melita House $2,047,022 for a ten-year option to purchase eshare's property in the U.K. for 5,714,668. Under the real estate
option agreement, Szlam Partners and Melita House will agree not to raise the rental amounts due under, or otherwise adversely modify, the leases for these properties so long as the surviving company
is not in default under the leases. 

    divine Interested Director Ownership.
  Andrew J. Filipowski, the chairman and chief executive officer of divine, is also
a director of eshare. As of the record date, Mr. Filipowski beneficially owned 413,333 eshare common shares, representing approximately 2.0% of the total eshare common shares outstanding as of
the record date.

    Indemnification; Insurance.
  The eshare merger agreement provides that, for a period of six years from the closing of
the eshare merger, the surviving corporation will provide rights to indemnification benefiting eshare's directors and officers that are at least as favorable as those in effect under eshare's articles
of incorporation and bylaws as of the date of the eshare merger agreement. The surviving corporation will also provide directors' and officers' liability insurance covering those persons who were
covered by eshare's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy as of the date of the eshare merger agreement. However, the surviving corporation will not be required to spend more than 150%
of the annual premium paid by eshare for that coverage as of the date of the eshare merger agreement.

    Stock Option Acceleration.
  Vesting of options to purchase eshare common shares under eshare's stock option plans will
accelerate upon the completion of the eshare merger. Based on the divine average closing price on August 28, 2001, divine would grant options to purchase divine common stock with respect to
options to purchase 738,750 eshare common shares held by eshare directors and executive officers.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Open Market Merger (page 115)

    Open Market stockholders and divine stockholders should be aware that certain members of the Open Market board of directors and management have interests in
the Open Market merger that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of other Open Market stockholders and divine stockholders. In particular:

    Indemnification; Insurance.
  The Open Market merger agreement provides that, for a period of six years from the closing
of the Open Market merger, the surviving corporation will provide rights to indemnification benefiting Open Market's directors and officers that are at least as favorable as those in effect under Open
Market's certificate of incorporation and bylaws as of the date of the Open Market merger agreement. The surviving corporation will also provide directors' and officers' liability insurance covering
those persons who were covered by Open Market's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy as of the date of

the Open Market merger agreement. However, the surviving corporation will not be required to spend more than $2,000,000 for the aggregate premium for that coverage.

Stock Option Acceleration.
  Vesting of options to purchase Open Market's common stock granted to directors of Open
Market under Open Market's stock option plans accelerate at the effective time of the Open Market merger agreement. As of the record date, divine would grant options to purchase divine common stock
with respect to options to purchase       shares of Open Market common stock held by Open Market directors and executive officers.

Executive Retention Agreements.
  Open Market has entered into executive retention agreements with certain members of its
management. The retention agreements generally provide for severance benefits if (1) Open Market terminates the executive (other than termination for cause, disability or death), or
(2) the executive terminates his or her employment for good reason (as defined in his or her retention agreement), within 12 months after a change in control (as defined in his or her retention
agreement). The Open Market merger will constitute a change in control under the retention agreements.

Employment Agreement between Mr. LaVigne and Open Market.
  Pursuant to an employment agreement, dated
December 1, 2000, by and between Open Market and Harland K. LaVigne, Open Market's chairman, president and chief executive officer, in the event of a change in

control of Open Market (as defined in the employment agreement), Mr. LaVigne is entitled to receive a payment equal to his annual base salary of $420,000 and annual target bonus of $126,000 and
continuation of the benefits described in the employment agreement for one-year period following that change in control. The Open Market merger would qualify as a change in control under the
employment agreement. In addition, all of Mr. LaVigne's unvested Open Market options will become immediately exercisable. Mr. LaVigne is entitled to the payments, continuation of
benefits and accelerated vesting of his options regardless of whether he remains an employee of Open Market following the Open Market merger or if his employment is terminated on or after the Open
Market merger.

Extension of Exercise Period of Options Granted to Non-Management Directors.
  divine has agreed to extend the time
period during which current non-management members of Open Market's board of directors may exercise options to purchase an aggregate of 10,000 shares of Open Market common stock. These options
would normally expire 90 days after these board members' last day of service as Open Market directors. The closing date of the Open Market merger would be the last day of service for these directors.
Pursuant to the extension, these options, as converted to options to purchase divine common stock, will expire on a date 18 months after the closing date of the Open Market merger.

United States Federal Income Tax Consequences (pages 91 and 116)

    Neither eshare shareholders nor Open Market stockholders generally will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on their exchange of eshare
common shares, and Open Market common or preferred shares, respectively, except to the extent they receive cash as part of the merger consideration or for fractional shares. To review the tax
consequences to eshare shareholders in greater detail, see "The eshare MergerUnited States Federal Income Tax Consequences" beginning on page 91. To review the tax consequences to
Open Market stockholders in greater detail, see "The Open Market MergerUnited States Federal Income Tax Consequences" beginning on page 116. The tax consequences to each particular
eshare

shareholder and Open Market stockholder will depend on his, her or its specific situation. Therefore, each eshare shareholder and Open Market stockholder should consult his, her or its own tax advisor
for an understanding of the tax consequences resulting from the mergers.

Accounting Treatment (pages 95 and 118)

    divine will record the mergers using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Regulatory Matters (pages 95 and 118)

    eshare's, Open Market's and divine's obligations to complete the mergers are subject to their receipt of all necessary approvals and the expiration of all
applicable waiting periods required by U.S. laws. divine and eshare, and divine and Open Market, respectively, have made filings and taken other actions, and will continue to take actions, needed to
obtain approvals from all appropriate authorities, including the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC. The Federal Trade Commission has
granted early termination of the required waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, for the eshare merger.

divine's Recent Developments (page 154)

    Since July 1, 2001, divine has completed, or entered into agreements in connection with, a number of acquisitions to further its business strategy.

    On July 6, 2001, divine entered into an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization with RoweCom Inc. RoweCom is a leading business-to-business provider of high
quality service and e-commerce solutions for purchasing and managing the acquisition of magazines, newspapers, journals and e-journals, books and other printed sources of
commercial, scientific and general interest information and analysis. RoweCom targets clients in knowledge-intense industries, such as business and financial services; biomedical; academia and the
federal government; and corporate and professional services. Under the terms of the RoweCom merger agreement, each of the approximately 12,952,745 outstanding shares of RoweCom common stock will be
converted into the right to receive 0.75 shares of divine common stock, and RoweCom will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine. In addition, prior to the close of its merger with divine, RoweCom
expects to issue 600,000 shares of common stock in connection with its acquisition of Doody Publishing, which shares would also be converted into shares of divine common stock at the 0.75 exchange
ratio. Assuming the Doody Publishing acquisition is consummated prior to the RoweCom transaction, and based on the closing price of divine common stock of $1.30 on August 28, 2001, the RoweCom
transaction would have an aggregate value of approximately $13,213,925. Completion of the RoweCom merger is subject to a number of conditions, including the approval of the RoweCom merger by RoweCom's

stockholders and the satisfaction of certain financing conditions by RoweCom and its subsidiaries. divine anticipates that RoweCom's content offerings and procurement technology will be key components
of divine's enterprise portal solutions and international expansion.

    On July 18, 2001, divine acquired the 67% of the equity interests of Emicom Group, Inc. that divine did not already own in exchange for a total of 13.8 million
shares of divine common stock. divine has agreed to file a registration statement on Form S-3 to register these

shares for resale. divine expects to file this registration statement as soon as practicable. Emicom had been an associated company of divine since April 2000, when divine acquired a 33%
interest in it. Emicom is a technology holding company that provides capital and advisory services to early-stage technology companies located in Israel. Emicom partners with privately held
technology-related companies in the telecommunications, cellular, Internet infrastructure and enterprise software markets. At the time of the acquisition, Emicom held interests in four
technology-related companies and had approximately $34 million in uncommitted cash reserves. divine expects that Emicom will provide divine with a base of operations in the Israeli
high-tech market, a platform from which to expand an international customer base and a channel for divine's expansion in Israel and Europe.

    On
July 29, 2001, divine entered into an agreement to purchase substantially all of the assets of Intira Corporation, subject to bankruptcy court approval. Intira provides information
technology and network infrastructure for online business applications and is based in Pleasanton, California. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, divine will purchase substantially all of the
assets of Intira for $1 million in cash, provide Intira with a $6.8 million debtor-in-possession credit facility and assume certain obligations which divine intends to restructure on
more favorable terms. The acquisition of the Intira assets is expected to add to divine's capabilities in its Managed Applications business unit and to provide opportunities for divine's other
business units. 

    In August 2001, divine acquired certain assets, subject to certain liabilities, of Fracta Networks, Inc., a provider of personal content management solutions. Among the
assets divine acquired was Fracta Networks' software, FractaNet, an application that allows users to easily capture portions of documents, spreadsheets or Web sites. For these assets, divine issued
warrants to purchase 1,000,000 shares of divine common stock. Additionally, divine has agreed to grant Fracta Network's continuing employees options to purchase 468,000 shares of divine common stock.

    divine anticipates that the integration of these companies into its products and services offering will help divine to deliver a combination of software, technology-based solutions,
professional services and hosting/managed applications that allow businesses to increase efficiency, generate revenue, advance their brand and build customer loyalty.

Selected Historical Financial Data of Open Market

    You should read carefully Open Market's consolidated financial statements, including the related notes and Open Market's "Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," beginning on page 197 in this joint proxy

statement/prospectus. The merger of FutureTense Inc. with Open Market in October 1999 was accounted for as a pooling of interests and accordingly all prior period financial data has been
restated as if the merger took place at the beginning of these periods. Open Market's historical data is not necessarily indicative of future results.

    The selected consolidated balance sheet information presented below as of December 31, 1999 and 2000 and the operating information for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2000, have been derived from Open Market's consolidated financial statements that have been audited by Arthur Andersen LLP, independent public accountants, and are included
elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The selected consolidated balance sheet information as of December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998 and the operating information for each of the two
years in the period ended December 31, 1997 have been derived from Open Market's consolidated financial statements, audited by Arthur Andersen LLP, not appearing in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. Arthur Andersen LLP did not audit the financial statements of FutureTense as of December 31, 1998, and for the year ended December 31, 1998. These financial
statements are included in Open Market's consolidated financial statements. These financial statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to Arthur Andersen LLP, and their
opinion, in so far as it relates to amounts included for FutureTense, is based solely upon the report of other auditors. The report of the other auditors for FutureTense as of December 31,
1998, and for the year ended December 31, 1998 is included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

    The selected historical financial data as of June 30, 2000 and 2001 and for the six months ended June 30, 2000 and 2001 are derived from Open Market's unaudited
financial statements which are included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The unaudited financial statements include, in Open Market's opinion, all adjustments consisting

only of normal, recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of Open Market's financial position and the results of Open Market's operations for those periods.

 Unaudited Selected Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information  

    In addition to the pending mergers involving divine and eshare and divine and Open Market, on July 6, 2001, divine entered into an agreement and plan of
merger and reorganization with RoweCom Inc., a business-to-business provider of e-commerce solutions for purchasing and managing print and e-content knowledge resources,
including magazines, newspapers, journals and e-journals, books and other sources of commercial, scientific and general interest information and analysis. Completion of the RoweCom merger
is subject to a number of conditions, including the approval of the merger by RoweCom's stockholders and the satisfaction of certain financing conditions by RoweCom and its subsidiaries. The following
unaudited selected pro forma condensed combined financial information reflects the acquisitions of eshare and Open Market alone as well as the acquisitions of eshare, Open Market and RoweCom together.

    Because the pro forma financial information is based upon the financial condition and operating results of eshare, Open Market and RoweCom during periods when they were not under the
control, influence or management of divine, the information presented may not be indicative of the results that would have actually occurred had the acquisitions been completed as of the respective
periods presented, nor is it indicative of future financial or operating results. The unaudited selected pro forma condensed combined financial information does not give effect to any synergies that
may occur due to the integration of eshare, Open Market and RoweCom with divine, nor does it take into account the effect of any potential changes to accounting policies, including with respect to the
recognition of revenues, of the acquired entities after the mergers due to the integration of their businesses into divine's business model. The unaudited selected pro forma condensed combined
financial information should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements of divine, including the related notes, incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus,
the historical financial statements of eshare and Open Market, including the related notes included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial statements, including the related notes, included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Historical
book value per share is computed by dividing stockholders' equity by the number of shares of common stock, net of treasury shares, outstanding at the end of each period.

(2)
The
unaudited equivalent eshare pro forma per share amounts are calculated by multiplying the unaudited combined pro forma per share divine amounts by the assumed eshare exchange
ratio of 2.537.

(3)
The
unaudited equivalent Open Market pro forma per share amounts are calculated by multiplying the unaudited combined pro forma per divine share amounts by the assumed

share
exchange ratio of 0.8294 divine shares for each outstanding share of Open Market common stock.

(4)
Pro
forma book value per share is computed by dividing pro forma stockholders' equity by the pro forma number of shares of common stock and the exchangeable shares outstanding at
the end of the period.

Comparative Stock Price Information  

The eshare Merger. 
The following table sets forth the last sale prices per share of eshare common shares and
divine common stock on the Nasdaq National Market on July 6, 2001, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the proposed eshare merger, and on August 28, 2001, the most
recent date for which prices were practically available prior to the date of this document. The table also sets forth the value of the divine common stock that an eshare shareholder would have
received for one eshare common share, assuming that the eshare merger had taken place on those dates, and assuming that divine had not elected to pay any portion of the merger consideration in cash,
other than for fractional shares. These numbers have been calculated by multiplying the last sale price per share of divine common stock on those dates by the adjusted eshare exchange ratio. The
actual value of the divine common stock that an eshare shareholder will receive on the date of the eshare merger may be higher or lower than the prices set forth below. 
We urge
you to obtain current market quotations for divine common stock and eshare common shares before making any decision on the eshare merger.

date for which prices were practically available prior to the date of this document. The table also sets forth the value of the divine common stock that an Open Market stockholder would have received
for one share of Open Market common stock, assuming that the Open Market merger had taken place on those dates, in each case, and assuming that divine paid cash for fractional shares. These numbers
have been calculated by multiplying the last sale price per share of divine common stock on those dates by the Open Market adjusted exchange ratio. The actual value of the divine common stock that an
Open Market stockholder will receive on the date of the Open Market merger may be higher or lower than the prices set forth below.

following the mergers, we have assumed the consummation of the RoweCom merger. References to the products, businesses, financial results or financial condition of divine, eshare and Open Market mean
our combined enterprise and its subsidiaries, including RoweCom. We have separated the risks into three groups: risks relating to the proposed mergers, risks relating to the combined entity and risks
relating to ownership of divine common stock. References to "we," "us" and "our" in "Risks Relating to the Proposed Mergers" refer to the combined divine/eshare/Open Market entity
following the completion of the mergers. References to "we," "us" and "our" in "Risks Relating to the Combined Entity" and "Risks Relating to Owning divine Common Stock"
refer to the combined divine/eshare/Open Market/RoweCom entity following completion of the mergers.

Risks Relating to the Proposed Mergers

We may be unable to successfully integrate our operations and personnel and, as a result, may not realize the expected benefits of the mergers.

    These two mergers require the integration of our companies, which have previously operated independently. We may not accomplish this integration smoothly,
quickly, successfully, or at all. The successful combination of the companies will require significant effort, managerial resources, time and expense. divine, eshare and Open Market have different
systems and procedures in many operational areas that must be rationalized and integrated. Integration also may be difficult because divine is based in Chicago, Illinois, eshare is based in Norcross,
Georgia, and Open Market is based in Burlington, Massachusetts. This integration may be

further complicated by the possible simultaneous integration of RoweCom's operations. While we integrate operations, management may be distracted, and employee uncertainty and lack of focus may
disrupt our operations. As often occurs with mergers of technology/services companies, during the pre-merger and integration phases, competitors may intensify their efforts to recruit key
employees. Employee uncertainty regarding the effects of the mergers could also increase turnover. Failure to quickly and effectively accomplish the integration of our operations could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

If we are unable to successfully integrate our products and technologies on a timely basis, we may not realize the expected benefits of the proposed mergers.

    After the mergers, we will need to integrate our product development operations, technologies and products. This integration may be difficult and unpredictable
because divine's, eshare's and Open Market's products are highly complex and were developed independently and without regard to this integration. Successful integration will also require coordination
of previously independent development and engineering teams, as well as sales and marketing efforts and personnel. In addition, this integration may take longer than expected, and we may need to
expend more resources on integration than we anticipated. The need to expend additional time and money on our integration would reduce the resources that would otherwise be available to develop new
products and technologies. If we cannot

integrate our products and technologies successfully and on a timely basis, we may not be able to operate efficiently or realize the expected benefits of the mergers.

The eshare merger and the Open Market merger are independent of each other.

    The shareholders of eshare are voting solely on the eshare merger and the amendment to the eshare employee stock purchase plan; the Open Market stockholders
are voting solely on the Open Market merger; and the divine stockholders are voting on the issuance of divine common stock in each of the eshare and the Open Market mergers. Neither of the mergers is
subject to, or conditioned upon consummation of, the other merger. As a result, it is possible that one merger will be consummated while the other merger is not. The failure of divine to consummate
either of the two mergers could adversely affect divine's implementation of its enterprise Web solutions strategy, and could be negatively viewed by analysts or investors, which in turn could cause
the value of divine's common stock to decline.

Our customers may react unfavorably to the mergers, which could negatively affect our results of operations.

    The mergers may disrupt our customer relationships. Uncertainty regarding the mergers and our ability to effectively integrate our operations without a
significant reduction in the quality of product and service offerings may also cause some of our customers to explore alternatives. Further, customers may defer making purchasing decisions as they
evaluate the likelihood of our successful integration. Any significant delay or loss of business from significant customers could have a negative effect on our results of operations.

The amount and type of consideration that eshare shareholders will receive in the eshare merger may not be finalized until after the date of the eshare and
divine special meetings.

    The number of shares of divine common stock that eshare shareholders will receive at the closing of the eshare merger may increase or decrease pursuant to the
eshare exchange ratio, which is tied to fluctuations in the market price of divine common stock. Furthermore, if the number of shares of divine common stock to be issued in the eshare merger pursuant
to the eshare exchange ratio exceeds 28,546,506 shares, divine may elect to pay cash in lieu of all or any portion of the shares issuable in excess of 28,546,506 shares. Accordingly, the amount and
type of consideration to be received by eshare shareholders in the eshare merger may not be settled as of the date you submit your proxy or the date of the special meetings and will depend on the
market price of divine common stock in the days leading up to the closing of the eshare merger and divine's decision as to whether to pay cash in lieu of a portion of the shares of its common stock.
Historically, the market price of both divine common stock and eshare common shares has been volatile, and we cannot assure you what the market prices of the divine common stock or eshare common
shares will be in the days leading up to the eshare merger. We, therefore, urge you to obtain current market quotations for divine common stock and eshare common shares before making any decision on
the merger.

The amount of divine common stock that Open Market stockholders will receive in the Open Market merger may not be finalized until after the date of the Open
Market and divine special meetings.

    The total number of shares of divine common stock that Open Market stockholders will receive as Open Market merger consideration is 44,285,714 shares, plus any
additional shares reflecting Open Market options and warrants exercised after the signing of the Open Market

merger agreement. However, the number of shares of divine common stock that each Open Market stockholder will receive at the closing of the Open Market merger will vary because the Open Market
exchange ratio is based on the number of shares of Open Market's common stock that are deemed to be outstanding as of the effective time of the Open Market merger. Because the conversion price for
Open Market's Series E preferred stock is tied to the market price of Open Market's common stock, changes in the conversion price for the Series E preferred stock will change the number of shares of
Open Market common stock that are deemed to be outstanding at the effective time of the Open Market merger. If the number of shares of Open Market common stock that are deemed to be outstanding has
increased from the time the Open Market merger agreement was signed until the Open Market merger becomes effective, the Open Market exchange ratio will decrease, and an Open Market stockholder will
receive fewer divine shares for his, her or its Open Market shares.

The Open Market exchange ratio will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of divine common stock.

    The Open Market exchange ratio determines the number of shares of divine common stock each Open Market stockholder will receive at the closing of the Open
Market merger. The Open Market exchange ratio will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of divine common stock.

    The share price of divine common stock fluctuates in the market and has experienced significant volatility. We cannot predict the market price for divine common stock at any time
before or after the completion of the Open Market merger. We have included the market prices of divine common stock and Open Market common stock as of a recent date under the caption "Selected
Historical and Pro Forma Financial DataComparative Stock Price Information" beginning on page 28. However, we cannot assure you what the market prices of the divine common stock or
Open Market common stock will be at any time. We, therefore, urge you to obtain current market quotations for divine common stock and Open Market common stock before making any decision on the merger.

Officers and directors of eshare and Open Market have potential conflicts of interest in the mergers.

    Certain of eshare's officers and directors have employment and other agreements and/or benefit plans that provide them with interests in the eshare merger that
are different from, or in addition to, interests of eshare shareholders. These interests, which include acceleration of vesting of stock options, severance benefits and an employment agreement with
Aleksander

Szlam, are described in more detail under the caption "The eshare MergerInterests of Certain Persons in the eshare Merger" beginning on page 89.

    Certain of Open Market's officers and directors have executive retention and other agreements and/or benefit plans that provide them with interests in the Open Market merger that are
different from, or in addition to, interests of Open Market stockholders. These interests, which include acceleration of vesting of stock options and severance benefits, and an employment agreement
between Open Market and Harland LaVigne, are described in more detail under the caption "The Open Market MergerInterests of Certain Persons in the Open Market Merger" beginning on
page 115.

After the mergers, shareholders of eshare and stockholders of Open Market will have different rights that may be less advantageous than their current rights.

    Upon consummation of the respective mergers, eshare shareholders and Open Market stockholders will become divine stockholders. eshare's articles of
incorporation and bylaws and Open Market's certificate of incorporation and by-laws are different from those of divine, which will result in changes to the rights of eshare shareholders
and Open Market stockholders when they become divine stockholders. In addition, in connection with the eshare merger, there are differences in Delaware and Georgia law that will result in changes to
the rights of eshare shareholders when they become divine stockholders. Finally, divine's stockholder rights plan will result in changes to the rights of eshare shareholders and Open Market
stockholders when they become divine stockholders. These rights as divine stockholders may be less advantageous than the current rights of eshare shareholders and Open Market stockholders. See
"Comparison of Rights of divine Stockholders and eshare Shareholders" beginning on page 210 and "Comparison of Rights of divine Stockholders and Open Market Stockholders" beginning on
page 216.

Risks Relating to the Combined Entity  

divine has been in business for only two years, has little operating history and has a new business strategy that may continue to change, which makes it
difficult to evaluate its business.  

    divine was formed in May 1999 and began operations as an Internet holding company engaged in business-to-business
e-commerce through a community of associated companies. divine announced a new strategy to focus on enterprise Web solutions in February 2001. Because divine has only recently begun
operating under this new business strategy, there is limited data upon which you can evaluate its prospects. As we continue to analyze business plans and internal operations in light of market
developments, we may decide to make further substantial changes in our business plan and organization. These changes in business strategy may include moving into areas in which divine has little or no
experience. Furthermore, our future business strategy will depend on our ability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses as we continue to seek to expand our portfolio of products and
services. We are, and will remain for the foreseeable future, subject to risks, expenses and uncertainties frequently encountered by young companies, and it will continue to be difficult to evaluate
our business and its likelihood of success. 

Our overall performance and quarterly operating results may fluctuate and will be affected by the revenues generated from eshare's, Open Market's and RoweCom's
products and services and will be affected by fluctuations in the sales of these products and services.

    We expect eshare's, Open Market's and RoweCom's revenues to comprise a significant portion of our revenues in the future. In particular, we expect RoweCom's
revenues to represent a significant portion of our revenues because RoweCom historically has recognized as revenue its cost of the knowledge resources it sells plus the fee retained by RoweCom.
Fluctuations in the revenue generated from our offering of eshare's CIM solutions, RoweCom's knowledge resources and Open Market's e-business solutions will likely impact our overall performance, and
risks relating to these CIM solutions, knowledge resources and e-business solutions may affect our success as a whole. divine's, eshare's, Open Market's and RoweCom's revenues and results of
operations have varied substantially from quarter to

quarter. We expect large fluctuations in our future quarterly operating results due to a number of factors, including:


the
success of, and costs associated with, acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic relationships;


losses
or charges incurred by associated companies that may include significant write-downs, write-offs and impairment charges;


the
level of product and price competition;


the
length of our sales and implementation process;


the
size and timing of individual transactions;


seasonal
trends;


the
mix of products and services sold;


software
defects and other product quality problems;


the
timing of new product introductions and enhancements by us and our competitors;


customer
order deferrals in anticipation of enhancements or new products to be offered by us and our competitors;


changes
in foreign currency exchange rates;


customers'
fiscal constraints; and


general
economic conditions. 

    Because RoweCom's revenue flow is seasonal in nature, RoweCom periodically will have to rely on financing from divine or third parties to support its needs for working capital.
RoweCom has an established practice of paying publishers 30 to 60 days before receipt of its customers' funds. Consequently, RoweCom anticipates making substantial additional expenditures in the
fourth quarter of each year, while receiving the majority of its cash receipts relating to those purchases late in the first quarter of the following year. Given these seasonal cash flow imbalances,
if RoweCom has an unexpected demand for liquid capital, or does not have financing available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, when needed, it could have a material adverse effect on our
future results of operations and financial condition.

We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we may never become profitable.

    divine incurred net losses of approximately $9,407,000 for the period from inception on May 7, 1999 through December 31, 1999, approximately
$470,319,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000, and approximately $104,132,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2001. The majority of these losses were related to the consolidated
operations of divine's associated companies and charges divine took to reduce the carrying value of these associated companies. In addition:


RoweCom
incurred net losses of approximately $7,630,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998, $15,067,000 for the year ended December 31,
1999, $83,981,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000 and $16,922,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2001;


Open
Market incurred net losses of approximately $36,970,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998, $19,780,000 for the year ended
December 31, 1999, $37,796,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000 and $14,702,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2001; and


eshare
incurred net losses of approximately $9,958,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999, $11,117,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000
and $3,197,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2001.

We expect to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, we expect our operating expenses to increase significantly as we continue to develop the infrastructure necessary to
implement our current business strategy and integrate acquired businesses. Changes to our business strategy and product lines may cause us to incur additional expenses. Our financial results will
continue to be affected by the operations of divine's existing associated companies, some of which may cease operations in the future if they are unable to generate positive cash flow. To the extent
that our revenues do not increase at a sufficient rate, we may not be able to achieve and maintain profitability.

If we do not successfully implement our acquisition strategy or address the risks associated with acquisitions, our growth and ability to compete may be
impaired.  

    Our business strategy includes the acquisition of other businesses that are complementary to ours, including other providers of enterprise software products or
professional services. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates available for sale at reasonable prices, consummate any acquisitions, including the proposed RoweCom merger, or
successfully integrate any acquired businesses, including RoweCom, into our operations. Acquisitions involve a number of special risks and challenges, including:


diversion
of management's attention;


assimilation
of the operations and personnel of acquired companies;


incorporation
of acquired products into existing product lines;


adverse
short-term effects on reported operating results;


assumption
of the liabilities of acquired companies including, for example, the potential liability of RoweCom for (1) the securities class action
lawsuits recently filed against it and (2) sales taxes for prior periods;


possible
loss of key employees; and


difficulty
of presenting a unified corporate image. 

If we are unable to successfully implement our acquisition strategy or address the risks associated with acquisitions, our growth and ability to compete may be impaired.

    If
we engage in future acquisitions, we might finance these acquisitions with available cash, the proceeds from possible debt financing or the issuance of additional equity securities
(common or preferred stock), or a combination of the foregoing. We may not be able to arrange adequate financing on acceptable terms. If we proceed with one or more significant future acquisitions, we
may use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate the acquisitions. If we consummate one or more significant acquisitions by issuing additional equity securities, the market price of
our common stock could decline and stockholders could 

suffer significant dilution of their interests in us. Furthermore, sellers may be reluctant to accept divine common stock as consideration at its recent price level and given its historical
volatility, in which case, our ability to complete further acquisitions could be significantly limited. 

    For most of the businesses that we may acquire, we will likely have to record significant goodwill and other intangible assets, and generally accepted accounting principles may
require us to recognize substantial amortization charges on the other intangible assets, reducing our future reportable earnings. We will also have to periodically test our goodwill and other
intangible assets for impairment. If we determine that the value of the goodwill and/or the intangible assets have been impaired, we will be required to recognize substantial charges that would
adversely affect our operating results. In addition, these acquisitions could involve significant non-recurring acquisition-related charges, such as the write-off or
write-down of software development costs or other intangible items.

Our failure to retain key personnel may negatively affect our business.  

    Our success depends on our ability to retain senior executives and other key employees who are critical to the continued advancement, development and support
of our products and services and ongoing sales and marketing efforts. The loss of any key personnel or any significant group of employees could negatively affect our future business and prospects. If

our management does not succeed in their roles, or we are not able to effectively allocate management responsibilities and cause our officers and senior managers to operate effectively as a group, our
business could be negatively affected.

    Employee
morale and our ability to attract and retain qualified employees may also be adversely affected by the decline and substantial fluctuation in the market price of divine
common stock since its initial public offering, as many divine employees hold options with exercise prices far higher than divine's recent stock price. 

Revenues from our professional services division are difficult to predict because they are derived from project-based engagements.  

    For the six months ended June 30, 2001, divine derived approximately 92% of its revenues from professional services. Almost all of these revenues were
from project-based client engagements, which vary in size and scope. As a result, the revenues of our professional services division are difficult to predict because a client that accounts for a
significant portion of these revenues in one period may not generate a similar amount of revenues, if any, in subsequent periods. In addition, because many of our professional services engagements
involve sequential stages, each of which may represent a separate contractual commitment, a client may choose not to retain us for subsequent stages of an engagement or for new professional services
projects.

If we cannot keep our billable professionals engaged on client projects, our future revenues could decline and our operating results could be adversely
affected.  

    Virtually all the client contracts of our professional services division allow the client to terminate our services on relatively short notice and do not
guarantee us any specific or minimum amount of business from the client. To the extent that any significant clients decrease their use of our professional services, delay an engagement or terminate
their relationship with us, the revenues of our professional services division could decline 

substantially and our overall operating results could be adversely affected to the extent we are unable to quickly redeploy our billable professionals to other client engagements. 

We may not be able to compete successfully with current and future competitors, and competitive pressures faced by us could hurt our business and financial
results.

    The market for our products and services is intensely competitive, fragmented and subject to rapid change. As a result of the eshare and Open Market mergers
and the RoweCom transaction, we will compete with a variety of companies that provide software solutions and professional services independently or on an integrated basis. We may not be able to
compete successfully against current and future competitors, and competitive pressures faced by us could hurt our business and financial results. Furthermore, many of our current and potential
competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, product development and marketing resources, greater name recognition and a larger customer base than we do.

    eshare's
primary competitors in the field of integrated inbound/outbound telephony-based call management systems have been Davox Corporation, SER Systeme AG (formerly EIS
International, Inc.) and Avaya, Inc. (formerly Mosaix International, Inc.) We will continue to compete primarily against Davox and Avaya in the collections segment of the outbound
call management systems market, and against SER Systeme in the telemarketing and telesales segments of the inbound/outbound call management systems market. We will also compete in the computer
telephony integration segment of the market, where principal competitors include Interactive Intelligence, Inc., Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories/Alcatel, and Stratasoft Corp., Apropos
Technology, Castel, Inc. and CellIT, Inc., among others. In the future, we may also face additional direct competition from private branch exchange/automatic call distribution vendors, other
telecommunications equipment providers, telecommunications service providers, computer hardware and software vendors and others. Furthermore, in the Internet-based CIM industry, our competitors will
include eGain Communications Corporation, Kana Software, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Face Time Communications, Inc., LivePerson, Inc., People Support, Inc. and Siebel Systems, Inc. 

    Open Market's primary competition in the e-business content management market includes in-house development efforts by prospective customers, other vendors of application software or
application development platforms and tools directed at interactive commerce and financial services, such as Art Technology Group, Inc., BroadVision, Inc., Documentum, Inc., Interwoven, Inc. and
Vignette Corporation. In addition, larger companies with much broader product offerings, such as BEA Systems, Inc., IBM Corporation, Microsoft Corporation and Oracle Corporation, may bundle their
products to discourage users from purchasing Open Market's products. Companies such as International Business Machines, BEA Systems and iPlanet E-Commerce Solutions also may add content management
functionality to their application servers or introduce their own content management software.

    The market for the sale of magazines, newspapers, journals and e-journals, books and other knowledge resources to businesses is intensely and increasingly competitive. Although
RoweCom has not yet had significant direct competition from other companies offering a service for purchasing and managing the acquisition of subscriptions and books with comparable management control
features, EBSCO Industries, Inc. has recently launched a desktop e-commerce service that is similar to RoweCom's kStore. Thus, we expect that

significant competition will develop in the near future with respect to RoweCom's knowledge resource products, and it may have an adverse impact on our business.

    divine competes in various market segments that are extremely competitive, highly fragmented and subject to rapid change. While we offer an increasingly comprehensive range of
advanced enterprise solutions, we compete with various providers of one or more components of our solutions. In the enterprise portal software and services segment, according to Delphi Research and
the Yankee Group, the leading portal application makers in 2000 included: Plumtree Software, Inc., Hummingbird Ltd., Viador Inc., Sequoia Software Corporation (acquired by Citrix Systems, Inc.) and
InfoImage, Inc., among others. We believe that additional competitors in the broader advanced enterprise solutions market include: IBM Corporation, PeopleSoft, Inc., BEA Systems, Inc., Microsoft
Corporation, Sybase, Inc., Oracle Corporation, Computer Associates International, Inc., Epicentric, Inc., BroadVision, Inc., Vignette Corporation, Citrix Systems, Inc., Open Text Corporation, Top Tier
Software, Inc., DataChannel, Inc., Tibco Software Inc., SAP AG, American Express Company and InfoSys Consulting Inc.

If we do not expand our customer base, we may never become profitable and our stock price will likely decline.  

    The market for many of our products and services is newly emerging. As a result, we cannot accurately estimate the potential demand for them. We believe that
market acceptance of many of our products and services will depend principally on our ability to: 


timely
develop or acquire products and services that meet changing customer needs;


effectively
market our products and services;


hire,
train, and retain a sufficient number of qualified sales and marketing personnel;


provide
high-quality and reliable customer support for our products;


distribute
and price our products and services in a manner that is more appealing to customers than that of our competitors;


develop
a favorable reputation among our customers, potential customers and participants in the software industry; and


withstand
downturns in general economic conditions or conditions that would slow corporate spending on software products and professional services. 

    Our inability to accomplish any of the foregoing may limit our ability to expand our customer base. If our customer base does not expand, we may never become profitable and our stock
price will likely decline.

Our success is dependent upon the market for Internet services, which, along with the general economy, is experiencing a downturn.  

    During late 2000 and 2001, the market for Internet services and technology experienced a significant decline. This decline is at least partly attributable to
funding difficulties experienced by many companies and a general economic slowdown. Both developments have caused many of our current and potential customers and clients to cancel, reduce and/or delay
some projects. A prolonged economic slowdown or continued uncertainty about the future of the market for Internet services will also adversely affect our business and financial results. If

demand for our products and services does not improve, increased competition for business may result in significant decreases in the prices we charge for our products and services. The

market for our products and services may not improve in a timely manner or to the extent necessary to allow us to achieve and sustain profitability in the near future.

Our success will depend upon the ability of our software products to work with a large variety of hardware, software, database and networking systems.  

    The success of our products will depend on the ability of our products to integrate and be compatible with customer systems, particularly hardware systems,
operating systems and data sources, as well as or better than competing products. The success of our products will also depend on the ability of our existing products to work well with one another,
with new products we develop and with new software developed by third parties. We currently serve, and intend to continue to serve, a customer base with a wide variety of hardware, software, database
and networking systems. If we cannot support an increasing number of systems in the future, we may not gain broad market acceptance.

Customers will be less likely to accept our products if we are unable to introduce in a timely manner new software products and enhancements that meet industry
requirements.  

    The market for our software products is subject to rapid technological change, changing customer needs, frequent new product introductions and evolving
industry standards that may render our existing products and services obsolete. As a result, unforeseen changes in customer and technological requirements for application features, functions and
technologies could limit our ability to develop market share or could rapidly erode our position in those markets in which we have an established presence. Our growth and future operating results will
depend in part upon our ability to develop and introduce new applications that anticipate, meet or exceed technological advances in the marketplace, meet changing customer requirements, respond to
competitive products and achieve market acceptance. 

    New
products, platforms and language support typically require long development and testing periods. New products or enhancements may not be released according to schedule or may
contain defects when released. Either situation could result in adverse publicity, loss of sales, delay in market acceptance of our products or customer claims against us, any of which could harm our
business. Our product acquisition, development and testing efforts have required, and are expected to continue to require, substantial investments. We may not possess sufficient resources to make
these necessary investments. 

    We
also expect to develop and introduce new and enhanced versions of products as an integrated suite. In addition to the risks and uncertainties inherent in the development and
introduction of new products, we will face significant challenges in developing and introducing new products and versions that work together effectively and allow customers to achieve the benefits of
a broader product offering. We may not be able to identify or overcome these challenges. 

If we cannot cross-sell the products and services of divine, eshare, Open Market and RoweCom to the other companies' customers, we will not achieve one of the
expected benefits of the mergers and the RoweCom transaction.

    After the mergers and the RoweCom transaction, we intend to offer the products and services of eshare, Open Market and RoweCom to existing divine customers and
the

customers of each other acquired company, and divine's products to existing eshare, Open Market and RoweCom customers. One company's customers may not have an interest in the other companies' products
and services. If we fail to cross-market our products and services, we will not achieve one of the expected benefits of the mergers and the RoweCom transaction, and this failure could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.

We expect that our future revenues and operating results will be adversely affected if the software application industry continues to evolve toward a
subscription-based model.

    We expect that our revenue growth rates and operating results will be adversely affected as more customers require us to offer our products under a
subscription-based application service provider model. We currently sell software application solutions on a perpetual license basis in exchange for an up-front license fee. Many of our
customers are attempting to reduce their up-front capital expenditures by purchasing software applications under a hosted subscription service model. Under the hosted model, the customer
subscribes to use an application from the software provider. Generally, the application is hosted on a server managed by the software provider or a third-party hosting service. We expect that
subscription-based revenues will represent a substantial portion of future revenues generated by our software applications and managed applications divisions.

    Under
the subscription-based model, we generally will recognize revenue and receive payment ratably over the term of a customer's subscription. As a result, our revenue growth rate
under
a subscription model may be less than what our revenue growth rate would be under a license model. In addition, the price of our services will be fixed at the time of entering into the subscription
agreement. If we are unable to adequately predict the costs associated with maintaining and servicing a customer's subscription, then the periodic expenses associated with a subscription may exceed
the revenues we recognize for the subscription in the same period, which would adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if we are not successful in implementing the subscription-based
model, or if market analysts or investors do not believe that the model is attractive relative to our existing license model, our business could be impaired and our stock price could decline. 

Our business may be adversely affected if there are defects in our software or we are unable to acquire third-party software or hardware that is
error-free.  

    Software products as complex as those that we offer may contain errors that could occur at any point in a product's life cycle. divine, eshare, Open Market and
RoweCom have, in the past, discovered software errors in certain of their products and have experienced delays in shipment or implementation of products during the period required to correct these
errors. Despite extensive testing by us and by our current and potential customers, errors in our software may be found in the future. This could result in a loss of, or delay in, market acceptance
and sales, diversion of development resources, injury to our reputation or increased service and warranty cost. In particular, the call center environment is characterized by a wide variety of
standard and non-standard configurations that make pre-release testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and time consuming and will limit our ability to
uncover all defects prior to shipment and installation at a customer's location. We also license certain software used in our products from third parties, and our products are designed to operate on
certain hardware platforms manufactured by third parties. Third-party software or hardware may contain errors that we are dependent upon others to correct. These

errors could cause problems with the installation and operation of our products, which could harm our business. 

We may face potential liability to customers if our products or our customers' systems fail.  

    Our software, portal and applications products are often critical to the operation of our customers' businesses and provide benefits that may be difficult to
quantify. If a product of ours or a customer's system fails, the customer could make a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. The limitations of
liability set forth
in our contracts may not be enforceable in all instances and may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Our insurance coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or in
sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims. In addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim. If we experience one or more large claims against us that exceed
available insurance coverage or result in changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, our business
and financial results could be hurt. 

We could lose our competitive advantage if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights, and any related litigation could be costly and time consuming.  

    We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our
proprietary rights in our products and technology. These measures may not be adequate to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technology. As a result, unauthorized third parties may copy or
otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. We may not be able to detect all instances of infringement. Furthermore, we may be subject to additional risks as we enter into transactions in
countries where intellectual property laws are not well developed or are poorly enforced. Legal protection of our rights may be ineffective in these countries. If we must engage in litigation to
defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, either domestically or in other countries, we could face substantial costs and diversion of resources, regardless of the outcome of such
litigation. Any future attempt by us to enforce our intellectual property rights might not be successful, or might result in royalties that do not exceed the cost of such enforcement efforts. Even if
we succeed in protecting our intellectual property, others may independently develop similar technologies or products that do not infringe on our intellectual property.

Other companies may claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights, which could harm our business.  

    Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. We expect that the risk of infringement claims will rise as the number of
products and competitors in our industry grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. To develop our services and products, we may need to acquire licenses for
intellectual property to avoid infringement of a third party's product. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Former employers of our present and future
employees may assert claims that these employees improperly disclosed confidential or proprietary information to us. Any such claims could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation,
divert management's attention and resources, cause product shipment delays or require us to pay money damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. These royalty or licensing agreements may
not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In 

the event of a successful claim of product infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology, our business, operating results and financial condition
could be materially and adversely affected. 

We may not be able to prevent online security breaches, which could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation and expose us to liability.

    A party that is able to circumvent our security systems or the security systems of our customers could steal proprietary information or cause interruptions in
our operations. Security breaches could also damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. Our insurance policies have coverage limits and exclusions that
may prevent reimbursement for losses caused by security breaches. Furthermore, our servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions.
We may need to expend significant additional capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches. Despite these efforts, we may not be able
to prevent all security breaches. 

Future government regulation could place financial burdens on our business.  

    Because of the Internet's popularity and increasing use, new laws and regulations may be adopted that could have an adverse effect on us. In particular, states
may impose discriminatory, multiple or special taxes on the Internet if the current moratorium on the application of these taxes, due to end on October 21, 2001, is not extended. If the
moratorium ends, federal taxes may also be imposed on the use of the Internet. These state and federal taxes could cause a decrease in the volume of e-commerce and, therefore, the demand
for our products and services. The enactment of any additional laws or regulations, including international laws and regulations, could impede the growth of the Internet and e-commerce,
which could decrease our revenue and place additional financial burdens on our business. 

    Federal, state or foreign agencies have also adopted, and may continue to adopt, laws or regulations affecting the use of outbound call processing systems. These laws or regulations
could limit the market for our products or expose us to liability, which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.

Restrictions relating to the privacy of Internet users and the collection and use of online data could limit the utility of the personalization functionality
of eshare's and Open Market's products and, therefore, the attractiveness of those products to customers.

    One of the principal features of eshare's and Open Market's products is the ability to develop and maintain profiles of online users to assist business
managers in personalizing content and in displaying tailored commercial offers to specific online users. By limiting the means in which this feature can be utilized, proposed and existing legal
restrictions on the collection and use of information relating to Internet users could materially and adversely impact eshare's and Open Market's products. For example, legislation has been proposed
in some jurisdictions that would regulate the practice of placing small information files, or "cookies," on a user's hard drive to gather information. Likewise, regulation of the practice of online
preference marketing is also under consideration in many jurisdictions. Moreover, legislation regulating the collection of data online and offline is already in place in the United States and
elsewhere, including the European Union. While regulatory and legislative efforts in this area are relatively new and still developing, they continue to gain attention, and continued regulation and
legislation in this area could adversely affect the demand for eshare's and Open Market's products.

    If we lost the services of Andrew J. Filipowski, our business could fail.  

    We believe that Andrew J. Filipowski, our chairman and chief executive officer, is critical to our success. If we lost the services of Mr. Filipowski,
our ability to promote our business and raise additional capital would be severely limited, and our business could fail. We do not maintain key man life insurance on Mr. Filipowski. 

    Our key personnel have entered into non-compete agreements that could prevent us from engaging in certain activities and
acquiring interests in some companies.  

    Andrew J. Filipowski, our chairman and chief executive officer; Michael P. Cullinane, our executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer and a
director; and Paul L. Humenansky, our president and chief operating officer and a director, have entered into consulting and non-compete agreements with PLATINUM 

technology
 International, 
inc.
, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Computer Associates
International, Inc. These agreements prohibit Mr. Filipowski until June 29, 2007, and each of Messrs. Cullinane and Humenansky until June 29, 2004, from
participating or engaging, directly or indirectly, in the development, manufacture, marketing or distribution of any products or services offered by PLATINUM as of March 29, 1999, or any
products or services offered by PLATINUM after that date and in which they had actively participated. PLATINUM was, as of March 29, 1999, and continues to be, engaged in the business of
developing, marketing and supporting software products for managing information technology infrastructures and providing related professional services. As of March 29, 1999, PLATINUM also
offered products and services for the creation, deployment and management of Web content. 

    Under
the agreements, Messrs. Filipowski, Cullinane and Humenansky also are prohibited from soliciting, or assisting another person to solicit or attempt to solicit, persons or
entities that were current customers of PLATINUM or its affiliates before the end of the respective employment periods of Messrs. Filipowski, Cullinane and Humenansky, unless the solicitation
of these customers is for goods or services unrelated to any activity which competes with PLATINUM. 

    To manage divine's business effectively in light of these agreements, divine has consulted with PLATINUM and Computer Associates before making any acquisition to confirm that a breach
of these agreements would not result. PLATINUM and Computer Associates have consented to the mergers and the RoweCom transaction. In the future, however, these consulting and non-compete
agreements could limit our business opportunities, which could impair our success.

    Delays in sales and the implementation cycle for CIM solutions and managed applications could adversely affect us.  

    If we experience delays in, or cancellations of, sales or implementations of CIM solutions and managed applications, our business and financial results could
be hurt. To sell these products, we generally must provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding their use and benefits. In addition, prospective customers generally make
a significant commitment of resources in connection with the implementation of these products. For these and other reasons, the length of time between the date of initial contact with the potential
customer and the installation and use of these solutions has generally been six months or more. Our implementation cycle could be lengthened in the future by delays over 

which we have little or no control, increases in the size and complexity of our installations and the number of third-party systems with which our products must be integrated. In addition, any
unexpected delays in individual implementations could generate negative publicity and expose us to liability claims from our customers. 

    We expect that our future operating results will be significantly dependent on a limited number of eshare and Open Market products and
the markets for these products.

    eshare traditionally has derived a majority of its revenues from sales of its Conversations call center management product, its NetAgent
Web-collaboration product and related services and support. eshare introduced Conversations in 1999 and NetAgent in 1998. eshare is currently in the process of developing next generation
CIM applications and expects to begin beta trials in 2001. In the near term, we anticipate that a significant portion of our eshare-related revenue may be derived from eshare's Conversations and
NetAgent product offerings and related services and support. We intend to enhance these products and develop market specific solutions. However, any factor adversely affecting the market for call
center and Internet-based solutions in general, or the Conversations and NetAgent products in particular, could
hurt our business and financial results. We also may face potential charges resulting from the write-down of inventory of outdated products that we cannot sell. 

    Open Market expects to derive substantially all of its product license revenues in the future from its recently announced CSEE software. Our future growth and profitability will
depend on the successful release, introduction and customer acceptance of this new suite of products and future enhancements to these products. Any factors adversely affecting the pricing of, demand
for or market acceptance of these products, including competition or technological change, could cause our revenues to decline and our business and future operating results to suffer.

    eshare has traditionally relied on a few customers for a significant portion of its revenues, and we expect this trend will continue
for our future call center revenues.  

    eshare has historically derived, and we believe that we will continue to derive, a significant portion of call center revenues in any period from a limited
number of large corporate clients. In 2000, eshare's five largest customers accounted for 16.6% of its total revenues. During 1999, eshare's five largest customers accounted for 28.2% of its total
revenues. The loss, deferral or cancellation of an order from one of these customers could have a significant impact on our operating results. eshare's current customers might not place additional
orders, and we might not obtain orders of similar magnitude from other customers. If we fail to retain any major customer of eshare, suffer any reduction, delay in or cancellation of orders by any
such customer, or fail to market successfully CIM Solutions to new customers, our business and financial results could be hurt.

    Open Market is a party to several securities class action lawsuits that may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain
and may harm our business.

    Open Market and several of its former and present officers and directors are named as defendants in several class action complaints filed on behalf of certain
of its stockholders who purchased securities between November 8, 1999 and April 18, 2000. These complaints allege violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule
10b-5

promulgated thereunder. In particular, they allege, among other things, that during the putative class period, the defendants sought to mislead the investing public by overstating

Open Market's prospects and the quality of its products. The plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages and other appropriate relief. Any resolution of this litigation in a manner adverse to Open Market
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the costs to us of defending this litigation or other related proceedings, even if
resolved in our favor, could be substantial. This litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and resources in general. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and
continuation of this litigation or other related proceedings could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace.

    If Reed Elsevier or any of the other suppliers with which RoweCom does business stops providing knowledge resources to RoweCom on
favorable terms, we may not be able to satisfy customers' demands at acceptable prices.

    The primary supplier of the magazines and journals of which RoweCom sells subscriptions is Reed Elsevier, which supplied titles accounting for approximately
16% and 13% of RoweCom's sales for the year ended December 31, 1999 and 2000, respectively. RoweCom currently does not have a contract with Reed Elsevier. If Reed Elsevier stops offering RoweCom
knowledge resources on favorable terms, we may not be able to offer customers competitive prices on their orders. If Reed Elsevier were to cease providing RoweCom with knowledge resources, it would
not be possible to obtain replacements for many of the titles Reed Elsevier publishes at a comparable price, if at all, from another supplier. Either of these events could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, if any of the other suppliers with which RoweCom does business decides not to provide RoweCom with knowledge resources or
decides to stop providing RoweCom with knowledge resources on favorable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

    We may not be able to expand RoweCom's catalog of knowledge resources.

    One of the key elements of RoweCom's strategy is to continue to expand its catalog of knowledge resources. RoweCom gains content through acquisitions, entrance
into strategic alliances and through contact with various publishers. RoweCom may not be able to continue to gain available content through strategic alliances or directly from publishers. In the
event that RoweCom is unable to continue to increase its available content, we may:


be
at a competitive disadvantage with respect to competitors that may compile greater libraries of available titles;


lose
clients that rely upon RoweCom as a single-source of knowledge resources; and


be
unable to increase the amount of revenue that is otherwise generated from particular clients.

    Any of these effects could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition.

    Our strategy to expand our international operations is subject to many risks that may prevent us from maintaining or increasing our
international revenues.

    eshare's sales outside the United States accounted for approximately 32% and 28% of its total revenues in 1999 and 2000, respectively. Open Market's sales
outside of North America accounted for approximately 30% and 40% of its total revenues in 1999 and 2000, respectively. RoweCom's sales outside the United States accounted for approximately 43% and 50%
of its total revenues in 1999 and 2000, respectively. A significant element of our business strategy is to expand our international presence through eshare's, Open Market's and RoweCom's operations
and sales channels in international markets. This projected expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources. Because of the difficulty in penetrating new markets, we
may not be able to maintain or increase international revenues. Our international operations are subject to a number of inherent risks, which will increase as the international operations expand,
including:


significant
volatility in the level and timing of business;


the
impact of possible recessionary environments in economies outside the United States;


changes
in foreign legal and regulatory requirements;


changes
in tariffs;


the
costs of localizing products for foreign markets and integrating products with foreign system components;


longer
accounts receivable collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection;


difficulties
and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations;


reduced
protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;


potentially
adverse tax consequences;


political
and economic instability; and


the
higher cost of foreign service delivery. 

    While eshare's, Open Market's and RoweCom's expenses incurred in foreign countries typically have been denominated in the local currencies, revenues generated by eshare's, Open
Market's and RoweCom's international sales typically have been paid in U.S. dollars, British pounds or Euros. We could experience fluctuations in currency exchange rates in the future that would have
a material adverse impact on our international operations.

    Our growth in operations will likely be dependent upon the successful development of direct and indirect sales channels.  

    eshare and Open Market primarily sell their products domestically through a direct sales force and internationally through both direct and indirect sales
channels. eshare and Open Market support their customers with internal technical and outsourced customer support staff. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will greatly
depend on our ability to

recruit and train sufficient technical and direct sales personnel and to outsource effectively our customer support functions. Each of eshare and Open Market has in the past

experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified technical and sales personnel. If we are unable to rapidly and effectively expand eshare's and Open Market's technical staff and direct sales force, our
business and financial results could be hurt.

    We believe that our future growth will also depend on our ability to continue to develop and maintain eshare's and Open Market's indirect sales channels, including value added
resellers, or VARs, and distributors. Additionally, our investment of significant resources to develop these indirect sales channels could adversely affect our operating results if they do not
generate sufficient additional revenues.

    If we are unable to recruit and retain qualified VARs and distributors, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Increased indirect sales also could adversely affect our
average selling prices and result in lower gross margins because lower unit prices are typically charged on sales made through indirect channels. Sales of eshare and Open Market products through
indirect channels will reduce our gross profits from our services because VARs and distributors provide these services.

    As
indirect sales increase, our direct contact with our customer base will decrease, and we may have more difficulty accurately forecasting sales, evaluating customer satisfaction and
recognizing emerging customer requirements. In addition, VARs and distributors may develop, acquire or market products competitive with our products. Our strategy of marketing products directly to
customers and indirectly through VARs and distributors may result in distribution channel conflicts. Our direct sales efforts may compete with those of our indirect channels and, to the extent
different VARs and distributors target the same customers, VARs and distributors may also come into conflict with each other. Any channel conflicts that develop may have a material adverse effect on
our relationships with VARs and distributors or hurt our ability to attract new VARs and distributors. 

Risks Relating to Owning divine Common Stock  

    The market price of divine common stock may continue to be volatile, which could cause litigation against us and prevent eshare
shareholders and Open Market stockholders from reselling their divine shares at or above the prices at which they acquire them in the respective mergers.

    From divine's initial public offering in July 2000 through the date of this document, the price per share of divine common stock has ranged from a high of
$12.44 to a low of $1.00. The market price of divine common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations due to various factors, many of which are
beyond our control, including: 


quarterly
variations in operating results;


volatility
in the stock market;


volatility
in the general economy;


changes
in interest rates;


announcements
of acquisitions, technological innovations or new software, services or products by us or our competitors; and


changes
in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts. 

    In addition, there have been large fluctuations in the prices and trading volumes of securities of many technology, Internet and CIM product and related professional service
companies. Broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock. As a result, eshare shareholders and Open Market stockholders may be unable to resell their shares of
divine common stock that they receive in the mergers at or above the prices at

which they acquired them. In the past, volatility in the market price of a company's securities has often led to securities class action litigation. Such litigation could result in substantial costs
to us and divert our attention and resources, which could harm our business. Declines in the market price of our common stock or failure of the market price to increase could also harm our ability to
retain key employees, our access to capital and other aspects of our business.

    Our stockholder rights plan and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws and Delaware law could delay or
deter tender offers or takeover attempts that may offer you a premium for your common stock.

    Our stockholder rights plan and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a
third party to acquire control of us, even if that transaction would be beneficial to you. These impediments include:


the
rights issued in connection with the stockholder rights plan that will substantially dilute the ownership of any person or group that acquires 15% or
more of our common stock unless the rights are first cancelled or redeemed by our board of directors, in its discretion;


the
classification of our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms;


the
ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock with rights as it deems appropriate without stockholder approval;


a
requirement that special meetings of our board of directors may be called only by our chairman, president or a majority of our board of directors;


a
prohibition against action by written consent of our stockholders;


a
requirement that our stockholders comply with advance notice provisions to bring director nominations or other matters before meetings of our
stockholders; and


the
adoption of a provision of Delaware law that prohibits us from entering into some business combinations with interested stockholders without the
approval of our board of directors. 

    The existence of the stockholder rights plan and these provisions may deprive you of an opportunity to sell your shares at a premium over prevailing prices. The potential inability of
our stockholders to obtain a control premium could adversely affect the market price for our common stock.

    Our stock price may decline if a large number of shares are sold or there is a perception that these sales may occur.  

    The market price of our stock could decline as a result of additional sales of common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur. As of the record
date for the divine 

special meeting, there was an aggregate of 

 shares of restricted divine common stock that could be resold only through
registration
under the Securities Act or under an available exemption from registration, including the exemption provided by Rule 144. As of the record date,    of those shares were eligible
for sale subject to the volume, manner of sale and other limitations of Rule 144; 13,800,000 shares will be registered pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 that
divine has agreed to file in connection with the Emicom transaction; and the remaining 

 shares will become eligible for sale between
the record date and August 2002, subject to certain lock-up agreements described below.

    The market price of divine common stock could decline as a result of the large number of shares that will become eligible for sale upon
consummation of the mergers.

    Based upon the divine average closing price of $1.23 on August 28, 2001, divine would issue 55,647,791 shares of divine common stock in the eshare
merger and grant options to purchase 4,271,184 additional shares of divine common stock. In addition, divine would issue 44,285,714 shares of divine common stock in the Open Market merger. divine
would also grant options and warrants to purchase 9,756,671 additional shares of divine common stock following the Open Market merger. divine would also issue 10,164,558 shares of divine common
stock in the RoweCom merger and grant options and warrants to purchase 1,510,066 additional shares

of divine common stock. As a result, we would have outstanding 270,138,767 shares of common stock after the mergers (assuming no exercise prior to the closings of the mergers of outstanding options or
warrants to acquire divine common stock, eshare common shares, Open Market common stock or RoweCom common stock).

    Based on the foregoing, approximately 72,408,202 of the shares of divine common stock issued in the mergers and the RoweCom transaction will be eligible for sale in the public market
without restriction under the Securities Act, and approximately 37,689,861 shares of divine common stock issued in the mergers and the RoweCom transaction to affiliates of eshare, Open Market and
RoweCom will be eligible for sale subject to the volume, manner of sale and other limitations of Rule 144 and Rule 145 under the Securities Act, including 28,280,941 shares to be issued
to eshare's principal shareholder, Szlam Partners, subject to the stockholder agreement described below. The market price of divine common stock could decline as a result of these sales or the
perception that these sales could occur.

    Aleksander Szlam, the chairman and chief executive officer of eshare, and Szlam Partners have agreed with divine that, for a period of one year from the date of the closing of the
eshare merger, they will not offer to sell, contract to sell, or otherwise sell, dispose of, loan, pledge or grant any rights with respect to shares of divine common stock they receive in connection
with the eshare merger, other than their right to sell shares directly to divine pursuant to the terms of their stockholder agreement with divine. Similarly, in connection with the acquisition of
Emicom Group, Inc. on July 18, 2001, certain of the founders of Emicom have agreed that they will not offer to sell, contract to sell, or otherwise sell, dispose of, loan, pledge or
grant any rights with respect to the 6,179,104 shares of divine common stock they received in that transaction until July 18, 2002. An early waiver of these lock-up agreements by us
could permit sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock and could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.

    If our common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq National Market, the liquidity, visibility and price of our common stock may decrease.  

    Since divine's initial public offering in July 2000, divine common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq National Market. Shares of our common stock could
be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market if we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq National Market, including the minimum bid price of $1.00 per share. If our common
stock is delisted from the Nasdaq National Market, we would be forced to list our common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board or some other quotation medium, depending upon our ability to
meet the specific listing requirements of those quotation systems. If this happens, an investor might find it more difficult to buy and sell, or to obtain accurate price quotations for, shares of our
common stock. This lack of visibility and liquidity could further decrease the price of our common stock. In addition, delisting from the Nasdaq National Market might negatively impact our reputation
and, as a consequence, our business.

Quorum; Required Votes  

 divine Special Meeting  

    At the divine special meeting, a quorum requires the presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of divine common
stock entitled to vote at the meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes (as defined below under "Proxies") will be counted as shares present for purposes of determining
whether a quorum exists. If the issuance of the

divine common stock in the eshare merger requires divine stockholder approval, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of divine common stock that are present in person or by
proxy and entitled to vote at the divine special meeting will be required. Similarly, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of divine common stock that are present in person
or by proxy and entitled to vote at the divine special meeting will be required to approve the issuance of the divine common stock in the Open Market merger. Abstentions by divine stockholders as to a
particular proposal will have the same effect as a vote against that proposal. Broker non-votes are counted as present, but are deemed not entitled to vote on proposals for which brokers
do not have discretionary authority and, therefore, have no effect on a particular proposal other than to reduce the number of affirmative votes needed to approve that proposal.

    Open Market, divine and certain of divine's stockholders have entered into stockholder agreements, pursuant to which certain of divine's stockholders have granted Open Market the
right to vote 37,841,681 shares of divine common stock owned by them in favor of the approval and adoption of the Open Market merger agreement and the Open Market merger, and the issuance of shares of
divine's common stock necessary to complete the Open Market

merger. As of the record date, the shares subject to these agreements represented approximately 24% of the outstanding shares of divine common stock entitled to vote at the divine special meeting.

 eshare Special Meeting  

    At the eshare special meeting, a quorum requires the presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding eshare common shares
entitled to vote at the meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. The affirmative vote of (1) a majority of the
eshare common shares outstanding as of the record date is required to approve and adopt the eshare merger agreement and the eshare merger, and (2) a majority of the votes cast at the eshare
special meeting is required to approve the amendment to the eshare employee stock purchase plan. Abstentions by eshare shareholders will have the same effect as votes against each of the proposed
eshare merger and the proposed amendment to the eshare employee stock purchase plan. Broker non-votes (as defined below under "Proxies") will not affect the outcome of the
proposed amendment to the eshare employee stock purchase plan, other than to reduce the number of affirmative votes needed to approve the proposal, but will have the effect of a vote against the
eshare merger proposal. Therefore, we encourage eshare shareholders that have

their eshare common shares registered in the name of their broker to direct their broker on how to vote their shares.

    divine has entered into a voting agreement with Szlam Partners, L.P., an entity beneficially owned by Aleksander Szlam, the chairman and chief executive officer of eshare,
under which divine has been granted the right to vote 10,745,969 eshare common shares owned by Szlam Partners in favor of the approval and adoption of the eshare merger agreement and the eshare
merger. As of the record date, the shares subject to this agreement represented approximately 49% of the outstanding eshare common shares entitled to vote at the eshare special meeting.

    Andrew J. Filipowski, the chairman and chief executive officer of divine, is a member of the
eshare board of directors. As of the record date, Mr. Filipowski beneficially owned 413,333 eshare common shares entitled to vote at the eshare special meeting, and has indicated his intention
to vote these shares in favor of approval and adoption of the eshare merger agreement and the eshare merger. As of the record date, eshare's directors and executive officers beneficially owned an
aggregate of 12,132,556 eshare common shares, representing approximately 55.3% of the eshare common shares entitled to vote at the eshare special meeting, and have indicated their intention to vote
these shares, or cause these shares to be voted, in favor of approval and adoption of the eshare merger agreement and the eshare merger.

 Open Market Special Meeting

    At the Open Market special meeting, a quorum requires the presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Open
Market common stock and Series E preferred stock, taken together as a single class, entitled to vote at the meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes (as defined below under
"Proxies") will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Open Market common stock and
Series E preferred stock

outstanding as of the record date, voting on an as converted basis (based on the initial Series E conversion price) and together with the common stock as a single class, is required to approve
and adopt the Open Market merger agreement and the Open Market merger. Abstentions by Open Market stockholders will have the same effect as votes against the proposed Open Market merger. Broker
non-votes will have the effect of a vote against the

Open Market merger proposal. Therefore, we encourage Open Market stockholders that have their shares of Open Market common stock registered in the name of their broker to direct their broker on how to
vote their shares.

    In addition, Open Market and each of Harland K. LaVigne, Thomas H. Bruggere, Shikhar Ghosh, William S. Kaiser, B.C. Krishna, Eugene F. Quinn, Paul L. Sagan, Patrick Scannell, Edward
Durkin, Joseph Alwan and Greylock Equity Limited Partnership, as stockholders of Open Market, have entered into a stockholder agreement with divine. Under the stockholder agreement, these stockholders
agreed to vote all of the shares covered by the stockholder agreement in favor of the Open Market merger, the Open Market merger agreement and all related agreements. In addition, these stockholders
each irrevocably appointed divine as his or its lawful attorney and proxy. The proxy grants divine, or any nominee of divine, the limited right to vote all of the shares of Open Market common stock
covered by the stockholder agreement in favor of the approval and adoption of the Open Market merger agreement and any transactions contemplated by the Open Market merger agreement. In addition, these
stockholders have further agreed not to offer, sell, pledge, encumber or otherwise dispose of all of their shares of Open Market common stock until the termination of the stockholder agreement, which
will occur upon the earlier of the termination of the Open Market merger agreement or the completion of the Open Market merger. As of the record date, the shares subject to these agreements
represented approximately 10.8% of the outstanding shares of Open Market common stock entitled to vote at the Open Market special meeting.

Proxies  

    All shares of divine common stock represented by properly executed proxies received before or at the divine special meeting, all eshare common shares
represented by properly executed proxies received before or at the eshare special meeting, and all shares of Open Market common stock and Series E preferred stock represented by properly
executed proxies received before or at the Open Market special meeting will, unless the proxies are revoked, be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on those proxies. If no instructions
are indicated for a particular proposal, including a merger proposal, on a properly executed proxy card of any company, those shares will be voted 
FOR  
that proposal.

    If
your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you must direct them on how to vote your shares. If you do not provide these directions and a broker or bank holding
your shares returns an executed proxy card indicating that the broker or bank does not have discretionary authority to vote on


the
approval of the issuance of divine common stock in the mergers, in the case of a divine stockholder,


the
approval and adoption of the eshare merger agreement and the eshare merger, and/or the amendment to the eshare employee stock purchase plan, in the
case of an eshare shareholder, or


the
approval and adoption of the Open Market merger agreement and the Open Market merger in the case of an Open Market stockholder,

this will constitute a broker non-vote as to that particular proposal. Shares represented by broker non-votes will be considered present at the special meetings for purposes of
determining the presence of a quorum, but will not be considered to have been voted in favor of the approval of the issuance of divine common stock in the mergers for divine, the approval and adoption
of the eshare merger agreement and the eshare merger and the amendment to the eshare employee stock purchase plan for eshare, or the approval and adoption of the Open Market merger agreement and the
Open Market merger for Open Market. Your broker or bank will vote your shares only if you provide directions on how to vote by following the instructions provided to you by your broker.

    divine
stockholders may vote by telephone or over the Internet. If you vote by telephone or over the Internet, you will be required to have the control number appearing on your proxy
card available in order to submit your vote. A properly completed telephone or Internet vote has the same effect as if you marked, signed and returned the proxy card by mail. See the instructions on
the proxy card or voting instructions card for a detailed description of the telephone and Internet voting procedures. divine believes that the granting of proxies by telephone or over the Internet is
valid under Delaware law. Please note that if you choose to vote over the Internet, you are responsible for any Internet access charges incurred. 

eshare shareholders and Open Market stockholders may only vote in person at the eshare special meeting or Open Market special meeting, respectively, or by
granting a proxy by signing and mailing the proxy card.

    divine, eshare and Open Market do not expect that any matter other than approval of the issuance of divine common stock in each of the mergers, in the case of
divine, approval of the eshare merger agreement and the eshare merger and approval of the amendment to the

eshare employee stock purchase plan, in the case of eshare, and approval of the Open Market merger agreement and the Open Market merger, in the case of Open Market, will be brought before its
respective special meeting. If, however, other matters are properly presented, the persons named as proxies will vote in accordance with their judgment with respect to those matters, unless you
withhold authority to do so on the proxy card.

    Stockholders
or shareholders of record may change their proxies in any of the following ways:


by
sending a written notice to the secretary of either divine, eshare or Open Market, as applicable, prior to that company's special meeting, stating that
they would like to revoke their proxies;


by
completing, signing and dating another proxy card and returning it by mail to divine, eshare or Open Market, as applicable, prior to that company's
special meeting;


by
telephone or via the Internet, if they are divine stockholders, by following the instructions provided on their proxy cards; or


by
attending the applicable special meeting and voting in person.

Attendance
at a special meeting will not in and of itself constitute revocation of a proxy; you must cast an actual vote. 

    If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other fiduciary, including under the divine employee stock purchase plan, and you have directed that person to vote your
shares, you must instruct that person if you want to change your vote.

Solicitation of Proxies  

    divine, eshare and Open Market will share equally the expenses incurred in printing and mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The initial solicitation
of proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone, Internet or personal solicitation by directors, officers or other regular employees of divine, eshare and Open Market, respectively. No additional
compensation will be paid to directors, officers or other regular employees for these services. divine, eshare and Open Market will also request banks, brokers and other intermediaries holding divine
common stock, eshare common shares and Open Market common stock beneficially owned by others to send this joint proxy statement/prospectus to, and obtain proxies from, the beneficial owners and will
reimburse the holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing.

    Open Market has retained Georgeson Shareholder Communications, Inc. to assist with the solicitation of proxies from Open Market stockholders. Georgeson will be paid $7,500 for its
services by Open Market.

    eshare shareholders and Open Market stockholders should not send in any eshare or Open Market stock certificates with their proxy cards. The exchange agent will mail a transmittal
letter to you containing instructions for the surrender of eshare and Open Market stock certificates as soon as practicable after completion of the respective mergers.

  THE ESHARE MERGER

    This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes material aspects of the proposed eshare merger, including the eshare merger agreement, voting
agreement and stockholder agreement. While we believe that the description covers the material terms of the eshare merger, this summary may not contain all of the information that is important to you.
You should read carefully this entire joint proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents to which we refer for a more complete understanding of the eshare merger. Complete copies of the eshare
merger agreement, the voting agreement and the stockholder agreement are attached as Annexes A, B and C, respectively, to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Structure of the eshare Merger

    If the eshare shareholders approve and adopt the eshare merger agreement and the eshare merger and, if necessary, divine stockholders approve the issuance of
divine common stock in the eshare merger, and all other conditions to the eshare merger agreement are satisfied, eshare will merge into DES, a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine. As a result, eshare
will cease its separate corporate existence and become a part of DES, the surviving corporation. We currently anticipate that we will complete the eshare merger on or about             ,

and, in any event, unless the parties agree otherwise, on the second business day after obtaining stockholder and shareholder approval at the special meetings and satisfaction or waiver of all other
conditions of the eshare merger agreement.

Background of the eshare Merger

    As part of their continuous efforts to increase shareholder value, eshare's board and executive management have regularly evaluated potential strategic
combinations. To that end, eshare employed Broadview International LLC to act as its financial advisor and assist in this regard. eshare, with Broadview's assistance, has from time to time evaluated
numerous potential strategic relationships. 

    In
December 2000, eshare's executive management met to discuss a wide range of strategic options for the business coincident with the usual end of year review and finalization
of the 2001 operating plan and to reevaluate its overall business strategy and operations. At that time, eshare's management agreed that, while exploring opportunities in the market, and pending
completion of a strategic alternative, eshare would maintain its efforts to increase shareholder value by continuing to develop and market its products and services. 

    In
late February 2001, a representative of divine contacted Aleksander Szlam, chairman and chief executive officer of eshare, to discuss a potential business arrangement.
Representatives of divine had expressed a general interest in potentially acquiring eshare in the spring of 2000, but neither company pursued a transaction at that time. Mr. Szlam invited
divine to develop a proposal for review by eshare. 

    On
February 22, 2001, eshare's executive management met with representatives of a third party to discuss the prospect of a strategic business combination. 

    On
March 20, 2001, eshare's executive management discussed the status of potential strategic business arrangements with the eshare board. All of eshare's directors were present
at this meeting except Andrew J. Filipowski. Mr. Filipowski, as chairman and chief executive 

officer of divine, did not participate in any eshare board discussions concerning potential transactions with divine or the third party. The eshare board authorized eshare's executive management to
proceed with separate preliminary discussions with both divine and the third party concerning a possible transaction. 

    On
March 23, 2001, eshare's executive management gave a presentation concerning its general business strategies, products and services to the divine transaction team. 

    On

    On
April 6, 2001, the divine transaction team continued to internally discuss and evaluate the structure and financial terms of a potential acquisition of eshare. 

    From
April 11 through April 13, 2001, members of the divine transaction team met with eshare management at eshare's headquarters in Norcross, Georgia to discuss
operating results, financial systems and preliminary due diligence matters. 

    On
April 18, 2001, a representative of the divine transaction team presented the potential acquisition of eshare to divine's executive management and reviewed various
transaction structure, valuation and operational matters. 

    Also
on April 18, 2001, divine sent a preliminary, non-binding term sheet to the chief executive officer of eshare, setting forth a
stock-for-stock merger proposal. The transaction structure and valuation were discussed by eshare's chief executive officer and representatives of divine. 

    On
April 20, 2001, the divine transaction team discussed due diligence and operational matters with its outside accounting consultants. 

    In May 2001, Broadview, at eshare's request, began to evaluate the indications of interest received from both divine and the third party and to assist eshare in discussions
with potential strategic partners. From this date through the execution of the eshare merger agreement with divine, members of eshare's executive management regularly discussed eshare's strategic
alternatives with Broadview.

    On
May 9, 2001, eshare's chief executive officer conducted separate meetings in Atlanta, Georgia with divine and the third party to review the status of a potential business
transaction. At these meetings, each company was invited to continue to pursue a strategic combination with eshare. 

    On
May 20, 2001, the divine transaction team presented the status, structure and financial terms of the potential eshare acquisition to the executive management of divine. 

    From
May 21 through May 30, 2001, divine and its outside accounting consultants continued their preliminary investigation of eshare. 

    On
May 22, 2001, eshare held its regularly scheduled board meeting. eshare's board and executive management discussed various strategic alternatives and business combinations,
including potential transactions with divine or the third party. 

    On
May 23, 2001, members of eshare's executive management met with Broadview to further evaluate eshare's strategic alternatives. Broadview was authorized to continue
discussions with divine and the third party regarding a potential transaction. 

    On May 24, 2001, Broadview and the third party's outside financial advisor discussed the preparation of a preliminary, non-binding term sheet outlining the proposed
terms and conditions of a possible transaction. 

    On
May 25, 2001, Broadview presented eshare's executive management with preliminary eshare valuation information and discussed key issues in pursuing a strategic transaction. 

    From
May 29 through May 30, 2001, representatives of the third party and its financial advisor met with representatives of eshare and Broadview to discuss eshare's
operations, technology, financial condition and prospects and other preliminary due diligence matters. 

    On
May 30, 2001, the divine transaction team distributed summary due diligence information concerning eshare to divine's board of directors. 

    On
May 31, 2001, representatives of divine and eshare's chief executive officer discussed transaction structure and valuation issues. After receiving the preliminary approval
of its board, divine presented a revised, non-binding term sheet to Broadview outlining the proposed terms and conditions of a stock-for-stock merger, including a
fixed exchange ratio of divine shares per eshare common share. 

    Also
on May 31, 2001, Broadview provided additional information concerning eshare to the third party's financial advisor. 

    On
June 1, 2001, Broadview, eshare's executive management and outside counsel discussed the previous negotiations and identified outstanding issues in connection with the
non-binding term sheet submitted by divine and the expression of interest of the third party. Representatives of Broadview separately discussed various business and valuation issues with
divine and the third party's financial advisor. 

    On
June 4, 2001, divine presented a revised, non-binding term sheet to Broadview outlining proposed terms and conditions of a potential
stock-for-stock merger transaction. Broadview reviewed the revised, non-binding term sheet with eshare's executive management and outside counsel and subsequently
discussed outstanding issues with divine. Later that evening, divine delivered a further revised, non-binding term sheet to eshare responding to the issues presented by Broadview. 

    Also
on June 4, 2001, the third party's financial advisor indicated to Broadview that the third party could not meet eshare's valuation expectations and would not be submitting
a term sheet for a possible transaction. 

    On
June 5, 2001, Broadview reviewed preliminary valuation information and outstanding issues concerning the non-binding divine term sheet with eshare's board and
executive management. eshare's board authorized Broadview to continue negotiations with divine and requested a meeting among eshare's board, eshare's executive management and the divine transaction
team to discuss divine's business strategy and rationale for the possible transaction. 

    On
June 6, 2001, Broadview communicated eshare's negotiating position to divine and the request of eshare's board for a meeting at eshare's headquarters in Norcross, Georgia. 

    Also
on June 6, 2001, the third party's financial advisor discussed a possible revised valuation range with Broadview. 

    On June 7, 2001, Broadview and divine discussed alternative transaction structures providing potential price protection for eshare's shareholders. 

    Also
on June 7, 2001, Broadview requested that the third party's financial advisor submit a preliminary, non-binding term sheet on behalf of the third party. 

    On
June 8, 2001, representatives of divine met with eshare's executive management and Broadview at eshare's headquarters in Norcross, Georgia to engage in an initial due
diligence review of divine's business strategy and discuss the merits of a potential business combination between the companies. 

    On
June 11, 2001, the third party's financial advisor presented a preliminary, non-binding term sheet to Broadview outlining proposed terms and conditions of a
possible transaction between the third party and eshare. The terms presented by the third party provided for a mix of cash and stock at a lower valuation than that proposed by divine. 

    On
June 12, 2001, Broadview discussed the preliminary, non-binding term sheet with the third party's financial advisor. 

    Also
on June 12, 2001, divine presented a further revised, non-binding term sheet to Broadview outlining proposed terms and conditions of a possible transaction
between divine and eshare, including price protection for eshare's shareholders in the form of a price collar. 

    On
June 13, 2001, Broadview and eshare's board and executive management reviewed the non-binding term sheets provided by divine and the third party. eshare's board
deemed the divine non-binding term sheet to be superior to that of the third party, authorized Broadview to clarify various issues regarding the price collar structure, and instructed
eshare's executive management to sign a 14-day exclusivity agreement with divine pending satisfactory resolution of the open issues. 

    On
June 14, 2001, eshare entered into a 14-day exclusivity agreement with divine to pursue a possible business combination. 

    Also on June 14, 2001, the revised terms and valuation of the potential eshare acquisition were tentatively approved by divine's board. divine's outside counsel transmitted an
initial business due diligence request to eshare and Broadview and began to draft the definitive eshare merger agreement and ancillary documentation.

    From June 18 through June 28, 2001, several meetings were held at eshare's headquarters in Norcross, Georgia among representatives of eshare, divine, the companies'
outside counsel and divine's outside accounting consultants to review eshare's operations, technology and financial condition, as well as to discuss divine's operations and the potential synergies of
the combined companies. At these meetings, members of eshare's executive management presented an overview highlighting eshare's operations, product positioning, technology, research and development
efforts and results of operations and financial conditions. Meetings among representatives of eshare, divine and Broadview regarding financial and technological due diligence issues concerning both
companies and post-merger integration matters continued through the execution of the eshare merger agreement, as did legal and business due diligence by divine's representatives.
Negotiation of the definitive terms of the eshare merger agreement and ancillary documentation among divine's outside counsel, eshare's outside counsel and Broadview also continued through the
execution of the eshare merger agreement.

    On June 20, 2001, Broadview and eshare's board and executive management reviewed the price collar structure in light of the market prices of divine common stock and eshare
common shares. eshare's board authorized Broadview to negotiate a revised price collar structure with divine. 

    From June 21 through June 27, 2001, representatives of Broadview and divine negotiated a revised price collar structure and other terms and conditions of the proposed
eshare merger agreement.

    On
June 28, 2001, Broadview, eshare's board and eshare's executive management discussed the status of the divine price collar negotiations. eshare's board authorized Broadview
to re-approach the third party's financial advisor after the expiration of the divine exclusivity period to determine if the third party remained interested in pursuing a potential
strategic transaction with eshare. The divine exclusivity period expired at midnight on this date. 

    On
June 29, 2001, the third party's financial advisor indicated that the third party remained interested in a potential transaction, but only at the valuation range previously
discussed. 

    Also
on June 29, 2001, divine's board tentatively approved a revised price collar structure, which was outlined in a further revised, non-binding term sheet
presented to Broadview later that evening. 

    On
June 30, 2001, Broadview and eshare's board, executive management and outside counsel discussed divine's further revised, non-binding term sheet and the third
party's verbal indication of continued interest. eshare's board concluded that divine's offer was superior and determined that there was no reason to move forward with the third party unless presented
with a substantially improved offer. eshare's board authorized Broadview to continue negotiations concerning greater price protection for eshare shareholders with divine. 

    On
July 2, 2001, eshare entered into a second 14-day exclusivity agreement with divine to pursue a possible business combination. 

    From
July 2 to July 3, 2001, eshare's outside counsel conducted a due diligence review of divine's operations at divine's offices located in Lisle, Illinois. 

    Also on July 3, 2001, Broadview, eshare's board and executive management discussed the status of negotiations, timing issues and the roles and responsibilities of eshare's
independent directors, as well as the scope of Broadview's fairness opinion. eshare's independent directors (Messrs. Jeffery, House, Pellicci and Tito) determined that they should obtain
independent counsel to review the eshare merger agreement and ancillary documents and advise them. The independent directors held a separate meeting with independent counsel to discuss the specifics
of the proposed agreements.

    On July 4, 2001, the independent directors and independent counsel reviewed the proposed eshare merger transaction, the proposed ancillary transactions to which Mr. Szlam and
entities controlled by him would be parties and the scope of their fiduciary duties with the independent counsel.

    On
July 5, 2001, Broadview, eshare's outside counsel, Mr. Szlam, eshare's independent directors, eshare's executive management and independent counsel held a meeting at which 

eshare's independent directors requested a chronology of the discussions with divine and the third party and a summary of the eshare merger agreement and ancillary documents. Later that day, the
independent directors and independent counsel met to review the requested materials and to discuss the eshare merger transaction and the ancillary transactions. In their fiduciary capacity to the
company's public shareholders, eshare's independent directors requested that certain elements of the ancillary transactions be restructured. Later that same day, another meeting was held with the
independent directors, independent counsel, Broadview and eshare's outside counsel, at which Broadview reported on transaction structure changes it felt were necessary to provide eshare with a
fairness opinion taking into consideration both the eshare merger and the ancillary transactions. The independent directors and independent counsel then met separately to discuss transaction structure
alternatives and subsequently requested that Broadview negotiate with divine to restructure various elements of the eshare merger and ancillary transactions.

    On
July 6, 2001, the independent directors and independent counsel continued to meet and review further transaction structure changes and the progress of negotiations with
divine. Broadview reported on the continuing negotiations regarding the independent directors' proposed structure revisions, and eshare's executive management reviewed the potential benefits of a
merger with divine to eshare's shareholders and customers. 

    On July 7, 2001, the independent directors and independent counsel met to discuss the eshare merger and ancillary transactions. The independent directors were informed by
Broadview and eshare's executive management that divine had made certain revisions to the transaction structure.

    On
July 8, 2001, the independent directors and independent counsel met with eshare's executive management and outside counsel to discuss the progression of the negotiations
with divine. 

    Later on July 8, 2001, eshare's independent directors held a meeting during which the independent directors, independent counsel, eshare's executive management and Broadview
reviewed the status of the negotiations with divine and the terms of the revised versions of the eshare merger agreement and ancillary documents. Broadview presented an analysis of the transaction and
provided its opinion that the consideration to be received in the eshare merger by holders of eshare common shares is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. eshare's independent
directors then unanimously voted to approve and adopt the eshare merger agreement and the agreements and transactions contemplated thereby, and

unanimously voted to recommend that eshare's shareholders approve and adopt the eshare merger agreement and the eshare merger.

    Also on July 8, 2001, divine's board reviewed the terms of the revised eshare merger agreement and ancillary documents. Robertson Stephens presented its opinion that the eshare
exchange ratio as of July 8, 2001 was fair, from a financial point of view, to divine. divine's board, with the exception of Mr. Filipowski, who recused himself from the board decision
regarding the merger with eshare, and board members John Cooper and Kevin Nater, who were not present at the meeting, then unanimously voted to approve and adopt the eshare merger agreement and the
ancillary agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby and unanimously voted to recommend that divine's stockholders approve the issuance of divine common stock in the eshare merger, if their
approval was necessary.

    On July 8, 2001, the parties reached final agreement on all terms and signed the eshare merger agreement, the voting agreement and the stockholder agreement.

    On July 9, 2001, prior to the opening of the Nasdaq National Market, divine and eshare issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the eshare merger agreement.

The Companies' Reasons for the eshare Merger

    The boards of directors of divine and eshare independently concluded that the proposed eshare merger will afford to each company the complementary strengths of
the two individual companies, will provide the combined company significant potential advantages and resources and potentially will enable the combined company to address emerging strategic
opportunities more quickly and effectively.

    divine and eshare have each identified additional reasons for the eshare merger, as discussed below. It should be noted, however, that the potential benefits of the eshare merger may
not be fully realized. See "Risk Factors" beginning on page 31.

divine's Reasons for the eshare Merger and Recommendation of divine's Board of Directors

    The divine board of directors believes that the eshare merger is fair to, and in the best interest of, divine's stockholders, and, with one director, Andrew J.
Filipowski, excluded because he is a director of eshare, and two other directors not present at the meeting at which action was taken, unanimously recommends that divine's stockholders approve the
issuance of divine common stock in the eshare merger.

    In
reaching its decision, in addition to the anticipated joint benefits described above, the divine board of directors consulted with divine's management, as well as its legal counsel
and financial advisor, and considered, among others, the following information and potential material factors: 


the
compatibility of eshare's products and services with divine's enterprise Web solutions business strategy;


the
economics of the software solutions industry and the belief of the divine board that greater product variety, size and resources will increasingly be
required for companies to compete successfully in this industry;


the
belief that the combination of eshare's technology, products and services with divine's products, services, sales and marketing infrastructure should
enable the combined company to expand the range of products and services offered to the combined company's customers and increase sales;


the
divine board's expectation that the addition of eshare's operations to divine would likely increase the overall value and profitability of divine;


information
concerning divine's and eshare's respective businesses, historical financial performance and condition, operations, technology, products,
strategic partners, customers, competitive positions, prospects and management;


current
financial market conditions and the historical market prices, volatility and trading information of divine common stock and eshare common shares; 


the
financial and other terms of the eshare merger, including the relationship between the market value of divine common stock and eshare common shares and
a comparison of comparable merger transactions;


the
belief that the terms of the eshare merger agreement, including the parties' representations, warranties and covenants, and the conditions to their
respective obligations, are fair and reasonable;


the
likelihood that the eshare merger would be completed, including the limited conditions to the closing of the eshare merger, as well as the experience,
reputation and financial condition of eshare;


the
potential impact of the eshare merger on strategic partners, customers and employees of divine and eshare;


the
likely reaction to the eshare merger in the financial markets; and


the
presentation of Robertson Stephens, Inc. and the opinion of Robertson Stephens to the effect that, subject to certain matters set out in its
opinion, the eshare exchange ratio, as of July 8, 2001 (which, at the time, would have been 2.08) was fair, from a financial point of view, to divine. A copy of Robertson Stephens' written
opinion dated July 8, 2001, setting forth the assumptions made, matters considered and review undertaken, is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex D. divine
stockholders are urged to read the Robertson Stephens opinion in its entirety.

    The divine board of directors considered various alternatives to the eshare merger, including alternative acquisitions and directly competing with eshare in its markets. The divine
board of

directors also identified and considered a variety of potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the eshare merger, including, but not limited to:


the
possibility that the potential benefits set forth above may not be fully realized;


the
substantial costs of integrating the businesses of divine and eshare and the transaction expenses arising from the eshare merger;


certain
risks applicable to the eshare merger and the business of the combined company as set forth under "Risk Factors" beginning on page 31; and


the
possibility that the eshare merger might not be consummated, resulting in a potential adverse effect on the market price of the divine common stock.

Notwithstanding
the risks, the divine board of directors concluded that the positive factors outlined above outweighed any negative considerations. 

    The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the divine board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed to include the material factors
considered by the divine board of directors in connection with its review of the proposed eshare merger. In view of the variety of factors, both positive and negative, considered, the divine board of
directors did not find it practical to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to the specific factors considered. Rather, the divine board of directors viewed its position and
recommendations as being based on the totality of the information presented to, and considered by, the divine board. In addition, individual members of the divine board of directors may have given
different weight to different factors.

    In considering the proposed eshare merger, the divine board of directors was aware that Andrew J. Filipowski is a member of eshare's board of directors and, as of July 8, 2001,
beneficially owned approximately 2.0% of eshare's outstanding common shares. See "Interests of Certain Persons in the eshare Merger" beginning on page 89.

    Based on the above-described analysis, the divine board of directors has determined that the terms of the eshare merger and the eshare merger agreement are fair to, and in the best
interests of, the divine stockholders. Accordingly, the divine board of directors has approved and adopted the eshare merger agreement and the eshare merger and recommends that the stockholders of
divine vote 
FOR
 approval of the issuance of divine common stock in the eshare merger.

eshare's Reasons for the eshare Merger and Recommendation of eshare's Board of Directors

    The eshare board of directors believes that the eshare merger is fair to eshare's shareholders and in their best interest, and, with Andrew J. Filipowski and
Aleksander Szlam excluded as interested directors, unanimously recommends the approval and adoption of the eshare merger agreement and the eshare merger.

    In
reaching its decision, in addition to the anticipated joint benefits described above, the eshare board of directors consulted with eshare's management, as well as its legal counsel
and financial advisor, and considered, among others, the following information and potential material factors: 

    Financial Terms; Premium Valuation; Continuing Interest in Combined Company.
  The eshare board noted that:


Based
on the closing price of divine common stock on the last trading day prior to the meeting at which the board approved the eshare merger agreement and
the negotiated collar protecting the eshare shareholders from divine's stock price volatility, the per share value of the eshare merger consideration represented a premium of approximately:


143%
over the closing price of eshare's common shares on the last trading day prior to eshare's board approval; and


147%
over the closing price of eshare's common shares 20 days prior to eshare's board approval. 


Historical
analysis of the premiums paid since January 1, 1999 for public software companies with total consideration between $25 million and
$100 million showed only 1 of 33 companies purchased at a premium over 100%. 

    Alternatives to the eshare Merger.
  The eshare board had considered numerous strategic alternatives and concluded that
the eshare merger represented the most desirable strategic alternative for eshare, as well as the most attractive opportunity that was available to eshare and its shareholders. Specifically:


The
eshare board believed that to effectively compete in the CIM market, eshare needed to invest further in research and development. Without a strategic
partner, it would be very hard, if not impossible, to secure the capital necessary for such investments. 


The
eshare board considered various strategic alternatives available to eshare, including:


continuing
as an independent entity and entering into strategic financing or business arrangements with other industry participants or financing sources
that would assist eshare in financing its business strategy; and


entering
into a combination with, or being acquired by, another company in the CIM sector. 


eshare's
directors and management investigated and discussed these strategic alternatives over a period of months, and, during this period, were in contact
with and/or engaged in discussions with other parties to determine if they would be interested in acquiring or engaging in a strategic or financial alliance with eshare, as discussed under
"Background of the eshare Merger" beginning on page 60.


After
intensive efforts to find another strategic partner, as described above, only one other party indicated a significant interest in engaging in a
business combination. However, the valuation range proposed by that third party was substantially lower than the price collar structure agreed to by divine and did not offer a value to eshare
shareholders comparable to that offered by divine. The proposal from the third party was not a firm proposal, did not offer the assurances of value or completion offered by divine and was subject to a
due diligence contingency. 

    Opinion of Financial Advisor.
  Broadview International LLC, eshare's financial advisor, made presentations to the
eshare board concerning financial aspects of the proposed eshare merger and of the various strategic alternatives available to eshare, and delivered its oral opinion, confirmed in writing, that as of
the date of that opinion, the consideration to be received in the eshare merger by holders of eshare common shares is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

    Distribution Agreement with divine.
  The eshare board viewed favorably divine's desire to become a distributor of the
eshare products immediately upon signing of the eshare merger agreement. The board believed that the addition of divine's sales force would help eshare's sales while offering divine personnel the
opportunity to become trained on the eshare products.

    Complementary Strategies and Technologies.
  The eshare board believed that there is a strong strategic and technology
fit between divine's and eshare's product plans. 

    New Opportunities for Growth.
  The eshare board believed that the combination of eshare's and divine's businesses would
create growth opportunities not available to either company without the eshare merger. These include the opportunities to:


offer
and provide a suite of customer interaction products that will allow the combined company to offer its customers more complete software solutions;


accelerate
the introduction of next-generation customer interaction platforms that will be built around eshare's Conversations and NetAgent
products; and


use
divine's greater financial resources to finance eshare's growth-focused business strategy, which is expected to require significant capital commitments
in the near term. 

    The eshare board observed that these opportunities could enable the combined company to grow more quickly and beyond the levels eshare could be expected to achieve without the eshare
merger.

    Likelihood of Completion.
  The eshare board believed that the nature and relatively limited number of conditions to the
completion of the eshare merger, and the strength of divine's obligations to fulfill those conditions, increased the likelihood that the eshare merger will be

completed. The eshare board also took into account divine's strong commitment to the deal throughout the negotiation of the transaction.

    Price Protection.
  The eshare board viewed favorably the provisions in the eshare merger agreement pursuant to which the
eshare exchange ratio for the conversion of eshare's common shares to divine's common stock adjusts to give the eshare shareholders substantial price protection. The eshare merger agreement provides a
"collar" mechanism that mitigates the effect of a decrease in the trading price of divine's common stock and allows the eshare board to terminate the eshare merger if the closing sale price of
divine's common stock is less than $1.00 for any 10 trading day period ending after the SEC declares effective the registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part, but
prior to the date of eshare's special meeting.

    Tax-Free Treatment.
  It is expected that the portion of the eshare merger consideration to be received by
eshare shareholders in the form of shares of divine common stock will be tax-free to those shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

    The eshare board of directors also considered the terms of the eshare merger agreement regarding eshare's right to consider, negotiate and undertake other acquisition proposals that
might arise following announcement of the eshare merger, as well as the possible effects of the provision regarding termination fees. In the course of these deliberations, legal counsel to eshare
advised the eshare board of directors as to its fiduciary obligations in the context of considering the proposed transaction. The eshare board of directors concluded that, while the existence of the
termination fee provision might reduce the likelihood that a third party would propose an alternative transaction with eshare pending completion of the eshare merger, the increased costs to a third
party would not be material and that the benefits of the eshare merger to eshare outweighed the risks.

    The eshare board of directors also identified and considered a variety of potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the eshare merger, including, but not limited
to:


the
risks described under "Risk Factors" beginning on page 31;


that
the eshare merger agreement is required to be submitted to the eshare shareholders even if the eshare board withdraws or changes its recommendation
that eshare shareholders vote in favor of the eshare merger;


shareholder
approval of the eshare merger is virtually assured even if the eshare board were to withdraw or change its recommendation because Szlam
Partners intended to enter into a stockholder agreement with divine contemporaneously with the signing of the eshare merger agreement, under which it would agree to vote shares representing
approximately 49% of the outstanding voting power in favor of the eshare merger agreement, and the chief executive officer of divine, Andrew J. Filipowski, also

beneficially
owned approximately 2.0% of eshare's outstanding common shares as of July 8, 2001;


these
facts would likely discourage other potentially interested third parties from proposing an alternative or superior transaction to eshare and would
prevent eshare from engaging in any such transaction if proposed; and


that
divine common stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past year. 

    The eshare board believed and continues to believe that these potential risks are outweighed by the potential benefits anticipated to result from the eshare merger.

    In considering the proposed eshare merger, the directors of eshare were aware of the interests of certain officers and directors in the eshare merger described under
"Interests of Certain Persons in the eshare Merger" beginning on page 89.

    The foregoing discussion addresses the material information and factors considered by the eshare board in its consideration of the eshare merger, including factors that support the
eshare merger as well as those that may weigh against it. The eshare board conducted numerous discussions of the factors described above, including asking questions of eshare's management and legal
and financial advisors, as well as independent legal counsel hired by the independent directors. In view of the variety of factors and the amount of information considered, the eshare board did not
find it practical to, and did not, make specific assessments of, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination. In addition, the eshare
board did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to its ultimate determination. The
determination to

approve the eshare merger was made after consideration of all of the factors as a whole. In addition, individual members of the eshare board may have given different weight to different factors.

    The eshare board of directors has determined that the terms of the eshare merger and the eshare merger agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of, eshare shareholders.
Accordingly, the eshare board of directors has approved the eshare merger agreement and the eshare merger and recommends that the shareholders of eshare vote 

FOR
 approval and adoption of the eshare
merger agreement and the eshare merger.

Opinion of Financial Advisor to divine's Board of Directors  

    On July 3, 2001, divine engaged Robertson Stephens, Inc. to act as its financial advisor in connection with the eshare merger, and to render an
opinion as to the fairness of the eshare exchange ratio, from a financial point of view, to divine.

    On July 8, 2001, at a meeting of the divine board held to evaluate the proposed eshare merger, Robertson Stephens delivered to divine's board its oral opinion that, as of
July 8, 2001 and based on the matters considered and the limitations on the review undertaken described in the opinion, the eshare exchange ratio (which, at that time, would have been 2.08) was
fair, from a financial point of view, to divine. Shortly thereafter, Robertson Stephens delivered a written opinion, dated July 8, 2001, to the same effect. Robertson Stephens has consented to
the use of its opinion in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the full text of this opinion is reprinted as Annex D to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

No limitations were imposed by divine's board on Robertson Stephens with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by it in furnishing its opinion. The eshare exchange ratio was
determined through negotiations between the management of divine and eshare. Robertson Stephens was not asked by, and did not recommend to, divine that any specific exchange ratio constituted the
appropriate exchange ratio for the eshare merger.

    You
should consider the following when reading the discussion of the opinion of Robertson Stephens, divine's financial advisor, in this document:


We
urge divine stockholders to read carefully the entire opinion of Robertson Stephens, which is set forth in Annex D to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference and set forth as Annex D to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.


The
following description of the Robertson Stephens opinion is qualified by reference to the full opinion located in Annex D to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. The full opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions by Robertson Stephens, the matters it considered and the limitations on the review undertaken.


The
Robertson Stephens opinion was prepared for the benefit and use of the divine board in its consideration of the eshare merger and does not constitute a
recommendation to stockholders of divine as to how they should vote at the special meeting, or take any other action, in connection with the eshare merger.


The
Robertson Stephens opinion does not address the relative merits of the eshare merger and any other transactions or business strategies discussed by the
divine board as alternatives to the eshare merger agreement or the underlying business decision of the divine board to proceed with or effect the eshare merger.

    The
Robertson Stephens opinion is necessarily based upon market, economic and other conditions as in effect on, and information made available to it as of, the date of the opinion. It
should be understood that subsequent developments may affect the conclusion expressed in the Robertson Stephens opinion and that Robertson Stephens disclaims any undertaking or obligation to advise
any person of any change in any matter affecting the opinion which may come or be brought to its attention after the date of the opinion or to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. The Robertson
Stephens opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of July 8, 2001, of the exchange ratio (which, at that time, would have been 2.08) to divine. 

 Opinion and Analysis of Robertson Stephens  

    In connection with the preparation of the Robertson Stephens opinion, Robertson Stephens: 


reviewed
certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of eshare and divine, respectively;


reviewed
certain publicly available research estimates of research analysts regarding eshare and divine;


held
discussions with the respective managements of eshare and divine concerning the businesses, past and current operations, financial condition
(including certain forward 

looking
information concerning eshare and divine) and future prospects of both eshare and divine, independently and combined, including discussions with the managements of eshare and divine concerning
their views regarding the strategic rationale for the eshare merger;


reviewed
the financial terms and conditions set forth in the draft eshare merger agreement dated July 8, 2001;


reviewed
the stock price and trading history of eshare common shares and divine common stock;


compared
the financial performance of eshare and the prices and trading activity of eshare common shares with that of certain other publicly traded
companies comparable with eshare;


compared
the financial terms of the merger with the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of other transactions that it deemed relevant;


reviewed
certain diligence materials prepared for the management of divine; and


made
such other studies and inquiries, and reviewed such other data, as it deemed relevant. 

    In
its review and analysis, and in arriving at its opinion, Robertson Stephens assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and other information
provided to it (including information furnished to it orally or otherwise discussed with it by the managements of eshare and divine) or publicly available and has neither attempted to verify, nor
assumed responsibility for verifying, any of such information. Robertson Stephens relied upon the assurances of the managements of eshare and divine that they are not aware of any facts that would
make such information inaccurate or misleading. Furthermore, Robertson Stephens did not obtain or make, or assume any responsibility for obtaining or making, any independent evaluation or appraisal of
the properties, assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of eshare or divine, nor was it furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Robertson Stephens has relied without independent
verification upon the information furnished to it for purposes of its opinion. 

    With
respect to the performance and prospects of eshare that Robertson Stephens discussed, Robertson Stephens assumed that divine's and eshare's managements' views regarding the
combined company's performance and prospects were arrived at in good faith, and were based on reasonable assumptions regarding the future financial condition and performance of the combined company,
and reflect the best currently available judgments of the management of divine and eshare, respectively, and it further assumed that such performance will be realized as anticipated by management. 

    In
addition, Robertson Stephens assumed that:


the
eshare merger will be consummated upon the terms set forth in the draft eshare merger agreement made available to it without material alteration
thereof, including, among other things, that the eshare merger will be accounted for as a "purchase method" business combination in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles;


the
eshare merger will be treated as a tax-free reorganization pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; and


historical
financial statements of each of eshare and divine reviewed by it were prepared and fairly presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied. 

    Robertson
Stephens expressed no opinion as to:


the
value of any stockholder, non-competition or employee agreements or other arrangements entered into in connection with the eshare merger;


any
tax or other consequences that might result from the eshare merger;


the
value of divine common stock when issued to eshare's shareholders pursuant to the eshare merger or the price at which shares of divine common stock may
be traded in the future;


the
relative merits of the eshare merger and the other business strategies that divine's board of directors has considered or may be considering;


the
decision of divine's board of directors to proceed with the eshare merger; or


any
legal or accounting matters, as to which Robertson Stephens understood that divine obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified
professionals. 

    The
following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Robertson Stephens in connection with rendering its opinion. The summary of the financial analyses is not a
complete description of all of the analyses performed by Robertson Stephens. Certain of the information in this section is presented in tabular form. In order to better understand the financial
analyses performed by Robertson Stephens, these tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The Robertson Stephens opinion is based on the totality of the various analyses which it
performed, and no particular portion of the analysis has any merit standing alone.

    No company, transaction or business used in the Comparable Company Analysis or the Selected Precedent Transaction Analysis as a comparison is identical to divine, eshare or the eshare
merger. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the foregoing is not entirely mathematical; rather it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating
characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading and other values of the comparable companies or the business segment, company or transactions to which they are
compared.

    Other Factors.
  While this summary describes the analysis and factors that Robertson Stephens deemed material in its
presentation to the divine board, it is not a comprehensive description of all analysis and factors considered by Robertson Stephens. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process that
involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of these methods to the particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness
opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Robertson Stephens did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor
considered by it, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly, Robertson Stephens believes that its analyses must be considered
as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and of the factors considered by it, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the evaluation
process underlying its opinion. Several analytical methodologies were employed and no one method of analysis should be regarded as critical to the overall conclusion reached by Robertson Stephens.
Each analytical technique has inherent strengths and weaknesses, and
the nature of the available information may further affect the value of particular techniques. The conclusion reached by Robertson Stephens is based on all analyses and factors taken as a whole and
also on application of Robertson Stephens' own experience and judgment. This conclusion may involve significant elements of subjective judgment and qualitative analysis. Robertson Stephens gives no
opinion as to the value or merit standing alone of any one or more parts of the analysis it performed. In performing its analyses, Robertson Stephens made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business and other conditions and matters, many of which are beyond the control of divine, eshare or Robertson Stephens. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not
necessarily indicative of actual 

values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by these analyses. Accordingly, analyses relating to the value of businesses do
not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which these businesses actually may be sold in the future, and these estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty. 

    divine's
engagement letter with Robertson Stephens provides that, for its services, Robertson Stephens is entitled to receive $250,000 due in cash upon delivery of the opinion,
whether or not the opinion is favorable. divine has also agreed to reimburse Robertson Stephens for its out-of-pocket expenses and to indemnify and hold harmless Robertson
Stephens and its affiliates and any other person, director, employee or agent of Robertson Stephens or any of its affiliates, or any person controlling Robertson Stephens or its affiliates, for
certain losses, claims, damages, expenses and liabilities relating to or arising out of services provided by Robertson Stephens as financial advisor to divine. The terms of the fee arrangement with
Robertson Stephens, which divine and Robertson Stephens believe are customary in transactions of this nature, were negotiated at arm's length between divine and Robertson Stephens, and the divine
board was aware of these fee arrangements. Robertson Stephens was retained based on Robertson Stephens' experience as a financial advisor in connection with mergers and acquisitions and in securities
valuations generally, as well as Robertson Stephens' investment banking relationship and familiarity with divine. Robertson Stephens has provided and continues to provide financial advisory and
investment banking services to divine from time to time, including acting as lead managing underwriter for divine's initial public offering and currently as divine's financial advisor under a retainer
agreement. Robertson Stephens may actively trade the equity of divine for its own account and for the account of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in these
securities. 

    Robertson
Stephens is an internationally recognized investment banking firm. As part of its investment banking business, Robertson Stephens is frequently engaged in the valuation of
businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of securities, private placements and other purposes. 

Opinion of Financial Advisor to eshare's Board of Directors  

    Pursuant to a letter agreement dated as of May 24, 2001, eshare engaged Broadview International LLC to act as financial advisor to eshare's board of
directors. The eshare board of directors selected Broadview based on Broadview's reputation and experience in the information technology, communication and media sector and the call center software
industry in particular. Broadview focuses on providing merger and acquisition advisory services to information technology, communications and media companies. In this capacity, Broadview is
continually engaged in valuing these businesses and maintains an extensive database of information technology, communications and media mergers and acquisitions information for comparative purposes.
At the meeting of the eshare board of directors on July 8, 2001, Broadview rendered its opinion that, as of July 8, 2001, based upon and subject to the various factors and assumptions
described in the Broadview opinion, the consideration to be received in the eshare merger by holders of eshare common shares was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

    Broadview's opinion, which describes the assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by Broadview, is incorporated by reference and attached as
Annex E to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. eshare shareholders are urged to, and should, read the Broadview opinion carefully and in its entirety. The Broadview opinion is

directed to the eshare board of directors and addresses only the fairness of the consideration to be received by holders of eshare common shares in the eshare merger, from a
financial point of view, to such holders, as of the date of the opinion. The Broadview opinion does not address any other aspect of the eshare merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any
eshare shareholder as to how to vote at the eshare special meeting. The summary of the Broadview opinion set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, although materially complete, is qualified
in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion.

    In
connection with rendering its opinion, Broadview, among other things:


reviewed
the terms of the draft eshare merger agreement and stockholder agreement furnished to Broadview on July 7, 2001, as well as the terms of
the draft employment agreement furnished to Broadview on July 8, 2001;


reviewed
certain publicly available financial statements and other information on eshare and divine, respectively;


reviewed
certain internal financial and operating information, including certain projections for eshare prepared and provided to Broadview by eshare
management;


participated
in discussions with eshare and divine management concerning the operations, business strategy, financial performance and prospects for eshare
and divine, respectively;


discussed
the strategic rationale for the eshare merger with eshare and divine management, respectively;


reviewed
the recent reported closing prices and trading activity for eshare and divine common stock, respectively;


compared
aspects of the financial performance of eshare and divine with other comparable public companies;


analyzed
available information, both public and private, concerning other comparable mergers and acquisitions;


reviewed
recent equity research analyst reports covering eshare and divine;


analyzed
the anticipated effect of the eshare merger on the future financial performance of divine;


participated
in discussions related to the eshare merger with eshare, divine and their respective advisors; and


conducted
other financial studies, analyses and investigations as Broadview deemed appropriate for purposes of its opinion. 

    In rendering its opinion, Broadview relied, without independent verification, on the accuracy and completeness of all the financial and other information, including the
representations and warranties contained in the eshare merger agreement, that was publicly available or furnished to Broadview by eshare, divine or their respective advisors. With respect to the
financial projections examined by Broadview, Broadview assumed that they were prepared reasonably and reflected the best available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of eshare and
divine as to the future performance of eshare and divine, respectively. Broadview also assumed that eshare is not involved currently in any material

transaction as of the date of Broadview's opinion other than the eshare merger, other publicly announced transactions, any other transactions of which Broadview was aware and those activities
undertaken by eshare in the ordinary course of conducting its business.

    Broadview
did not make or obtain any independent appraisal or valuation of any of eshare's assets. Broadview's opinion necessarily is based upon market, economic, financial and other
conditions as they existed and could be evaluated as of July 8, 2001, and any change in such conditions since that date would require a reevaluation of Broadview's opinion. The Broadview
opinion did not express any opinion as to the price at which divine common stock will trade at any time. 

    The
following is a brief summary of some of the sources of information and valuation methodologies employed by Broadview in rendering its opinion. These analyses were presented to the
eshare board of directors at its meeting on July 8, 2001. This summary includes the financial analyses used by Broadview and deemed to be material, but does not purport to be a complete
description of analyses performed by Broadview in arriving at its opinion. Broadview did not assign explicitly any relative weights to the various factors of analyses considered. This summary of
financial analyses includes information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses used by Broadview, the tables must be read together with the text of each
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. 

 eshare Stock Performance Analysis  

    Broadview compared the recent stock performance of eshare with that of the Nasdaq Composite and the eshare Comparable Index. The eshare Comparable Index is
comprised of public companies that Broadview deemed comparable to eshare. Broadview selected companies competing in the call center and customer interaction management software industry with Trailing
Twelve Month ("TTM") revenue between $25 million and $100 million and Projected 12/31/01 revenue growth of less than 100%. The eshare Comparable Index consists of the following
companies: Interactive Intelligence, Inc.; Primus Knowledge Solutions, Inc.; eGain Communications, Inc.; Davox Corporation; and Apropos Technology, Inc. 

 Public Company Comparables Analysis  

    Broadview considered ratios of share price and market capitalization, adjusted for cash and debt when necessary, to selected historical operating results in
order to derive multiples placed on a company in a particular market segment. In order to perform this analysis, Broadview compared financial information of eshare with publicly available information
for the companies comprising the eshare Comparable Index. For this analysis, as well as other analyses, Broadview examined publicly available information.

company utilized in the public company comparables analysis as a comparison is identical to eshare. In evaluating the comparables, Broadview made numerous assumptions with respect
to call center and customer interaction management software industry performance and general economic conditions, many of which are beyond the control of eshare. Mathematical analysis, such as
determining the median, average or range, is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable company data. 

 Transaction Comparables Analysis  

    Broadview considered ratios of equity purchase price, adjusted for the seller's cash and debt when appropriate, to selected historical operating results in
order to indicate multiples strategic and financial acquirers have been willing to pay for companies in a particular market segment. In order to perform this analysis, Broadview reviewed a number of
transactions that it considered similar to the merger. Broadview selected these transactions by choosing recent transactions involving sellers in the automated customer support and call center
software industries with TTM revenue greater than $10 million. For this analysis, as well as other analyses, Broadview examined publicly available information, as well as information from
Broadview's proprietary database of published and confidential merger and acquisition transactions in the information technology, communication and media industries. These transactions consisted of
the acquisition of: 


Servicesoft, Inc.

respect to the telecommunications software industry's performance and general economic conditions, many of which are beyond the control of eshare or divine. Mathematical analysis, such as determining
the average, median or range, is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable transaction data. 

 Transaction Premiums Paid Analysis  

    Broadview considered the premiums paid above a seller's share price in order to determine the additional value that strategic and financial acquirers, when
compared to public stockholders, are willing to pay for companies in a particular market segment. In order to perform this analysis, Broadview reviewed a number of transactions involving
publicly-held software companies. Broadview selected these transactions from its proprietary database by choosing transactions since January 1, 1999 with an equity purchase price
between $25 million and $100 million. These transactions consisted of the acquisition of:

    No transaction utilized as a comparable in the transaction premiums paid analysis is identical to the eshare merger. In evaluating the comparables, Broadview made numerous assumptions
with respect to the telecommunications software industry's performance and general economic conditions, many of which are beyond the control of eshare or divine. Mathematical analysis, such as
determining the average, median or range is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable transaction data.

 Present Value of Projected Share Price Analysis  

    Broadview calculated the present value of potential future share prices of eshare common shares on a stand-alone basis using eshare management estimates for
the 12 months ending December 31, 2002. The implied share price calculated using the median total market 

capitalization to last 12 months revenue multiple for the eshare Comparable Index and a discount rate determined by the Capital Asset Pricing Model with the risk implied by the past stock
performance of the eshare Comparable Index was $2.84. The implied share price calculated using the total market capitalization to last 12 months revenue multiple for eshare and a discount rate
determined by the Capital Asset Pricing Model with the risk implied by the past stock performance of eshare was $0.98. Broadview also examined the effects of potential variations in the
December 31, 2002 revenue estimate. 

 Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis  

    Broadview compared the ratios of the closing prices of eshare common shares divided by the corresponding prices of divine common stock over the period from
July 12, 2000 through July 6, 2001, referred to as the historical exchange ratio, with the exchange ratio contained in the merger agreement. The historical exchange ratio has ranged from
0.347 to 2.061, with an average of 0.770. 

 Relative Contribution Analysis  

    Broadview examined the relative contribution of eshare to divine for a number of historical and projected operating metrics. In this analysis, projected
figures for eshare and divine are based on management estimates.

    At the eshare merger consideration, the implied equity ownership is 25.0% for eshare and 75.0% for divine, while the implied entity ownership (equal to equity value plus total debt
minus cash and cash equivalents) is 100.0% for eshare and 0.0% for divine.

 divine Stock Performance Analysis  

    Broadview compared the recent stock performance of divine with that of the Nasdaq Composite and the divine Comparable Index. The divine Comparable Index is
comprised of public companies that Broadview deemed comparable to divine. Broadview selected companies competing in the technology-focused Internet services industry with Projected 12/31/01 revenue
between $100 million and $500 million. The divine Comparable Index consists of the following companies: Sapient Corporation; Digitas, Inc.; Answerthink, Inc.; iXL
Enterprises, Inc.; and eLoyalty Corporation. 

 Evaluation of divine Equity  

    Broadview compared financial information of divine with publicly available information for companies comprising the divine Comparable Index. For this analysis,
as well as other 

analyses, Broadview examined publicly available information, as well as a range of estimates based on securities research analyst reports. 

 Pro Forma Combination Analysis  

    Broadview calculated the pro forma impact of the eshare merger on the combined entity's projected earnings per share for the fiscal quarter ending
December 31, 2001 and the fiscal year ending December 31, 2002 taking into consideration various financial effects which will result from a consummation of the eshare merger. This
analysis relies upon certain financial and operating assumptions obtained from both management and publicly available sources about eshare and divine. Broadview assumed that the eshare merger would be
treated as a purchase transaction for accounting purposes and that no opportunities for cost savings or revenue enhancements exist. Based on this analysis, the pro forma purchase model indicates
earnings-per-share accretion of $0.04, excluding acquisition expenses, for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2001 and earnings-per-share
accretion of $0.02 for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2002. Broadview also examined the effects of potential cost savings and revenue enhancements, and the incremental accretion/dilution
related to those potential synergies.

 Consideration of the Discounted Cash Flow Methodology  

    While discounted cash flow is a commonly used valuation methodology, Broadview did not employ such an analysis for the purposes of this opinion. Discounted
cash flow analysis is most appropriate for companies which exhibit relatively steady or somewhat predictable streams of future cash flow. Given the uncertainty in estimating both the future cash flows
and a sustainable long-term growth rate for eshare, Broadview considered a discounted cash flow analysis inappropriate for valuing eshare. 

    The
preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Broadview
considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it. Furthermore, Broadview believes that selecting any
portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion. 

    In performing its analyses, Broadview made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance and general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are
beyond the control of eshare or divine. The analyses performed by Broadview are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable
than suggested by such analyses. The consideration to be received by holders of eshare common stock pursuant to the eshare merger agreement and other terms of the eshare merger agreement were
determined through arm's length negotiations between eshare and divine, and were approved by the eshare board of directors. Broadview participated in discussions with the eshare board of directors
during those negotiations. However, Broadview did not recommend any specific consideration to the eshare board of directors or that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate
consideration for the eshare merger. In addition, Broadview's opinion and presentation to the eshare board of directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by the eshare board of
directors in making its decision to approve the eshare merger. Consequently, the

Broadview analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the eshare board of directors with respect to the value of eshare or of whether the eshare board of
directors would have been willing to agree to a different consideration. 

    Upon consummation of the eshare merger, eshare will be obligated to pay Broadview a transaction fee of approximately $911,000. eshare has already paid Broadview a fairness opinion fee
of $250,000. The fairness opinion fee will be credited against the transaction fee payable by eshare upon completion of the eshare merger. In addition, eshare has agreed to reimburse Broadview for its
reasonable expenses, including fees and expenses of its counsel, and to indemnify Broadview and its affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses related to their engagement, including
liabilities under the federal securities laws. The terms of the fee arrangement with Broadview, which eshare and Broadview believe are customary in transactions of this nature, were negotiated at
arm's length between eshare and Broadview, and the eshare board of directors was aware of the nature of the fee arrangement, including the fact that a significant portion of the fees payable to
Broadview is contingent upon completion of the eshare merger.

eshare Merger Consideration

    If we complete the eshare merger, eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare common share they own. This number
will be determined based on the average closing price of divine common stock on the Nasdaq National Market for the ten trading days ending two trading days prior to the closing date of the eshare
merger. We refer to the result of this calculation as the divine average closing price.

    If
the divine average closing price is greater than $2.39 but less than $2.82, then eshare shareholders will receive 1.30 shares of divine common stock for each eshare common share
they own. If the divine average closing price is $2.82 or greater, then eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare common share they own equal to $3.653
divided by the divine average closing price. If the divine average closing price is $2.39 or less, then eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare
common share they own equal to $3.12 divided by the greater of the divine average closing price or $1.00. As an example only, if the divine average closing price is $5.00, then eshare shareholders
will receive 0.7306 shares of divine common stock for each eshare common share they own. If the divine average closing price is $1.00, they would receive 3.12 shares of divine common stock for each
eshare common share they own. 

We urge you to obtain current market quotations for divine common stock and eshare common shares before making any decision on the eshare
merger.

    If the number of shares of divine common stock to be issued in the eshare merger exceeds 28,546,506, then divine may elect to pay cash instead of all or any portion of the divine
common stock otherwise issuable to eshare shareholders in excess of 28,546,506 shares. However, because divine and eshare intend for the eshare merger to be a tax-free reorganization, divine will not
pay cash in excess of 50% of the total consideration paid to all eshare shareholders. The per share amount of these cash payments will be equal to the divine average closing price. divine will not
issue fractional shares. eshare shareholders who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share will instead receive cash based on the market value of the fractional share of divine common
stock.

Procedures for Exchange of eshare Stock Certificates for the Merger Consideration  

    When the eshare merger is completed, divine will deposit with the exchange agent certificates representing the shares of divine common stock and an estimated
amount of cash to be paid to eshare shareholders in the eshare merger. In addition, as soon as practicable after we complete the eshare merger, the exchange agent will mail to eshare shareholders a
letter of transmittal and instructions for use in surrendering eshare stock certificates in exchange for the divine common stock and cash, if any, to which they are entitled as merger consideration.
When eshare shareholders deliver their stock certificates to the exchange agent along with a properly executed letter of transmittal and any other required documents, their stock certificates will be
cancelled and they will receive divine common stock certificates representing the number of full shares of divine common stock to which they are entitled under the eshare merger agreement and a
payment in cash, without interest, equal to the amount, if any, of cash to which they are entitled as merger consideration. eshare shareholders also will receive payment in cash, without interest,
instead of any fractional share of divine common stock which would have been otherwise issuable to them as a result of the eshare merger. The exchange agent will return to divine any shares of divine
common stock and any cash that remain undistributed to eshare shareholders 12 months after completion of the eshare merger. Any former eshare shareholder who has not at that time surrendered
its eshare common shares to the exchange agent may look only to divine for payment of the merger consideration without any interest.

eshare shareholders should not submit their eshare stock certificates for exchange until they receive the transmittal instructions and a form of letter of
transmittal from the exchange agent.

    eshare shareholders are not entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions on divine common stock until the eshare merger is completed and they have surrendered their eshare
stock certificates in exchange for divine stock certificates.

    divine
will only issue a divine stock certificate or a check for cash received as part of the merger consideration or instead of a fractional share in a name other than the name in
which a surrendered eshare stock certificate is registered if a shareholder of eshare presents the exchange agent with all documents required to show and effect the unrecorded transfer of ownership
and show that the shareholder paid any applicable stock transfer taxes. 

Dissenters' Rights  

    eshare shareholders are entitled to dissenters' rights under the Georgia Business Corporation Code (attached as Annex F to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus) if divine elects to pay a portion of the eshare merger consideration to eshare shareholders in cash, other than for fractional shares, as described under "eshare Merger
Consideration" beginning on page 87. divine may make this election at any time before or after the eshare special meeting. If divine does not pay any of the merger consideration in cash, other
than for fractional shares, then eshare shareholders will not be entitled to dissenters' rights under Georgia law.

Treatment of eshare Stock Options  

    When the eshare merger is completed, each outstanding eshare stock option with an exercise price less than or equal to the closing price of divine common stock
on the Nasdaq

National Market on the date immediately prior to the closing date of the eshare merger multiplied by the eshare exchange ratio will convert into a fully exercisable option to purchase a number of
shares of divine common stock equal to the number of eshare common shares underlying the stock option multiplied by the eshare exchange ratio. As of August 28, 2001, divine would grant options
to purchase approximately 4,300,000 shares of divine common stock upon conversion of these eshare options. The exercise price for the stock options to be granted by divine will be equal to the
current exercise price of the corresponding eshare options divided by the eshare exchange ratio. Each outstanding eshare stock option with an exercise price above the result of the divine closing
price on the date immediately prior to the closing date of the eshare merger multiplied by the eshare exchange ratio will be cancelled.

    Under the terms of the eshare merger agreement, divine will grant to eshare employees options to purchase shares of divine common stock representing, in the aggregate, 13% of the
total number of shares of divine common stock issued to eshare shareholders in the eshare merger. These options will have an exercise price equal to the closing sale price of divine common stock on
the trading day immediately prior to the grant date of the options. These options will vest in three equal installments, with the first installment vesting on the grant date and the second and third
installments vesting on the second and third annual anniversaries of the grant date. Otherwise, these options will be subject to the terms and conditions commonly provided by divine for option grants
under its stock incentive plan.

Voting Agreement  

    divine has entered into a voting agreement with Szlam Partners, L.P., an entity beneficially owned by Aleksander Szlam, under which divine has been
granted the right to vote 10,745,969 eshare common shares owned by Szlam Partners in favor of the approval and adoption of the eshare merger agreement and the eshare merger. As of the record date, the
shares subject to this agreement represented approximately 49% of the outstanding eshare common shares entitled to vote at the eshare special meeting.

Interests of Certain Persons in the eshare Merger

    In considering the recommendations of the eshare board and the divine board that eshare shareholders approve and adopt the eshare merger agreement and the
eshare merger, and that divine stockholders approve the issuance of divine common stock in the eshare merger, eshare shareholders and divine stockholders should be aware that certain members of the
eshare and divine boards of directors and eshare's management have interests in the eshare merger that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of eshare shareholders and divine
stockholders. The boards of divine and eshare were aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving and/or adopting the eshare merger agreement and the eshare merger.

    The Stockholder Agreement.
  divine and Szlam Partners, along with Aleksander Szlam, entered into a stockholder
agreement, dated as of July 8, 2001, under which, among other things, (1) divine granted Szlam Partners the right to sell to divine a certain number of shares of divine common stock at a
purchase price per share equal to the divine average closing price, (2) Szlam Partners granted divine the right to purchase from Szlam Partners a certain number of shares of divine common stock
at a purchase price per share equal to the divine average closing price, and (3) Szlam Partners agreed to restrictions on its right to transfer shares of divine common stock, other than as
described above, for a period of twelve months, in each case following consummation of the eshare merger.

    The Employment Agreement.
  Pursuant to the stockholder agreement, divine and Mr. Szlam agreed to enter into an
employment agreement simultaneously with the closing of the eshare merger. The terms of the employment agreement provide that Mr. Szlam will be employed by divine for an initial
three-year term as chief strategy officer and presidentCIM businesses and will receive a salary of $400,000 per year and a bonus of up to $600,000 per year. divine has also
agreed to appoint Mr. Szlam to its board of directors and nominate him to continue as a director in 2002. Mr. Szlam's employment agreement contains customary confidentiality and
non-solicitation provisions and prohibits Mr. Szlam from competing against the combined entity during the term of the agreement and for a period of three years after the termination of the
agreement.

    If divine terminates the employment agreement without cause, it must continue to pay Mr. Szlam his salary and bonus for the entire term of the agreement. Moreover, under the
agreement, divine will agree to maintain an insurance policy for the benefit of Mr. Szlam which, in the event of Mr. Szlam's death or disability, will pay his estate or legal
representative an amount equal to the balance, if any, that would be payable to Mr. Szlam under the remaining term of the employment agreement.

    The Real Estate Option Agreement.
  Szlam Partners and Melita House, Inc., a corporation owned by
Mr. Szlam, own the properties on which eshare's U.S. and United Kingdom headquarters, respectively, are located. Pursuant to the stockholder agreement, divine agreed to enter into a real estate
option agreement with Szlam Partners and Melita House upon the closing of the eshare merger under which divine will pay Szlam Partners $3,702,978 for a ten-year option to purchase eshare's
property in the U.S. for $14,560,000, and pay Melita House $2,047,022 for a ten-year option to purchase eshare's property in the U.K. for 5,714,668. Under the real estate option
agreement, Szlam Partners and Melita House will agree not to raise the rental amounts due under, or otherwise adversely modify, the leases for these properties so long as the surviving company is not
in default under the leases.

    divine Interested Director Ownership.
  Andrew J. Filipowski, the chairman and chief executive officer of divine, is also
a director of eshare. As of the record date, Mr. Filipowski beneficially owned 413,333 eshare common shares, representing approximately 2.0% of the total eshare common shares outstanding
as of the record date.

    Indemnification; Insurance.
  The eshare merger agreement provides that, for a period of six years from the closing of
the eshare merger, the surviving corporation will provide rights to indemnification benefiting eshare's directors and officers that are at least as favorable as those in effect under eshare's articles
of incorporation and bylaws as of the date of the eshare merger agreement. The surviving corporation will also provide directors' and officers' liability insurance covering those persons who were
covered by eshare's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy as of the date of the eshare merger agreement. However, the surviving corporation will not be required to expend more than 150%
of the annual premium paid by eshare for that coverage as of the date of the eshare merger agreement.

    Stock Option Acceleration.
  Vesting of options to purchase eshare common shares under eshare's stock option plans will
accelerate upon the completion of the eshare merger. Based on the divine average closing price on August 28, 2001, divine would grant options to purchase divine common stock with respect to
options to purchase 738,750 eshare common shares held by eshare directors and executive officers.

United States Federal Income Tax Consequences  

    The following are the material United States federal income tax consequences of the merger. This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, applicable Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations and court decisions as in effect as of the date of this prospectus, all of which may change, possibly with retroactive effect. 

    This
discussion only addresses United States federal income tax consequences of those shareholders who hold their eshare common shares as capital assets. It does not address all
aspects of federal income taxation that may be important to an eshare shareholder in light of that shareholder's particular circumstances or to an eshare shareholder who is subject to special rules,
such as: 


a
shareholder who is not a citizen or resident of the United States,


a
financial institution or insurance company,


a
tax-exempt organization,


a
dealer or broker in securities,


a
shareholder who holds his, her or its eshare common shares as part of a hedge, appreciated financial position, straddle or conversion transaction, or


a
shareholder who acquired his, her or its eshare common shares by exercising options or otherwise as compensation. 

    This discussion of material federal income tax consequences is not a complete analysis or description of all potential federal income tax consequences of the eshare merger. This
discussion does not address tax consequences that may vary with, or are contingent on, individual circumstances. In addition, it does not address any non-income tax or any foreign, state
or local tax consequences of the eshare merger.

We strongly urge each eshare shareholder to consult his, her or its own tax advisor to determine the particular United States federal, state or local or
foreign income or other tax consequences of the eshare merger to him, her or it.

    Tax Opinions.
  The obligations of divine and eshare to consummate the eshare merger are conditioned upon the receipt of
legal opinions from their respective counsel that the eshare merger will qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and that these opinions of counsel shall
not have been withdrawn prior to closing. However, the eshare merger agreement provides that if counsel to either party does not render a tax opinion, this condition will nonetheless be deemed
satisfied with respect to that party if counsel to the other party delivers a tax opinion to that party. These opinions of counsel will rely on customary factual assumptions and customary
representations made by divine and eshare. In addition, the opinions also will rely upon divine's representation to Katten Muchin Zavis and Morris, Manning & Martin, LLP, that, notwithstanding any
contrary right divine may have under the eshare merger agreement, divine will not pay to eshare shareholders an amount of cash or other consideration in connection with the eshare merger that would
exceed Internal Revenue Service ruling guidelines concerning the amount of cash that may be issued in a merger without disqualifying it as a reorganization under Section 368 of the Internal
Revenue Code. If any of the factual assumptions or representations relied upon by counsel are inaccurate, the opinions may not accurately describe the federal income tax treatment of the eshare
merger, and this discussion may not accurately describe the tax

consequences of the eshare merger. The opinions of counsel are not binding upon the Internal Revenue Service or the courts, and it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service or the courts will
disagree with counsels' opinions. Further, neither divine nor eshare intends to obtain an IRS ruling on the tax consequences of the eshare merger.

    Federal Income Tax Treatment of the eshare Merger.
  The eshare merger is intended to qualify as a "reorganization" under
Section 368(a)(1)(A) and Section 368(a)(2)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code. In such a reorganization, the Internal Revenue Service takes the position for ruling purposes that at least
fifty percent of the fair market value of the aggregate consideration received by the former stockholders of the acquired corporation pursuant to the exchange of their shares of acquired corporation
stock must be in the form of stock of the parent of the acquiring corporation, although the courts have allowed lower percentages of stock under certain circumstances. The fair market value of the
consideration received by the former stockholders of the acquired corporation is determined as of the effective time of the reorganization. In this regard, it is important to note that there is no
requirement that at least fifty percent of the fair market value of the consideration received by each former stockholder of the acquired corporation be in the form of stock of the parent of the
acquiring corporation, but only that in the aggregate, at least fifty percent of the fair market value of the total consideration received by all stockholders of the acquired corporation be in the
form of stock of the parent of the acquiring corporation.

    Pursuant to subsection 4.1(e) of the eshare merger agreement, divine has the option to pay some of the eshare merger consideration in cash to eshare shareholders if, based upon
the value of divine common stock at the time of the closing, divine would otherwise be required to issue more than 28,546,506 shares of its common stock to the eshare shareholders in the eshare
merger. In this case, the eshare merger might not meet Internal Revenue Service ruling guidelines for the transaction to qualify as a reorganization for federal income tax purposes. Nevertheless, as
noted above, divine has represented to Katten Muchin Zavis and Morris, Manning & Martin, LLP that, notwithstanding any contrary right divine may have under the eshare merger agreement, divine will not
pay to eshare shareholders an amount of cash in connection with the eshare merger that would exceed Internal Revenue Service ruling guidelines concerning the amount of cash that may be issued in the
eshare merger without disqualifying it as a reorganization under Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, the discussion immediately below in "Federal Income Tax
Consequences to eshare Shareholders" assumes that the eshare merger will qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code by virtue of
Section 368(a)(2)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code.

    Federal Income Tax Consequences to eshare Shareholders.
  Provided that the eshare merger qualifies as a reorganization,
then for federal income tax purposes, subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications referred to herein:


An
eshare shareholder who exchanges all of his or her eshare common shares solely for shares of divine common stock pursuant to the eshare merger will not
recognize any gain or loss upon such exchange.


An
eshare shareholder receiving both divine common stock and cash in exchange for eshare common shares may recognize gain, but only to the extent of the
amount of cash received. The gain, if any, will be measured by the sum of the fair market value of the divine common stock received plus the amount of cash received, minus the tax 

basis
of the eshare common shares exchanged in the eshare merger. This gain should generally be capital gain, subject to the potential recharacterization as a dividend as discussed below, and should
generally be long-term capital gain if the eshare common shares exchanged in the eshare merger have been held for more than one year. Shareholders of eshare will not recognize any tax loss
upon the receipt of divine common stock and cash.


An
eshare shareholder will have a tax basis in the divine common stock received in the eshare merger (including any fractional share of divine common stock
deemed to be received and then redeemed for cash, as described below) equal to (1) the aggregate tax basis of the eshare common shares surrendered by that holder in the eshare merger, less
(2) any cash received as payment of a portion of the merger consideration or instead of a fractional share of divine common stock, plus (3) any gain recognized in the eshare merger.


A
cash payment received by an eshare shareholder in lieu of a fractional share of divine common stock will be treated as if that fractional share had been
issued in the eshare merger and then redeemed by divine. An eshare shareholder receiving that cash will generally recognize capital gain or loss upon this payment, equal to the difference, if any,
between that eshare shareholder's tax basis in the fractional share and the amount of cash received.


The
holding period for shares of divine common stock received in exchange for eshare common shares in the eshare merger will include the holding period for
the eshare common shares surrendered in the eshare merger.

    In certain circumstances, an eshare shareholder who exchanges eshare common shares for divine common stock and cash in the eshare merger will be required to treat any gain recognized
as dividend income rather than capital gain. In general, whether a shareholder must recognize capital gain or dividend income is determined under Sections 356(a)(2) and 302 of the Code. Under
Section 356(a)(2), each eshare shareholder will be treated for tax purposes as if such shareholder had received only divine common stock in the eshare merger, and immediately thereafter divine
redeemed part of that stock in exchange for the cash actually distributed to the shareholder in the eshare merger. Under Section 302 of the Code, the gain recognized by an eshare shareholder on
the exchange will be taxed as capital gain if the deemed redemption from the shareholder (1) is a "substantially disproportionate redemption" of stock with respect to the shareholder, or
(2) is "not essentially equivalent to a dividend" with respect to that shareholder. In making this determination, an eshare shareholder may be considered under Section 318 of the Code to
own divine common stock owned, and in some cases constructively owned, by certain individuals and entities related to that shareholder, as well as divine common stock that the shareholder, or that
related individuals or entities, has the right to acquire upon the exercise or conversion of options.

    The deemed redemption of an eshare shareholder's divine common stock will be a "substantially disproportionate redemption" if, as a result of the deemed redemption, the ratio
determined by dividing the number of shares of divine common stock owned by that shareholder immediately after the eshare merger by the total number of outstanding shares of divine common stock is
less than 80% of the same ratio calculated as if only divine common stock, including divine common stock with a value equal to the cash portion of the eshare merger consideration, were issued to the
eshare shareholders in the eshare merger.

    The deemed redemption of an eshare shareholder's divine common stock will be "not essentially equivalent to a dividend" if the shareholder experiences a "meaningful reduction" in his
or her proportionate equity interest in divine by reason of the deemed redemption. Although there are no fixed rules for determining when a meaningful reduction has occurred, the Internal Revenue
Service has indicated in a published ruling that the receipt of cash in a merger would not be characterized as a dividend if the shareholder's percentage ownership interest in the target and the
acquiror prior to the merger was minimal, the shareholder exercises no control over the affairs of the target or the acquiror, and the shareholder's percentage ownership interest in the acquiror is
reduced in the deemed redemption by any extent. 

    If
neither of the redemption tests set forth above is satisfied, an eshare shareholder will be treated as having received a dividend equal to the amount of such shareholder's
recognized
gain, assuming that such shareholder's ratable share of the earnings and profits of eshare, and possibly of divine, equals or exceeds the recognized gain. 

    Dissenting Shareholders.
  An eshare shareholder who dissents from the eshare merger may recognize gain or loss on the
eshare merger. Gain or loss will be recognized by that dissenting shareholder equal to the difference between the cash received (other than amounts, if any, which are or are deemed to be interest for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, which amounts will be taxed as ordinary income) and the tax basis in that shareholder's eshare common shares. This gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss
and generally will be long-term capital gain or loss with respect to eshare common shares held for more than one year at the effective time of the eshare merger. Dissenting shareholders may be
required to recognize any gain or loss in the year the eshare merger closes, irrespective of whether that shareholder actually receives payment for their shares in that year.

    Backup Withholding.
  Certain noncorporate eshare shareholders may be subject to backup withholding at a rate of 30.5% on
cash payments received in the eshare merger. Backup withholding will not apply, however, to a shareholder who furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that he or she is not
subject to backup withholding on the substitute Form W-9 included in the letter of transmittal, who provides a certificate of foreign status on an appropriate
Form W-8, or who is otherwise exempt from backup withholding. A shareholder who fails to provide the correct taxpayer identification number on Form W-9 may be
subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue Service.

    Tax Consequences if the eshare Merger is Not a Reorganization.
  The federal income tax consequences of the eshare merger
to eshare shareholders will be different than the consequences described above if the Internal Revenue Service successfully challenges the status of the eshare merger as a reorganization. That is, if
the cash received by all of the eshare shareholders pursuant to the eshare merger agreement would be more than fifty percent of the fair market value of the aggregate consideration received by all of
the eshare shareholders pursuant to the eshare merger agreement, the Internal Revenue Service could take the position that the eshare merger fails to qualify as a reorganization. Likewise, in such
circumstances, each of Katten Muchin Zavis and Morris, Manning & Martin, LLP, counsel to divine and eshare, respectively, could withdraw its legal opinion that the eshare merger will constitute a
reorganization for federal income tax purposes. Such a legal opinion is a condition to the consummation of the eshare merger and, if such condition is not met, the eshare merger will not be
consummated unless such condition is waived by divine and eshare.

    If the eshare merger fails to qualify as a reorganization, an eshare shareholder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the aggregate fair
market value of the consideration that the eshare shareholder receives in the eshare merger (divine common stock and cash) and the tax basis in that shareholder's eshare common shares surrendered. If
an eshare shareholder holds eshare common shares as a capital asset, any gain or loss recognized will be capital gain or loss. If, at the effective time of the eshare merger, an eshare shareholder has
held eshare common shares for more than one year, any capital gain that such eshare shareholder recognizes will be long-term capital gain, which is subject to a maximum federal income tax rate of 20%
in the case of taxpayers other than corporations. Any capital losses recognized by a taxpayer other than a corporation that are not offset by capital gains may be deducted only up to a maximum of
$3,000 per year, although unused capital losses may be carried forward to future taxable years. In the case of a corporation, capital gains are subject to federal income tax at the same rate as
ordinary income. A corporation's capital losses may be deducted only to the extent of its capital gains, but unused capital losses may be carried back three years and forward five years.

    Federal Income Tax Consequences to divine Stockholders.
  For federal income tax purposes, holders of divine common stock
will not recognize gain or loss on their divine common stock as a result of the eshare merger.

The preceding discussion is intended only as a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences of the eshare merger and does not purport to be
a complete analysis or discussion of all potential tax effects relevant thereto. Thus, eshare shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences to them of
the eshare merger, including tax return reporting requirements, the applicability and effect of foreign, federal, state, local and other applicable tax laws and the effect of any proposed changes in
tax laws.

 Accounting Treatment  

    divine will record the eshare merger using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This means that
for financial reporting purposes, divine will treat both companies as one company beginning as of the date we complete the eshare merger. In addition, under this method of accounting, divine will
record the fair value of eshare's net assets on its consolidated financial statements, with the remaining purchase price in excess of the fair value of eshare's net assets recorded as goodwill. See
"Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements" beginning on page 142

Regulatory Matters  

    We have summarized below the material regulatory requirements affecting the eshare merger. We anticipate that we will receive regulatory approvals sufficient
to complete the eshare merger shortly after the divine and eshare special meetings.

    Antitrust Considerations.
  The eshare merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, which prevents specified transactions from being completed until required information and materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and specified waiting periods are terminated or expire. The Federal Trade Commission has granted early

termination of the required waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, for the eshare merger.

    The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission nonetheless may challenge the eshare merger on antitrust grounds after termination of the waiting
period. Accordingly, at any time before or after the completion of the eshare merger, either the Antitrust Division or the Federal Trade Commission could take action under the antitrust laws as it
deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, or other persons could take action under the antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the eshare merger. Additionally, at any time before or
after the completion of the eshare merger, notwithstanding that the applicable waiting period expired or was terminated, any state could take action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or
desirable in the public interest. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the eshare merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.

    Federal Securities Laws.
  The shares of divine common stock to be issued in connection with the eshare merger will be
registered under the Securities Act and will be freely transferable under the Securities Act, except for shares of divine common stock issued to any person who is deemed to be an "affiliate" of eshare
on the date of the eshare special meeting. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under the common control of eshare and may
include executive officers, directors and significant shareholders of eshare. Affiliates of eshare may not sell their shares of divine common stock acquired in connection with the eshare merger except
pursuant to:


an
effective registration statement covering the resale of those shares under the Securities Act;


Rule 145
under the Securities Act (or Rule 144 of the Securities Act if these persons become affiliates of divine); or


any
other applicable exemption under the Securities Act. 

    The eshare merger agreement provides that eshare will use its reasonable efforts to obtain from each of its affiliates (for purposes of Rule 145 of the Securities Act) a
written agreement providing that the affiliate will not sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of any divine common stock issued to the affiliate pursuant to the eshare merger, except in
compliance with Rule 145 or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

    divine's registration statement on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part, does not cover the resale of shares of divine common stock to
be received by eshare affiliates in the eshare merger.

    Nasdaq National Market.
  divine will use its reasonable commercial efforts to cause the shares of divine common stock to
be issued in connection with the eshare merger to be approved for quotation on the Nasdaq National Market, subject to official notice of issuance, before the completion of the eshare merger. When the
eshare merger is completed, eshare common shares will be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

  THE OPEN MARKET MERGER

    This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes material aspects of the proposed Open Market merger, including the Open Market merger agreement
and the stockholder agreements. While we believe that the description covers the material terms of

the Open Market merger, this summary may not contain all of the information that is important to you. You should read carefully this entire joint proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents to
which we refer for a more complete understanding of the Open Market merger. Complete copies of the Open Market merger agreement and the stockholder agreements are attached as Annexes G and H,
respectively, to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Structure of the Open Market Merger

    If the Open Market stockholders approve and adopt the Open Market merger agreement and the Open Market merger and the divine stockholders approve the issuance
of divine common stock in the Open Market merger, and all other conditions to the Open Market merger agreement are satisfied, DI1 Acquisition Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine, will merge
into Open Market. As a result, DI1 will cease its separate corporate existence and become a part of Open Market, the surviving corporation, which will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine. We
currently anticipate that we will complete the Open Market merger on or about             , 2001 and, in any event, unless the parties agree otherwise, on the day of obtaining
stockholder approval at the special meetings and satisfaction or waiver of all other conditions of the Open Market merger agreement.

Background of the Open Market Merger

    Over the past several months, Open Market's board of directors and management have pursued a number of potential strategic alternatives in an attempt to
maximize Open Market stockholder value while confronting the impact of changes to the market for content management and delivery solutions.

    Open Market has experienced operating losses in each quarterly and annual period since its inception. Open Market incurred net losses of $37.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 1998, $19.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, $37.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 and $14.7 million for the
six-months ended June 30, 2001. In addition, since mid-2000, Open Market has been transitioning from its heritage Transact/ShopSite business and concentrating on the market for
content management and delivery solutions. Furthermore, the external economic climate in Open Market's principal geographic markets evidenced an increasing deterioration in the fourth quarter of 2000,
which served to decrease information technology spending. This decrease adversely impacted Open Market, especially with respect to its content management business. All of these factors contributed to
Open Market's overall sequential declines in quarterly revenues during each quarter of 2000 and for the first two quarters of 2001. The resulting operating losses, coupled with a significant

downturn in the public capital markets, significantly reduced Open Market's liquidity and capital resources.

    Faced with continued operating losses and a deteriorating cash position, Open Market began to consider various strategic alternatives, including corporate partnering initiatives,
dispositions of assets and business lines, including the sales of Open Market patents, and,

ultimately, the sale of the company. At its February 16, 2001 meeting, the Open Market board of directors decided to request that Goldman, Sachs & Co., Open Market's financial advisor,
assist Open Market in identifying possible strategic alternatives. Goldman Sachs' previous service as Open Market's underwriter and advisor and its knowledge of Open Market, its technology, products,
and markets, as well as its reputation, background and experience in the industry were important factors in the board's decision.

    Beginning on April 10, 2001, management of Open Market began meeting with representatives of Goldman Sachs to review information about Open Market's business and financial
condition, as well as a list of parties with whom Open Market might seek a business combination or other strategic relationship. On April 27, 2001 and May 3, 2001, management of Open
Market continued these discussions with representatives of Goldman Sachs.

    From April 2001 through July 2001, management and representatives of Goldman Sachs contacted approximately 15 companies regarding a potential strategic combination with Open
Market and had preliminary discussions with four of these companies.

    At the same time, Open Market continued to seek financing from a variety of sources to offset its operating losses, which continued in the first quarter of 2001. In
February 2001, Open Market entered into a $12,000,000 line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank. To date, however, Open Market has not drawn upon this line of credit and, prior to the signing of
the Open Market merger agreement, was unable to do so as a result of its noncompliance in July 2001 with the financial covenants contained in the line of credit agreement. In March 2001,
Open Market issued 5,000 shares of its Series E preferred stock to Halifax Fund, L.P., a fund managed by The Palladin Group, for gross proceeds of approximately $5,000,000. Also in
March 2001, Open Market sold its Folio technology to NextPage, Inc. for $6,667,000. In addition, in May 2001, Open Market entered into an agreement with Theddingworth
International Limited to provide it with up to $40 million in private equity funding. However, Open Market's ability to access these funds was subject to certain conditions, including filing a
registration statement with the SEC relating to the registration of shares to be sold to

Theddingworth and having the registration statement declared effective by the SEC, neither of which condition had been met. Notwithstanding these efforts, Open Market continued to experience
significant liquidity constraints.

    At a May 17, 2001 meeting of Open Market's board of directors, management and representatives from Goldman Sachs discussed with the board various strategic alternatives,
including possible business combinations. The board of directors instructed management and Goldman Sachs to pursue aggressively any viable partnering opportunities while instructing management to
explore simultaneously other cash generating and cash saving alternatives.

    On May 21, 2001, at the request of divine, Harland K. LaVigne, Open Market's chairman, president and chief executive officer, and Edward Durkin, Open Market's vice president
and chief financial officer, met with Ronald Bienvenu, the president of divine's enterprise portal software group, to discuss the respective businesses of Open Market and divine and the potential
synergies between the two companies. Mr. Bienvenu expressed divine's interest in continuing discussions with Open Market.

    On May 29, 2001, management of Open Market and representatives of Goldman Sachs met with management of the other entity that Open Market and Goldman Sachs had

discussed approaching in April regarding a possible business combination. Representatives from this party's financial advisor were also present.

    On May 31, 2001, Andrew Filipowski, divine's chairman and chief executive officer, Matthew Roszak, a partner in divine's corporate business development office, and
Mr. Bienvenu met with Mr. LaVigne, Mr. Durkin, B.C. Krishna, Open Market's chief technology officer, Joseph Alwan, Open Market's vice president of sales and marketing, and
Jonathan C. Wilk, Open Market's vice president and general counsel, at Open Market's offices in Burlington, Massachusetts. At this meeting, Mr. Filipowski led a discussion of divine's strategic
plans.

    On June 7 and June 8, representatives of divine conducted due diligence on Open Market at Open Market's headquarters.

    On June 11, 2001, the board of directors of Open Market met by telephone conference call with representatives of Goldman Sachs and management. During the call, management
discussed Open Market's forecasts for the second quarter of 2001 and cash projections. Management also updated the board on the status of discussions with divine and the other possible merger partner
referred to above. Also on June 11, Messrs. Durkin and Wilk, together with representatives from Goldman Sachs, met by telephone conference with Mr. Roszak and Alex Walker,
divine's Senior Vice President of Corporate Business Development, to discuss additional due diligence matters and some of the proposed terms of a possible transaction.

    On June 20, management of Open Market and representatives of Goldman Sachs held further discussions with the other entity with which it was then in negotiations about a
possible transaction.

    On June 21, 2001, Messrs. LaVigne and Durkin met with Messrs. Bienvenu and Roszak in Burlington, Massachusetts. The parties discussed the current status of their
respective due diligence efforts and their thoughts with respect to a possible transaction.

    On June 22, 2001, management of Open Market met by telephone conference with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Hale and Dorr LLP, counsel to Open Market, to discuss the
status of Open Market's conversations with divine and a proposed term sheet submitted to Open Market by the other possible merger partner.

    On June 29, 2001, the board of directors of Open Market met by telephone conference call with representatives of Goldman Sachs and management. During the call, management
discussed Open Market's updated forecasts for the second quarter of 2001 and cash projections. Management also updated the board on the status of discussions with the other party with which it was
then in negotiations, as well as the status of discussions with divine.

    From July 5, 2001 through July 15, 2001, various representatives of divine conducted due diligence on Open Market at Open Market's headquarters, focusing on Open
Market's financial results for the second quarter of 2001 and other general corporate matters.

    On July 10, 2001, divine delivered to Open Market a proposed letter of intent and term sheet outlining the terms of a possible transaction.

    On July 10 and July 11, 2001, representatives from Open Market and divine discussed the proposed letter of intent and term sheet. On July 11, 2001, divine
delivered to Open Market a revised version of the proposed letter of intent and term sheet.

    On July 16, 2001, Messrs. Filipowski, Bienvenu and Roszak from divine gave a presentation about divine and its business plan to certain members of the board of directors
of Open Market and representatives of Goldman Sachs.

    On July 17, 2001, the board of directors of Open Market met by telephone conference call with representatives of Goldman Sachs. During the call, management and the board
discussed various strategic alternatives, including the status of discussions with divine and another party, as well as a possible equity financing by a third party. The Open Market board instructed
management to continue to pursue all three alternatives.

    From July 17, 2001 through July 23, 2001, management of Open Market continued its negotiations with divine and with the other possible merger partner, and began
negotiating the terms of a possible equity financing with the third party.

    On July 20, 2001, divine management submitted to Open Market a summary of the revised proposed terms of a possible transaction and draft of a mutual confidentiality and
exclusivity agreement that would require Open Market to engage in discussions with respect to, among other things, change in control transactions exclusively with divine. On July 20, 2001,
representatives of Open Market, Hale and Dorr, divine and Bell, Boyd & Lloyd LLC, counsel to divine, met by telephone conference to discuss the revised proposed terms. After that meeting,
divine delivered a further revised summary of proposed terms to Open Market and also delivered a mutual confidentiality agreement that both parties executed that provided for an exclusivity period of
11 days but would allow Open Market to continue to explore equity financing during that time.

    On July 23, 2001, the board of directors of Open Market again met by telephone conference call with representatives of Goldman Sachs and Hale and Dorr. During the call,
management updated the Open Market board on the status of the three possible transactions being pursued, and outlined to the board the terms submitted by divine. Management and the board discussed the
possible merger with the other party, and determined that, based upon the current proposal, it could not be completed on acceptable terms. The Open Market board

directed management to continue its discussions with divine and with respect to the possible equity financing. The Open Market board also authorized management to enter into the confidentiality and
exclusivity agreement with divine. After this call, the parties finalized and executed a mutual confidentiality and exclusivity agreement that provided divine with an exclusivity period through
July 31, 2001 for the parties to evaluate a business combination.

    From July 23, 2001 through July 26, 2001, representatives from divine, Open Market, and their respective auditors met in Open Market's offices in Burlington for business
and financial due diligence on Open Market.

    On July 24, 2001, Bell, Boyd & Lloyd delivered to Hale and Dorr a draft of the proposed Open Market merger agreement and a credit agreement for a bridge loan to Open
Market.

    On July 27, 2001, Messrs. LaVigne and Durkin, together with representatives of Goldman Sachs, met with representatives of divine at divine's offices in Chicago, Illinois
for business and financial due diligence on divine.

    Also on July 27, 2001, the divine transaction team distributed due diligence information concerning Open Market to divine's board of directors.

    Between July 28, 2001 and August 2, 2001, representatives from divine and Open Market, their respective legal counsel and Goldman Sachs commenced a series of discussions
to negotiate the terms and conditions of the definitive Open Market merger agreement and bridge loan and related documentation. Throughout this period, both parties and their legal, financial and
accounting advisors conducted a detailed due diligence review of the other party's business, financial condition and operations.

    On August 1, 2001, Open Market received from the possible equity investor a draft term sheet setting forth proposed terms of an equity investment in Open Market.

    On August 2, 2001, the Open Market board of directors met by telephone conference call. Open Market management and representatives of Hale and Dorr and Goldman Sachs also
participated. During the call, the board and management discussed the proposed terms of the transaction with divine, and representatives from Hale and Dorr outlined the terms of the current draft of
the Open Market merger agreement. Representatives of Hale and Dorr also advised the board with respect to its fiduciary obligations. The board, management and Hale and Dorr then discussed the relative
merits and the timing and legal issues surrounding the proposed transaction with divine, the possible equity financing and the other possible merger transaction.

    On August 3, 2001, the parties agreed to extend the exclusivity period through August 8, 2001. From August 3, 2001 through August 15, 2001, representatives
from divine and Open Market, their respective legal counsel and Goldman Sachs participated in a series of discussions to negotiate the terms and conditions of the definitive Open Market merger
agreement and related documentation. Throughout this period, both parties and their legal, financial and accounting advisors continued their due diligence review of the other party's business,
financial condition and operations. During this period, the parties agreed to a number of brief extensions of the exclusivity period. In addition, throughout this period, representatives of Open
Market, divine and Silicon Valley Bank held discussions concerning Silicon Valley Bank's consent to the proposed Open Market merger and bridge loan and Open Market granting a security interest in its
Open Market assets to divine.

    In addition, as a condition to the proposed Open Market merger, in order to reduce the significant expenditure of cash potentially required, divine required that Open Market obtain a
waiver from Halifax Fund, L.P. of its right to require the redemption of its shares of Series E preferred stock for 115% of their stated value in cash in the event of a change of control
transaction, such as the proposed Open Market merger. After several days of negotiations, Halifax agreed to the terms of a waiver and modification agreement, pursuant to which Halifax agreed to waive
its redemption right under certain circumstances in exchange for the modification of the conversion rights of the Series E preferred stock and the exercise price of certain warrants.

    During their negotiations with divine, Silicon Valley Bank and Halifax Fund, management of Open Market continued discussions with the possible equity investor and discussed issues
related to terms and structure of the possible equity financing.

    On August 8, August 10 and August 14, 2001, the board of directors of Open Market met by telephone conference call with Open Market management and representatives
of Hale and

Dorr and Goldman Sachs. During these meetings, management updated the board on the status of negotiations with divine and discussed major open points for further negotiation and remaining due
diligence issues. Management also discussed with the board of directors the status of the possible equity financing and its potential impact on Open Market stockholders. Copies of the documents for
the divine transaction were also delivered to the Open Market board of directors.

    On August 8, 2001, the divine board of directors held a regular meeting at which the terms of the proposed Open Market transaction were considered. Senior management of divine
reported on the status of the Open Market merger negotiations and summarized the due diligence findings of divine's internal transaction team, Bell, Boyd & Lloyd, and KPMG LLP, divine's
independent accountants. divine's board of directors was also presented with copies of drafts of the relevant Open Market transaction documents.

    On August 10, 2001, the divine board of directors, with four directors not present, held a special meeting to consider the terms of the proposed Open Market transaction and
additional due diligence findings. Representatives of senior management and Bell, Boyd & Lloyd also participated. divine's transaction team led the discussion by summarizing additional due
diligence findings and reporting on the status of the Open Market merger negotiations. divine's board of directors then unanimously adopted and approved the Open Market merger agreement and ancillary
agreements contemplated by the Open Market merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and unanimously recommended that the stockholders of divine approve the issuance of divine common
stock in the Open Market merger.

    On August 15, 2001, the Open Market board of directors, with one director not present at the meeting at which action was taken, held a special meeting to consider the terms of
the proposed transaction with divine as well as the alternative possible equity financing. Representatives of senior management, Goldman Sachs and Hale and Dorr also participated. Open Market
management reported on the status of the Open Market merger negotiations with divine and the negotiations with respect to the possible equity financing. Representatives of Hale and Dorr reviewed the
significant terms of the Open Market merger agreement, the credit agreement and the stockholder agreements, the waiver and modification agreement with the holder of the Series E preferred stock
and a proposed amendment to Open Market's stockholder rights plan and summarized the board's fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed Open Market transaction. Mr. Wilk summarized the
terms of the proposed software distribution agreement to be entered into between divine and Open Market simultaneously with the Open Market merger agreement. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then
presented their financial analyses with respect to the proposed business combination with divine. Following this presentation, Goldman Sachs delivered its oral opinion that, as of such date and based
upon and subject to certain assumptions and matters set forth in the opinion, the

Open Market exchange ratio is fair from a financial point of view to the holders of Open Market common stock. This opinion was confirmed in a letter subsequently delivered by Goldman Sachs, a copy of
which is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex I. Following the presentations and further discussions, the Open Market board unanimously determined that the Open Market
merger agreement, and the transactions contemplated thereby, were advisable, fair and in the best interests of, Open Market and its stockholders, unanimously adopted and approved the Open Market
merger agreement and

the transactions contemplated thereby, and unanimously recommended that stockholders of Open Market approve the Open Market merger.

    On August 15, 2001, following final negotiations, the Open Market merger agreement, the credit agreement, the stockholder agreements and other ancillary documents were
executed.

    On August 16, 2001, prior to the opening of the Nasdaq National Market, divine and Open Market issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the Open Market merger
agreement.

The Companies' Reasons for the Open Market Merger

    The boards of directors of divine and Open Market independently concluded that the proposed Open Market merger will afford to each company the complementary
strengths of the two individual companies, will provide the combined company significant potential advantages and resources and potentially will enable the combined company to address emerging
strategic opportunities more quickly and effectively.

    divine and Open Market have each identified additional reasons for the Open Market merger, as discussed below. It should be noted, however, that the potential benefits of the Open
Market merger may not be fully realized. See "Risk Factors" beginning on page 31.

divine's Reasons for the Open Market Merger and Recommendation of divine's Board of Directors

    The divine board of directors believes that the Open Market merger is fair to, and in the best interest of, divine's stockholders and, with four directors not present at the meeting
at which action was taken, voted to unanimously recommend that divine's stockholders approve the issuance of divine common stock in the Open Market merger.

    In reaching its decision, in addition to the anticipated joint benefits described above, the divine board of directors consulted with divine's management, as well as its legal
counsel, and considered, among others, the following information and potential material factors:


the
compatibility of Open Market's products and services with divine's enterprise Web solutions business strategy;


the
economics of the software solutions industry, and the belief of the divine board that greater product variety, size and resources will increasingly be
required for companies to compete successfully in this industry;


the
belief that the combination of Open Market's technology, products and services with divine's products, services and sales and marketing infrastructure
should enable the combined company to expand the range of products and services offered to the combined company's customers and increase sales;


the
divine board's belief that the addition of Open Market's operations to divine could possibly increase the overall value and profitability of divine;


information
concerning divine's and Open Market's respective businesses, historical financial performance and condition, operations, technology, products,
strategic partners, customers, competitive positions, prospects and management;


current
financial market conditions and the historical market prices, volatility and trading information of divine common stock and Open Market common
stock;


the
financial and other terms of the Open Market merger, including the relationship between the market value of divine common stock and Open Market common
stock and a comparison of comparable merger transactions;


the
belief that the terms of the Open Market merger agreement, including the parties' representations, warranties and covenants, and the conditions to
their respective obligations, are fair and reasonable;


the
likelihood that the Open Market merger would be completed, including the limited conditions to the closing of the Open Market merger, as well as the
experience, reputation and financial condition of Open Market;


the
potential impact of the Open Market merger on strategic partners, customers and employees of divine and Open Market; and


the
likely reaction to the Open Market merger in the financial markets.

    The divine board of directors considered various alternatives to the Open Market merger, including alternative acquisitions and directly competing with Open Market in its markets. The
divine board of directors also identified and considered a variety of potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the Open Market merger, including, but not limited to:


the
possibility that the potential benefits set forth above may not be fully realized;


the
substantial costs of integrating the businesses of divine and Open Market and the transaction expenses arising from the Open Market merger;


certain
risks applicable to the Open Market merger and the business of the combined company as set forth under "Risk Factors" beginning on page 31;
and


the
possibility that the Open Market merger might not be consummated, resulting in a potential adverse effect on the market price of the divine common
stock.

Notwithstanding the risks, the divine board of directors concluded that the positive factors outlined above outweighed any negative considerations.

    The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the divine board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed to include the material factors
considered by the divine board of directors in connection with its review of the proposed Open Market merger. In view of the variety of factors, both positive and negative, considered, the divine
board of directors did not find it practical to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to the specific factors considered. Rather, the divine board of directors viewed its position
and recommendations as being based on the totality of the information presented to, and considered by, the divine board. In addition, individual members of the divine board of directors may have given
different weight to different factors.

    Based on the above-described analysis, the divine board of directors has determined that the terms of the Open Market merger and the Open Market merger agreement are fair to, and in
the best interests of, the divine stockholders. Accordingly, the divine board of directors, with four directors not present at the meeting at which action was taken, has unanimously approved and
adopted the Open Market merger agreement and the Open

Market merger and recommends that the stockholders of divine vote 
FOR 
approval of the issuance of divine common stock in the Open Market merger.

Open Market's Reasons for the Open Market Merger and Recommendation of Open Market's Board of Directors

    The Open Market board of directors believes that the Open Market merger is fair to Open Market's stockholders and in their best interests, and, with one director not present at the
meeting at which action was taken, has unanimously recommended the approval and adoption of the Open Market merger agreement and the Open Market merger. In reaching its determination to approve the
Open Market merger, the Open Market merger agreement and

the related transactions, the Open Market board of directors considered a number of factors in addition to those described above. The following summarizes the material factors the Open Market board of
directors considered:


the
current state of Open Market's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, given the general economic decline in the principal
geographic markets in which Open Market operates and the highly competitive nature of the industry in which Open Market operates, including the fact that Open Market's business could not be sustained
at an appropriate level without substantial and immediate new capital from a strategic partner or financing source;


the
strategic viability and economic terms of possible alternatives to the transaction with divine, including continuing as an independent entity and
entering into strategic financing or business arrangements with other industry participants or entering into a combination with another company in the content management and delivery market or a
related market, and the conclusion that these alternatives could not be completed on acceptable terms, if at all, as well as the belief that because of fundamental changes in the equity markets, there
was no assurance that the financing environment for companies like Open Market would improve substantially;


the
possible synergies to be realized from a merger with divine, including the opportunity for the combined businesses of Open Market and divine to employ
divine's significant financial and technical resources to help expand the market for Open Market's current products, to offer a broader suite of products and services encompassing software products,
professional services and application hosting and to accelerate the introduction of next-generation, content-driven customer interaction products built upon the foundation of Open Market's content
management products, and the willingness of divine to enter into a software distribution agreement concurrently with signing the Open Market merger agreement and begin distributing Open Market's
products immediately;


the
opportunity for Open Market's stockholders to continue to participate in the potential future growth and success of Open Market and divine and the
possible synergies to be realized from the Open Market merger through their receipt of shares of divine common stock in the Open Market merger;


the
likelihood of completing the Open Market merger, given the need for relatively few regulatory approvals or consents to consummate it, and the favorable
prospects for receiving these necessary approvals and consents and completing the Open Market merger;


the
terms of the Open Market merger agreement, including those relating to the board recommendation, the holding of the Open Market stockholder meeting,
the $2,600,000 termination fee payable by Open Market under specified circumstances, and the effect that the Open Market merger agreement and the existing arrangements with divine would have on Open
Market's ability to pursue or complete an alternative transaction, and the fact that the Open Market merger agreement was the product of arm's-length negotiations;


the
provisions of the credit agreement with divine, including the immediate access to the additional capital resources required by Open Market through
loans from divine;


the
impact on the proposed Open Market merger of stockholders agreements between divine and a group of stockholders of Open Market, on the one hand, and
between Open Market and a group of stockholders of divine, on the other hand, and the fact that the stockholder agreements would terminate if the Open Market merger agreement is terminated;


the
proposed acquisitions of eshare and RoweCom by divine, and the opportunities and risks associated with combining their businesses with those of divine
and Open Market;


the
fact that the consideration to be received by Open Market stockholders in the Open Market merger is expected to be tax-free to those stockholders for
U.S. federal income tax purposes;


the
historical market prices and recent trading activity of shares of Open Market common stock and divine common stock, including the fact that the offer
price per share of Open Market common stock implied by the exchange ratio represented a premium to the average closing prices of Open Market common stock relative to that of divine common stock over
the 30 trading days prior to August 15, 2001, notwithstanding the fact that the offer price per share of Open Market common stock implied by the exchange ratio represented a discount to the
closing price of Open Market common stock on that day; and


the
opinion of Goldman, Sachs & Co., Open Market's financial advisor, that the exchange ratio set forth in the Open Market merger agreement was
fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of Open Market common stock.

    The Open Market board of directors also identified and considered a number of uncertainties and risks concerning the Open Market merger, including:


the
risks described under "Risk Factors" beginning on page 31.


the
risk that the per share value of the consideration actually received by Open Market stockholders might be significantly less than the per share price
implied by the Open Market exchange ratio prior to the announcement of the Open Market merger because the Open Market exchange ratio will not be adjusted for changes in market price of either divine
common stock or Open Market common stock;


the
risk that the benefits sought in the Open Market merger and the related transactions might not be achieved;


the
difficulty of integrating the businesses of Open Market and divine, and the possible adverse effects that could result from the need for senior
management to focus significant time and effort on completing the Open Market merger and integrating the businesses;


the
risk that Open Market might suffer employee attrition or fail to attract key personnel due to uncertainties associated with the Open Market merger, and
that customers may delay purchases of Open Market's products until the Open Market merger is completed;


the
substantial price volatility that divine's common stock has experienced in the past year;


the
risk that eshare may terminate the eshare merger agreement on any date prior to the date of the eshare special meeting if the average closing sale
price of divine's common stock for any ten trading day period is less than $1.00; and


the
risk that the Open Market merger might not be consummated and the other applicable risks described in this proxy statement/prospectus under "Risk
FactorsRisks Relating to the Proposed Mergers" beginning on page 32.

    In light of the wide variety of factors that the Open Market board of directors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Open Market merger agreement and the complexity of
these matters, the Open Market board of directors did not quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the factors it considered. In addition, individual members of the Open Market board may have
given different weights to different factors. However, the Open Market board as a whole viewed its determinations and recommendations based on the totality of the information presented to and
considered by it.

    Based on the foregoing analysis, the Open Market board of directors has determined that the Open Market merger agreement and the Open Market merger are advisable and in the best
interests of Open Market and its stockholders and, with one director not present at the meeting at which action was taken, unanimously recommends that Open Market stockholders vote 

FOR 
adoption and
approval of the Open Market merger agreement and the Open Market merger.

Opinion of Financial Advisor to Open Market's Board of Directors

    On August 15, 2001, Goldman Sachs delivered its oral opinion to the board of directors of Open Market that as of the date of that opinion, the exchange
ratio set forth in the Open Market merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view, to the holders of Open Market common stock. Goldman Sachs subsequently confirmed its earlier opinion by
delivery of its written opinion, dated August 15, 2001.

The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated August 15, 2001, which sets forth the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex I and is incorporated herein by reference. Goldman Sachs provided its opinion for the
information and assistance of Open Market's board of directors in connection with its consideration of the Open Market merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of
Open Market

shares should vote with respect to the transaction. We urge you to read the opinion in its entirety.

    In connection with its opinion, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:


the
Open Market merger agreement,


the
proxy statement/prospectus, filed with the SEC on August 1, 2001, related to the eshare merger,


the
Annual Reports to Stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Open Market for the five years ended December 31, 2000 as
well as the Annual Report to Stockholders and Annual Report on Form 10-K of divine for the year ended December 31, 2000,


the
Registration Statement on Form S-1 of divine, dated July 12, 2000, relating to the initial public offering of divine common
stock,


certain
interim reports to shareholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Open Market and divine,


certain
other communications from Open Market and divine to their respective stockholders, and


certain
internal financial analyses and forecasts for Open Market and divine prepared by their respective managements.

    Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior managements of Open Market and divine regarding their assessment of the strategic rationale for, and the potential

benefits of, the transaction contemplated by the proposed Open Market merger agreement and the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of their respective
companies, including current and projected availability of cash on a stand-alone basis. In addition, Goldman Sachs:


reviewed
the reported price and trading activity for the Open Market common stock and the divine common stock,


compared
certain financial and stock market information for Open Market and divine with similar information for certain other companies the securities of
which are publicly traded, and


performed
such other studies and analyses as it considered appropriate.

    Goldman Sachs relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial accounting and other information reviewed by it and assumed such accuracy and completeness for purposes
of rendering its opinion. Goldman Sachs assumed with the consent of Open Market that forecasts of divine and Open Market (including synergies) were reasonably prepared on a basis that reflected the
best available estimates and judgments of Open Market. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities of Open Market or divine or any of their
subsidiaries. Open Market instructed Goldman Sachs to assume, for the purposes of its opinion, that certain contracts referred to in the Open Market merger agreement would be restructured in a manner
that would not have an adverse effect on divine, Open Market or the transaction contemplated by the Open Market merger agreement. Both Open Market and divine have relatively short operating histories,
and Goldman Sachs is not expressing any opinion on the prices at which the Open Market common stock or the divine common stock would be likely to trade before or following consummation of the Open
Market merger. Goldman Sachs' opinion does not address the relative merits of the transaction contemplated pursuant to the Open Market

merger agreement as compared to any alternative business transaction that might have been available to Open Market.

    The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by Goldman Sachs in connection with providing its August 15, 2001 opinion to Open Market's board of
directors.

     (i) 
Stand-alone Cash Position Analysis
. Based on information provided by Open Market's management, Goldman Sachs

     (ii) 
Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis.
 Goldman Sachs reviewed the historical daily trading prices for Open Market's
common stock and divine's common stock for the period from August 14, 2000 to August 14, 2001. Goldman Sachs' analysis indicated that the one-year average of the historical
exchange ratio was 1.089x, the six-month average was 0.871x, the three-month average was 0.769x, the one-month average was 0.865x and the exchange ratio as

of August 14, 2001 was 0.791x, compared to an exchange ratio between 0.8230x and 0.8598x proposed in the Open Market merger.

    (iii) 
Selected Companies Analysis
. Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared certain financial information for Open Market and
divine to corresponding financial information, ratios and public market multiples for the following four publicly traded corporations in the content management industry:


Documentum


Interwoven


Macromedia


Vignette

    In addition, Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared certain financial information for Open Market and divine to corresponding financial information, ratios and public market multiples
for the following nine publicly traded corporations in the e-CRM industry:


Art
Technology Group


Aspect
Communications


Blue
Martini Software


BroadVision


E.piphany


Intershop
Communications


Kana
Communications


Onyx
Software


Siebel
Systems

    Goldman Sachs also calculated and compared various financial multiples based on information it obtained from SEC filings, Institutional Brokers Estimate System estimates and certain
Wall Street research. The multiples of Open Market were calculated using the Open Market closing price on August 14, 2001, and the multiples of divine were calculated using the divine closing
price on August 14, 2001. The multiples for Open Market and divine were based on information provided by Open Market's management and Institutional Brokers Estimate System estimates. The
multiples for each of the selected companies were based on the most recent publicly available information. With respect to the selected companies, Goldman Sachs considered the equity market
capitalization as a multiple of calendarized revenues.

The
results of these analyses are summarized as follows:

    (iv) 
Contribution Analysis
. Goldman Sachs reviewed estimated future operating revenues for Open Market and divine based
on estimates provided by Open Market's and divine's managements to determine the contribution of each of Open Market and divine to the combined company's revenues. Goldman Sachs also reviewed
estimated future operating revenues for Open Market and divine without giving effect to the pending acquisitions of RoweCom and eshare to determine the contribution of each of Open Market and divine
to the combined company's revenues without RoweCom and eshare.

    Based on Open Market's common share price on August 14, 2001, the analysis indicated that, in the fully consolidated company:


Open
Market would contribute an estimated 14.9% of the combined sales in 2001 and an estimated 8.7% of the combined sales in 2002, and


Open
Market stockholders would own on a pro forma basis 16.8% of the outstanding common equity of the combined company (based on the midpoint of the number
of Open Market shares into which the Series E preferred stock would be converted).

    Based on Open Market's common share price on August 14, 2001, the analysis indicated that in the combined company excluding RoweCom and eshare:


Open
Market would contribute an estimated 20.5% of the combined sales in 2001 and an estimated 11.1% of the combined sales in 2002, and


Open
Market stockholders would own 21.8% of the outstanding common equity of the combined company (based on the midpoint of the number of Open Market
shares into which the Series E Preferred Stock would be converted).

    The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the
summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs' opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination,
Goldman Sachs considered the results of all such analyses. No company used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Open Market or divine or the contemplated transaction.

    The analyses were prepared solely for the purposes of Goldman Sachs' providing its opinion to the Open Market board of directors as to the fairness from a financial point of view of
the Open Market exchange ratio pursuant to the Open Market merger agreement to the holders of Open Market shares. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at
which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be

significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses. Because such analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the
parties or their respective advisors, none of Open Market, divine, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.

    As described above, Goldman Sachs' opinion to the board of directors of Open Market was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Open Market board of directors in making
its determination to approve the Open Market merger agreement.

    Goldman Sachs, as part of its investment banking business, is continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions,
negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. Goldman Sachs is
familiar with Open Market, having provided certain investment banking services to Open Market from time to time, including having acted as lead managing underwriter of its initial public offering of
4,000,000 shares of common stock in May 1996, and having acted as its financial advisor in connection with, and having participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the Open Market
merger agreement.

    Goldman Sachs provides a full range of financial advisory and securities services and, in the course of its normal trading activities, may from time to time effect transactions and
hold securities, including derivative securities, of Open Market or divine for its own account and for the accounts of customers.

    Pursuant to a letter agreement dated January 8, 1999, Open Market engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with the contemplated transaction.
Pursuant to the terms of this engagement letter, Open Market has agreed to pay Goldman Sachs a customary fee upon consummation of the Open Market merger.

    Open Market has also agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including attorneys' fees, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs
against certain liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.

Open Market Merger Consideration

    If we complete the Open Market merger, Open Market stockholders will receive for each share of Open Market common stock they own, that number of shares of
divine common stock obtained by dividing (1) 44,285,714 by (2) the total number of shares of Open Market's common stock deemed to be outstanding as of the closing of the Open Market
merger, including, for this purpose, all shares issuable upon conversion of any then outstanding Series E preferred stock of Open Market but less any shares of Open Market common stock issued
pursuant to any options or warrants exercised after the signing of the Open Market merger agreement. This Open Market exchange ratio will not change because of any fluctuation in the price of divine's
common stock, but will change as the conversion price for the Open Market Series E preferred stock changes, which is tied to the market price of the Open Market common stock, provided that in
no event will the conversion price be less than $0.75 per share or greater than $1.30 per share. Based on the volume weighted average price of the Open Market common stock through August 27,
2001, the number of issued and outstanding shares of Open Market common stock would be 53,392,546 shares and the Open Market exchange ratio would be 0.8294.

    As of August 28, 2001, 2,500 shares of Open Market Series E preferred stock had been converted into 2,712,085 shares of Open Market common stock at a conversion price of
$0.9218 per share and 1,765 shares of Open Market Series E preferred stock had been converted into 2,447,467 shares of Open Market common stock at a conversion price of $0.75 per share. The
conversion price for each of the remaining 735 shares of Series E preferred stock is equal to $1,040 divided by 90% of the daily volume weighted average market price of the Open Market common
stock for the three trading days or 20 trading days (whichever average is lower) preceding the date of conversion, provided that in no event will the

conversion price be less than $0.75 per share or greater than $1.30 per share. As a result, the maximum Open Market exchange ratio in the Open Market merger will be 0.8362 and the minimum Open Market
exchange ratio will be 0.8294.

We urge you to obtain current market quotations for divine common stock and Open Market common stock before making any decision on the Open Market merger.

Procedures for Exchange of Open Market Stock Certificates for the Open Market Merger Consideration

    When the Open Market merger is completed, divine will deposit with the exchange agent certificates representing the shares of divine common stock to be paid to
Open Market stockholders in the Open Market merger. In addition, as soon as practicable after we complete the Open Market merger, the exchange agent will mail to Open Market stockholders a letter of
transmittal and instructions for use in surrendering Open Market stock certificates in exchange for the divine common stock to which they are entitled as Open Market merger consideration. When Open
Market stockholders deliver their stock certificates to the exchange agent along with a properly executed letter of transmittal and any other required documents, their stock certificates will be
cancelled and they will receive divine common stock certificates representing the number of full shares of divine common stock to which they are entitled under the Open Market merger agreement. Open
Market stockholders also will receive payment in cash, without interest, instead of any fractional share of divine common stock which would have been otherwise issuable to them as a result of the Open
Market merger. The exchange agent will return to divine any shares of divine common stock and any cash that remain undistributed to Open Market stockholders 12 months after completion of the Open
Market merger. Any former Open Market stockholder who has not at that time surrendered his, her or its shares of Open Market common stock to the exchange agent may look only to divine for payment of
the Open Market merger consideration without any interest.

Open Market stockholders should not submit their Open Market stock certificates for exchange until they receive the transmittal instructions and a form of
letter of transmittal from the exchange agent.

    Open Market stockholders are not entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions on divine common stock until the Open Market merger is completed and
they have surrendered their Open Market stock certificates in exchange for divine stock certificates.

    divine will only issue a divine stock certificate or a check for cash received instead of a fractional share in a name other than the name in which a surrendered Open Market stock
certificate is registered if a stockholder of Open Market presents the exchange agent with all documents required to show and effect the unrecorded transfer of ownership and show that the stockholder
paid any applicable stock transfer taxes.

Dissenters' Rights

    Open Market common stockholders are not entitled to dissenters' rights or appraisal rights under the Delaware General Corporation Law in connection with the
Open Market merger.

Treatment of Open Market Stock Options and Warrants

    When the Open Market merger is completed, each outstanding stock option or warrant to purchase Open Market stock will convert into a stock option or warrant to
purchase a number of shares of divine common stock equal to the number of shares of Open Market common stock underlying the stock option or warrant multiplied by the Open Market exchange ratio. The
exercise price for these stock options or warrants will be equal to the current exercise price divided by the Open Market exchange ratio. On August 28, 2001, there were outstanding options and
warrants to purchase a total of 10,008,801 shares of Open Market common stock, with exercise prices ranging from $0.52 to $55.00 per share.

Stockholder Agreements

    divine and Messrs. Filipowski, Cullinane and Humenansky individually, and as trustees of certain trusts, and Microsoft Corporation and Dell Computer
Corporation, as stockholders of divine, have entered into stockholder agreements with Open Market. Under the stockholder agreements, Messrs. Filipowski, Cullinane and Humenansky individually,
and as trustees of certain trusts, and Microsoft Corporation and Dell Computer Corporation agreed to vote all of the shares covered by the stockholder agreements in favor of the issuance of divine
common stock in the Open Market merger. In addition, Messrs. Filipowski, Cullinane and Humenansky individually, and as trustees of certain trusts, and Microsoft Corporation and Dell Computer
Corporation each irrevocably appointed Open Market as his or its lawful attorney and proxy. The proxy grants Open Market, or any nominee of Open Market, the limited right to vote all of the shares of
divine common stock covered by the stockholder agreement in favor of the approval and adoption of the issuance of divine common stock in the Open Market merger. In addition, Messrs. Filipowski,
Cullinane and Humenansky individually, and as trustees of certain trusts, have further agreed not to offer, sell, pledge, encumber or otherwise dispose of all of their shares of divine common stock
until the termination of the stockholder agreements, which will occur upon the earlier of the termination of the Open Market merger agreement or the completion of the Open Market merger. As of the
record date, the shares subject to these agreements represented approximately 24% of the outstanding shares of divine common stock entitled to vote at the divine special meeting.

    In addition, Open Market and each of Harland K. LaVigne, Thomas H. Bruggere, Shikhar Ghosh, William S. Kaiser, B.C. Krishna, Eugene F. Quinn, Paul L. Sagan, Patrick Scannell, Edward
Durkin, Joseph Alwan and Greylock Equity Limited Partnership, as stockholders of Open Market, have entered into a stockholder agreement with divine. Under the stockholder agreement, these stockholders
agreed to vote all of the shares covered by the stockholder agreement in favor of the Open Market merger, the Open Market merger agreement and all related agreements. In addition, these stockholders
each irrevocably appointed divine as his or its lawful attorney and proxy. The proxy grants divine, or any nominee of divine, the limited right to vote all of the shares of Open Market common stock
covered by the stockholder agreement in favor of the approval and adoption of the Open Market merger agreement and any transactions contemplated by the Open Market merger agreement. In addition, these
stockholders have further agreed not to offer, sell, pledge, encumber or otherwise dispose of all of their shares of Open Market common stock until the termination of the stockholder agreement, which
will occur upon the earlier of the termination of the Open Market merger agreement or the completion of the Open Market

merger. As of the record date, the shares subject to these agreements represented approximately 10.5% of the outstanding shares of Open Market common stock entitled to vote at the Open Market special
meeting.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Open Market Merger

    In considering the recommendations of the Open Market board and the divine board that Open Market stockholders approve and adopt the Open Market merger
agreement and the Open Market merger, and that divine stockholders approve the issuance of divine common stock in the Open Market merger, Open Market stockholders and divine stockholders should be
aware that certain members of the Open Market board and management have interests in the Open Market merger that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of Open Market stockholders
and divine stockholders. The boards of divine and Open Market were aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving and/or adopting the Open Market merger agreement and
the Open Market merger.

    Indemnification; Insurance.
  The Open Market merger agreement provides that, for a period of six years from the closing
of the Open Market merger, the surviving corporation will provide rights to indemnification benefiting Open Market's directors and officers that are at least as favorable as those in effect under Open
Market's certificate of incorporation and bylaws as of the date of the Open Market merger agreement. The surviving corporation will also provide directors' and officers' liability insurance covering
those persons who were covered by Open Market's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy as of the date of the Open Market

merger agreement. However, the surviving corporation will not be required to expend more than $2,000,000 for the aggregate premium for that coverage.

Stock Option Acceleration.
  Vesting of options to purchase Open Market common stock granted to directors of Open Market
will accelerate upon the completion of the Open Market merger. As of the record date, divine would grant options to purchase divine common stock with respect to options to purchase       
shares of Open Market common stock held by Open Market directors and executive officers.

Executive Retention Agreements.
  Open Market has entered into executive retention agreements with certain members of its
management. The executive retention agreements generally provide for severance benefits if Open Market terminates the executive (other than termination for cause, disability or death), or the
executive terminates his or her employment for good reason (as defined in his or her retention agreement), within 12 months after a change in control (as defined in his or her retention
agreement). The Open Market merger will constitute a change in control for purposes of the executive retention agreement.

Employment Agreement between Mr. LaVigne and Open Market

    Pursuant to an employment agreement, dated December 1, 2000, by and between Open Market and Harland K. LaVigne, Open Market's chairman, president and
chief executive officer, in the event of a change in control (as defined in the employment agreement), Mr. LaVigne is entitled to receive a payment equal to his annual base salary of $420,000
and annual target bonus of $126,000 and continuation of the benefits described in the employment agreement for one year period following the change in control. The Open Market merger

would qualify as a change in control under the employment agreement. In addition, all of Mr. LaVigne's unvested Open Market options will become immediately exercisable. Mr. LaVigne is entitled
to the payments, continuation of benefits and accelerated vesting of his options regardless of whether he remains an employee of Open Market following the Open Market merger or if his employment is
terminated on or after the Open Market merger. The employment agreement also provides that, at the request of Open Market, Mr. LaVigne will remain an employee of Open Market for up to six
months following a change in control.

Extension of Exercise Period of Options Granted to Non-Management Directors.

    divine has agreed to extend the time period over which current non-management members of Open Market's board of directors may exercise options to purchase an
aggregate of 10,000 shares of Open Market common stock, at an exercise price of $1.21 per share. These options would normally expire 90 days after these board members' last day of service as
Open Market directors. The closing date of the Open Market merger would be the last day of service for these directors. Pursuant to the extension, these options, as converted to options to purchase
divine common stock, will expire on a date 18 months after the closing date of the Open Market merger.

United States Federal Income Tax Consequences

    The following are the material United States federal income tax consequences of the Open Market merger. This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, applicable Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations and court decisions as in effect as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, all of which may change,
possibly with retroactive effect.

    This discussion only addresses United States federal income tax consequences of those stockholders who hold their Open Market common or Series E preferred stock as capital
assets. It does not address all aspects of federal income taxation that may be important to an Open Market stockholder in light of that stockholder's particular circumstances or to an Open Market
stockholder who is subject to special rules, such as:


a
stockholder who is not a citizen or resident of the United States,


a
financial institution or insurance company,


a
tax-exempt organization,


a
dealer or broker in securities,


a
stockholder who holds his, her or its Open Market stock as part of a hedge, appreciated financial position, straddle or conversion transaction, or


a
stockholder who acquired his, her or its Open Market stock by exercising options or otherwise as compensation.

    This discussion of material federal income tax consequences is not a complete analysis or description of all potential federal income tax consequences of the Open Market merger. This
discussion does not address tax consequences that may vary with, or are contingent on, individual circumstances. In addition, it does not address any non-income tax or any foreign, state or local tax
consequences of the Open Market merger.

We strongly urge each Open Market stockholder to consult his, her or its own tax advisor to determine the particular United States federal, state or local or
foreign income or other tax consequences of the Open Market merger to him, her or it.

    Tax Opinions.
  The obligations of divine and Open Market to consummate the Open Market merger are conditioned upon the
receipt of legal opinions from their respective counsel that the Open Market merger will qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and that these opinions
of counsel shall not have been withdrawn prior to closing. However, the Open Market merger agreement provides that if counsel to either party does not render a tax opinion, this condition will
nonetheless be deemed satisfied with respect to that party if counsel to the other party delivers a tax opinion to that party. These opinions of Bell, Boyd & Lloyd LLC and Hale and
Dorr LLP will rely on customary factual assumptions and customary representations made by divine and Open Market. If any of the factual assumptions or representations relied upon by counsel are
inaccurate, the opinions may not accurately describe the federal income tax treatment of the Open Market merger, and this discussion may not accurately describe the tax consequences of the Open Market
merger. The opinions of counsel are not binding upon the Internal Revenue Service or the courts, and it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service or the courts will disagree with counsels'
opinions. Further, neither divine nor Open Market intends to obtain an IRS ruling on the tax consequences of the Open Market merger.

    Federal Income Tax Treatment of the Open Market Merger.
  The Open Market merger is

intended to qualify as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a)(1)(A) and Section 368(a)(2)(E)

of the Internal Revenue Code. The discussion immediately below "Federal Income Tax Consequences to Open Market Stockholders" assumes that the Open Market merger will qualify
as a reorganization.

    Federal Income Tax Consequences to Open Market Stockholders.
  Provided that the Open Market merger qualifies as a
reorganization, then for federal income tax purposes, subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications referred to herein:


An
Open Market stockholder who exchanges all of his, her or its Open Market stock solely for shares of divine common stock pursuant to the Open Market
merger will not recognize any gain or loss upon such exchange.


An
Open Market stockholder will have a tax basis in the divine common stock received in the Open Market merger (including any fractional share of divine
common stock deemed to be received and then redeemed for cash, as described below) equal to (1) the aggregate tax basis of the Open Market stock surrendered by that holder in the Open Market
merger, less (2) any cash received instead of a fractional share of divine common stock, plus (3) any gain recognized in the Open Market merger.


A
cash payment received by an Open Market stockholder in lieu of a fractional share of divine common stock will be treated as if that fractional share had
been issued in the Open Market merger and then redeemed by divine. An Open Market stockholder receiving that cash will generally recognize capital gain or loss upon this payment, equal to the
difference, if any, between that Open Market stockholder's tax basis in the fractional share and the amount of cash received.


The
holding period for shares of divine common stock received in exchange for Open Market stock in the Open Market merger will include the holding period
for the Open Market stock surrendered in the Open Market merger.

    Federal Income Tax Consequences to divine Stockholders.
  For federal income tax purposes, holders of divine common stock
will not recognize gain or loss on their divine common stock as a result of the Open Market merger.

The preceding discussion is intended only as a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences of the Open Market merger and does not purport
to be a complete analysis or discussion of all potential tax effects relevant thereto. Thus, Open Market stockholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences to
them of the Open Market merger, including tax return reporting requirements, the applicability and effect of foreign, federal, state, local and other applicable tax laws and the effect of any proposed
changes in tax laws.

Accounting Treatment

    divine will record the Open Market merger using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This means
that for financial reporting purposes, divine will treat both companies as one company beginning as of the date we complete the Open Market merger. In addition, under this method of accounting, divine
will record the fair value of Open Market's net assets on its consolidated financial statements, with the remaining purchase price in excess of the fair value of Open Market's net assets recorded as
goodwill. See "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements" beginning on page 142.

Regulatory Matters

    We have summarized below the material regulatory requirements affecting the Open Market merger. Although we have not received the required approvals as of the
date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, we anticipate that we will receive regulatory approvals sufficient to complete the Open Market merger shortly after the divine and Open Market special
meetings.

Antitrust Considerations.
  The Open Market merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, which prevents specified transactions from being completed until required information and materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and
the Federal Trade Commission and specified waiting periods are terminated or expire.

    The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission may challenge the Open Market merger on antitrust grounds, either before or after expiration of the
waiting period. Accordingly, at any time before or after the completion of the Open Market merger, either the Antitrust Division or the Federal Trade Commission could take action under the antitrust
laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, or other persons could take action under the antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the Open Market merger. Additionally, at any
time before or after the completion of the Open Market merger, notwithstanding that the applicable waiting period expired or was terminated, any state could take action under the antitrust laws as it
deems necessary or desirable in the

public interest. We cannot assure you that a challenge to the Open Market merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.

Federal Securities Laws.
  The shares of divine common stock to be issued in connection with the Open Market merger will
be registered under the Securities Act and will be freely transferable under the Securities Act, except for shares of divine common stock issued to any person who is deemed to be an "affiliate" of
Open Market on the date of the Open Market special meeting. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under the common control
of Open Market and may include executive officers, directors and significant stockholders of Open Market. Affiliates of Open Market may not sell their shares of divine common stock acquired in
connection with the Open Market merger except pursuant to:


an
effective registration statement covering the resale of those shares under the Securities Act;


Rule 145
under the Securities Act (or Rule 144 of the Securities Act if these persons become affiliates of divine); or


any
other applicable exemption under the Securities Act.

    The Open Market merger agreement provides that Open Market will use its reasonable efforts to obtain from each of its affiliates (for purposes of Rule 145 of the Securities
Act) a written agreement providing that the affiliate will not sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise

dispose of any divine common stock issued to the affiliate pursuant to the Open Market merger, except in compliance with Rule 145 or an exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act.

    divine's registration statement on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part, does not cover the resale of shares of divine common stock to be received by
Open Market affiliates in the Open Market merger.

Nasdaq National Market.
  divine will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shares of divine common stock to
be issued in connection with the Open Market merger to be approved for quotation on the Nasdaq National Market, subject to official notice of issuance, before the completion of the Open Market merger.
When the Open Market merger is completed, shares of Open Market common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

  THE ESHARE MERGER AGREEMENT

    The following summary of the eshare merger agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the eshare merger agreement, which is
incorporated by reference and attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. This summary may not contain all of the information that is important to you. We urge you to read the
full text of the eshare merger agreement.

The eshare Merger

    The eshare merger agreement provides that eshare will be merged with and into DES Acquisition Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine, on the second
business day following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the eshare merger agreement, unless the parties agree to another date. Following the eshare merger, DES's certificate
of incorporation and by-laws will govern the surviving corporation. The initial directors and officers of the surviving company will be DES's directors and officers. At the effective time
of the eshare merger, each eshare common share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be automatically converted into the right to receive a number of shares of divine
common stock. This number will be determined as follows:


If
the average closing price per share of divine common stock for the ten consecutive trading days ending two trading days prior to the closing of the
merger (referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the divine average closing price) is greater than $2.39 but is less than $2.82, then eshare shareholders will receive 1.30 shares of
divine common stock for each eshare common share they own.


If
the divine average closing price is $2.82 or greater, then eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare
common share they own equal to $3.653 divided by the divine average closing price.


If
the divine average closing price is $2.39 or less, then eshare shareholders will receive a number of shares of divine common stock for each eshare
common share they own equal to $3.12 divided by the greater of the divine average closing price or $1.00. 

    After giving effect to the adjustment provisions described above, if the number of shares of divine common stock to be issued in the eshare merger exceeds 28,546,506, then divine may
elect to pay cash in lieu of all or any portion of the divine common stock otherwise issuable to eshare shareholders in excess of 28,546,506 shares. The amount of these cash payments will be
determined based upon the divine average closing price.

No Fractional Shares Will Be Issued  

    divine will not issue any fractional shares of divine common stock in connection with the eshare merger. Instead of receiving fractional shares, each holder of
eshare common shares will be entitled to a cash payment equal to the fractional interest of the divine common stock multiplied by the closing sale price of divine common stock on the trading day
immediately prior to the effective date of the eshare merger.

eshare Stock Certificate Exchange Procedures  

    Promptly after the effective time of the eshare merger, the exchange agent will mail to each registered holder of eshare common shares (1) a letter of
transmittal, and (2) instructions for surrendering the holder's eshare stock certificate(s) in exchange for certificates representing shares of divine common stock and cash, if any, to which
he, she or it is entitled as eshare merger consideration. Upon surrendering an eshare stock certificate, together with a signed letter of transmittal and any other required documents to the exchange
agent, each eshare shareholder will be entitled to receive a certificate representing the whole number of shares of divine common stock that he, she or it has the right to receive and a cash payment
equal to the amount, if any, to which he, she or it is entitled as eshare merger consideration. eshare shareholders should not surrender their eshare stock certificates for exchange until they receive
a letter of transmittal from the exchange agent.

Treatment of eshare Stock Options  

    Depending upon the factors described below, outstanding eshare stock options may be either cancelled or converted into divine stock options upon consummation
of the eshare merger.

    Termination of eshare Stock Options.
  eshare stock options will be terminated if their post-merger exercise
price would be greater than the closing sale price of divine common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the closing date of the eshare merger. For purposes of this provision, the
post-merger exercise price is determined by dividing the exercise price of an eshare stock option by the exchange ratio and rounding the result to the nearest tenth of one cent.

    Conversion of eshare Stock Options.
  Fully exercisable options to purchase eshare common shares will be converted into
divine stock options if the post-merger exercise price of the eshare stock options would be less than or equal to the closing sale price of divine common stock on the trading day
immediately preceding the closing date of the eshare merger. The number of substitute divine options issued pursuant to each conversion will equal the number of eshare common shares subject to the
converted eshare stock options multiplied by the eshare exchange ratio. The exercise price of the divine options will equal the exercise price of the converted eshare stock options divided by the
eshare exchange ratio.

    divine and eshare intend that the divine options will qualify as "incentive stock options" as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. After giving effect to
accelerated vesting as a result of the eshare merger, the eshare merger agreement provides that each substituted divine option will be exercisable upon the same terms and conditions applicable to the
converted eshare option immediately prior to the eshare merger.

Issuance of divine Stock Options to eshare Employees  

    Promptly after the effective date of the eshare merger, divine will grant to eshare employees options to purchase shares of divine common stock representing,
in the aggregate, 13% of the total number of divine shares issued in the eshare merger. The exercise price of these options will be equal to the closing sale price of divine common stock on the
trading day immediately prior to the grant date of the options. These options will vest in three equal installments, with the first installment vesting on the grant date and the second and third

installments vesting on the second and third annual anniversaries of the grant date. Otherwise, these options will be subject to the terms and conditions commonly provided by divine for option grants
under its 2001 Stock Incentive Plan.

    No Solicitation of Alternative Transactions.
  Until the closing of the eshare merger or the termination of the eshare
merger agreement, eshare agreed not to:


solicit,
initiate or take any action to facilitate or encourage a "company acquisition proposal," as defined below; or


engage
in, or enter into, any negotiations or discussions concerning any company acquisition proposal. 

    However,
in response to an unsolicited company superior proposal, as defined below, that did not result from eshare's breach of its obligations not to solicit alternative
transactions, and provided that eshare promptly provides notice to divine of the company superior proposal, eshare may: 


participate
in discussions regarding any company acquisition proposal that is, or may lead to, a company superior proposal, in order to be informed and
make a determination with respect to that proposal;


approve
or recommend to its shareholders a company acquisition proposal under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934; and


withdraw,
modify in a manner adverse to divine or fail to make a recommendation to its shareholders of the eshare merger, if the eshare board of directors
reasonably determines that the company acquisition proposal is or is likely to result in a company superior proposal and determines in good faith that those actions are necessary to satisfy its
fiduciary duties.

    A
"company acquisition proposal" means any bona fide inquiry, proposal or offer relating to any: 


merger,
consolidation, business combination, or similar transaction involving eshare or any subsidiary of eshare;


sale,
lease or other disposition, directly or indirectly, by merger, consolidation, share exchange or otherwise, of any assets of eshare or any subsidiary
of eshare in one or more transactions;

  THE OPEN MARKET MERGER AGREEMENT

    The following summary of the Open Market merger agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Open Market merger agreement,
which is incorporated by reference and attached as Annex G to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. This summary may not contain all of the information that is important to you. We urge you to read
the full text of the Open Market merger agreement.

The Open Market Merger

    The Open Market merger agreement provides that DI1 Acquisition Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine, will be merged with and into Open Market on the
day all of the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Open Market merger set forth in the Open Market merger agreement have been satisfied or waived, unless the parties agree
to another date. As a result, DI1's separate corporate existence will cease and Open Market will survive as a wholly-owned subsidiary of divine. Following the Open Market merger, Open Market's
certificate of incorporation will be amended to read as set forth in Exhibit E to the Open Market merger agreement, and will govern the surviving corporation. DI1's by-laws will govern the surviving
corporation. The initial directors and officers of the surviving company will be DI1's directors and officers. At the effective time of the Open Market merger, each share of Open Market common stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be automatically converted into the right to receive a number of shares of divine common stock. This number will be determined by
dividing (1) 44,285,714 by (2) the total number of shares of Open Market's common stock outstanding as of the closing of the Open Market merger, including, for this purpose, all shares
issuable upon conversion of any then outstanding Series E preferred stock of Open Market, but less any shares of Open Market common stock issued pursuant to any options or warrants exercised
after the signing of the Open Market merger agreement. This exchange ratio will change as the conversion price for the Open Market Series E preferred stock changes, which price is tied to the
market price of Open Market common stock, provided that in no event will the conversion price be less than $0.75 per share or greater than $1.30 per share. Based on the volume weighted average price
of Open Market common stock through August 27, 2001, the number of issued and outstanding shares of Open Market common stock would be 53,392,546 shares and the exchange ratio would be 0.8294.

    As of August 30, 2001, 2,500 shares of Open Market Series E preferred stock had been converted into 2,712,085 shares of Open Market common stock at a conversion price of
$0.9218 per share and 1,765 shares of Open Market Series E preferred stock had been converted into 2,447,467 shares of Open Market common stock at a conversion price of $0.75 per
share. The conversion price for each of the 735 remaining shares of Series E preferred stock is equal to $1,040 divided by 90% of the daily volume weighted average market price of the
Open Market common stock for the three trading days or 20 trading days (whichever is lower) preceding the date of conversion, provided that in no event will the conversion price be less than $0.75 per
share or greater than $1.30 per share. As a result, the maximum

exchange ratio in the Open Market merger will be 0.8362 and the minimum exchange ratio will be 0.8294.

No Fractional Shares Will Be Issued

    divine will not issue any fractional shares of divine common stock in connection with the Open Market merger. Instead of receiving fractional shares, each
holder of Open Market common stock will be entitled to a cash payment equal to the fractional interest of the divine common stock multiplied by the closing sale price of divine common stock on the
trading day immediately prior to the effective date of the Open Market merger.

Open Market Stock Certificate Exchange Procedures

    Promptly after the effective time of the Open Market merger, the exchange agent will mail to each registered holder of Open Market common stock (1) a
letter of transmittal, and (2) instructions for surrendering the holder's Open Market stock certificate(s) in exchange for certificates representing shares of divine common stock. Upon
surrendering an Open Market stock certificate, together with a signed letter of transmittal and any other required documents to the exchange agent, each Open Market stockholder will be entitled to
receive a certificate representing the whole number of shares of divine common stock that he, she or it has the right to receive and a cash payment equal to the amount, if any, to which he, she or it
is entitled in lieu of fractional shares of divine's common stock. Open Market stockholders should not surrender their Open Market stock certificates for exchange until they receive a letter of
transmittal from the exchange agent.

Treatment of Open Market Stock Options and Warrants

    When the Open Market merger is completed, each outstanding option and warrant to purchase shares of Open Market's common stock will be converted into an option
or warrant to purchase the number of shares of divine's common stock equal to the number of shares of Open Market's common stock subject to such option or warrant multiplied by the Open Market
exchange ratio, with an exercise price equal to the exercise price of that option or warrant divided by the Open Market exchange ratio.
