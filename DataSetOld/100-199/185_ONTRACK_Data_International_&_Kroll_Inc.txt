                        JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS

                  MERGER PROPOSED--YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

The boards of directors of Kroll Inc. and ONTRACK Data International, Inc. have
agreed on a merger. As a result of the merger, Ontrack will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of Kroll. For each share of Ontrack common stock owned just
before the merger, Ontrack shareholders will be entitled to receive a fractional
share of Kroll common stock calculated to have a value equal to $12.50, based on
the volume weighted average price of Kroll common stock over a period of 20
consecutive trading days ending three trading days before the vote of the
Ontrack shareholders at the Ontrack special meeting. However, the value of this
fractional share may change depending upon the average trading price of Kroll
common stock before the merger. This is explained in further detail in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus.

We believe that the merger represents an exciting opportunity for both of our
companies. It will enhance Kroll's position as one of the world's leading risk
mitigation consulting companies, with leadership positions in investigations,
intelligence, forensic accounting, corporate recovery, security, employee
screening, electronic discovery and computer forensic services.

Following the merger, the current shareholders of Kroll will hold between
approximately __% and __% of the equity and voting power of the combined
company, and the current shareholders of Ontrack will hold between approximately
__% and __% of the equity and voting power of the combined company.

We cannot complete the merger unless the shareholders of Ontrack approve and
adopt the merger agreement and the merger and the shareholders of Kroll approve
the issuance of shares of Kroll common stock in connection with the merger.

A special meeting of the shareholders of Ontrack has been scheduled to vote on
the merger agreement and the merger and another proposal that are further
described in the notice of special meeting included in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. The 2002 annual meeting of the shareholders of Kroll has
been scheduled to vote on the issuance of Kroll common stock in the merger and
other proposals that are further described in the notice of annual meeting
included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The Kroll Annual Report to
shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2001 and the Ontrack Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001, as amended, also are enclosed
with this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Only shareholders of record of Ontrack as of , 2002 and shareholders of record
of Kroll as of , 2002 are entitled to attend and vote at the meetings. The
dates, times and places of the meetings are as follows:

For Kroll shareholders:

                             Eden Prairie, MN 55347

        The board of directors of ONTRACK Data International, Inc. asks you to
attend this important special meeting of shareholders to vote on the following:

        1.      To consider and vote on a proposal to adopt and approve the
                Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of April 1, 2002,
                by and among Kroll Inc., an Ohio corporation, ODI Acquisition
                Corporation, a Minnesota corporation and a wholly-owned
                subsidiary of Kroll Inc. and Ontrack, as amended, under which
                ODI Acquisition would be merged with and into Ontrack and
                Ontrack would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kroll. If the
                merger is completed, Ontrack shareholders will become Kroll
                shareholders. For each share of Ontrack common stock you own
                immediately prior the merger, you will be entitled to receive a
                partial share of Kroll common stock calculated to have a value
                equal to $12.50 based on the volume weighted average price of
                Kroll common stock over a period of 20 consecutive trading days
                ending three trading days before the vote of the Ontrack
                shareholders at the Ontrack special meeting. If this average
                price is $19.3886 or more, Ontrack shareholders will receive
                0.6447 of a share of Kroll common stock. If this average price
                is $15.8634 or less, Ontrack shareholders will receive 0.7880 of
                a share of Kroll common stock. However, if this average price is
                less than $15.8634, the Ontrack board of directors can terminate
                the merger agreement unless Kroll agrees to deliver to Ontrack
                shareholders Kroll common stock calculated to have a value equal
                to at least $12.50, based on the volume weighted average price
                of Kroll common stock over the period of 20 consecutive trading
                days ending three trading days before the vote of the Ontrack
                shareholders at the Ontrack special meeting, for each share of
                Ontrack common stock. The merger agreement and the merger are
                described in detail in the accompanying joint proxy
                statement/prospectus;

        2.      To adopt and approve the Ontrack 2001 Employee Stock Purchase
                Plan; and

        3.      To transact such other business as may properly come before the
                Ontrack special meeting or any postponements or adjournments.

        Your board of directors has determined that the merger agreement and the
merger are in your best interests and unanimously recommends that you vote to
adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger at the special meeting.
Your board of directors also unanimously recommends that you vote to adopt and
approve the Ontrack 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

______, 2002 as the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled
to notice of and to vote at the Ontrack special meeting. Only

holders of record of shares of Ontrack common stock on the record date will be
entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting or any postponements or
adjournments of the special meeting, and the presence in person or by proxy of a
majority of all shares will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.
The merger cannot be completed unless holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Ontrack common stock as of the record date affirmatively vote to adopt
and approve the merger agreement and the merger. Adoption and approval of the
Ontrack 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan requires the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares of Ontrack common stock present and entitled

        Kroll filed a registration statement on Form S-4 to register with the
SEC the shares of Kroll common stock to be delivered in connection with the
merger. This joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part of that registration
statement and constitutes a prospectus of Kroll, in addition to being a proxy
statement of Kroll and Ontrack for the annual meeting of Kroll shareholders and
the special meeting of Ontrack shareholders. As allowed by SEC rules, this joint
proxy statement/prospectus does not contain all the information you can find in
the registration statement or the exhibits to the registration statement. You
may obtain copies of the Form S-4 (and any amendments to that document) in the
manner described above.

        This joint proxy statement/prospectus incorporates by reference the

                         QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE
                              KROLL/ONTRACK MERGER

Q.    Why are Kroll and Ontrack proposing the merger?

A.    We believe that a merger of Kroll and Ontrack will enhance Kroll's
      position as one of the world's leading risk mitigation consulting
      companies, with leadership positions in investigations, intelligence,
      forensic accounting, corporate recovery, security, employee screening,
      electronic discovery and computer forensic services. The services of the
      two companies are complementary, and the combination should allow Ontrack
      to expand its geographic presence and Kroll to expand its services
      offerings within the risk mitigation consulting services industry.

      For shareholders of Ontrack, the merger will allow participation in a
      larger and more diversified public company and will provide more resources
      for Ontrack to expand its business and its market presence.

      For shareholders of Kroll, the merger is an opportunity to assume a
      leadership role in the high-growth electronic discovery and computer
      forensic markets and to position Kroll for continuing growth in the risk
      mitigation consulting industry.

      The reasons Ontrack and Kroll are proposing the merger are discussed in
      more detail later in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See
      "Recommendation of the Board of Directors of Ontrack; Reasons of Ontrack
      for the Merger," beginning on page and "Recommendation of the Board of
      Directors of Kroll; Reasons of Kroll for the Merger" on page .

Q.    What will I receive in the merger?

A.    Upon completion of the merger, for each share of Ontrack common stock
      owned just before the merger, Ontrack shareholders will be entitled to
      receive a partial share of Kroll common stock calculated to have a value
      equal to $12.50 based on the volume weighted average price of Kroll common
      stock over a period of 20 consecutive trading days ending three trading
      days before the vote of the Ontrack shareholders at the Ontrack special
      meeting. If this average price is $19.3886 or more, Ontrack shareholders
      will receive 0.6447 of a share of Kroll common stock. If this average
      price is $15.8634 or less, Ontrack shareholders will receive 0.7880 of a
      share of Kroll common stock. However, if this average price is less than
      $15.8634, the Ontrack board of directors can terminate the merger
      agreement unless Kroll agrees to deliver to Ontrack shareholders Kroll
      common stock calculated to have a value equal to $12.50, based on the
      volume weighted average price of Kroll common stock over the period of 20
      consecutive trading days ending three trading days before the vote of the
      Ontrack shareholders at the Ontrack special meeting, for each share of
      Ontrack common stock.

      The market price of Kroll common stock on the date of the merger will
      probably be different from the volume weighted average price of Kroll
      common stock over the period of 20 consecutive trading days ending three
      trading days before the vote of the Ontrack shareholders at the Ontrack
      special meeting. Thus, the value of the shares that Ontrack shareholders
      will receive on the date of the merger may be more or less than $12.50 per
      share. We believe using a 20 trading day period gives a better measure of
      the value over time of the stock to be received.

      Kroll will issue only whole shares and will pay cash instead of issuing
      fractional shares.

      Kroll shareholders will not receive any new consideration as a result of
      the merger.

Q.    When do you expect to complete the merger?

A.    The merger is subject to various conditions described in the merger
      agreement. We anticipate that the last of these conditions to be satisfied
      will be the shareholder approvals at the special meeting of Ontrack
      shareholders and the annual meeting of Kroll shareholders described in
      this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Accordingly, if the shareholders
      approve the merger related proposals, the merger should be completed
      shortly after the meetings.

Q.    What shareholder approvals are needed?

A.    Approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger requires the
      affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
      Ontrack stock. Please note that holders of approximately 27% of Ontrack's
      outstanding common stock have signed agreements, and granted irrevocable
      proxies to Kroll, to vote for the adoption and approval of the merger
      agreement and the merger.

      Kroll shareholders are not required to approve the merger agreement or the
      merger. However, under Ohio corporate law and the rules of the Nasdaq
      National Market, on which Kroll's shares are listed, the shareholders of
      Kroll must approve the issuance of Kroll common stock in the merger. The
      vote required is the affirmative vote of shareholders entitled to exercise
      a majority of the voting power of Kroll.

Q.    What if I don't vote?

A.    Because adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger
      require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
      outstanding shares of Ontrack, failing to cast a vote or abstaining will
      have the same effect as a vote against adoption and approval of the merger
      agreement and the merger. A proxy card for the Ontrack meeting that has
      been properly signed, dated and returned but that does not indicate how
      the Ontrack shareholder wishes to vote will be counted as a vote for the
      adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger.

      Because approval of the issuance of Kroll common stock in the merger
      requires the affirmative vote of shareholders entitled to exercise a
      majority of the voting power of Kroll, failing to cast a vote or
      abstaining will have the same effect as a vote against approval of the
      issuance of Kroll common stock in the merger. A proxy card for the Kroll
      meeting that has been properly signed, dated and returned but that does
      not indicate how the Kroll shareholder wishes to vote will be counted as a
      vote in favor of approval of the issuance of Kroll common stock.

Q.    What should I do now?

A.    After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this
      joint proxy statement/prospectus and the documents that accompany it, you
      should cast your vote by completing, signing and dating your proxy card
      and returning it promptly in the postage-prepaid envelope provided.

      You also can attend the shareholders meeting of your company and vote in
      person.

      The Ontrack board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR
      approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger.

      The Kroll board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR
      approval

      of the issuance of Kroll common stock in connection with the merger.

Q.    When should I deliver my proxy? Can I change my vote?

A.    You should deliver your proxy as soon as possible to ensure that your
      shares will be voted at the shareholders meeting of your company. You can
      change your vote at any time prior to the shareholders meeting by
      submitting a later dated, signed proxy card. You can also change your vote
      by attending the shareholders meeting of your company and voting in
      person.

Q.    If my shares of stock are held in "street name" by my bank or broker, how
      can I vote?

A.    Your bank or broker will vote your shares only if you provide it with
      instructions on how to vote. Your bank or broker will contact you
      regarding the procedures necessary for it to vote your shares. Please tell
      your bank or broker how you would like it to vote your shares. If you do
      not tell your bank or broker how to vote, your shares will not be voted.

Q.    Should shareholders send in their Ontrack stock certificates now?

A.    No. After the merger is completed, Ontrack shareholders will receive
      written instructions on how to exchange their Ontrack stock certificates
      for certificates representing shares of Kroll common stock. Please do not
      send in Ontrack stock certificates with the proxy.

Q.    What should I do if I have questions?

A.    Ontrack shareholders may call Thomas P. Skiba, Vice President and Chief
      Financial Officer of Ontrack, at (952) 937-1107.

      Kroll shareholders may call Sabrina H. Perel, Vice President, General
      Counsel and Secretary of Kroll, at (212) 593-1000.

                              The Meetings (page   )

The special meeting of Ontrack shareholders will be held on , 2002, at , Central
Daylight Time, at the offices of Ontrack at 9023 Columbine Road, Eden Prairie,
Minnesota 55347.

The record date for Ontrack shareholders entitled to receive notice of and to
vote at the Ontrack special meeting is the close of business on , 2002. On that
date, there were shares of Ontrack common stock outstanding of which
approximately were held by directors and officers of Ontrack and their
affiliates. Each holder of record of Ontrack common stock on the record date is
entitled to one vote per share on the proposals to be presented at the Ontrack
special meeting.

The annual meeting of Kroll shareholders will be held on   , 2002, at   ,
Eastern Daylight Time, at , New York.

The record date for Kroll shareholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote
at the Kroll annual meeting is the close of business on , 2002. On that date,
there were shares of Kroll common stock outstanding of which approximately were
held by directors, officers and affiliates of Kroll. Each holder of record of
Kroll common stock on the record date is entitled to one vote per share on the
proposals to be presented at the Kroll annual meeting.

                               The Merger (page   )

The proposed merger is to be completed pursuant to a merger agreement, as
amended, among Ontrack, Kroll and ODI Acquisition Corporation, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Kroll. In the merger, ODI Acquisition will merge with and into
Ontrack and Ontrack will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kroll. A copy of
the merger agreement is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as
Annex A.

The Exchange Ratio; Merger Consideration

Upon completion of the merger, for each share of Ontrack common stock owned just
before the merger, Ontrack shareholders will be entitled to receive a partial
share of Kroll common stock calculated to have a value equal to $12.50 based on
the volume weighted average price of Kroll common stock over a period of 20
consecutive trading days ending three trading days before the vote of the
Ontrack shareholders at the Ontrack special meeting. If this average price is
$19.3886 or more, Ontrack shareholders will receive 0.6447 of a share of Kroll
common stock. If this average price is $15.8634 or less, Ontrack shareholders
will receive 0.7880 of a share of Kroll common stock. However, if this average
price is less than $15.8634, the Ontrack board of directors can terminate the
merger agreement unless Kroll agrees to deliver to Ontrack shareholders Kroll
common stock calculated to have a value equal to $12.50, based on the volume
weighted average price of Kroll common stock over the period of 20 consecutive
trading days ending three trading days before the vote of the Ontrack
shareholders at the Ontrack special meeting, for each share of Ontrack common
stock.

The market price of Kroll common stock on the date of the merger will probably
be different from the volume weighted average price of Kroll common stock over
the period of 20 consecutive trading days ending three trading days before the
vote of the Ontrack shareholders at the Ontrack special meeting. Thus, the value
of the shares that Ontrack shareholders will receive on the date of the merger
may be more or less than $12.50 per share. We believe using a 20 trading day
period gives a better measure of the value over time of the stock to be
received.

Ontrack shareholders will receive only whole shares of Kroll common stock and
cash instead of any fractional shares.

Dissenters' Rights

Under Minnesota law, Ontrack shareholders will have the right to dissent from
the merger and, subject to various conditions provided for under Minnesota law,
receive cash for their Ontrack shares if the merger is completed. To do this,
holders of dissenting Ontrack shares must follow required procedures, including
filing notices and not voting their shares in favor of the merger. A dissenting
Ontrack shareholder will not receive any shares of Kroll common stock in the
merger. See "The Merger - Dissenters' Rights of Ontrack Shareholders" beginning
on page for a description of the dissenters' rights available to Ontrack
shareholders and how they can exercise those rights. In addition, a copy of the
Minnesota dissenters' rights statutes is attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex D.

Under Ohio law, Kroll shareholders will have the right to dissent from the
issuance of Kroll common stock in the merger and to receive the appraised value
of their Kroll shares. To do this, holders of dissenting shares must follow
required procedures, including filing notices with Kroll and either abstaining
or voting against the issuance of Kroll stock in the merger. See "The Merger -
Dissenters' Rights of Kroll Shareholders" beginning on page for a description of
the dissenters' rights available to Kroll shareholders and how they can exercise
those rights. In addition, the applicable provisions of Ohio law related to
dissenters' rights are attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as
Annex E.

Restrictions on the ability to sell shares of Kroll common stock

All shares of Kroll common stock received by shareholders of Ontrack in
connection with the merger will be freely transferable, except for shares of
Kroll common stock received by Ontrack shareholders who are considered to be
"affiliates" of Ontrack under the Securities Act of 1933 at the time of the
Ontrack special meeting. See "The Merger - Federal Securities Law Consequences"
on page . Consistent with their long standing desire to diversify their
holdings, each of Messrs. Michael W. Rogers, John E. Pence and Gary S. Stevens,
affiliates of Ontrack, have informed Ontrack that they intend to sell the Kroll
common stock they receive in the merger from time to time as market conditions
are favorable and in accordance with the volume limitations prescribed by Rule
145 and all other legal requirements.

Tax Treatment

We anticipate that the merger, as it has been structured, will constitute a
reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes. Neither Kroll nor
Ontrack will be obligated to complete the merger unless it receives a legal
opinion to that effect. Assuming the merger qualifies as a reorganization, the
receipt of shares of Kroll common stock in the merger will generally be tax-free
to Ontrack shareholders for United States federal income tax purposes, except
for tax with respect to any gain on cash received for fractional shares of Kroll
common stock.

To review the tax consequences of the merger in greater detail, see "The Merger
- - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" beginning on page . The tax
consequences to Ontrack shareholders will depend on the facts and circumstances
of a shareholder's own situation. Ontrack shareholders should consult their tax
advisors for a full understanding of the tax consequences to them.

Interests of Ontrack's Directors, Officers and Employees in the Merger

In considering the recommendation of the Ontrack board of directors in favor of
approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger, Ontrack
shareholders should be aware that members of Ontrack's board of directors,
executive officers and key employees will receive benefits as a result of the
merger that will be in addition to or different from the benefits received by
Ontrack shareholders generally. The board of Ontrack recognized those interests
and considered them when it approved the merger agreement and the merger. These
benefits include:

     o    the acceleration of the exercisability and vesting of all outstanding
          options, including those held by directors, officers and employees;

     o    severance payments made to three Ontrack officers;

     o    employment agreements entered into between Kroll or ODI Acquisition
          and three Ontrack officers;

     o    options to purchase shares of Kroll common stock that will be granted
          to certain Ontrack officers and employees; and

     o    the appointment of Ben F. Allen to the Kroll board of directors.

See "The Merger - Interests of Ontrack's Directors, Officers and Employees in
the Merger" beginning on page .

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger

Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and
the rules under the HSR Act, we cannot complete the merger until we have given
notification and furnished information relating to the operations of the parties
and the industries in which they operate to the Antitrust Division of the U.S.
Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and a specified waiting
period expires or is terminated. We both filed notification and report forms
under the HSR Act with the Antitrust Division on April 26, 2002.

Conditions to the Merger

Completion of the merger depends upon satisfaction of a number of conditions,
including:

     o    continuing effectiveness of the registration statement of which this
          joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part;

     o    approval and adoption by the Ontrack shareholders of the merger
          agreement and the merger;

     o    approval by the Kroll shareholders of the issuance of shares of Kroll
          common stock in connection with the merger;

     o    the absence of legal restraints to completion of the merger;

     o    the receipt of all necessary regulatory or governmental clearances;

     o    the filing with the Nasdaq National Market of an application for the
          listing of additional shares for the Kroll common stock to be issued
          or reserved for issuance in connection with the merger;

     o    receipt of legal opinions regarding the tax-free nature of the merger;
          and

     o    the absence of any material adverse changes in the businesses of Kroll
          and Ontrack since December 31, 2001.

For further details of all of the closing conditions, see "The Merger Agreement
- - Conditions to Completion of the Merger" beginning on page .

If specified conditions to closing have not been satisfied by the date of the
respective shareholders meetings, either Kroll or Ontrack may adjourn its
meeting until those conditions have been satisfied. See "The Merger Agreement -
Other Material Covenants - Shareholders Meetings."

Termination of the Merger

Either Kroll or Ontrack may terminate the merger agreement if:

     o    both parties consent in writing;

     o    the merger is not completed by August 31, 2002 through no fault of the
          party seeking to terminate the merger;

     o    the Ontrack shareholders do not approve the merger agreement;

     o    the Kroll shareholders do not approve the issuance of shares of Kroll
          common stock in connection with the merger;

     o    there are legal restraints preventing the merger;

     o    a representation or warranty of the other party in the merger
          agreement is not true and correct in all material respects on or
          subsequent to April 1, 2002, unless cured within 15 days of the notice
          of termination; or

     o    the other party fails to perform or comply in all material respects
          with a covenant, obligation or condition contained in the merger
          agreement and the failure is not cured within 15 days of a notice of
          breach.

Kroll also may terminate the merger agreement if Ontrack's board of directors:

     o    withdraws or modifies in a manner adverse to Kroll its approval,
          adoption or recommendation of the merger agreement or the merger;

     o    fails to reaffirm its recommendation of the merger agreement or the
          merger after Kroll requests a reaffirmation of the recommendation
          following the public announcement of an alternative acquisition
          proposal for Ontrack;

     o    recommends an alternative acquisition transaction with a third party;

     o    fails to recommend rejection of a tender or exchange offer being
          commenced by a third party for 15% or more of the outstanding shares
          of Ontrack common stock; or

     o    fails to hold the Ontrack special meeting within 45 days after the
          registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus
          is a part becomes effective, unless Ontrack adjourns its meeting
          because specified conditions have not been satisfied or waived by the
          date of its special meeting as long as Ontrack holds the meeting
          within two business days after those conditions have been satisfied or
          waived.

Ontrack may terminate the merger agreement to accept an alternative acquisition
proposal if:

     o    its board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation
          with independent financial and legal advisors, that the alternative
          proposal (1) is reasonably capable of being completed on the terms
          proposed and (2) would result in a transaction more favorable to
          Ontrack shareholders from a financial point of view than the proposed
          merger with Kroll;

     o    Ontrack gives Kroll notice that it intends to enter into an agreement
          or letter of intent regarding the alternative proposal, unless Kroll
          submits a counterproposal within 72 hours of receipt of such notice,
          in which event Ontrack will negotiate with Kroll in good faith until
          the expiration of such 72 hour period; and

     o    Ontrack pays Kroll the termination fee described below.

Ontrack may also terminate the merger agreement if:

     o    Kroll's board of directors withdraws or modifies in a manner adverse
          to Ontrack its approval, adoption or recommendation of the proposal to
          issue the Kroll common stock in connection with the merger; or

     o    the volume weighted average price of Kroll common stock over a period
          of 20 consecutive trading days ending three trading days before the
          vote of the Ontrack shareholders at the Ontrack special meeting is
          less than $15.8634 and Kroll does not agree to an exchange ratio equal
          to $12.50 divided by that 20

          consecutive trading day volume weighted average price.

For further details, see "The Merger Agreement - Termination" beginning on
page    .

Termination Fee and Expenses; No Solicitation Provisions

If the merger is terminated under specified circumstances, generally involving
an alternative acquisition transaction, Ontrack will be required to pay a
termination fee of $4.2 million to Kroll. In addition, Ontrack or Kroll may have
to pay the other party's out-of-pocket expenses if the merger agreement is
terminated under other specified circumstances. See "The Merger Agreement -
Termination - Fees and Expenses; Termination Fee" beginning on page for a
discussion of the circumstances in which the termination fee and other expenses
are payable.

Ontrack has agreed that it will not solicit or encourage the initiation of any
inquiries or proposals regarding any alternative acquisition transactions with
third parties. However, Ontrack may respond to unsolicited acquisition proposals
if required by the fiduciary duties of Ontrack's board of directors, but it must
promptly notify Kroll if it receives proposals for any alternative acquisition
transactions. See "The Merger Agreement - No Solicitation" beginning on page .

The termination fee and the no-solicitation provisions may have the effect of
discouraging persons who might be interested in entering into an acquisition
transaction with Ontrack from proposing an alternative acquisition transaction.

Accounting Treatment

The merger will be accounted for as a purchase by Kroll in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

Opinion of Financial Advisor to Ontrack (page    )

On April 1, 2002, RBC Dain Rauscher, Inc., a member company of RBC Capital
Markets, Ontrack's financial advisor, which we refer to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as RBC, rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed
in writing, to Ontrack's board of directors that, as of that date and subject to
the assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth in its opinion, the
per share merger consideration under the exchange ratio provisions of the merger
agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Ontrack's
common stock. The full text of the written opinion of RBC is attached to this
proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B. The summary of the opinion in "The Merger
- - Opinion of Financial Advisor to Ontrack", is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of the opinion by RBC. Ontrack shareholders are urged
to read the opinion of RBC carefully and in its entirety. RBC's opinion was
directed to the Ontrack board of directors and does not constitute a
recommendation to any shareholder as to any matter relating to the merger.

Opinion of Financial Advisor to Kroll (page    )

On March 29, 2002, Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn, Inc., Kroll's financial advisor,
delivered its oral opinion to the Kroll board of directors, and subsequently
confirmed in writing, that, as of that date and based on and subject to the
matters described in its written opinion, the consideration to be offered by
Kroll in the merger was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of
Kroll common stock. Morgan, Lewis Githens & Ahn reaffirmed this opinion on April
1, 2002. See "The Merger - Opinion of Financial Advisor to Kroll" beginning on
page . The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn, dated
March 29, 2002 and the reaffirmation of that opinion dated April 1, 2002, are
attached to this joint proxy statement/ prospectus as Annexes C-1 and C-2. Kroll
shareholders should read this opinion in its entirety for a description of the
procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the
review undertaken in delivering the opinion. Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn's
opinion is directed to the Kroll board of directors and does not constitute a
recommendation to any shareholder as to any matter relating to the merger.

Comparison of Rights of Shareholders of Ontrack and Kroll (page    )

The rights of Ontrack shareholders are governed by Minnesota law and Ontrack's
Articles of

Incorporation and its Bylaws. The rights of Kroll shareholders are governed by
Ohio law and Kroll's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended,
and its Code of Regulations. This joint proxy statement/prospectus also contains
a proposal for Kroll shareholders to approve and adopt an agreement and plan of
merger that would reincorporate Kroll in Delaware following the merger with
Ontrack. If this proposal is approved by Kroll shareholders, the rights of Kroll
shareholders, including Ontrack shareholders receiving Kroll stock in the
merger, will be governed by Delaware law and the certificate of incorporation
and by-laws of the Delaware entity. For a summary of material differences
between the rights of Ontrack shareholders and Kroll shareholders, see
"Comparison of Rights of Shareholders of Ontrack and Shareholders of Kroll"
beginning on page   .

Risk Factors

In considering whether to approve the merger-related proposals, you should
consider risks related to the merger and other risks related to Kroll. See "Risk
Factors" beginning on page ___ for a more detailed discussion of these risks.

                                  RISK FACTORS

        In addition to reading and considering the other information we have
included or incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus,
you should carefully read and consider the following factors in evaluating the
merger-related proposal to be considered at the shareholders meeting of your
company.

Risks Factors Related to the Proposed Merger

        Since the market price of Kroll common stock will vary after the merger
exchange ratio becomes fixed, Ontrack shareholders cannot be certain of the
value of the consideration they will receive in the merger.

        Upon completion of the merger, for each share of Ontrack common stock
owned just before the merger, Ontrack shareholders will be entitled to receive a
partial share of Kroll common stock calculated to have a value equal to $12.50
based on the volume weighted average price of Kroll common stock over a period
of 20 consecutive trading days ending three trading days before the vote of the
Ontrack shareholders at the Ontrack special meeting. If this average price is
$19.3886 or more, Ontrack shareholders will receive 0.6447 of a share of Kroll
common stock. If this average price is $15.8634 or less, Ontrack shareholders
will receive 0.7880 of a share of Kroll common stock. However, if this average
price is less than $15.8634, the Ontrack board of directors can terminate the
merger agreement unless Kroll agrees to deliver to Ontrack shareholders Kroll
common stock calculated to have a value equal to $12.50, based on the volume
weighted average price of Kroll common stock over the period of 20 consecutive
trading days ending three trading days before the vote of the Ontrack
shareholders at the Ontrack special meeting, for each share of Ontrack common
stock. Assuming the volume weighted average price of Kroll common stock equals
the closing price of Kroll common stock on the Nasdaq National Market of $17.10
on April 1, 2002, the day the merger agreement was signed, Ontrack shareholders
would receive 0.7310 of a share of Kroll common stock, with a value of $12.50.
The market price of Kroll common stock on the date of the merger will probably
be different from the volume weighted average price of Kroll common stock over
the period of 20 consecutive trading days ending three trading days before the
vote of the Ontrack shareholders at the Ontrack special meeting. The market
value of Kroll common stock fluctuates for many reasons, including changes in
the business, operations or prospects of Kroll, regulatory considerations or
general market or economic conditions. Thus, the value of the shares that
Ontrack shareholders will receive on the date of the merger may be more or less
than $12.50 per share. Other than as described above, the exchange ratio will
not be adjusted in the event of any increase or decrease in the price of Kroll
common stock or Ontrack common stock.

        The exchange ratio will not be fixed until three trading days before the
date of the vote of the Ontrack shareholders at the Ontrack special meeting. In
addition, the merger may not be completed immediately after the Ontrack special
meeting. Accordingly, at the time of the Ontrack special meeting, Ontrack
shareholders will know the exchange ratio but will not know the exact market
value of the Kroll stock they will receive when the merger is completed.

        The expected benefits of the merger may not be realized.

        We cannot assure you that our two companies will be successfully
combined into a single entity. If we cannot successfully combine our operations,
we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
or results of operations. The merger involves combining two companies that have
previously operated separately. The combining of companies such as Kroll and
Ontrack involves a number of risks, including:

        o       the diversion of management's attention to the combining of
                operations;

        o       difficulties in the combining of our operations and systems,
                particularly our sales and marketing organizations;

        o       difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees;

        o       challenges in keeping existing clients and obtaining new
                clients; and

        o       potential adverse short-term effects on operating results.

        Because of difficulties in combining operations, we may not be able to
realize the cost savings, revenue growth and other benefits that we hope to
achieve after completion of the merger. In addition, Kroll may be required to
spend additional time or money on integration that would otherwise be spent on
the development of its business and services.

        The trading price of Kroll common stock may be affected by factors
different from those affecting the price of Ontrack common stock; the Kroll
price could decline following the merger.

        Upon completion of the merger, holders of Ontrack common stock will
become holders of Kroll common stock. Kroll's business differs from that of
Ontrack. Ontrack is engaged in providing data recovery and discovery services.
Kroll provides some computer forensic services as part of its technology
services, but these services represent a small portion of Kroll's business.
Kroll provides a full range of risk mitigation consulting services, including
investigations, intelligence, forensic accounting, corporate recovery, security,
employee screening, electronic discovery and computer forensic services.
Accordingly, Kroll's results of operations, as well as the trading price of
shares of Kroll common stock, may be affected by factors different from those
affecting Ontrack's results of operations and the price of Ontrack common stock.

Risk Factors Relating to Kroll

    Kroll may not be able to implement its growth strategy.

        Kroll's ability to implement its business plan successfully requires
effective planning and growth management. Kroll will continue to manage and
attempt to expand relationships with its clients. Kroll also may enhance the
capabilities of its operational systems and may require additional employees,
management and operational and financial resources to support its growth
strategy. If Kroll cannot manage its growth effectively, its financial
condition, results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected.

        In addition, Kroll made multiple acquisitions in 1998, 1999 and 2000 and
currently is evaluating its acquisition strategy. While Kroll has experience in
identifying and integrating acquisitions, it may not be able to identify
suitable acquisition candidates, obtain the capital necessary to pursue its
acquisition strategy or complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms or at all.
When companies are acquired, Kroll may not be able to integrate or manage these
businesses so as to produce returns that justify the investment. In addition,
issues relating to new acquisitions may divert its management's attention from
existing operations. If Kroll cannot manage its growth for any of these reasons,
its financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be materially
adversely affected.

        Kroll's business outside the United States exposes it to numerous risks,
which, singly or together, could materially and adversely affect its business.

        In addition to its U.S. facilities, Kroll has operations and assets in
Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India,
Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Africa and the
United Kingdom. Kroll also offers its services in other foreign countries and is
seeking to increase its level of international business activity. Kroll's
international business exposes it to various risks. Currently, the most
significant risks relate to regional economic downturns in Central and South
America and in certain regions in Asia. Other risks of doing business outside
the United States include exchange rate fluctuations, foreign currency
restrictions, U.S. government-imposed prohibitions against offering services to
specific countries, expropriation of assets, war, civil uprisings and riots,
government instability, difficulties enforcing contracts under foreign legal
systems, and unanticipated taxes, duties or other governmental assessments. Any
of these risks could result in a loss of business, significant unexpected
write-offs of assets or other unexpected costs, which could have a material
adverse effect on Kroll's financial condition, results of operations and cash
flow.

        In the past, Kroll has occasionally had difficulty in collecting
significant accounts receivable for its services, particularly when the obligor
was located in a foreign country.

        Kroll may not operate profitably in the future.

        Kroll reported net losses of approximately $1.9 million, $33.9 million
and $21.4 million for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001,
respectively. Although the net loss in each of those periods included material
non-recurring expenses, even if those expenses were excluded, results for the
years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 would have been a net loss. Kroll cannot
assure you that it will generate a profit from continuing operations or that it
will operate profitably in future periods.

        The terms of Kroll's credit facility could restrict its flexibility and
limit its ability to satisfy obligations under its other debt.

        Kroll is subject to operational and financial covenants and other
restrictions under its revolving credit facility. These covenants could limit
its operational flexibility and restrict its ability to borrow additional funds,
if necessary, to finance operations and to make principal and interest payments
on its other debt. In addition, failure to comply with these operational and
financial covenants could result in an event of default under the terms of the
credit facility which, if not cured or waived, could result in amounts borrowed
under the credit facility becoming due and payable. The effect of these
covenants, or Kroll's failure to comply with them, could have a material adverse
effect on its business and financial condition.

        Kroll's inability or failure to comply with governmental regulations and
licensing requirements could have a material adverse effect on its business.

        Kroll's services are subject to various federal, state, local and
foreign laws, including privacy laws. A number of its subsidiaries hold private
investigative licenses from, and their investigative activities are regulated
by, state and local government agencies in various jurisdictions. Kroll also
uses some data from outside sources, including data from third party vendors and
various government and public record services, in performing its services. To
date, applicable laws and regulations have not interfered materially with the
manner in which Kroll obtains information and conducts its operations, including
its access to data used in its business. However, changes in these laws and
regulations, particularly those relating to privacy, could interfere with its
method of operations and access to data and, as a result, have a material
adverse effect on Kroll. If additional restrictions were imposed, they could
have a material adverse effect on Kroll's financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows. Additionally, the laboratory of Kroll's drug testing
subsidiary is certified on the federal level and licensed in a number of states.
If the subsidiary's certification were suspended or lost, it would not be
eligible to

perform testing for various clients, which would have a material adverse effect
on the drug testing services aspect of Kroll's business. In addition, foreign
countries in which Kroll does business have laws and regulations which may
restrict its business. Kroll believes that it currently conducts its activities
and operations in substantial compliance with applicable governmental laws and
regulations.

        Kroll is highly dependent on executive management and other key
employees and its success is largely dependent upon its ability to hire and
retain skilled professionals.

        Kroll relies heavily on its executive management and key employees to
provide its services and for continued business development. Competition for
these personnel is intense. Kroll's business could be materially and adversely
affected if a number of its senior managers or key employees were to leave and
if it were unable to attract and retain qualified replacements.

        Competition for consulting professionals, particularly for personnel
with the specific risk mitigation and other skills necessary to perform the
services which Kroll offers, has caused wages to increase at a rate greater than
the general rate of inflation. Kroll may not be successful in attracting, hiring
and retaining qualified people at favorable rates. Its success is largely
dependent upon the ability to hire and retain skilled professionals.

        The risk mitigation industry is very competitive; Kroll may be unable to
compete favorably.

        Kroll competes with local, regional, national and international firms,
including investigative and security firms and consultants in specialized areas
such as kidnapping. Kroll believes that it is one of the largest companies in
the world that provide a broad array of security and risk mitigation services on
a global basis and that it enjoys strong name recognition in its industry.

        Nevertheless, the markets in which Kroll does, and intends to do,
business are highly competitive. In most service areas in which Kroll operates,
there is at least one competitor that is significantly larger or more
established than Kroll is in the delivery of that individual service. Many of
the national and international accounting firms, along with other companies such
as Forensic Technologies, Inc., Securitas AB, Control Risks Group Limited,
Investigations Group, Inc. and ChoicePoint, Inc., provide consulting services
similar to some of Kroll's services. Some of these firms have indicated an
interest in providing corporate investigation and business intelligence services
similar to Kroll's on a broader scale and may prove to be formidable competitors
if they elect to devote the necessary resources to these competitive businesses.
The accounting firms have significantly larger financial and other resources
than Kroll has and have long-established relationships with their clients, which
also are likely to be clients or prospective clients of Kroll's. In addition,
large multinational security services providers have indicated an interest in
expanding their services to include value-added services such as some of the
risk mitigation services Kroll provides. Competitive conditions could have a
material adverse effect on Kroll's financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows.

        Kroll may be subject to potentially significant liability claims.

        The very nature of Kroll's business exposes it to liability claims in
instances in which its clients suffer losses in spite of Kroll's efforts to
mitigate their risks. Kroll maintains professional liability insurance with a
policy aggregate limit of $15 million including loss and claim expense. If one
or more successful claims substantially exceeded coverage limits, it would have
a material adverse effect on Kroll. Also, in the ordinary course of Kroll's
business, it is subject to claims of third parties other than clients alleging
trespass, invasion of privacy and other tortious conduct by Kroll's
investigators and other personnel, which may not be covered by insurance.
Although Kroll endeavors to minimize the risk of these claims, a substantial
successful claim could have a material adverse effect on it.

        Kroll's business is not predictable and varies from period to period.

        Kroll generally does not have long term contracts with its clients and
its ability to generate net sales is dependent upon obtaining many new projects
each year, most of which are of relatively short duration. As a result, Kroll's
net sales and net income from year-to-year and period-to-period are not
necessarily predictable and historically there has not been a consistent
year-to-year pattern of growth. Period-to-period comparisons within a given year
or between years may not be meaningful or indicative of operating results over a
full fiscal year. The demand for Kroll's services is affected by general
economic conditions and the level of corporate acquisitions and other financial
transactions, and clients reduce their reliance on Kroll's services during
periods when there is a decline in those activities. In addition, Kroll's
operating results are affected by specific market conditions, including, among
other factors specified in this section, increased competition, the mix of
services sold among Kroll's service offerings, Kroll's ability to control costs
and the demand for Kroll's services.

        Kroll will need to use a portion of its cash flow to service its debt.

        As of December 31, 2001, Kroll had total indebtedness (net of notes
discount) of approximately $22.0 million and total shareholders' equity of
approximately $111.1 million. As of December 31, 2001 its debt was approximately
19.8% of its shareholders' equity. In addition, Kroll has a new revolving credit
facility of up to $15 million of senior debt. As of April 26, 2002 Kroll had not
borrowed any amounts under the credit facility.

        Kroll anticipates that its cash interest expense for the year ending
December 31, 2002 will be approximately $2 million. Kroll's adjusted cash flows
from operating activities from continuing operations, excluding one-time
non-recurring charges, would not have been sufficient to fund cash interest
expense for the year ended December 31, 2000, but would have been sufficient to
fund cash interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2001. Kroll expects
to use a portion of its cash flow from operations to pay the principal and
interest on its debt, but Kroll does not believe that servicing its debt will
materially affect its cash available for existing operations and future growth.
However, Kroll cannot assure you that this will be the case.

        Kroll may not be able to obtain additional financing when Kroll needs it
or obtain it on acceptable terms.

        Kroll believes that its current operations and its financing will
generate enough cash flow to meet all of its cash requirements and support its
growth strategy. However, Kroll may need additional capital in order to finance
internal growth or pursue acquisitions. In addition, Kroll may experience
unexpected circumstances, including the occurrence of any of the risk factors
discussed in this section, which may have a material adverse effect on its cash
flow and require it to obtain additional capital. Kroll may decide to sell
additional shares of common stock to obtain additional capital. If Kroll sells
more shares, the price of its stock may decline significantly and your ownership
may be substantially diluted. If Kroll requires additional capital, it may have
to borrow funds under new credit facilities or issue equity, equity-related or
debt securities. Kroll cannot assure you that additional financing will be
available, or if it is, whether it will be on acceptable terms. Kroll's
inability to obtain any needed financing, or the terms on which it may be
available, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition,
results of operations and cash flow.

        Kroll's code of regulations contains provisions that allow for the
indemnification and exculpation of its directors and officers.

        Kroll's code of regulations provides that Kroll will indemnify any
current or former director, officer, employee or agent against expenses,
including judgments and fines, if such director, officer, employee or agent
acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of Kroll. In addition, if the reincorporation merger
agreement is adopted, following its reincorporation in Delaware, Kroll's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws will also provide for indemnification
for its directors and officers and, in addition, will provide that a director of
Kroll will not be personally liable to Kroll or its stockholders for monetary
damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. However, a director will
remain liable for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to Kroll or its
stockholders, for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve
intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, for unlawful payment of
dividends or unlawful stock purchase or redemption, or for any transaction from
which the director derived any improper personal benefit.

        Kroll does not intend to pay dividends.

        Kroll intends to retain future earnings, if any, that may be generated
from its operations to help finance the growth and development of its business,
and Kroll does not plan to pay cash dividends to its shareholders for the
foreseeable future. Furthermore, Kroll is prohibited from paying cash dividends
by the terms of its senior secured subordinated convertible notes.

        Jules B. Kroll, who currently owns approximately 13% of Kroll's
outstanding common stock, will have significant influence over the management
and direction of Kroll.

        Mr. Kroll currently owns approximately 13% of the outstanding shares of
Kroll common stock and is the Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of
Kroll. As a result, Mr. Kroll will have significant influence over the
management and direction of Kroll, including the election of directors,
appointment of management and approval of actions requiring the approval of
shareholders.

        Kroll's articles of incorporation and its debt contain provisions that
could deter acquisition by a third party.

        Kroll's articles of incorporation provide its board of directors with
the authority to issue preferred stock. The issuance of preferred stock may have
the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, may
adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of Kroll capital
stock and may discourage, delay or prevent a takeover attempt that a shareholder
might consider in its best interest. If the reincorporation merger agreement is
approved and adopted, following its reincorporation in Delaware, Kroll's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws will contain provisions, in addition to
granting the board of directors the authority to issue preferred stock, that may
be deemed to have anti-takeover effects and may discourage, delay or prevent a
takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in its best interest. These
provisions include: (1) the requirement that there be three classes of directors
and that their terms be staggered; (2) the requirement that a stockholder comply
with specified procedures, including advance written notice, before bringing
matters, including the nomination of directors, before a stockholders' meeting;
(3) the specific denial of stockholders' ability to take action by written
consent, and (4) the restriction of the right to call special meetings to only
the Executive Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or the board of
directors pursuant to a board resolution.

        A change in control would be an event of default under Kroll's revolving
credit facility. In addition, until November 14, 2003, Kroll cannot enter into a
transaction that would result in a change of control of Kroll without the prior
written consent of holders of a majority of its senior secured

subordinated convertible notes. Even if the noteholders consent, upon a change
in control of Kroll, the notes would become immediately due and payable. These
events would add to the cost of acquisition, which could deter a third party
from acquiring Kroll.

        Future sales of Kroll common stock in the public market could lower the
stock price.

        Kroll may, in the future, sell additional shares of its common stock in
subsequent public offerings. Kroll may also issue additional shares of its
common stock to finance future acquisitions, including acquisitions larger than
those Kroll has done in the past through the issuance of equity securities.
Additionally, a substantial number of shares of Kroll common stock is reserved
for issuance pursuant to stock options and upon conversion of its senior secured
subordinated convertible notes. The antidilution provisions of the notes
regarding price protection could result in additional shares of Kroll common
stock being issued, which would increase the number of shares of common stock
outstanding on a fully diluted basis and could reduce the market price for Kroll
common stock.

        Kroll cannot predict the size of future issuances of its common stock or
the effect, if any, that future issuances of its common stock will have on the
market price of its common stock. The issuance of substantial amounts of Kroll
common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition or upon
the exercise of stock options or the conversion of the notes), or the perception
that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for
its common stock.

        Kroll's stock price has been highly volatile. You could lose all or part
of the value of your Kroll common stock.

        The market price of Kroll common stock has fluctuated and may continue
to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be
beyond Kroll's control, including:

        o       sales of Kroll common stock by shareholders because Kroll's
                business profile does not fit their investment objectives;
        o       sales of Kroll common stock by Ontrack shareholders, including
                Messrs. Rogers, Pence and Stevens, each of whom has informed
                Ontrack of his intention, consistent with his long standing
                desire to diversify his holdings, to sell Kroll common stock he
                receives in the merger from time to time as market conditions
                are favorable and in accordance with the volume limitations
                prescribed by Rule 145 and all other legal requirements;
        o       actual or anticipated fluctuations in Kroll's operating results;
        o       changes in earnings estimated by securities analysts or Kroll's
                ability to meet those estimates;
        o       the operating and stock price performance of other comparable
                companies;
        o       developments and publicity regarding Kroll's industry; and
        o       general economic conditions.

        In addition, the stock market in general has experienced volatility that
has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies.
These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of Kroll
common stock, regardless of Kroll's actual performance, and could enhance the
effect of any fluctuations that do relate to its operating results.

                        COMPARATIVE PER SHARE INFORMATION

        The following table presents:

        o       Historical income from continuing operations per share and book
                value per share data for Kroll and Ontrack;

        o       Unaudited pro forma combined per share data of Kroll as if the
                merger had occurred on January 1, 2001; and

        o       Ontrack's unaudited pro forma equivalent per share data.

        The pro forma combined data has been calculated by combining the
historical statement of operations and balance sheet data of Kroll and Ontrack
and adjusting those figures to reflect the impact of purchase accounting by
Kroll and the issuance in the merger of 7,638,748 shares of Kroll common stock.
This assumption is based on an exchange ratio of 0.7389, which is calculated
using an average stock price of Kroll of $16.9160, equal to the average of Kroll
stock prices beginning two days before the public announcement of the merger
agreement and ending two days later, and on 10,338,000 shares of Ontrack common
stock outstanding at December 31, 2001. The actual exchange ratio for the merger
will be determined based on the volume weighted average price of Kroll's common
stock over a period of 20 consecutive trading days ending three trading days
before the vote of the Ontrack shareholders at the Ontrack special meeting.

        The Ontrack equivalent pro forma data shows the effect of the merger
from the perspective of an owner of Ontrack shares. The data was calculated by
multiplying the pro forma combined data by an assumed exchange ratio of 0.7389.
This exchange ratio was calculated to be the fraction of one share of Kroll
common stock equal to the product of one and a fraction, the numerator of which
is $12.50 and the denominator of which is an assumed average stock price of
Kroll common stock of $16.9160. The actual exchange ratio for the merger will be
determined as described above.

        Neither Kroll nor Ontrack paid cash dividends during the period covered
by this table.

      merger of 0.7389.

      The pro forma combined per share data does not purport to represent what
Kroll's financial position or results of operations would actually have been had
the merger occurred on January 1, 2001 or to project Kroll's financial position

                ONTRACK DATA INTERNATIONAL, INC. SPECIAL MEETING

Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus

        This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being furnished to Ontrack
shareholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies by Ontrack's board
of directors to adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger.

Date, Time and Place

        The special meeting of Ontrack shareholders will be held on __________,
2002, at ________, Central Daylight Time, at ONTRACK Data International, Inc.,
9023 Columbine Road, Eden Prairie, MN 55347.

Purposes of the Ontrack Special Meeting

        At the Ontrack special meeting, Ontrack shareholders will be asked to
consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt and approve the Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization, dated as of April 1, 2002, by and among Kroll, ODI Acquisition,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kroll, and Ontrack, as amended, pursuant to which
ODI Acquisition would be merged with and into Ontrack and Ontrack would become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Kroll. If the merger is completed, Ontrack
shareholders will become Kroll shareholders. For each share of Ontrack common
stock owned immediately prior to the merger, Ontrack shareholders will be
entitled to receive a partial share of Kroll common stock calculated to have a
value equal to $12.50 based on the volume weighted average price of Kroll common
stock over a period of 20 consecutive trading days ending three trading days
before the vote of the Ontrack shareholders at the Ontrack special meeting. If
this average price is $19.3886 or more, Ontrack shareholders will receive 0.6447
of a share of Kroll common stock. If this average price is $15.8634 or less,
Ontrack shareholders will receive 0.7880 of a share of Kroll common stock.
However, if this average price is less than $15.8634, the Ontrack board of
directors can terminate the merger agreement unless Kroll agrees to deliver to
Ontrack shareholders Kroll common stock calculated to have a value equal to
$12.50, based on the volume weighted average price of Kroll common stock over
the period of 20 consecutive trading days ending three trading days before the
vote of the Ontrack shareholders at the Ontrack special meeting, for each share
of Ontrack common stock.

        Ontrack shareholders will also be asked to consider and vote upon a
proposal to adopt and approve the Ontrack 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. If
the merger is completed, the plan will be terminated and all participants will
receive shares of Ontrack common stock under the plan, which will in turn
automatically be exchanged for a number of shares of Kroll common stock
determined on the basis of the exchange ratio provisions of the merger
agreement. However, the approval of the Ontrack shareholders is necessary for
the plan to qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" under Section 423 of
the Internal Revenue Code. If shareholder approval is not obtained, the plan
will not qualify under Section 423, and the exercise of purchase rights to
purchase shares under the plan upon completion of the merger will result in
participants recognizing as ordinary income the difference between the fair
market value of the stock on the date of exercise and the purchase price.

at the Ontrack special meeting. The record date has been set at ________, 2002.
As of the close of business on the record date, there were ________ shares of
Ontrack common stock outstanding and entitled to vote, held of record by
_________

__________ beneficial owners of Ontrack common stock. A majority, or ________ of
these shares, present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a

Voting of Proxies

        The Ontrack proxy accompanying this joint proxy statement/prospectus is
solicited on behalf of the Ontrack board of directors for use at the Ontrack
special meeting. Ontrack shareholders are requested to complete, date and sign
the accompanying proxy and promptly return it in the accompanying envelope or
otherwise mail it to Ontrack. All properly executed proxies that Ontrack
receives prior to the vote at the Ontrack special meeting, and that are not
revoked, will be voted at the Ontrack special meeting in accordance with the
instructions indicated on the proxies. If no direction is indicated, all
properly executed proxies will be voted in favor of the adoption and approval of
the merger agreement and the merger and the adoption and approval of the Ontrack
2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

        Ontrack does not presently intend to bring any other business before the
Ontrack special meeting and, to its knowledge, no other matters will be brought
before the Ontrack special meeting. If there is any other business that is
properly brought before the Ontrack special meeting, however, the proxies will
be voted on such matters in the judgment of the persons voting the proxies.
Unless an Ontrack shareholder has given an irrevocable proxy pursuant to a
voting agreement, an Ontrack shareholder may revoke a proxy at any time before
it is exercised at the Ontrack special meeting by:

        o       delivering to the secretary of Ontrack a written notice, bearing
                a date later than the date of the previous proxy, stating that
                the proxy is revoked;

        o       signing and delivering a proxy relating to the same shares and
                bearing a later date than the date of the previous proxy prior
                to the vote at the Ontrack special meeting; or

        o       attending the Ontrack special meeting and voting in person.

Vote Required

        Adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger by
Ontrack's shareholders is required under Minnesota law. This approval requires
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Ontrack
common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Michael W. Rogers and John E.
Pence, each of whom is a director of Ontrack, and their respective affiliates,
have signed agreements, and granted irrevocable proxies to Kroll, to vote for
the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger. These
agreements and proxies cover an aggregate of approximately 27% of the
outstanding shares of Ontrack common stock. All other directors and executive
officers of Ontrack, excluding Messrs. Rogers and Pence, own approximately an
additional 17% of the outstanding shares of common stock. Accordingly, all
directors and executive officers own an approximate total of 44% of all
outstanding shares of Ontrack common stock. As of the record date and the date
of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Kroll owns no shares of Ontrack common
stock. See "The Voting Agreements."

        Approval of the Ontrack 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Ontrack common
stock present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the Ontrack special
meeting. The voting agreements and proxies entered into and delivered by Messrs.
Rogers and Pence require them, and entitle Kroll, to vote for the adoption and
approval of the plan. See "Ontrack Proposal No. 2 - Approval of the Ontrack 2001
Employee Stock Purchase Plan."

Quorum; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

        The required quorum for the transaction of business at the Ontrack
shareholder meeting is a majority of the shares of Ontrack common stock issued
and outstanding on the record date. Abstentions will be included in determining
the number of shares present and voting at the meeting for the purpose of
determining the presence of a quorum. If a broker indicates on the proxy that it
does not have discretionary authority to vote on a proposal, those shares will
not be considered as present and entitled to vote. Because adoption and approval
of the merger agreement and the merger requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Ontrack common stock entitled to vote on
the merger agreement and merger, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the
same effect as votes against the merger agreement and the merger.

        Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against the adoption and
approval of the Ontrack 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, but broker non-votes
will have no effect on the adoption and approval of the plan. The actions
proposed in this joint proxy statement/prospectus are not matters that can be
voted on by brokers holding shares for beneficial owners without the owners'
specific instructions. Accordingly, Ontrack shareholders are urged to return the
enclosed proxy card marked to indicate their votes.

Voting Shares Held By Brokers In Street Name

        Brokers will vote shares beneficially owned by Ontrack shareholders only
if Ontrack shareholders provide instructions on how to vote by following the
instructions provided to them by their broker. If Ontrack shareholders do not
provide their broker with voting instructions, their shares will not be voted at
the Ontrack special meeting and it will have the same effect as voting against
adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger. Broker non-votes
will have no effect on the adoption and approval of the Ontrack 2001 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan.

Solicitation of Proxies and Expenses

        Ontrack is soliciting proxies for the Ontrack special meeting from
Ontrack shareholders and Kroll is soliciting proxies for the Kroll annual
meeting from its shareholders. Each company will share equally all fees and
expenses, other than their respective accountants' and attorneys' fees, incurred
in relation to the filing and printing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus
and the registration statement on Form S-4, of which it forms a part. Kroll has
paid for the SEC registration fee with respect to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, and each party will bear the expenses of mailing this
joint proxy statement/prospectus to its own shareholders. Additionally, the
merger agreement provides that under certain circumstances, one party may be
required to pay the expenses of the other party in connection with the merger.

        Other than the costs shared with Kroll or required to be paid by Kroll
under the circumstances described in the merger agreement, Ontrack will bear the
cost of soliciting of proxies from its shareholders. In addition to solicitation
by mail, the directors, officers and employees of Ontrack may solicit proxies
from Ontrack shareholders by telephone, facsimile or in person. Following the
original mailing of the proxies and other soliciting materials, Ontrack will
request brokers, custodians, nominees and other record holders to forward copies
of the proxy and other soliciting materials to persons for whom they hold shares
of Ontrack common stock and to request authority for the exercise of proxies. In
such cases, Ontrack, upon the request of the record holders, will reimburse
those holders for their reasonable expenses.

Dissenters' Rights

        Ontrack shareholders are entitled to dissent from the merger and,
subject to various conditions, receive cash for their Ontrack shares if the
merger is completed. To do this, dissenting Ontrack shareholders must follow
required procedures, which are described in detail in "The Merger - Dissenters'
Rights of Ontrack Shareholders."

Ontrack Board Recommendation

        The Ontrack board of directors has determined that the merger agreement
and the merger are in the best interests of Ontrack shareholders. The Ontrack
board of directors has unanimously approved the terms and conditions of the
merger agreement and the merger and recommends that Ontrack shareholders vote
for adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the consummation of the
merger. In considering this recommendation, Ontrack shareholders should be aware
that some of Ontrack's directors, officers and employees will receive benefits
as a result of the merger that will be in addition to or different from benefits
received by Ontrack shareholders generally. See "The Merger - Interests of
Ontrack's Directors, Officers and Employees in the Merger."

        The Ontrack board of directors has also unanimously approved the Ontrack
2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and recommends that Ontrack shareholders vote
for adoption and approval of the 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

        For information regarding instructions for the exchange of Ontrack
common stock share certificates, Ontrack shareholders should read the section
entitled "The Merger Agreement - Merger Consideration - Exchange of Ontrack
Stock Certificates for Kroll Stock Certificates."

        The matters to be considered at the Ontrack shareholder meeting are of
great importance. Accordingly, Ontrack shareholders are urged to read and
carefully consider the information presented and incorporated by reference in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and to complete, date, sign and promptly
return the enclosed proxy in the enclosed postage-paid envelope.

        Ontrack shareholders should not send any stock certificates with their
proxy cards.

Merger" beginning on page.

        Kroll's board of directors has unanimously approved the slate of seven
nominees proposed for election to the Kroll board of directors and unanimously

Approval of Kroll's Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan."

        Kroll's board of directors has unanimously approved the appointment of

to ratify this appointment. See "Kroll Proposal No. 6 - Ratification of
Appointment of Independent Public Accountants."

Voting and Revocation of Proxies; Shares Held in "Street Name"

        Kroll shareholders may vote their Kroll shares by attending the Kroll
annual meeting and voting their shares in person, or by completing the enclosed
proxy card, signing and dating it and mailing it in the enclosed postage-prepaid
envelope. If a written proxy card is signed by a Kroll shareholder and returned
without instructions, the shares represented by the proxy will be voted FOR the
proposals of the Kroll annual meeting.

        Kroll shareholders that have questions or requests for assistance in
completing and submitting proxy cards should contact the General Counsel of
Kroll, at the following address and telephone number:

                      Kroll Inc.
                      900 Third Avenue
                      New York, New York  10022
                      Attention: Sabrina Perel, Vice President, General
                                 Counsel and Secretary
                      Phone No.: (212) 593-1000

        Votes cast by proxy or in person at the Kroll annual meeting, will be
tabulated and will determine whether or not a quorum is present. Abstentions and
broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is
present. Because approval of the issuance of shares in connection with the
merger and approval and adoption of the Agreement and Plan of Merger providing
for the reincorporation of Kroll in Delaware each requires the affirmative vote
of a majority of shareholders entitled to exercise a majority of the voting
power of Kroll, abstentions and broker non-votes will have same effect as
negative votes. Because the election of directors requires the affirmative vote
of a plurality of the votes cast at the meeting, abstentions and broker
non-votes will not affect the outcome of this election. Because approval and
adoption of the amendment to the 1996 Stock Option Plan and the Amended and
Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan and ratification of Deloitte & Touche as
Kroll's independent public accountants each requires the vote of a majority of
the votes actually cast at the annual meeting, abstentions and broker non-votes
will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on these matters.

        Kroll shareholders who hold their Kroll shares in "street name," meaning
in the name of a bank, broker or other record holder, must either direct the
record holder of their shares how to vote their shares or obtain a proxy from
the record holder to vote at the Kroll annual meeting.

        Under the applicable rules of the Nasdaq National Market, brokers who
hold shares in street names for customers who are the beneficial owners of those
shares are prohibited from giving a proxy to vote those customers' shares with
respect to the matters to be voted on at the Kroll annual meeting in the absence
of specific instructions from the customer. Brokers are also required to request
these instructions from beneficial owners of Kroll shares.

        All properly delivered proxies that are not revoked will be voted at the
annual meeting as instructed on those proxies. A shareholder who delivers a
proxy may revoke it at any time before it is voted, by:

        o       delivering a proxy bearing a later date;

        o       giving written notice of revocation to any of the persons named
                as proxies or to Kroll addressed to the Secretary; or

        o       attending the special meeting and voting in person.

        The Kroll board of directors is unaware of any other matters that
properly may be presented for action at the Kroll annual meeting. However, if
other matters do come before the annual meeting or any adjournment or
postponement of the annual meeting, proxies will be voted on those matters in
accordance with the discretion of the proxies.

Solicitation of Proxies

        Kroll may use its directors, officers and employees to solicit proxies.
These people will not receive any additional compensation for their services,
but will be reimbursed for their out-of-pocket expenses. Kroll will reimburse
banks, brokers, nominees, custodians and fiduciaries for their reasonable
expenses in forwarding copies of the proxy soliciting material to the beneficial
owners of Kroll common stock and in obtaining voting instructions from those
owners. Kroll and Ontrack will share equally in the expenses of printing this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, but Kroll will pay the expenses of mailing
this joint proxy statement/prospectus to Kroll shareholders.

                                   THE MERGER

General

        This section, together with the following section, describes the
material aspects of the proposed merger, including the merger agreement, as
amended. These discussions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the
merger agreement, which we have attached as Annex A-1 to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, and the amendment to the merger agreement, which we have
attached as Annex A-2 to this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and to the other
agreements and documents that are discussed in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and that are filed as exhibits to the registration
statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part. You
should read the merger agreement, as amended, in its entirety as it is the legal
document that governs the merger.

Background of the Merger

        From mid-1998 through late 1999, Ontrack's management and board of
directors considered strategic partnerships and business combinations, as well
as the merits of operating as a stand alone company, as alternatives to enhance
shareholder value.

        From June through August 1999, representatives of Kroll and
representatives of Ontrack spoke several times about the possibility of a joint
marketing venture. These conversations did not result in an agreement. In July
and August 1999, Mr. Michael W. Rogers, then President and Chief Executive
Officer of Ontrack, and Jules B. Kroll, then Chairman of the Board and Co-Chief
Executive Officer of Kroll, discussed the potential interests of the two
companies in a strategic relationship, including a possible business combination
transaction. None of these discussions resulted in an agreement.

        In late 1999, Ontrack signed a merger agreement with Legato Systems,
Inc., of Palo Alto California, California and then terminated the agreement in
January 2000 immediately following Legato's announcement that it would restate
its results of operations for the third quarter of 1999 and the resulting
significant decline in the value of Legato common stock.

        In May 2001, Ontrack engaged RBC Dain Rauscher Inc., a member company of
RBC Capital Markets, to explore strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder
value and improve shareholder liquidity. RBC and Ontrack identified several
potential strategic and financial partners, including potential acquirors and
acquisition candidates. At various times thereafter, Ontrack and RBC entered
into confidentiality agreements with and had discussions with many of these
candidates. However, prior to October 2001, such discussions were preliminary in
nature.

        On August 24, 2001, Michael Beber, Executive Vice President of Strategic
Development of Kroll, called Tony S. Cueva, Vice President North American Sales
of Ontrack, to determine if Ontrack would be interested in reinitiating
discussions regarding strategic opportunities or transactions between the two
companies. Mr. Cueva indicated that Ben F. Allen, Ontrack's new President and
Chief Executive Officer, was interested in exploring opportunities with
companies that could give Ontrack more exposure to law firm clients and
suggested that Mr. Beber contact Mr. Allen directly.

        In mid-September 2001, Mr. Beber and Mr. Allen had a telephone
conversation about possible strategic opportunities.

        On October 1, 2001, Messrs. Allen and Cueva met with Mr. Beber, Tim
Mitchell, Director of Strategic Alliances of Kroll, and Harry Schessel, then the
practice leader for Kroll's technology services group, in Eden Prairie to
discuss strategic opportunities between the two companies. They also discussed

the possibility of a business combination between the two companies, and agreed
that Mr. Allen and Mr. Beber would have discussions with members of management
of Ontrack and Kroll to determine whether there was any interest in pursuing a
possible business combination.

        On October 10, 2001, Mr. Allen and Mr. Beber had a telephone
conversation in which they agreed to explore, in greater detail, the possibility
of a business combination.

        On October 12, 2001, Kroll and Ontrack executed a confidentiality
agreement.

        On October 22, 2001, the Ontrack board held a regular meeting at which
Mr. Allen, Mr. Skiba, Mr. Bujan, Mr. Rogers and attorneys from Robins, Kaplan,
Miller & Ciresi L.L.P., outside legal counsel to Ontrack, were present. Mr.
Rogers updated the board of directors regarding the status of discussions with
Kroll, provided the board with an overview of the business and operations of
Kroll, and discussed the status of other possible strategic partners or
financial buyers.

        On November 1 and 2, 2001, Mr. Rogers, Roger D. Shober, a director of
Ontrack, Mr. Allen, Thomas P. Skiba, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
of Ontrack, John M. Bujan, Senior Vice President, Strategic Planning and
Corporate Development and Secretary of Ontrack, and Steve P. O'Donnell from RBC
met with Mr. Kroll, the Executive Chairman of Kroll, Michael G. Cherkasky,
President and Chief Executive Officer of Kroll, Mr. Beber and Mr. Mitchell to
discuss the strategic fit of the companies and the potential opportunities that
might result from a business combination.

        On November 6, 2001, Mr. O'Donnell and Ms. Angela M. Busch from RBC and
Mr. Beber had a telephone conversation to determine an agenda for a conference
call between Ontrack, RBC and Kroll scheduled for November 8, 2001.

        Also on November 6, 2001, the Ontrack board met telephonically to, among
other matters, obtain an update from Mr. Rogers regarding discussions with
Kroll.

        On November 8, 2001, Mr. Rogers, Mr. Allen, Mr. Skiba, Mr. Bujan, Mr.
O'Donnell and Ms. Busch had a conference call with Mr. Cherkasky, Mr. Beber and
Mr. Mitchell to confirm their mutual interest in advancing their discussions
and to determine a timeline for further due diligence, beginning negotiations
and related actions.

        In November 2001, Kroll and Ontrack exchanged preliminary due diligence
requests and provided requested information and documents.

        On November 15, 2001, Kroll retained Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn as its
financial advisor in connection with its proposed acquisition of Ontrack.

        On November 19, 2001, Kroll retained Torys LLP to act as its outside
counsel in connection with its proposed acquisition of Ontrack.

        On November 20, 2001, Mr. Beber and Michael Petrullo, Acting Chief
Financial Officer, Vice President and Controller of Kroll met with
representatives from Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn to review a proposed transaction
with Ontrack and negotiating strategies.

        On November 26 and 27, 2001, Mr. Beber, Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Petrullo
and representatives of Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn, met with Messrs. Rogers,
Allen and Skiba and representatives of RBC in Eden Prairie to conduct
preliminary due diligence on Ontrack and Kroll.

        In early December, 2001, Ontrack provided to Kroll a list of terms for
an acquisition proposal that Ontrack would be willing to consider.

        On December 4 and 5, 2001, senior managers and officers of Kroll met
with representatives of Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn and Torys to discuss a
structure for a proposed acquisition of Ontrack, including pricing, structure
and negotiating approach.

        On December 5, 2001, the Ontrack board met telephonically to, among
other matters, obtain an update from Mr. Rogers regarding RBC's exploration of
various strategic alternatives.

        On December 10, 2001, the Kroll board of directors held a regularly
scheduled meeting. Mr. Cherkasky and Mr. Kroll, who are also directors of Kroll,
discussed with the board the business of Ontrack and the benefits to Kroll and
its shareholders of a business combination with Ontrack. Management advised the
Kroll board of directors that they would continue to pursue a transaction with
Ontrack and would keep the board apprised of their progress.

        On December 11, 2001, Mr. Beber delivered to RBC a written proposal on
behalf of Kroll to acquire Ontrack, which, among other provisions, provided for
a proposed per share purchase price of approximately $7.50.

        On December 11, 2001, Ms. Busch telephoned Mr. Beber and Dennis Galgano
of Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn to inform them that Ontrack considered Kroll's
offer inadequate.

        On December 12, 2001, Mr. Beber submitted a revised proposal on behalf
of Kroll, which, among other provisions, provided for a proposed per share
purchase price of approximately $8.78.

        On December 14, 2001, Mr. O'Donnell and Ms. Busch telephoned Mr. Beber
and Mr. Galgano to discuss the potential terms of a possible business
combination.

        On December 15, 2001, the Ontrack board of directors met with Messrs.
Allen, Skiba, Bujan and Fabel and representatives of RBC and Robins, Kaplan,
Miller & Ciresi to obtain an update on the status of negotiations.

        On December 17, 2001, representatives of RBC approached a number of
potential financial buyers to determine whether there was any interest in a
possible acquisition of Ontrack.

        On December 18, 2001, Mr. O'Donnell, Ms. Busch, Mr. Beber and Mr.
Galgano discussed the terms of the proposed business combination between Kroll
and Ontrack via email and telephone. The terms discussed included a proposed per
share purchase price of approximately $9.25. Similar communications between
these parties occurred on December 21, 2001 and included a proposed per share
purchase price of approximately $9.50.

        On December 22, 2001, the Ontrack board met with Messrs. Allen, Skiba,

        On April 1, 2002 the Ontrack board of directors held a special meeting

conditions of the merger agreement and related documents. RBC rendered its oral
opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of that date and subject to
the assumptions, qualifications and limitations to be set forth in its written
opinion, the per share merger consideration under the exchange ratio provisions
of the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders
of Ontrack common stock. See Annex B for the full text of the written opinion.
Following these events, the Ontrack board of directors unanimously approved the

Recommendation of the Board of Directors of Ontrack; Reasons of Ontrack for the
Merger

        Ontrack's board of directors has unanimously approved the merger
agreement and the merger as fair to, and in the best interests of, Ontrack and
its shareholders and unanimously recommends that Ontrack shareholders vote for
the approval and adoption of the merger agreement.

        In making its decision, the board of directors consulted with its legal
and financial advisors and considered a number of factors, as described below.
The Ontrack board of directors' decision to approve the merger agreement and the
merger was based in significant part upon its evaluation of Kroll, its
assessment of the strategic benefits of the merger and the fact that the
consideration to be received by Ontrack shareholders in the transaction was fair
from a financial point of view. Strategic benefits of the merger that the
Ontrack board of directors believes will contribute to the success of the
combined entity include:

        o       the opportunity to benefit from Kroll's greater size; and

        o       the opportunity for improved revenue prospects with the addition
                of new customers and the ability to obtain greater revenue from
                existing customers.

        The Ontrack board of directors further evaluated the merits of Kroll
common stock and concluded that shares of Kroll common stock:

        o       have appreciation potential in the long term; and

        o       represent a more liquid investment than Ontrack common stock and
                provide greater market capitalization as compared to that of
                Ontrack's common stock and, as a consequence, provide a greater
                opportunity to Ontrack's larger shareholders, including members
                of the board of directors, to diversify their holdings.

        In the course of its deliberations, the Ontrack board of directors
reviewed with Ontrack's management a number of other factors important to the
merger, including:

        o       the fact that the merger would provide Ontrack's shareholders
                approximately a 27% premium compared to the closing price of
                Ontrack common stock on March 28, 2002, the last trading day
                before the board meeting;

        o       the fact that the exchange ratio represents an increase in the
                volume weighted average price-based value of Kroll common stock
                to be received by Ontrack shareholders from Kroll's December
                2001 proposed exchange ratio;

        o       the price to be paid per share of Ontrack common stock under the
                exchange ratio provisions of the merger agreement, and the
                relationship between the market value of Kroll common

                stock to be issued in exchange for each share of Ontrack common
                stock and a comparison of comparable merger transactions;

        o       financial analysis and other information with respect to the
                companies presented by RBC in a presentation to the Ontrack
                board of directors, including RBC's opinion that, as of April 1,
                2002 and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and
                limitations set forth in its written opinion, the per share
                merger consideration under the exchange ratio provisions of the
                merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to
                the holders of Ontrack common stock;

        o       the likelihood of realizing superior benefits through
                alternative business strategies, including remaining an
                independent company and continuing to execute on its existing
                business plan;

        o       historical information concerning Kroll's business, prospects,
                financial performance and condition, operations, technology,
                management and competitive position, including public reports
                concerning results of operations during the most recent fiscal
                year filed with the SEC;

        o       Ontrack management's view of the financial condition, results of
                operations and business of Kroll before and after giving effect
                to the merger;

        o       current financial market conditions and historical market
                prices, volatility and trading information with respect to
                Ontrack common stock and Kroll common stock;

        o       the board's view that the transaction structure would allow
                Ontrack shareholders to participate in the potential upside of
                the combined company;

        o       the belief that the terms of the merger agreement, including the
                parties' representations, warranties and covenants and the
                conditions to their respective obligations, are reasonable;

        o       the terms of the voting agreements and proxies under which
                holders of approximately 27% of Ontrack's outstanding common
                stock have committed, and have granted irrevocable proxies to
                Kroll, to vote in favor of the merger agreement and the merger;

        o       that Mr. Allen will join Kroll's board of directors;

        o       that Kroll will continue to operate and grow Ontrack's business
                as a separate division;

        o       the expected tax treatment of the merger;

        o       the impact of the merger on Ontrack's customers and employees;
                and

        o       discussions with management and financial and legal advisors as
                to the results of the due diligence investigation of Kroll's
                business.

        Ontrack's board of directors believed that these factors, including the
board's review of the terms of the merger agreement, supported the board's
recommendation of the merger when viewed with the risks and potential benefits
of the merger.

        The Ontrack board of directors also considered risks arising in
connection with the merger, including:

        o       the potential disruption of Ontrack's business that might result
                from employee and customer uncertainty and lack of focus
                following announcement of the merger;

        o       the risk associated with receiving Kroll common stock, including
                the risk that its value might diminish and the potential impact
                on Kroll's stock price as a result of sales of Kroll stock by
                Ontrack shareholders, including Ontrack affiliates, following
                the merger;

        o       the possibility that the merger might not be completed;

        o       the risk that Kroll might fail to meet projected growth rates
                and analyst expectations and that Kroll's stock price might
                decline substantially prior or subsequent to closing;

        o       the effects of the public announcement of the merger on
                Ontrack's sales and operating results, Ontrack's ability to
                attract and retain key management, marketing and technical
                personnel and the progress of certain of its development
                projects;

        o       the risk that the announcement of the merger could result in
                decisions by customers to cancel or delay purchases of products
                or services of Ontrack or Kroll;

        o       the risk associated with attempting to integrate Kroll's
                operations, products and services with Ontrack's operations,
                products and services, including the risk that the benefits
                sought to be achieved by the merger will not be achieved;

        o       the risks associated with entering into a non-solicitation
                agreement with Kroll regarding potential alternative
                transactions;

        o       the risks associated with agreeing to a break-up fee of
                $4,200,000 payable to Kroll under certain circumstances and the
                potential effect of the termination fee in discouraging
                competing offers to acquire Ontrack, although the board of
                directors did not believe that any competing offer would be
                forthcoming;

        o       the risks associated with Messrs. Rogers and Pence entering into
                the voting agreements and proxies and the potential effects on
                the ability to enter into and consummate other acquisition
                proposals;

        o       the fact that directors, officers and employees of Ontrack will
                receive benefits that are greater than or in addition to those
                received by Ontrack shareholders generally; and

        o       other risks described under the caption "Risk Factors".

        In the view of the Ontrack board of directors, these risks were not
sufficient, either individually or in the aggregate, to outweigh the advantages
of the proposed merger in the manner in which it was proposed. In addition, in
the view of the Ontrack board of directors, the inclusion of the
non-solicitation agreement, termination fee and the voting agreements and
proxies, together with the limited circumstances under which Ontrack could
consider and negotiate other acquisition proposals, was consistent with the
exercise of their fiduciary obligations under applicable law. These provisions
were a condition to Kroll's agreeing to enter into the proposed transaction.

        The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by
the Ontrack board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but is believed
to include all material factors considered by the Ontrack board of directors. In
view of the wide variety of factors, both positive and negative, considered

by the Ontrack board of directors, the Ontrack board of directors did not find
it practical to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to
the specific factors considered or necessarily reach a conclusion as to these
factors. Based on the totality of the information and factors considered, the
Ontrack board of directors believed and continues to believe that the merger is
in the best interests of Ontrack and its shareholders and continues to recommend
approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger.

Opinion of Financial Advisor to Ontrack

        On April 1, 2002, RBC Dain Rauscher Inc., a member company of RBC
Capital Markets, rendered its written opinion to Ontrack's board of directors
that, as of that date and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and
limitations set forth in its opinion, the per share merger consideration, as
defined below, was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
Ontrack's common stock. The full text of the opinion of RBC is attached to this
joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B and this summary of the opinion is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion by RBC.
Ontrack shareholders are urged to read the opinion of RBC carefully and in its
entirety.

        RBC's opinion was provided for the information and assistance of
Ontrack's board of directors in connection with its consideration of the merger.
The terms of the merger agreement and exchange ratio in the merger, however,
were determined through negotiations between Ontrack and Kroll, and were
approved by Ontrack's board of directors.

        RBC's opinion does not address the relative merits of the merger as
compared to other transactions or business strategies that might be available to
Ontrack, nor does it address the underlying business decision of Ontrack's board
of directors to engage in the merger. RBC's opinion and presentation to
Ontrack's board of directors were only two of many factors taken into
consideration by Ontrack's board of directors in making its determination to
approve the merger agreement. RBC's opinion does not constitute a recommendation
to Ontrack shareholders as to how they should vote with respect to the merger.

        RBC's opinion addresses solely the fairness, from a financial point of
view, of the per share merger consideration to the holders of Ontrack's common
stock and does not address any other terms or agreements related to the merger.
As used in this section and the opinion of RBC, the term "per share merger
consideration" refers to the amount of Kroll common stock that each share of
Ontrack common stock will be converted into at the closing of the merger under
the exchange ratio provisions of the merger agreement, which are described in
"The Merger Agreement - Merger Consideration."

        In rendering its opinion, and after discussions with the management of
each of Ontrack and Kroll, RBC assumed that each company would perform
substantially in accordance with publicly available institutional investment
research estimates, although RBC did not express any opinion as to the actual
estimates or the assumptions on which they were based. In addition, after
discussions with Kroll's management, RBC assumed that the mean estimates for
2002 contained in Kroll's publicly-available February 26, 2002 investor
presentation were reasonably prepared on a basis that reflected the best
currently available estimates and judgments of Kroll's management as to Kroll's
financial performance for the balance of 2002. RBC did not

express any opinion as to these estimates and judgments or the assumptions on
which they were based.

        In rendering its opinion, RBC assumed and relied upon the accuracy and
completeness of the financial, legal, tax, operating, and other information
provided to it by Ontrack and Kroll, including, without limitation, the
financial statements and related notes of Ontrack and Kroll. RBC did not assume
responsibility for independently verifying and did not independently verify this
information. RBC did not assume any responsibility to perform, and did not
perform, an independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the respective assets
or liabilities of Ontrack or Kroll, and RBC was not furnished with any
valuations or appraisals of these types. In addition, RBC did not assume any
obligation to conduct, and did not conduct, any physical inspection of the
property or facilities of Ontrack or Kroll. Likewise, RBC was not asked to, and
did not consider, the possible effects of any litigation or other legal claims.

        In rendering its opinion, RBC assumed that the merger would be accounted
for by Kroll as a purchase transaction under generally accepted accounting
principles and would qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. RBC also assumed, in all respects material to its analysis,
that the representations and warranties of each party contained in the merger
agreement were true and correct, that each party would perform all of the
covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the merger
agreement, and that all conditions to the consummation of the merger would be
satisfied without waiver. In addition, in arriving at its opinion, RBC assumed
that, in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals for the
merger, no restrictions, including any divestiture requirements, will be imposed
that would have a material effect on the combined company.

        The opinion of RBC speaks only as of the date it was rendered, is based
on the conditions as they existed, and information which it was supplied, as of
March 28, 2002 (the last trading day preceding the finalization of its
analysis), and is without regard to any market, economic, financial, legal, or
other circumstances or event of any kind or nature which may exist or occur
after such date.

        The opinion of RBC addresses solely the fairness of the per share merger
consideration, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Ontrack's
common stock. The opinion does not in any way address other merger terms or
arrangements, including, without limitation, the financial or other terms of any
voting or employment agreement. RBC did not express any opinion as to the prices
at which Ontrack's or Kroll's common stock have traded or may trade following
the announcement or consummation of the merger.

        In arriving at its opinion, RBC:

        o       reviewed the financial terms of the draft dated April 1, 2002 of
                the merger agreement;

        o       reviewed and analyzed certain publicly available financial and
                other data with respect to Ontrack and Kroll and certain other
                relevant historical operating data relating to Ontrack and Kroll
                made available to RBC from published sources and from the
                internal records of Ontrack and Kroll;

        o       conducted discussions with members of the senior management of
                Ontrack with respect to the business prospects and financial
                outlook of Ontrack;

        o       conducted discussions with members of the senior management of
                Kroll with respect to the business prospects and financial
                outlook of Kroll and the combined company;

        o       received and reviewed financial forecasts prepared by Ontrack's
                and Kroll's management on the potential future performance of
                Ontrack and Kroll, respectively, each on a stand alone basis,
                and compared such forecasts with publicly available
                institutional investment research estimates;

        o       reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the common
                stock of each of Ontrack and Kroll;

        o       reviewed selected market valuation metrics of Kroll and other
                comparable publicly-traded companies; and

        o       compared the implied historical exchange ratios between
                Ontrack's common stock and Kroll's common stock with the
                exchange ratio provisions of the merger agreement.

        In arriving at its opinion, in addition to reviewing the matters listed
above, RBC performed the following analyses:

        o       compared selected market valuation metrics of Ontrack and other
                comparable publicly-traded companies with the per share merger
                consideration;

        o       compared the financial metrics, to the extent publicly
                available, of selected precedent transactions with the per share
                merger consideration;

        o       compared the premium implied by the per share merger
                consideration with the premiums paid in selected precedent
                transactions; and

        o       considered the projected pro forma effect of the merger on the
                combined company's earnings per share.

        In performing these analyses, RBC used $12.50 as the value of the per
share merger consideration, having regard to the exchange ratio provisions of
the merger agreement and the relative trading values of the two companies'
common stock as of March 28, 2002, the last trading day prior to the date of its
opinion.

        In connection with the rendering of its opinion to the Ontrack board of
directors, RBC prepared and delivered to Ontrack's board written materials
containing the analyses listed above and other information material to the
opinion. Set forth below is a summary of these analyses, including information
presented in tabular format. To fully understand the summary of the analyses
used by RBC, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The
tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the analysis.

        Comparable Company Analysis. RBC prepared a comparable company analysis
to analyze Ontrack's implied transaction valuation relative to a group of
publicly-traded companies that RBC deemed for purposes of its analysis to be
comparable to Ontrack. In this analysis, RBC compared the enterprise value of
Ontrack implied by the per share merger consideration, expressed as a multiple
of actual and projected revenue in calendar years 2001 and 2002, to the
respective range, mean and median multiples of enterprise values of comparable
companies implied by the public trading price of their common stock. In
addition, RBC compared the market capitalization or equity value of Ontrack
implied by the per share merger consideration, expressed as a multiple of price
to earnings in calendar years 2001 and 2002, to the respective range, mean and
median price to earnings multiples of comparable companies implied by the public
trading price of their common stock. Enterprise value is defined as market
capitalization, or equity value, plus debt less cash and cash equivalents.
Future revenue and earnings for Ontrack and for the comparable companies used in
the analyses were based on publicly available estimates.

        RBC compared enterprise value to revenue multiples and price to earnings
multiples of Ontrack's implied valuation with those of the following publicly
traded companies:

        o       American Management Systems Incorporated;

        o       Braun Consulting, Inc.;
        o       CACI International Inc.;
        o       Carreker Corporation;
        o       SOURCECORP, Incorporated;
        o       Inforte Corp.;
        o       Sapient Corporation; and
        o       Syntel, Inc.

        The following table presents, as of March 28, 2002, Ontrack's implied
enterprise value to revenue and price to earnings multiples and the range, mean
and median enterprise value to revenue and price to earnings multiples for the
aforementioned comparable companies for calendar years 2001 and 2002:

                                                                           Ontrack
                                                                        (as implied by
                                                                        the per share

        Precedent Transaction Analysis. RBC compared enterprise value to revenue
multiples and transaction value to earnings multiples relating to the proposed
merger of Ontrack and Kroll with like multiples in selected precedent merger and
acquisition transactions. In selecting precedent transactions, RBC considered
comparable publicly-traded company transactions announced after January 1, 2000,
in which the transaction values at announcement were between $50 million and $1
billion. Based on these criteria, the following ten transactions were analyzed:

        Acquiror                               Target
        --------                               ------

        SunGard Data Systems, Inc.             Comdisco, Inc. (technology services business)
        Affiliated Computer Services, Inc.     Lockheed Martin Corporation (IMS subsidiary)
        Affiliated Computer Services, Inc.     Systems and Computer Technology Corporation
                                               (Global Government Solutions business)
        CIBER, Inc.                            Aris Corporation
        CGI Group, Inc.                        IMRglobal Corp.
        ICICI Limited/                         Command Systems, Inc.
            ICICI Infotech, Inc.
        NCR Corporation                        4Front Technologies, Inc.
        CallCentric, Limited                   Datapoint Corporation
        Allen Systems Group, Inc.              Viasoft, Inc.
        PSINet, Inc.                           Metamor Worldwide, Inc.

        For the purpose of calculating the multiples, revenue and earnings were
derived from the twelve month actual revenue and earnings of the target
companies in the last twelve months prior to the announcement of the
transaction, or LTM revenue and LTM earnings, and the twelve month estimated
revenue of the target companies in the twelve months following the announcement
of the transaction, or

FTM revenue. Financial data regarding the precedent transactions was taken from
filings with the SEC, press releases, RBC institutional research, and other
institutional investment research estimates.

        The following table compares the implied transaction multiples for the
transaction with like range, mean, and median multiples for the selected
precedent transactions:

                                                                          Ontrack

        Premiums Paid Analysis. RBC compared the implied premium payable to
holders of Ontrack common stock to the premiums in 72 public-to-public
transactions announced since January 1, 2001 in which the transaction values
ranged between $100 million and $250 million. RBC compared Ontrack common stock
price at announcement implied by the per share merger consideration to Ontrack's
spot price one day (March 28, 2002), five days (March 22, 2002), and 30 days
(February 15, 2002) prior to announcement to the spot price premiums for the
same periods for the targets in the selected transactions. The following table
summarizes this analysis:

        Accretion/Dilution Analysis. RBC analyzed the pro forma impact of the
transaction on the projected earnings per share of the combined company for
calendar year 2002 using publicly-available estimates for Ontrack and Kroll. RBC
prepared this analysis using the closing price of Kroll stock on March 28, 2002,
for illustrative purposes.

        As discussed in "The Merger Agreement - Merger Consideration," under the
terms of the merger agreement, should the volume weighted average price of Kroll
common stock in the 20 consecutive trading days ending three trading days before
the vote of the Ontrack shareholders at the Ontrack special meeting at which the
merger is to be approved, or what is referred to in the merger agreement as the
"average stock price," fall in the range between $15.8634 and $19.3886, each
share of Ontrack common stock shall be exchangeable into that fraction of a
Kroll share determined by dividing $12.50 by such average stock price. However,
if the average stock price is either equal to or greater than $19.3886, or equal
to or less than $15.8634, each share of Ontrack common stock shall be
exchangeable into either 0.6447 or 0.7880 shares of Kroll common stock,
respectively. RBC prepared a sensitivity analysis of the pro forma impact of the
transaction on Kroll's 2002 earnings per share assuming that each share of
Ontrack common stock was exchanged for either 0.6447 or 0.7880 shares of Kroll
stock. RBC estimated that using either exchange ratio, the combined company's
earnings per share, excluding the impact of non-cash and one-time charges and
assuming no synergies, would be accretive in calendar year 2002.

        Other Considerations. No single company or transaction used in the above
analyses as a comparison is identical to Ontrack or Kroll or the proposed
merger. The analyses were prepared solely for purposes of RBC providing an
opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
common stock of Ontrack of the per share merger consideration and do not purport
to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or
securities actually may be sold, which are inherently subject to uncertainty.

        The opinion of RBC as to the fairness, from a financial point of view,
of the per share merger consideration, the analyses contained in such opinion
and all conclusions drawn from such analyses were necessarily based upon market,
economic, and other conditions that existed as of March 28, 2002 (the last
trading date preceding the finalization of its analysis) and on information
available to RBC as of that date.

        The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process that involves
the application of subjective business judgment in determining the most
appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of
those methods to the particular circumstances. Several analytical methodologies
were used by RBC and no one method of analysis should be regarded as critical to
the overall conclusion reached. Each analytical technique has inherent strengths
and weaknesses, and the nature of the available information may further affect
the value of particular techniques. The overall conclusions of RBC were based on
all the analysis and factors presented herein taken as a whole and also on
application of RBC's own experience and judgment. Such conclusions may involve
significant elements of subjective judgment and qualitative analysis. RBC
therefore believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that
selecting portions of the analyses and of the factors considered, without
considering all factors and analyses, could create an incomplete or misleading
view of the processes underlying its opinion.

        In connection with its analyses, RBC made, and was provided by Ontrack's
management, numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general
business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond
Ontrack's or Kroll's control. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results
are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because
these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous
factors or events beyond the control of Ontrack, Kroll, or their advisors, none
of Ontrack, Kroll, RBC, or any other person assumes responsibility if future
results or actual values are materially different from these forecasts or
assumptions.

        Ontrack selected RBC to render its opinion based on RBC's experience in
mergers and acquisitions and in securities valuation generally. RBC is an
internationally recognized investment

banking firm and is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, corporate
restructurings, underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted
securities, private placements, and valuations for corporate and other purposes.
In the ordinary course of business, RBC may actively trade Ontrack securities
for its own account and the accounts of its customers, and, accordingly, may
hold a long or short position in such securities.

        Pursuant to an engagement letter dated May 31, 2001, Ontrack is
obligated to pay RBC a nonrefundable fee of $500,000 upon the rendering of its
opinion on April 1, 2002, $250,000 of which is creditable against the
transaction fee. Payment of this opinion fee to RBC was not contingent upon the
closing of the merger. Ontrack has also agreed to pay RBC a transaction fee of
2% of the aggregate transaction value paid by Kroll upon the closing of the
merger for investment banking and financial advisory services. The transaction
fee is contingent upon the closing of the merger. Whether or not the transaction
closes, Ontrack has agreed to reimburse RBC for its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses and to indemnify RBC against liabilities relating to or arising out of
services performed by RBC in connection with the merger, including without
limitation, liabilities arising under the federal securities laws. The terms of
the engagement letter, which Ontrack believes are customary for transactions of
this nature, were negotiated at arm's-length between Ontrack and RBC, and
Ontrack's board of directors was aware of this fee arrangement at the time of
its approval of the merger agreement.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors of Kroll; Reasons of Kroll for the
Merger

        At a meeting of the Kroll board of directors, after careful
consideration, the Kroll board unanimously determined:

        o       that an acquisition of Ontrack would be in the best interests of
                Kroll and its shareholders; and

        o       to recommend to the shareholders of Kroll that they approve the
                issuance of shares in connection with the merger.

        In these determinations, Kroll's board of directors considered the
following material factors:

        o       Ontrack's leadership position in data recovery and electronic
                discovery services, services that are complementary to Kroll's
                own offerings of security and technology services and that will
                assist Kroll in fulfilling its strategy of expanding its
                business offerings;

        o       the synergies from the merger that may be achieved by using
                Kroll's brand name and sales and distribution channels to
                aggressively promote Ontrack's electronic discovery services and
                data recovery services around the world;

        o       the expectation that the merger would be immediately accretive
                to Kroll's book value per share;

        o       Ontrack's strong balance sheet and net cash position, which
                should further enable Kroll to grow its business and implement
                its business strategy;

        o       the opinion of Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn that the consideration
                to be offered by Kroll in the merger was fair, from a financial
                point of view, to the holders of Kroll common stock;

        o       the strong management team at Ontrack;

        o       the cost-saving opportunities from the merger that may be
                achieved through eliminating the duplicative costs associated
                with public companies and insurance coverage; and

        o       the increase in Kroll's market capitalization as a result of the
                merger, which should enhance the ability to use Kroll common
                stock as currency for future acquisitions and should make Kroll
                more attractive to a larger group of potential investors.

        The board of directors did not find it practical to, and did not,
quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the individual factors
considered in reaching its determination.

Opinion of Financial Advisor to Kroll

        At the meeting of the Kroll board of directors on March 29, 2002, Morgan
Lewis Githens & Ahn, Inc. rendered its opinion that, as of such date, and based
upon the assumptions made, matters considered and limits of review set forth in
its written opinion, the consideration to be offered by Kroll in the merger was
fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Kroll common stock.
Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn reaffirmed its opinion on April 1, 2002 by letter
dated April 1, 2002 before the execution of the merger agreement.

        The full text of Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn's opinion, and the
reaffirmation of its opinion, are attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Annexes C-1 and C-2 and is incorporated into this joint
proxy statement/prospectus by reference. The description of the opinion set
forth in this section is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text
of the opinion and its reaffirmation set forth in Annexes C-1 and C-2. Kroll
shareholders are urged to read the Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn opinion in its
entirety for a description of the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters
considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by
Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn in rendering its opinion.

        The Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn opinion is directed to the Kroll board of
directors and addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view of the
consideration offered by Kroll in the merger. It does not address the merits of
the underlying business decision of Kroll to engage in the merger and does not
constitute a recommendation to any Kroll shareholder as to how a shareholder
should vote at the Kroll annual meeting with respect to the merger or any other
matter in connection with the merger.

        Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn has reviewed and analyzed, among other
things, the following: (1) the merger agreement; (2) Kroll's and Ontrack's
Annual Reports on Form 10-K for each of the fiscal years in the three year
period ended December 31, 2001; (3) other publicly available information
concerning Kroll and Ontrack and the trading markets for their respective
securities; (4) internal information and other data relating to Kroll and
Ontrack, their respective businesses and prospects, including forecasts and
projections, provided to Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn by management of Kroll and
Ontrack; (5) publicly available information concerning other companies engaged
in businesses which Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn believed to be generally
comparable to Kroll and Ontrack and the trading market for some of those other
companies' securities; and (6) the financial terms of recent business
combinations which Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn believed to be relevant. Morgan
Lewis Githens & Ahn also met with certain of the officers and employees of Kroll
and Ontrack concerning their respective business and operations, assets,
condition and prospects and undertook other studies, analyses and investigations
that it deemed appropriate.

        In performing its analyses, numerous assumptions were made with respect
to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters, many of

which are beyond the control of Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn, Kroll or Ontrack.
Any estimates contained in the analyses performed by Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn
are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than suggested by those analyses.
Additionally, estimates of the value of businesses or securities do not purport
to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which those businesses or
securities might actually be sold. Accordingly, the analyses and estimates are
inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

        In preparing its opinion, Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn assumed and relied
on the accuracy and completeness of all information supplied or otherwise made
available to it, discussed with or reviewed by or for it, or publicly available,
and it has not assumed any responsibility for independently verifying that
information or undertaken an independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the
assets or liabilities of Kroll or Ontrack or been furnished with any such
evaluation or appraisal. In addition, Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn did not conduct
any physical inspection of the properties or facilities of Kroll or Ontrack.
With respect to the financial forecast information and the expected synergies
furnished to or discussed with Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn by Kroll or Ontrack,
Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn assumed that they were reasonably prepared and
reflected the best currently available estimates and judgment of Kroll's or
Ontrack's management as to the expected future financial performance of Kroll or
Ontrack, as the case may be, and the expected synergies.

        Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn's opinion was necessarily based upon market,
economic and other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on, and the
information made available to Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn as of, the date of the
opinion. Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn assumed that in the course of obtaining the
necessary regulatory or other consents or approvals (contractual or otherwise)
for the merger, no restrictions, including any divestiture requirements or
amendments or modifications, will be imposed that will have a material adverse
effect on the contemplated benefits of the merger. Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn
further assumed that the merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for
U.S. federal income tax purposes.

        In connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn
performed a variety of financial analyses, including those summarized below.
These analyses were presented to the Kroll board at a meeting held on March 29,
2002. The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description
of the analyses performed by Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn in this regard. The
preparation of a fairness opinion involves various determinations as to the most
appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of
these methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, such an opinion is
not readily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description.
Accordingly, notwithstanding the separate analyses summarized below, Morgan
Lewis Githens & Ahn believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and
that selecting portions of its analyses and factors considered by it, without
considering all of its analyses and factors, or attempting to ascribe relative
weights to some or all of its analyses and factors, could create an incomplete
view of the evaluation process underlying its opinion.

        The financial forecasts furnished to Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn and used
by it in some of its analyses were prepared by the management of Kroll and
Ontrack. Neither Kroll nor Ontrack publicly discloses financial forecasts of the
type provided to Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn in connection with its review of the
merger, and as a result, these financial forecasts were not prepared with a view
towards public disclosure. The financial forecasts were based on numerous
variables and assumptions which are inherently uncertain, including, without
limitation, factors related to general economic and competitive conditions, and
accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from those set forth in
such financial forecasts.

        The following is a summary of the material analyses performed by Morgan
Lewis Githens & Ahn in connection with its opinion.

        Historical Trading Analysis. Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn reviewed the
historical stock market performance of Ontrack common stock. This analysis

        Selected Publicly Traded Comparable Companies Analysis. Using publicly
available information, Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn reviewed the stock prices, as
of March 25, 2002, and selected market trading multiples of the following
companies: Symantec Corporation, Ikon Office Solutions, Inc., CACI
International, Inc., McAfee.com Corporation, SOURCECORP, Syntel, Inc. and
Computer Horizons Corporation, which are collectively referred to in this
section as the "Comparable Companies". Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn believes these
companies are engaged in lines of business that are generally comparable to
those of Ontrack. The financial information reviewed by Morgan Lewis Githens &
Ahn included market trading multiples exhibited by the Comparable Companies with
respect to their 2001 actual and 2002 estimated financial performance. The
specific multiples reviewed included price/earnings ratios, enterprise
value/sales ratios, enterprise value/EBITDA ratios and enterprise value/EBIT
ratios. For the analysis presented below, Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn excluded
non-recurring charges and goodwill amortization for 2001. Morgan Lewis Githens &
Ahn relied on various publicly available research reports prepared by
established securities firms for the 2002 estimated financial performance of the
Comparable Companies.

        For this summary of Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn's opinion, the term
"EBITDA" means earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
the term "EBIT" means earnings before interest and taxes, and the term
"Enterprise Value" means the sum of (1) a company's equity market
capitalization, or market equity value, plus (2) any minority interest, (3) any
preferred stock and (4) net debt, which equals total debt less cash and cash
equivalents.

        Selected Comparable Acquisitions Analysis. Using publicly available
information, Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn reviewed the purchase prices and
multiples paid in selected mergers and acquisitions involving companies which it
deemed relevant in evaluating the merger. Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn reviewed
the acquisition of OTG Software, Inc. by Legato Systems, Inc. (pending), the
acquisition of BTG, Inc. by Titan Corp., the acquisition of Metro Information
Services, Inc. by Keane, Inc., the acquisition of Avert Inc. by Automatic Data
Processing, the acquisition of Printrak International by Motorola, the
acquisition of TechForce Corp. by Equant N.V., the acquisition of VIASOFT INC.
by Allen Systems Group, Inc. and the acquisition of Quarterdeck Corp. by
Symantec Corp., which are collectively referred to in this section as the
"Acquisition Comparables". The financial information reviewed by Morgan Lewis
Githens & Ahn included the purchase prices and multiples paid by the acquiring
company of the acquired company's financial results over the twelve months
preceding the announcements of the proposed acquisitions and the expected
financial performance of the acquired company for the projected fiscal year
subsequent to the announcements of the proposed acquisitions. The acquisition
multiples reviewed included price/earnings ratios, enterprise value/sales
ratios, enterprise value/EBITDA ratios and enterprise value/EBIT ratios. For the
analysis presented below, Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn excluded non-recurring
charges and goodwill amortization (for 2001 only) from the latest 12 months of
financial information prior to the announcement of the transaction. Morgan Lewis
Githens & Ahn relied on various publicly available research reports prepared by
established securities firms for the estimated financial performance of the
Acquisition Comparables.

        No company or transaction used in the analyses described under
"--Selected Publicly Traded Comparable Companies Analysis" and "--Selected
Comparable Acquisitions Analysis" is identical to Ontrack or the merger.
Accordingly, an analysis of the results of these analyses necessarily involves
complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and
operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the transaction or
the public trading or other values of Ontrack or companies to which they are
being compared. Mathematical analysis, such as determining the average or
median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable acquisition or
company data. In addition, in performing such analyses, Morgan Lewis Githens &
Ahn relied on projections prepared by research analysts at established
securities firms which may or may not prove to be accurate.

        Pro Forma Merger Analysis. Based on the financial forecasts provided by
Kroll and Ontrack, Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn analyzed various pro forma effects
of the merger, including the potential impact on the projected earnings per
share of Kroll for 2002 and 2003. A range of potential synergies realizable in
connection with the merger and potential exchange ratios were taken into
consideration in this analysis. Based on the synergy levels that Kroll believed
to be achievable and the exchange ratios considered, Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn
determined that the transaction would be accretive to Kroll's projected earnings
per share for 2002 and 2003. Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn also analyzed the impact
of the merger on Kroll's balance sheet and noted that the merger would, among
other effects, increase Kroll's cash and marketable securities balances by
approximately $35 million, increase its shareholders' equity by approximately
$140 million, increase its book value per share from approximately $4.90 to more
than $8.00 per share, and improve Kroll's balance sheet from a credit
perspective. The actual impact of the merger on Kroll's balance sheet will
depend upon a number of factors including the number of Ontrack options
exercised, the number of Kroll shares that are actually issued in the merger as
well as the actual aggregate amount of expenses associated with the merger.

        Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn has been retained by Kroll to act as its
exclusive financial advisor in connection with the Merger. Kroll selected Morgan
Lewis Githens & Ahn to act as its financial advisor because its investment
bankers have substantial experience in transactions similar to the merger and
because its bankers are familiar with Kroll and its business. The investment
bankers at Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn have regularly engaged in the valuation of
businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged
buyouts, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and
unlisted securities and private placements. In addition, Morgan Lewis Githens &
Ahn is currently providing financial advisory services to Kroll and may continue
to do so and may receive fees for the rendering of such services.

        Kroll and Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn entered into a letter agreement
dated November 12, 2001 relating to the services to be provided by Morgan Lewis
Githens & Ahn in connection with the merger, which was executed on November 15,
2001. Kroll agreed to pay Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn a $50,000 non-refundable
retainer and a fee of 1.125% of the aggregate consideration paid by Kroll in the
merger, with the retainer being credited

against such fee. On March 25, 2002, Kroll and Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn
entered into a separate letter agreement relating to the rendering of a written
opinion as to the fairness to the shareholders of Kroll from a financial point
of view of the consideration offered in the merger. Under this agreement, Kroll
paid Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn a fee of $50,000 on the date the letter
agreement was executed and agreed to pay an additional fee of $150,000 upon the
earlier to occur of the consummation of the merger or ninety (90) days following
the delivery of Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn's opinion. Neither of such opinion
fees is contingent on the consummation of the merger. Kroll also agreed to
reimburse Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in connection with its advisory work, including certain fees and
disbursements of its legal counsel, and to indemnify Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn
against liabilities relating to or arising out of the merger, including
liabilities under the securities laws.

Issuance of Shares in Connection with the Merger

        The general corporation law of Ohio, the state where Kroll is
incorporated, requires shareholder approval for issuance of shares of common
stock in an acquisition where the number of shares to be issued will exceed
one-sixth of the number of shares of voting stock outstanding immediately after
the transaction. In addition, the rules of the Nasdaq National Market, on which
Kroll's common stock is listed, require shareholder approval for issuance of
shares of common stock in any transaction where the number of shares to be
issued will be equal to 20 percent or more of the number of shares of common
stock outstanding before the issuance.

        Kroll currently has outstanding ______ shares of its common stock. Based
upon the currently outstanding number of shares of Ontrack common stock of
_________ and the number of shares of Ontrack common stock to be issued under
Ontrack's employee stock purchase plan of _________, and assuming an exchange
ratio of 0.7880, ______ shares of Kroll common stock would be issuable in the
merger. In addition, Ontrack has outstanding options to acquire _______ shares
of common stock, at an average exercise price of $___. Under the terms of the
merger agreement, assuming an exchange ratio of 0.7880, these options would be
exercisable for a total of approximately _________ shares of Kroll common stock,
at an average exercise price of $___, following the merger.

        The issuance of the Kroll common stock described above requires
shareholder approval of the issuance of Kroll common stock in accordance with
Ohio corporate law and the rules of the Nasdaq National Market.

        The board of directors of Kroll unanimously recommends that Kroll
shareholders vote FOR approval of the issuance of Kroll common stock in
connection with the merger.

Interests of Ontrack's Directors, Officers and Employees in the Merger

        In considering the recommendation of the Ontrack board of directors to
vote for adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger, Ontrack
shareholders should be aware that members of Ontrack's board of directors,
executive officers and key employees will receive benefits as a result of the
merger that will be in addition to or different from the benefits received by
Ontrack shareholders generally. The board of Ontrack recognized those interests
and considered them when it approved the merger and the merger agreement.

        New Employment Agreements. Kroll has entered into an employment
agreement with Ben F. Allen, president and chief executive officer of Ontrack,
and ODI Acquisition has entered into employment agreements with Thomas P. Skiba,
vice president and chief financial officer of Ontrack, and

Paul D. Fabel, general counsel of Ontrack. These employment agreements are
contingent upon, and will become effective upon, the completion of the merger.

        Allen Employment Agreement. Kroll has entered into an employment
agreement with Mr. Allen for employment as president of Ontrack for a period of
three years following the completion of the merger. Mr. Allen will receive a
starting base salary of $250,000, which will be increased by not less than four
percent in each subsequent year of the term. Mr. Allen will be eligible for a
2002 bonus based on existing Ontrack incentive plans, for an incentive bonus at
an annual rate of 60% of his base salary, and to participate in benefits plans,
stock option plans and similar programs or plans. Mr. Allen will also be granted
upon completion of the merger stock options to purchase 100,000 shares of Kroll
common stock at the market price on the grant date, which options will vest over
a three year period commencing one year after the date of the grant.

        In the event Mr. Allen's employment is terminated by Kroll without
"cause" or by Mr. Allen for "good reason," Mr. Allen will be entitled to receive
as severance an amount equal to his base salary for the greater of 18 months or
the remainder of the term of the agreement and continuation of medical insurance
coverage for that period. The severance payment may be paid in a lump sum or in
equal monthly payments at the election of Kroll.

        Mr. Allen has agreed not to directly or indirectly compete in any
business in which Ontrack or its subsidiaries are engaged during the term of the
employment agreement. If Mr. Allen's employment is terminated for "cause," or
Mr. Allen terminates his employment other than for "good reason," this
non-competition restriction will continue for two years after the date of
termination. If Mr. Allen terminates his employment for "good reason," this
restriction shall continue for the longer of the remaining term of the agreement
or 18 months. Additionally, Mr. Allen has agreed not to induce or assist,
directly or indirectly, any employee, agent, representative or customer in
detrimentally modifying their relationship with Ontrack during the term of the
employment agreement and for one year after termination of the employment
agreement for any reason.

        As used in Mr. Allen's employment agreement, "cause" means:

        o       a willful and continued failure to substantially perform his
                duties under the employment agreement beyond the applicable cure
                period;

        o       a willful breach of any material terms and conditions of the
                employment agreement byeond the applicable cure period; or

        o       pleading no contest or guilty to a felony charge or being
                convicted of a felony.

        Mr. Allen may terminate his employment for "good reason:"

        o       if he is assigned duties diminishing in any material respect
                those contemplated by the employment agreement;

        o       if Kroll willfully fails to comply with the material provisions
                of the employment agreement;

        o       if an event occurs that directly results in Mr. Allen reporting
                to any person other than Michael G. Cherkasky; or

        o       if there is a change of control of Ontrack. Under the agreement,
                a change of control is considered to have occurred if any
                "person," as that term is used in Section 13(d) and 14(d)

                of the Securities Act of 1934, is or becomes the "beneficial
                owner," as defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the
                Securities Exchange Act of 1934, directly or indirectly, of
                securities of Ontrack representing 20% or more of the combined
                voting power of Ontrack's then outstanding securities.

        In addition, Mr. Allen's employment agreement provides that, if he is
still employed by Kroll at the time of the first Kroll shareholders' meeting
following the merger, Kroll will propose Mr. Allen as a nominee for election to
the Kroll board of directors to the nominating committee of the Kroll board, or,
if Kroll does not have a nominating committee, to the full board, for approval
by the Kroll board as a nominee at that shareholders meeting.

        Skiba and Fabel Employment Agreements. ODI Acquisition has entered into
one year employment agreements with Messrs. Skiba and Fabel. Mr. Skiba and Mr.
Fabel will receive payments on the completion of the merger of $262,500 and
$66,250, respectively, in satisfaction of existing severance obligations, and
will be entitled to annual base salaries of $175,000 and $132,500, respectively.
Mr. Skiba and Mr. Fabel will each be granted upon completion of the merger
non-qualified stock options to purchase 40,000 shares of Kroll common stock at
the market price on the grant date, which options will vest in accordance with
the terms of Kroll's 2000 Stock Option Plan. Additionally, all outstanding
options to purchase shares of Ontrack common stock held by Mr. Skiba prior to
the merger will be exercisable for Kroll common stock for a period of three
years after the termination or expiration of Mr. Skiba's employment agreement.

        In the event the employment of either Mr. Skiba or Mr. Fabel is
terminated for any reason, he will be entitled to unpaid but earned compensation
payable by ODI Acquisition, if any, in accordance with its normal pay practices
upon a termination of employees for similar reasons. In the event Mr. Skiba's or
Mr. Fabel's employment is terminated by ODI Acquisition without "cause," they
will be entitled to continued medical insurance coverage for the remainder of
the term, with respect to Mr. Skiba, or six months after the date of
termination, with respect to Mr. Fabel.

        Mr. Skiba and Mr. Fabel have agreed not to directly or indirectly
compete in any business in which Ontrack or its subsidiaries are engaged during
the term of the employment agreements. If their employment is terminated for
"cause" or if they terminate their employment during the term of their own
volition, this restriction shall continue for two years after the date of
termination. Additionally, Messrs. Skiba and Fabel have agreed not to induce or
assist, directly or indirectly, any employee, agent, representative or customer
in detrimentally modifying his or her relationship with Ontrack during the term
of the employment agreement and for one year after termination of the employment
agreement for any reason.

        As used in the Skiba and Fabel employment agreements, "cause" means:

        o       a willful and continued failure to substantially perform his
                duties under the employment agreement beyond the applicable cure
                period;

        o       a willful breach of any material terms and conditions of the
                employment agreement beyond the applicable cure period; or

        o       pleading no contest or guilty to a felony charge or being
                convicted of a felony.

        Severance Payments. In the merger agreement, Kroll agreed that Ontrack
will make a lump sum severance payment to John M. Bujan in the amount of
$295,985 upon completion of the merger in satisfaction of existing severance
obligations and in consideration of his execution of a release of claims

against Ontrack and the termination of his employment agreement with Ontrack.
Additionally, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, all stock options
held by Mr. Bujan shall be exercisable for a period of three years following the
completion of the merger.

        Kroll Stock Options. Under the merger agreement, Messrs. Skiba and Fabel
and seven other key employees of Ontrack will receive options to purchase an
aggregate of 300,000 shares of Kroll common stock upon completion of the merger.
The amounts and terms of the option grants to Messrs. Skiba and Fabel are
described above in the description of their employment agreements. In addition,
under his employment agreement, Mr. Allen will receive options to purchase
100,000 shares of Kroll common stock upon completion of the merger. The terms of
this grant are described above in the description of his employment agreement.

        Acceleration of Ontrack Stock Options. All options to purchase shares of
Ontrack common stock outstanding as of the effective time of the merger will
become fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to the merger. All shares
of Ontrack common stock acquired upon exercise of options prior to the merger
will be converted into Kroll common stock in the merger. All unexercised options
to purchase shares of Ontrack common stock that remain outstanding at the
effective time of the merger will be assumed by Kroll. The number of shares and
the exercise price per share of the Kroll option will be determined based on the
same exchange ratio applicable to the conversion of Ontrack common stock in the
merger, as described under the heading "The Merger Agreement - Merger
Consideration."

        Appointment of Ben F. Allen to Kroll's Board of Directors. One of the
conditions to Ontrack's obligation to complete the merger is that Kroll appoint
Mr. Allen a director of Kroll upon completion of the merger. In addition, Mr.
Allen's employment agreement provides that, if he is still employed by Kroll at
the time of the first Kroll shareholders' meeting following the merger, Kroll
will propose Mr. Allen as a nominee for election to the Kroll board of directors
to the nominating committee of the Kroll board, or, if Kroll does not have a
nominating committee, to the full board, for approval by the Kroll board as a
nominee at that shareholders' meeting. Mr. Allen will be entitled, as a Kroll
director, to the same indemnification and other benefits as provided to the
other members of the Kroll board of directors who are also employees of Kroll.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences

        The following discussion is the opinion of Kramer Levin Naftalis &
Frankel LLP and Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi L.L.P. as to the material U.S.
federal income tax consequences of the exchange of Ontrack common stock by
citizens or residents or domestic corporations of the United States, referred to
in this section as "U.S. persons," for shares of Kroll common stock in the
merger. The discussion which follows is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code,
Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code, administrative
rulings and pronouncements and judicial decisions as of the date of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus, all of which are subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect. Any such change could alter the tax consequences discussed
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The discussion below assumes that the
merger and related transactions will be completed on the terms and conditions of
the merger agreement and as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus
without waiver or modification of any of those terms or conditions.

        The discussion below is for general information only and, except where
specifically noted, does not address the effects of any state, local or non-U.S.
tax laws. In addition, the discussion below relates to U.S. persons who hold
Ontrack common stock as capital assets as defined in section 1221 of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code. The tax treatment of an Ontrack shareholder may vary
depending upon that shareholder's particular situation, and some shareholders
may be subject to special rules not discussed below, including, for example,
partners of partnerships that hold Ontrack common stock, insurance

companies, tax-exempt organizations, financial institutions, broker-dealers,
traders in securities, persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar,
persons holding Ontrack common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, conversion,
constructive sale, synthetic security or other integrated transaction, non-U.S.
persons, and individuals who received Ontrack common stock pursuant to the
exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation.

        The obligation of Kroll to complete the merger is conditioned upon the
receipt of an opinion, dated as of the date of the merger, of Kramer Levin
Naftalis & Frankel LLP, and the obligation of Ontrack to complete the merger is
conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion, dated as of the date of the merger,
of Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi, L.L.P. , subject in each case to the
assumptions and qualifications set forth below and in those opinions, to the
effect that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. If the conditions relating to
delivery of such opinions are waived and there is a material change in the tax
consequences of the merger, Kroll and Ontrack will recirculate proxy materials
regarding the merger and resolicit proxies. The opinions will be based on, among
other things, current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, Treasury
Regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code, administrative rulings
and pronouncements and judicial decisions as of the date of those opinions, all
of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, as well as
facts existing as of the date of those opinions, certain representations as to
factual matters made by Kroll, ODI Acquisition and Ontrack and the assumption
that the merger is completed in accordance with the terms of the merger
agreement and as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus without
waiver or modification of any of those terms or conditions. These
representations or assumptions, if incorrect in certain material respects, could
jeopardize the conclusions reached in the opinions. None of Kroll, ODI
Acquisition or Ontrack will seek a ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service
as to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the merger, and the legal
opinions are not binding on the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or the courts. The
forms of the opinions to be delivered to Kroll and Ontrack are filed as an
exhibit to the registration statement on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is a part.

        Subject to the opinions that are required to be delivered to satisfy the
conditions to completion of the merger described above, in the opinion of Kramer
Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP and Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi L.L.P., the
following material U.S. federal income tax consequences will result from the
merger:

        o       Ontrack shareholders will not recognize any gain or loss on the
                exchange of Ontrack common stock for shares of Kroll common
                stock in the merger, except for gain or loss with respect to
                cash received in lieu of fractional shares;

        o       the tax basis to an Ontrack shareholder of the shares of Kroll
                common stock received in exchange for Ontrack common stock
                pursuant to the merger, including any fractional share interest
                in shares of Kroll common stock for which cash is received
                instead, will equal that Ontrack shareholder's tax basis in the
                Ontrack common stock surrendered in the exchange;

        o       the holding period of an Ontrack shareholder for the shares of
                Kroll common stock received pursuant to the merger will include
                the holding period of the Ontrack common stock surrendered in
                the exchange;

        o       an Ontrack stockholder who exercises dissenters' rights and
                receives cash for his or her Ontrack common stock pursuant to
                the merger will be treated as having received that cash in
                exchange for that Ontrack common stock and generally will
                recognize capital

                gain or loss on the exchange in an amount equal to the
                difference between the amount of cash received and the basis of
                the Ontrack common stock surrendered in the exchange;

        o       an Ontrack shareholder who receives cash instead of an interest
                in a fractional share of Kroll common stock pursuant to the
                merger will be treated as having received that cash in exchange
                for that fractional share interest and generally will recognize
                capital gain or loss on the deemed exchange in an amount equal
                to the difference between the amount of cash received and the
                basis of the Ontrack stock allocable to that fractional share;
                and

        o       no income, gain or loss will be recognized by Kroll, ODI
                Acquisition or Ontrack as a result of the transfer to Ontrack
                shareholders of the shares of Kroll common stock pursuant to the
                merger.

        An Ontrack shareholder who exchanges Ontrack common stock for shares of
Kroll common stock will be required to retain in such shareholder's records and
file with such shareholder's federal income tax return for the taxable year in
which the merger takes place a statement setting forth all relevant facts in
respect of the nonrecognition of gain or loss upon the exchange. The statement
is required to include:

        o       the shareholder's tax basis in the Ontrack common stock
                surrendered in the merger; and

        o       the fair market value of the shares of Kroll common stock
                received in the merger as of the effective time of the merger.

        The foregoing discussion is intended only as a summary and does not
purport to be a complete analysis or listing of all potential tax effects
relevant to a decision by an Ontrack shareholder whether to vote in favor of
adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger. Ontrack
shareholders are urged to consult their tax advisors concerning the United
States federal, state, local and non-United States tax consequences of the
merger to them.

Accounting Treatment

        The merger will be treated as a purchase for accounting and financial
reporting purposes. Under this method of accounting, the assets and liabilities
of Ontrack will be recorded in Kroll's consolidated financial statements at
their estimated fair market value at the date of the merger, with the remaining
purchase price reflected as goodwill.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger

        Each of Kroll and Ontrack has agreed to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals required in order to complete the
merger. We cannot assure you that that the required regulatory approvals will be
obtained or, if obtained, what the timing of these approvals will be. We also
cannot assure you that, if obtained, these approvals will not face legal
challenges. Kroll and Ontrack are not aware of any regulatory approvals or
actions that are required prior to completion of the merger other than those
described below.

Antitrust Matters

        The Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 prohibits Kroll
and Ontrack from completing the merger until certain information and materials
have been furnished to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust
Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and the applicable waiting periods
have expired or been terminated. On April 26, 2002, Kroll and Ontrack filed
their Premerger Notification and Report Forms pursuant to the HSR Act with the
FTC and the Antitrust Division. Kroll and Ontrack expect that the waiting period
will expire at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on May 26, 2002, although the waiting
period could be extended if the FTC or the Antitrust Division requests
additional information or documentary material. If such a request is made, the
waiting period will be extended until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on the thirtieth
day after substantial compliance by Kroll and Ontrack with this request. In the
event that such day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, the waiting period
will expire on the next business day. Even after the waiting period expires or
has been terminated, the FTC or the Antitrust Division retains the authority to
challenge the merger on antitrust grounds, before or after the merger is
completed.

        Neither Kroll nor Ontrack believes that completion of the merger will
result in a violation of any applicable antitrust laws. However, we cannot
assure you that no governmental agency will challenge the merger on antitrust
grounds. State antitrust authorities and private parties in certain
circumstances may bring legal action under the antitrust laws seeking to enjoin
the merger or to impose conditions on the merger.

Federal Securities Law Consequences

        Ontrack shareholders who receive shares of Kroll common stock in the
merger can freely transfer such shares, except that persons who are deemed to be
"affiliates," as such term is defined under the Securities Act of 1933, of
Ontrack at the time of the Ontrack special meeting may only sell shares they
receive in the merger in transactions permitted by the resale provisions of Rule
145 under the Securities Act, or as otherwise permitted under the Securities
Act. People who may be deemed to be "affiliates" of Ontrack generally include
individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
control with, Ontrack, and would not include Ontrack shareholders who are not
executive officers, directors or significant shareholders of Ontrack.

        In general, under Rule 145, for one year after the date the merger is
completed, Ontrack affiliates will be subject to the following restrictions on
the public sale of shares of Kroll common stock acquired in the merger:

        o       an Ontrack affiliate, together with certain related persons, may
                sell only through unsolicited "broker transactions" or in
                transactions directly with a "market maker," as such terms are
                defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act;

        o       the number of shares of Kroll common stock an Ontrack affiliate
                may sell, together with certain related persons and certain
                persons acting in concert, within any three-month period may not
                exceed the greater of 1% of the outstanding shares of Kroll
                common stock or the average weekly trading volume of such shares
                during the four calendar weeks preceding such sale; and

        o       an Ontrack affiliate may sell only if Kroll remains current with
                its informational filings with the SEC under the Exchange Act.

        After one year from completion of the merger, an Ontrack affiliate may
sell shares of Kroll common stock received in the merger without the limitations
on the manner of sale or volume, provided

that Kroll is current with its Exchange Act informational filings and that
Ontrack affiliate is not then an affiliate of Kroll. Two years after completion
of the merger, an affiliate of Ontrack may sell its shares of Kroll common stock
received in the merger without any restrictions, so long as that affiliate has
not been an affiliate of Kroll for at least three months prior to such sale.

        If the merger is completed, Messrs. Rogers, Pence and Stevens, founders,
directors and significant shareholders of Ontrack, will receive shares of common
stock of Kroll like all other Ontrack shareholders. Because they are affiliates
of Ontrack, they will continue to be subject to certain volume limitations
pursuant to Rule 145 under the Securities Act. However, Kroll has, and will have
following the merger, a larger number of outstanding shares than Ontrack has and
the trading volume of Kroll common stock is generally higher than the trading
volume of Ontrack common stock. As a result, the volume limitations applicable
to Kroll common stock are and, for purposes of Rule 145 will be, higher than the
volume limitations applicable to Ontrack common stock under Rule 144 and these
individuals will have a greater ability to sell their shares of Kroll common
stock than they would have had if they had continued to hold Ontrack common
stock. Consistent with their long standing desire to diversify their holdings,
Messrs. Rogers, Pence and Stevens have informed Ontrack that they intend to sell
the Kroll common stock they receive in the merger from time to time as market
conditions are favorable and in accordance with the volume limitations
prescribed by Rule 145 and all other legal requirements.

Nasdaq Listing

        It is a condition to the merger that Kroll file an additional listing
application with the Nasdaq National Market for the shares of Kroll common stock
to be issued in the merger.

Dissenters' Rights of Ontrack Shareholders

        Ontrack is incorporated under Minnesota law. Under the general
corporation laws of Minnesota, Ontrack shareholders have the right to dissent
from the proposed merger and, subject to certain conditions provided for under
the Minnesota dissenters' rights statutes, are entitled to receive payment of
the fair value of their Ontrack common stock. Ontrack shareholders will be bound
by the terms of the merger unless they dissent by complying with all of the
requirements of the Minnesota dissenters' rights statutes.

        The following is a summary of the procedures relating to the exercise of
dissenters' rights under the Minnesota dissenters' rights statutes. Because this
is a summary, it does not contain all the information that may be important to
Ontrack shareholders for the exercise of their dissenters' rights. Ontrack
shareholders should read the full text of the Minnesota dissenters' rights
statutes, a copy of which is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus
as Annex D.

        Ontrack shareholders contemplating exercising the right to demand
dissenters' rights should carefully review Annex D, and, in particular, the
procedural steps required to exercise those rights. Ontrack shareholders that
fail to comply with these procedural requirements will lose their right to
dissent.

        Ontrack shareholders who wish to dissent must deliver to Ontrack, prior
to the vote on the merger agreement and the merger, a written notice of intent
to demand payment for their shares if the merger is completed. In addition,
Ontrack shareholders who wish to dissent must not vote their shares of Ontrack
common stock in favor of the merger agreement and the merger. Ontrack
shareholders who fail to deliver the notice on time or who vote in favor of the
merger agreement and the merger will not have any dissenters' rights. Proxies
that are signed and returned by Ontrack shareholders that do not specify a vote
against adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger, or a
direction to abstain, will be

voted for adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger, and
those Ontrack shareholders will waive their dissenters' rights.

        Because only shareholders of record on the record date may exercise
dissenters' rights, any person who beneficially owns shares that are held of
record by a broker, fiduciary, nominee or other holder and who wishes to
exercise dissenters' rights must instruct the record holder of the shares to
satisfy the conditions outlined above. If a record holder does not satisfy, in a
timely manner, all of the conditions required by the Minnesota dissenters'
rights statutes, the dissenters' rights for all of the shares held by that
shareholder will be lost.

        If the merger agreement and the merger are approved by Ontrack
shareholders, Ontrack is required to deliver a written notice to all dissenting
Ontrack shareholders who gave timely notice of intent to demand payment and who
did not vote in favor of the merger agreement. The notice must:

        o       state where the payment demand and certificates of certificated
                shares must be sent in order to obtain payment and the date by
                which they must be received;

        o       inform shareholders of uncertificated shares to what extent
                transfer of the shares will be restricted after the payment
                demand is received;

        o       supply a form for demanding payment and requiring the dissenting
                shareholders to certify the date on which such shareholders
                acquired their shares of Ontrack common stock; and

        o       be accompanied by a copy of the Minnesota dissenters' rights
                statutes.

        Dissenting Ontrack shareholders that are sent the notice described above
must demand payment, deposit their certificates of Ontrack common stock and
complete other information in the manner described in that notice within 30 days
of receipt of the notice. Dissenting Ontrack shareholders that demand payment
and deposit their certificates of Ontrack common stock in the manner described
in the notice will retain all other rights of a Ontrack shareholder until those
rights are canceled by the completion of the merger. Ontrack may restrict the
transfer of uncertificated shares owned by dissenting Ontrack shareholders from
the date of the demand for payment until the merger is consummated.

        Except for shares of Ontrack common stock acquired by a dissenting
shareholder after the date of the first public announcement of the merger,
within 60 days of the later of the date of completion of the merger or receipt
of the payment demand, Ontrack must pay each dissenting Ontrack shareholder who
complies with the foregoing requirements the amount Ontrack estimates to be the
fair value of the dissenting Ontrack shareholder's shares of Ontrack common
stock plus accrued interest or return deposited certificates to Ontrack
shareholders. The payment must be accompanied by certain financial information
concerning Ontrack, a statement of Ontrack's estimate of the fair value of the
shares, an explanation of the method used to reach the estimate, a brief
description of the procedure to be followed to demand supplemental payment and a
copy of the Minnesota dissenters' rights statutes.

        Following receipt of payment of Ontrack's estimate of the fair value of
Ontrack common stock, a dissenting Ontrack shareholder may notify Ontrack in
writing of the shareholder's own estimate of the fair value of their shares and
the amount of interest due, if different from Ontrack's estimate, and may demand
payment of that amount by following the procedures set forth in the Minnesota
dissenters' rights statutes. If that demand for supplemental payment is not made
within 30 days of receipt of payment, the dissenting Ontrack shareholder will be
entitled only to the amount remitted or offered by Ontrack.

        Within 60 days of receipt of a demand for supplemental payment from a
dissenting Ontrack shareholder, Ontrack is required to either pay the amount
demanded or file in court a petition requesting the court to determine the fair
value of the dissenting shares, with interest. If a petition is filed, the court
will determine whether dissenting Ontrack shareholders have fully complied with
the provisions of the Minnesota dissenters' rights statutes, and will determine
the fair value of the dissenting shares, computed by any method that the court
in its discretion sees fit to use and taking into account all factors the court
finds relevant, including, without limitation, the recommendation of any
appraisers which may have been appointed by the court. The fair value of the
dissenting shares as determined by the court is binding upon Ontrack and the
dissenting Ontrack shareholders. The costs and expenses of the court proceedings
will be assessed against Ontrack, except that the court may assess part or all
of those costs and expenses against dissenting Ontrack shareholders if their
action in demanding payment is found to be arbitrary, vexatious or not in good
faith.

Dissenters' Rights of Kroll Shareholders

        Kroll is incorporated under Ohio law. Under the general corporation laws
of Ohio, holders of Kroll common stock will have the right to dissent from the
issuance of Kroll common stock in the merger and to receive the appraised value
of their shares in cash.

        Section 1701.84 of the Ohio General Corporation Law provides that all
holders of Kroll common stock entitled to vote on the issuance of Kroll common
stock in the merger may exercise dissenter's rights with respect to that
issuance. The following is a summary of the principal steps which Kroll
shareholders must take to perfect their dissenters' rights under Section
1701.85. Because this is a summary, it does not contain all the information that
may be important to Kroll shareholders for the exercise of their dissenters'
rights. Kroll shareholders should read the full text of Section 1701.85, a copy
of which is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex E.

        Any holder of shares of Kroll common stock contemplating exercising
dissenter's rights should review Annex E carefully and consult with his or her
own legal counsel because dissenters' rights will be lost if the procedural
requirements under Section 1701.85 are not fully and precisely satisfied.

        To perfect dissenters' rights, a Kroll shareholder must satisfy each of
the following conditions:

        1. Not Vote in Favor of the Issuance of Kroll Common Stock in the
Merger. Shares of Kroll common stock held by the dissenting Kroll shareholder
must not be voted at the annual meeting in favor of approval of the issuance of
Kroll common stock in the merger. This requirement will be satisfied if a proxy
is signed and returned with instructions to vote against the approval of the
issuance of Kroll common stock in the merger or to abstain from that vote, if no
proxy is returned and no vote is cast at the annual meeting in favor of the
approval of the issuance of Kroll common stock in the merger, or if the
dissenting Kroll shareholder revokes a proxy, and thereafter abstains from
voting for the approval of the issuance of Kroll common stock in the merger or
votes against the approval of the issuance of Kroll common stock in the merger
at the annual meeting. A vote in favor of the approval of the issuance of Kroll
common stock in the merger at the annual meeting constitutes a waiver of
dissenters' rights. A proxy that is returned signed but on which no voting
preference is indicated will be voted in favor of the approval of the issuance
of Kroll common stock in the merger and will constitute a waiver of dissenters'
rights. A dissenting Kroll shareholder may revoke his or her proxy at any time
before its exercise by giving notice of revocation to Kroll in writing, by
verifiable communication, at the annual meeting or by signing and returning a
later dated proxy, although attendance at the special meeting will not in and of
itself constitute revocation of a proxy. See "Kroll Inc. Annual Meeting - Voting
and Revocation of Proxies; Shares Held in `Street Name'."

        2. File Written Demand. Not later than ten days after the taking of the
vote on approval of the issuance of Kroll common stock in the merger, a
dissenting Kroll shareholder must deliver to Kroll a written demand for payment
of the fair cash value of the dissenting shareholder's shares of Kroll common
stock. The demand should be delivered to Kroll at 900 Third Avenue, New York,
New York 10022, Attention: Sabrina H. Perel, Secretary. It is recommended,
although not required, that the demand be sent by registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested. Voting against the approval of the issuance of Kroll
common stock in the merger will not itself constitute a demand. Kroll will not
send any further notice to Kroll shareholders regarding the date on which the
ten-day period expires.

        The demand must identify the name and address of the holder of record of
the dissenting shareholder's shares of Kroll common stock, the number of shares
of the dissenting shareholder's Kroll common stock and the amount claimed as the
fair cash value of those shares. A beneficial owner must, in all cases, have the
record holder submit the demand regarding the dissenting shareholder's Kroll
common stock. The demand must be signed by the shareholder of record (or by the
duly authorized representative of the shareholder) exactly as the shareholder's
name appears on the shareholder records of Kroll. A demand regarding Kroll
common stock owned jointly by more than one person must identify and be signed
by all of the shareholders of record. Any person signing a demand on behalf of a
partnership or corporation or in any other representative capacity, such as an
attorney-in-fact, executor, administrator, trustee or guardian, must indicate
the nature of the representative capacity and, if requested, must furnish
written proof of this capacity and that person's authority to sign the demand.

        Because only shareholders of record on the record date may exercise
dissenters' rights, any person who beneficially owns shares that are held of
record by a broker, fiduciary, nominee or other holder and who wishes to
exercise dissenters' rights must instruct the record holder of the shares to
satisfy the conditions outlined above. If a record holder does not satisfy, in a
timely manner, all of the conditions outlined in this section, " -- Dissenters'
Rights of Kroll Shareholders," the dissenters' rights for all of the shares held
by that shareholder will be lost.

        From the time the demand is given until either the termination of the
rights and obligations arising from the demand or the purchase of the dissenting
shareholder's Kroll common stock by Kroll, all rights accruing to the dissenting
shareholder, including voting and dividend or distribution rights, will be
suspended. If any dividend or distribution is paid on Kroll common stock during
the suspension, an amount equal to the dividend or distribution which would have
been payable on the dissenting shareholder's shares of Kroll common stock, but
for that suspension, shall be paid to the holder of record of those shares of
Kroll common stock as a credit upon the fair cash value of the shares. If the
right to receive the fair cash value is terminated otherwise than by the
purchase of the dissenting shareholder's Kroll common stock by Kroll, all rights
will be restored to the dissenting shareholder and any distribution that would
have been made to the holder of record of the shares of Kroll common stock for
which dissenter's rights have been asserted, but for the suspension, will be
made at the time of the termination.

        3. Petitions to Be Filed in Court. Within three months after the service
of the demand, if Kroll and the dissenting shareholder do not reach an agreement
on the fair cash value of the dissenting shareholder's Kroll common stock, the
dissenting shareholder or Kroll may file a complaint in the Court of Common
Pleas of Butler County, Ohio, or join or be joined in an action similarly
brought by another dissenting shareholder, for a judicial determination of the
fair cash value, as defined below, of the shares of Kroll common stock for which
dissenters' rights have been asserted. Kroll does not intend to file any
complaint for a judicial determination of the fair cash value of any Kroll
common stock.

        For purposes of the corporate laws of Ohio, "fair cash value" is the
amount which a willing seller, under no compulsion to sell, would be willing to
accept, and which a willing buyer, under no compulsion to purchase, would be
willing to pay, but in no event may the fair cash value exceed the amount
specified

in the demand. The fair cash value is to be determined as of the date prior to
the day of the vote on the approval of the issuance of Kroll common stock in the
merger. In computing this value, any appreciation or depreciation in the market
value of the shares of Kroll common stock for which dissenters' rights have been
asserted resulting from the merger is excluded.

        Upon motion of the complainant, the Common Pleas Court will hold a
hearing to determine whether the dissenting shareholder is entitled to be paid
the fair cash value of his or her Kroll shares. If the Common Pleas Court finds
that the dissenting shareholder is so entitled, it may appoint one or more
appraisers to receive evidence and to recommend a decision on the amount of that
value. The Common Pleas Court is required to make a finding as to the fair cash
value of the shares of Kroll common stock for which dissenters' rights have been
asserted and to render a judgment against Kroll for the payment thereof, with
interest at a rate and from a date that the Common Pleas Court considers
equitable. Costs of the proceedings, including reasonable compensation to the
appraiser or appraisers to be fixed by the Common Pleas Court, are to be
apportioned or assessed as the Common Pleas Court considers equitable. Payment
of the fair cash value of the shares of Kroll common stock is required to be
made within 30 days after the date of final determination of the fair cash value
or the effective time of the merger, whichever is later, only upon surrender to
Kroll of the certificates representing the shares of Kroll common stock for
which payment is made.

        Please note that following delivery to Kroll of written demand for
dissenters' rights, Kroll may require dissenting shareholders to deliver their
certificates representing the dissenting shares to it so that Kroll can have
those certificates legended to the effect that the holders of those certificates
have demanded dissenters' rights. If Kroll so requests, dissenting shareholders
must deliver their certificates for legending to Kroll within 15 days after the
date of Kroll's request. As a result, the shares of dissenting shareholders may
be less transferable. If dissenting shareholders do not deliver their
certificates for legending to Kroll at Kroll's request within the 15-day period,
Kroll may, at its option, terminate the dissenters' rights of those holders by
delivering written notice of that termination within 20 days after the
expiration of the 15-day period.

        The rights of any dissenting shareholder will terminate if, among other
things:

        (1) the dissenting shareholder has not complied with Section 1701.85,
unless the Kroll board of directors waives compliance;

        (2) the merger is abandoned or otherwise not carried out or the
dissenting shareholder withdraws the demand with the consent of the Kroll board
of directors;

        (3) no agreement has been reached between Kroll and the dissenting
shareholder regarding the fair cash value of the shares of Kroll common stock
for which dissenters' rights have been asserted and no complaint has been timely
filed in the Common Pleas Court; or

        (4) the dissenting shareholder fails to deliver certificates for
dissenting shares at Kroll's request within the 15-day period and, as a result,
Kroll chooses to terminate that shareholder's dissenters' rights.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

General

        This section describes the material provisions of the merger agreement,
as amended. The full text of the merger agreement and the amendment to the
merger agreement are attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as
Annexes A-1 and A-2, respectively, and are incorporated by reference in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus. We encourage shareholders to read the merger
agreement, as amended, in its entirety. In addition, important information about
the merger agreement, as amended, and the merger is provided in the previous
section entitled "The Merger."

The Merger

        The merger agreement, as amended, provides for the merger of ODI
Acquisition, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kroll, with and into Ontrack in
accordance with Minnesota law. As a result of the merger, Ontrack will survive
the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kroll and the separate existence of
ODI Acquisition will cease.

Effective Time

        The merger will become effective when Ontrack and ODI Acquisition file a
certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of Minnesota. Unless the
merger agreement is terminated, the certificate of merger will be filed as soon
as possible, but no later than two business days after the satisfaction or
waiver of the closing conditions contained in the merger agreement, unless
otherwise agreed to by the parties. Please see " - Conditions to Completion of
the Merger" and " - Termination."

Merger Consideration

        Exchange Ratio

        In the merger, each share of Ontrack common stock outstanding
immediately prior to the merger, except as described below under "Cancellation,"
will be converted into the right to receive shares of Kroll common stock.
Ontrack shareholders should not send stock certificates with the enclosed proxy.

        The number of shares of Kroll common stock that will be received by a
holder of Ontrack common stock is based on the following formula:

        o       Each share of Ontrack common stock will be converted into the
                right to receive the fraction of one share of Kroll common stock
                equal to the product of one and a fraction, the numerator of
                which is $12.50 and the denominator of which is the average
                stock price;

        o       If the average stock price of Kroll common stock is equal to or
                more than $19.3886, each share of Ontrack common stock will be
                converted into the right to receive 0.6447 of a share of Kroll
                common stock;

        o       If the average stock price of Kroll common stock is equal to or
                less than $15.8634, each share of Ontrack common stock will be
                converted into the right to receive 0.7880 of a share of Kroll
                common stock. However, if this average price is less than
                $15.8634, the Ontrack board of directors can terminate the
                merger agreement unless Kroll agrees to deliver to Ontrack
                shareholders Kroll common stock calculated to have a value equal
                to $12.50, based on the volume weighted average price of Kroll
                over the period of 20 consecutive trading days

                ending three trading days before the vote of the Ontrack
                shareholders at the Ontrack special meeting, for each share of
                Ontrack common stock. See " - Termination."

        For purposes of this formula, average stock price means the volume
weighted average price of Kroll common stock on the Nasdaq National Market for
the 20 consecutive trading days ending three trading days before the vote of the
Ontrack shareholders at the Ontrack special meeting.

        Fractional Shares of Kroll Common Stock

        Kroll will not issue any fractional shares of common stock in connection
with the merger. Instead, each holder of Ontrack common stock exchanged in
connection with the merger who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction
of a share of common stock of Kroll will receive cash, without interest, in an
amount equal to the product of the fractional share interest to which that
holder would otherwise be entitled and the average stock price of Kroll common
stock.

        Exchange of Ontrack Common Stock for Kroll Common Stock

        Promptly following completion of the merger, Kroll will appoint an
exchange agent. No later than five business days after the merger, the exchange
agent will mail to each record holder of Ontrack common stock a letter of
transmittal and instructions for surrendering the record holder's stock
certificates in exchange for a certificate or certificates representing Kroll
common stock. Only those Ontrack shareholders who properly surrender their
Ontrack stock certificates in accordance with the exchange agent's instructions
will receive:

        o       a certificate or certificates representing Kroll common stock;
        o       cash in lieu of any fractional share of Kroll common stock; and
        o       dividends or other distributions, if any, to which they are
                entitled under the terms of the merger agreement.

        The surrendered certificates representing Ontrack common stock will be
cancelled. After the completion of the merger, each certificate representing
shares of Ontrack common stock that has not been surrendered will represent only
the right to receive each of the items enumerated in the preceding sentence.
Following the completion of the merger, Ontrack will not register any transfers
of Ontrack common stock on its stock transfer books.

        Ontrack shareholders should not send in their Ontrack stock certificates
until they receive a letter of transmittal from the exchange agent with
instructions for the surrender of the Ontrack certificates.

        Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares

        Ontrack shareholders are not entitled to receive any dividends or other
distributions on Kroll common stock until the merger is completed. After the
merger is completed, holders of Ontrack stock certificates will be entitled to
dividends and other distributions declared or made after completion of the
merger with respect to the number of whole shares of Kroll common stock which
they are entitled to receive upon exchange of their Ontrack stock certificates,
but they will not be paid any dividends or other distributions on the Kroll
common stock until they surrender their Ontrack stock certificates to the
exchange agent in accordance with the merger agreement and the exchange agent's
instructions.

        Return of Exchange Fund

        After the six month anniversary of the completion of the merger, all of
the shares of Kroll common stock and cash held by the exchange agent that remain
unclaimed by Ontrack shareholders will be returned to Kroll if Kroll so
requests. If an Ontrack shareholder has not complied with the procedures
necessary for exchange and payment prior to such time, that shareholder may look
only to Kroll, and not the exchange agent, for that exchange and payment. In any
event, Kroll or the exchange agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the shares of Kroll stock and cash otherwise payable to an Ontrack shareholder
the amounts that they are required to deduct and withhold by any provision of
the Internal Revenue Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law.
None of the exchange agent, Kroll, ODI Acquisition or Ontrack will be liable for
any amount paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable escheat or
similar law.

        Transfers of Ownership and Lost Stock Certificates

        Kroll will only issue a certificate or certificates representing whole
shares of Kroll common stock, cash instead of any fractional share and any
applicable dividends or other distributions in a name other than the name in
which a surrendered Ontrack stock certificate is registered if the person
requesting the exchange presents to the exchange agent all documents required to
show and affect the unrecorded transfer of ownership and to show that such
person paid any applicable stock transfer taxes. If a holder's Ontrack stock
certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, an Ontrack shareholder will
nevertheless be entitled to the merger consideration if the shareholder signs an
affidavit of loss. Kroll also may, in its discretion, require Ontrack
shareholders to deliver a bond in an amount sufficient to protect Kroll, the
surviving corporation and the exchange agent against claims related to their
lost Ontrack stock certificates.

        Cancellation

        Each share of Ontrack common stock held in Ontrack's treasury and each
share of Ontrack common stock owned by Kroll, if any, immediately prior to
completion of the merger will be cancelled and retired without payment of any
consideration.

Representations and Warranties

        The merger agreement, as amended, contains various customary
representations and warranties by Kroll, ODI Acquisition and Ontrack about
themselves and their respective subsidiaries.

Conduct of Business by Ontrack and Kroll

        Ontrack and Kroll have agreed to conduct their business and their
subsidiaries' businesses in the usual, regular and ordinary course in
substantially the same manner as conducted before the date of the merger
agreement, including using commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact
their and their respective subsidiaries' business organizations; keeping
available the service of their and their respective subsidiaries' present
officers and key employees; and preserving their and their respective
subsidiaries' relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors, licensors,
licensees and other parties with whom it or its subsidiaries have business
dealings, so that their goodwill and ongoing businesses are not impaired at the
time of the merger in any material respect.

        Except as otherwise permitted by the merger agreement, as amended, or as
consented to in writing by Kroll, the merger agreement, as amended, prohibits
Ontrack and any of its subsidiaries from taking specific actions, including:

        o       amending its articles of incorporation or bylaws;

        o       declaring or paying any dividends on or making any other

                adverse effect on Ontrack, impair in any material respect
                Ontrack's ability to perform its obligations under the merger
                agreement, or prevent or materially delay the consummation of
                the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

        o       entering into any material contract if the merger or compliance
                by Ontrack or any of its subsidiaries with the terms of the
                merger agreement could reasonably be expected to cause a
                violation, breach, termination, cancellation or acceleration of
                any obligation or a loss of benefit under that contract, or
                result in the creation of lien on the properties or assets of
                Ontrack or give rise to any increased, additional, accelerated
                or guaranteed right of any third party;

        o       entering into any contract containing any restriction on the
                ability of Ontrack or any of its subsidiaries to assign its
                rights or obligations under such contract, unless that
                restriction expressly excludes an assignment to Kroll or its
                subsidiaries;

        o       entering into any contract containing any restriction on the
                ability of Ontrack or any of its subsidiaries to compete in any
                line of business;

                Employee Stock Purchase Plan;

        o       transferring or licensing or extending, amending or modifying in

        o       taking or agreeing to take in writing any action that would
                prevent it from performing any of its covenants under the merger
                agreement.

        Except as otherwise permitted by the merger agreement, as amended, or as
consented to in writing by Ontrack, the merger agreement, as amended, prohibits
Kroll and any of its subsidiaries from taking specific actions, including:

        o       amending its amended and restated articles of incorporation or
                code of regulations, except that Kroll may take any action

        o       declaring or paying any cash dividends on or making any other
                cash distributions on any of its capital stock, except that
                Kroll's subsidiaries may pay cash dividends or make other cash
                distributions to Kroll or other parent entities, and except as
                may be required by an agreement in effect on the date of the
                merger agreement;

        o       splitting, combining, recapitalizing or reclassifying any of its
                capital stock;

        o       issuing or authorizing the issuance of any other securities in
                respect of or in substitution for, shares of its capital stock;

        o       entering into, modifying, amending or terminating any contract,
                agreement, license, instrument, document or commitment in a
                manner which could reasonably be expected to have a material
                adverse effect on Kroll, impair in any material respect Kroll's
                ability to perform its obligations under the merger agreement,
                or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
                transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

        o       entering into any material contract if the merger or compliance
                by Kroll or any of its subsidiaries with the terms of the merger
                agreement could reasonably be expected to cause a violation,
                breach, termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
                obligation or a loss of benefit under that contract, or result
                in the creation of lien on the properties or assets of Kroll or
                give rise to any increased, additional, accelerated or
                guaranteed right of any third party;

        o       taking or agreeing to take in writing any of the actions
                described above;

        o       taking or agreeing to take in writing any action that would make
                any of its representations or warranties untrue or incorrect in
                any material respect; or

        o       taking or agreeing to take in writing any action that would
                prevent it from performing any of its covenants under the merger
                agreement.

No Solicitation

        Ontrack has agreed that it will not, directly or indirectly, through any
officer, director, employee representative or agent, (1) solicit, initiate,
facilitate, continue or encourage the initiation of any inquiries that could
lead to, (2) negotiate or discuss, or provide any non-public information to any
third party relating to, (3) enter into an agreement for or make any statement,
recommendation or solicitation in support of, or (4) agree to or enter into a
letter of intent for or recommend, an acquisition proposal. The merger agreement
defines "acquisition proposal" as any merger, consolidation, business
combination, sale of substantial assets, sale of shares of capital stock or
other securities, including a tender offer, or similar transaction involving
Ontrack or any of its subsidiaries, other than transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement.

        If Ontrack's board of directors, after consultation with independent
legal advisors, determines in good faith that its fiduciary duties under
applicable law require it to do so, it may:

        o       furnish non-public information to or enter into discussions or
                negotiations with a third party that has made an unsolicited
                bona fide written acquisition proposal if Ontrack's board of
                directors determines in good faith after consulting with
                independent financial and legal advisors that the acquisition
                proposal (1) is reasonably capable of being completed on the
                terms proposed and (2) after taking into account the strategic
                benefits anticipated to be derived from the merger and the
                long-term prospects of Kroll and Ontrack as a combined company,
                would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to
                Ontrack's shareholders from a financial point of view than the
                merger, provided that (x) the third party has executed an
                agreement with confidentiality provisions no less favorable to
                Ontrack and no more favorable to the third party than the
                confidentiality agreement in effect between Ontrack and Kroll,
                (y) the non-public information being furnished has previously
                been delivered to Kroll and (z) Ontrack notifies Kroll of these
                actions in writing; and

        o       comply with the applicable rules regarding tender offers in
                connection with an acquisition proposal.

        Ontrack further agreed:

        o       upon execution of the merger agreement, to terminate any
                existing discussions or negotiations of an acquisition proposal
                with any third party that were ongoing at the time;

        o       to notify Kroll orally and in writing immediately after receipt
                of any acquisition proposal or any request for nonpublic
                information in connection with an acquisition proposal or for
                access to the properties, books and records of Ontrack or any of
                its subsidiaries;

        o       to disclose to Kroll in reasonable detail the terms of all
                acquisition proposals or requests for information or access,
                including the identity of the person making the acquisition
                proposal or request; and

        o       to keep Kroll informed on a current basis of the status and
                details of any acquisition proposal or any discussions or
                negotiations.

        In addition, Ontrack agreed that it will not accept or enter into any
agreement, letter of intent or similar document relating to an acquisition
proposal for at least 72 hours after Kroll receives notice of the material terms
of the acquisition proposal and the identity of the person making the
acquisition proposal. During this 72-hour period, Ontrack will negotiate in good
faith with Kroll regarding any proposal submitted by Kroll in response to the
acquisition proposal.

        Ontrack also agreed to ensure that the officers, directors and
affiliates of Ontrack and its subsidiaries and any investment banker or other
financial advisor or representative retained by Ontrack or its subsidiaries are
aware of the no-solicitation restrictions described above.

Other Material Covenants

        Indemnification and Insurance

        For six years following the merger:

        o       Ontrack will include in its articles of incorporation and bylaws
                indemnification provisions that are no less favorable than the
                provisions currently set forth in its articles of incorporation
                and bylaws, and such provisions will not be amended, modified or
                otherwise repealed in any way that would adversely affect the
                rights of individuals who are current or former directors,
                officers or employees of Ontrack at the time the merger is
                completed, unless otherwise required by law; and

        o       Ontrack and Kroll will indemnify and hold harmless each present
                and former director, officer or employee of Ontrack against all
                losses and damages in connection with any lawsuit, claim or
                investigation arising out of or pertaining to the transactions
                contemplated by the merger agreement or otherwise with respect
                to any acts or omissions occurring at or before the date the
                merger is completed, to the same extent as provided in Ontrack's
                articles of incorporation or bylaws as in effect on the date of
                the merger agreement.

        In addition, for a period of not less than six years after the merger,
Kroll and Ontrack will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain in effect
directors' and officers' liability insurance covering those persons who are
currently covered by Ontrack's existing directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies on terms that are substantially similar to the terms
applicable under those existing policies with respect to claims arising from and
related to facts or events which occurred on or before the date the merger is
completed. Kroll and Ontrack will not be required to pay more than $300,000 for
this coverage for the six-year period.

        Consents; Cooperation

        Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger
agreement, as amended, Kroll and Ontrack will promptly apply for and use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, all consents and approvals required
to be obtained for the completion of the merger, and will use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals under
any of their respective material contracts in connection with the merger. The
parties have agreed to consult with and provide necessary information to one
another in connection with any submission by a party in connection proceedings
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act or any other federal, state or foreign antitrust
law, and to use commercially

reasonable efforts to take all actions that may be required to cause the
expiration of the notice periods under applicable antitrust laws as promptly as
possible after the date of the merger agreement.

        Each party will use commercially reasonably efforts to resolve
objections, if any, asserted by any governmental authority under applicable
antitrust laws, including cooperation and commercially reasonable efforts to
contest and resist any administrative or judicial action or proceeding that may
be commenced by any governmental authority. Neither party is required to
litigate or contest such a proceeding beyond the earlier of August 31, 2002 or
the date of a ruling preliminarily enjoining the merger issued by a court of
competent jurisdiction.

        However, these obligations will not require either party to agree to
divest itself of any subsidiary, division or business unit that is material to
the business of that party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the
divestiture of which would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse
effect on that party or on the benefits intended to be derived as a result of
the merger.

        Shareholder Meetings

        Ontrack will call a shareholders meeting that will be held within 45
days of the date the registration statement, of which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is a part, is declared effective by the SEC. However,
Ontrack may adjourn the meeting, although not beyond August 31, 2002, until the
following conditions to the completion of the merger have been satisfied or
waived or are reasonably expected to be satisfied or waived within two business
days:

        o       no temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent
                injunction or other court order preventing the completion of the
                merger is in effect;

        o       no proceeding brought by a governmental authority seeking to
                restrain or prohibit the merger is pending;

        o       no action has been taken nor has any statute, rule, regulation
                or order been enacted, enforced or deemed applicable to the
                merger by a governmental authority, which makes the consummation
                of the merger illegal;

        o       all necessary governmental approvals, waivers and consents in
                connection with the merger and the transactions contemplated by
                the merger agreement have been timely obtained and all waiting
                periods under applicable antitrust laws have expired or
                terminated;

        o       Kroll must have filed with the Nasdaq National Market an
                application for listing of additional shares for the shares of
                Kroll common stock issuable in exchange for Ontrack common stock
                and upon exercise of the options under the Ontrack stock option
                plans assumed by Kroll in the merger; and

        o       no suit, action or proceeding by a governmental entity is
                pending that seeks to prohibit or limit in any material respect
                the ownership or operation by Ontrack, Kroll or their affiliates
                of a material portion of their business or assets, or to require
                any of them to dispose of or hold separate any material portion
                of the business or assets of Ontrack or Kroll and their
                subsidiaries, in each case taken as a whole, as a result of the
                merger, or that seeks to prohibit Kroll or any of its affiliates
                from effectively controlling in any material respect a material
                portion of the business or operations of Ontrack.

        Kroll will call a shareholders meeting that will be held within 45 days
of the date the registration statement, of which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is a part, is declared effective by the SEC. However, Kroll
may adjourn the meeting until the following conditions to completion of the
merger have been satisfied or waived or are reasonably expected to be satisfied
or waived within two business days:

        o       no temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent
                injunction or other court order preventing the completion of the
                merger is in effect;

        o       no proceeding brought by a governmental authority seeking to
                restrain or prohibit the merger is pending;

        o       no action has been taken nor has any statute, rule, regulation
                or order been enacted, enforced or deemed applicable to the
                merger by a governmental authority, which makes the consummation
                of the merger illegal;

        o       all necessary governmental approvals, waivers and consents in
                connection with the merger and the transactions contemplated by
                the merger agreement have been timely obtained and all waiting
                periods under applicable antitrust laws have expired or
                terminated; and

        o       no suit, action or proceeding by a governmental entity is
                pending that seeks to prohibit or limit in any material respect
                the ownership or operation by Ontrack, Kroll or their affiliates
                of any material portion of their business or assets, or that
                seeks to prohibit Kroll or any of its affiliates from
                effectively controlling in any material respect a material
                portion of the business or operations of Ontrack, or that seeks
                to impose material limitations on Kroll's ability to acquire and
                exercise full ownership rights of any shares of Ontrack common
                stock.

        Tax Treatment

        None of Ontrack, Kroll or ODI Acquisition will take any action that, to
their knowledge, would cause the merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization
under section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

        Kroll Common Stock

        Before completing the merger, Kroll will prepare and file with the
Nasdaq National Market an application for the listing of additional shares with
respect to the shares of Kroll common stock to be issued in the merger.

        Treatment of Ontrack Stock Options and the Ontrack 2001 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan

        All options to purchase shares of Ontrack common stock outstanding at
the time of completion of the merger will become fully vested and exercisable
immediately prior to the merger. All shares of Ontrack common stock acquired
upon exercise of options prior to completion of the merger will be converted
into Kroll common stock in the merger. All unexercised options to purchase
shares of Ontrack common stock that remain outstanding upon completion of the
merger will be assumed by Kroll. The number of shares and the exercise price per
share of the Kroll option will be determined based on the same exchange ratio
applicable to the conversion of Ontrack common stock in the merger. See " -
Merger Consideration - Exchange Ratio." Within ten business days after the date
the merger is completed, Kroll will file a registration statement on Form S-8 to
register its shares subject to the assumed options.

        All outstanding purchase rights under the Ontrack 2001 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan will automatically be exercised on the last business day of the
pay period immediately preceding the completion of the merger, and each
participant in the plan will be issued shares of Ontrack common stock in
accordance with the terms of the plan. These shares of Ontrack common stock will
then be automatically converted into the right to receive shares of Kroll common
stock in the merger on the same exchange ratio applicable to the conversion of
Ontrack common stock in the merger. See " - Merger Consideration - Exchange
Ratio." Ontrack will terminate the plan on the last business day of the pay
period immediately preceding the completion of the merger, and no purchase
rights will be granted after the termination of the plan.

        Employee Benefits

        From the date on which the merger is completed until December 31, 2002,
all Ontrack employees will continue to participate in the Ontrack employee
benefit plans in which they participated prior to the merger, other than the
Ontrack 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which will be terminated as described
above. Kroll will cause Ontrack to continue in force and honor all 2002 Ontrack
incentive plans through December 31, 2002. Calculation of incentive compensation
payable under incentive plans will be based on the stand-alone results of
operations and financial condition of Ontrack following the merger, excluding
the effect of all merger-related costs and benefits on the results of Ontrack.

        Thomas P. Skiba and Paul D. Fabel and seven other key employees of
Ontrack will each receive options to purchase shares of Kroll common stock upon
completion of the merger. The total number of options to purchase shares of
Kroll common stock issued to these employees under the merger agreement is
300,000. Additionally, following completion of the merger, the annual base
salaries of these employees will not be reduced below their annual base salaries
in effect on the date of the merger agreement. Under the terms of his employment
agreement, upon completion of the merger, Ben F. Allen will also receive options
to purchase 100,000 shares of Kroll common stock.

        Upon completion of the merger, Ontrack will pay to Mr. John M. Bujan
severance obligations due under his employment agreement in an amount equal to
$295,985 in cash. In consideration of this payment, Mr. Bujan's employment
arrangements with Ontrack will be terminated and he will execute a written
release releasing Ontrack from all liabilities and obligations to make severance
or similar payments. However, Mr. Bujan will continue as an at-will employee of
Ontrack following the merger. All options to purchase shares of Ontrack common
stock held by Mr. Bujan will be assumed by Kroll, as described above, and will
be exercisable for a period of three years following completion of the merger.
Under the terms of their employment agreements, Mr. Skiba and Mr. Fabel will
receive payments of $262,500 and $66,250, respectively, in satisfaction of
existing severance obligations.

        These provisions are subject to the limitations and qualifications set
forth in the merger agreement and may not be enforced by any employee of
Ontrack.

                        within 15 days of notice of breach; or

                o       the other party fails to perform or comply in all
                        material respects with a covenant, obligation or
                        condition obtained in the merger agreement and the
                        failure is not cured within 15 days of notice of breach.

       3.      By Kroll, if:

                o       the Ontrack board of directors has withdrawn or modified
                        its recommendation of the merger agreement or the merger
                        in a manner adverse to Kroll;

                o       the Ontrack board of directors fails to reaffirm its
                        recommendation of the merger agreement or the merger
                        within ten business days after Kroll requests this
                        reaffirmation at any time following the public
                        announcement of an acquisition proposal;

                o       the Ontrack board of directors has recommended to the
                        Ontrack shareholders any transaction which could result
                        in a party other than Kroll acquiring 15% or more of the
                        equity or assets of Ontrack;

                o       a party other than Kroll commences a tender offer or
                        exchange offer for 15% or more of the outstanding shares
                        of Ontrack common stock and the Ontrack board of
                        directors has not sent to its security holders pursuant
                        to Rule 14e-2 of the Securities Exchange Act, within ten
                        business days after the offer is first published, sent
                        or given, a statement that Ontrack recommends rejection
                        of the offer; or

                o       Ontrack fails to call and hold the meeting of its
                        shareholders to adopt and approve the merger agreement
                        and the merger within 45 days after Kroll's registration
                        statement on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy
                        statement/prospectus is a part, is declared effective by
                        the SEC, provided that this declaration occurs on or
                        before August 31, 2002, except that Ontrack may adjourn
                        the meeting until specified conditions to completion of
                        the merger have been satisfied or waived or are
                        reasonably expected to be satisfied or waived within two
                        business days.

        4.      By Ontrack, if:

                o       it proposes to accept a superior proposal and pays to
                        Kroll the required termination fee, so long as the
                        Ontrack board of directors has otherwise complied with
                        the no solicitation provisions of the merger agreement.
                        The merger agreement defines a "superior proposal" as an
                        alternative acquisition proposal which the Ontrack board
                        of directors determines in good faith, after
                        consultation with independent financial and legal
                        advisors, (1) is reasonably capable of being completed
                        on the terms proposed and (2) would result in a
                        transaction more favorable to Ontrack shareholders from
                        a financial point of view than the proposed merger;

                o       the volume weighted average price of Kroll common stock
                        for the 20 consecutive trading days ending three trading
                        days before the vote of the Ontrack shareholders at the
                        Ontrack special meeting is less than $15.8634; provided
                        that (1) it delivers written notice to Kroll no later
                        than two trading days before the Ontrack special meeting
                        that it is terminating the agreement for this reason and
                        (2) Kroll has not agreed in writing at least one trading
                        day prior to the vote of the Ontrack shareholders at the
                        Ontrack special meeting to deliver to Ontrack
                        shareholders Kroll common stock having a value, based on
                        the average stock price of Kroll common stock determined
                        as described above, of at least $12.50 for each share of
                        Ontrack common stock; or

                o       if the Kroll board of directors shall have withdrawn or
                        modified its recommendation of the issuance of Kroll
                        common stock in the merger in a manner adverse to
                        Ontrack.

        Fees and Expenses; Termination Fee

        Except as described below, whether or not the merger is completed, all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the
related transactions will be paid by the party incurring the expense. However,
Kroll and Ontrack will share equally all fees and expenses, other than
accountants' and attorneys' fees, incurred in relation to the printing and
filing of Kroll's registration statement on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is a part, any related preliminary materials, financial
statements, exhibits and any amendments or supplements. Kroll will pay the SEC
registration fee for the registration statement and each party shall bear the
expense of mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus and any other materials
to its own shareholders.

        Ontrack will pay Kroll a termination fee of $4,200,000 within two
business days after termination of the merger agreement by Kroll as a result of
one of the following events:

        o       the Ontrack board of directors has withdrawn or modified its
                recommendation of the merger agreement and the merger;

        o       the Ontrack board of directors has failed to reaffirm its
                recommendation of the merger agreement and the merger within ten
                business days of a Kroll request for the same at any time
                following the public announcement of an acquisition proposal;

        o       the Ontrack board of directors has recommended to the Ontrack
                shareholders a transaction which could result in a party other
                than Kroll acquiring 15% or more of the equity or assets of
                Ontrack; o a party other than Kroll commences a tender offer or
                exchange offer for 15% or more of the outstanding shares of
                Ontrack common stock and the Ontrack board of directors has not
                sent to its security holders pursuant to Rule 14e-2 of the
                Securities Exchange Act, within ten business days after the
                offer is first published, sent or given, a statement that
                Ontrack recommends rejection of the offer; or

        o       Ontrack fails to call and hold the meeting of its shareholders
                to adopt and approve the merger agreement and the merger within
                45 days after Kroll's registration statement on Form S-4, of
                which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part, is
                declared effective by the SEC, provided such declaration occurs
                on or before August 31, 2002, except that Ontrack may adjourn
                the meeting until specified conditions to completion of the
                merger have been satisfied or waived or are reasonably expected
                to be satisfied or waived within two business days.

        If Ontrack terminates the merger agreement because it proposes to accept
a superior proposal, the termination fee will be paid to Kroll simultaneously
with the termination.

        If the merger agreement is terminated by Kroll because of a breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant of Ontrack, Ontrack will pay Kroll's and
ODI Acquisition's out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the merger
agreement, including the fees and expenses of financial advisors, accountants
and legal counsel and printing and filing and mailing fees and expenses, within
two business days of such termination. If the merger agreement is terminated by
Ontrack because of a breach of a representation, warranty or covenant of Kroll
or ODI Acquisition, or because Kroll's board of directors has withdrawn or
modified its recommendation of the issuance of Kroll stock in connection with
the merger, Kroll will pay all of Ontrack's out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with the merger agreement, including the fees and expenses of
financial advisors, accountants and legal counsel and printing and filing and
mailing fees and expenses, within two business days of such termination.

Amendment and Waiver; Parties in Interest

        The merger agreement, as amended, may be amended by the parties by
action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards of directors at any time
prior to the completion of the merger. However, after the Ontrack shareholders
and the Kroll shareholders approve, respectively, the merger agreement, as
amended, and merger and the issuance of Kroll common stock in connection with
the merger, no amendment may be made which by applicable law requires further
shareholder approval unless that shareholder approval is obtained.

         At any time prior to the completion of the merger, any party to the
merger agreement may, to the extent legally allowed:

        o       extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
                acts of the other parties to the merger agreement;

        o       waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
                made to such party contained in the merger agreement or in any
                document delivered pursuant to the merger agreement; or

        o       waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for
                its benefit contained in the merger agreement.

        The merger agreement, as amended, is binding upon and inures solely to
the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement, and nothing in the merger
agreement, as amended, confers, or is intended to confer, upon any other person
any right or remedy under the merger agreement, as amended, or otherwise, other
than the rights of holders of Ontrack common stock to receive the merger
consideration and the indemnification and insurance obligations of Kroll and
Ontrack following the completion of the merger, which are intended for the
benefit of specific officers and directors of Ontrack.

                              THE VOTING AGREEMENT

        As an inducement to Kroll to enter into the merger agreement, on April
1, 2002, each of Michael W. Rogers, Rogers Family Limited Partnership, John E.
Pence and Pence Family Limited Partnership entered into a separate voting
agreement with Kroll. Collectively, Mr. Rogers, the Rogers Partnership, Mr.
Pence and the Pence Partnership own a total of 2,789,691 shares of Ontrack
common stock, not including options, which are also covered by the voting
agreement, which represents approximately 27% of the outstanding voting power of
Ontrack, as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

        Under the terms of the voting agreements, Mr. Rogers, the Rogers
Partnership, Mr. Pence and the Pence Partnership have agreed, among other
things, to vote all of the Ontrack common stock owned of record or beneficially
owned by them or over which they otherwise have voting control:

        o       in favor of the adoption and approval of the merger agreement
                and the merger;

        o       against any other acquisition proposal involving Ontrack;

        o       against any proposal that could impair Ontrack's ability to
                perform its obligations under the merger agreement or prevent or
                delay completing the merger; and

        o       in favor of adoption and approval of the Ontrack 2001 Employee
                Stock Purchase Plan.

        Mr. Rogers, the Rogers Partnership, Mr. Pence and the Pence Partnership
have also granted irrevocable proxies to Kroll to vote all of the Ontrack shares
owned by them at any Ontrack meeting for or against the proposals described
above.

        In addition, these Ontrack shareholders have agreed not to transfer or
encumber any of the Ontrack shares owned by them unless the transferee agrees in
writing to be bound by the terms of the voting agreements and the irrevocable
proxies.

        The voting agreements will terminate upon the earlier to occur of the
termination of the merger agreement or the completion of the merger.

        The form of the voting agreements has been filed as an exhibit to the
registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a
part. Shareholders should refer to the full text of the form of the voting
agreements for a complete understanding of their terms.

        Kroll anticipates that any future earnings will be retained to finance
its operations and for the growth and development of its business. Accordingly,
Kroll does not anticipate paying cash dividends on its shares of common stock
for the foreseeable future. Additionally, the terms of its senior secured
subordinated convertible notes provide that Kroll cannot pay dividends other
than stock dividends, and the terms of Kroll's revolving credit facility require
maintenance of financial ratios and other covenants, which limit the funds
available for cash dividends. The payment of any future dividends will be
subject to the discretion of Kroll's board of directors and will depend on its
results of operations, financial position and capital requirements, general
business conditions, restrictions imposed by financing arrangements, if any,
legal restrictions on the payment of dividends and other factors its board of
directors deems relevant.

        Ontrack paid no dividends in 2001 and 2000. Under the merger agreement,
Ontrack cannot pay cash dividends without the prior written consent of Kroll. If
the merger is completed, the payment of any future dividends will be determined
by Kroll. If the merger is not completed, Ontrack does not anticipate paying any
cash dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future because Ontrack
would intend to retain any future earnings for use in business development.

        On April 1, 2002, the last trading day prior to the public announcement
of the proposed merger, the closing prices of Kroll common stock and Ontrack
common stock reported on the Nasdaq National Market were $17.10 per share and
$9.71 per share, respectively. On _______, 2002, the most recent practicable
date prior to the printing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the closing
prices of Kroll common stock and Ontrack common stock on the Nasdaq National
Market were $     and $     , respectively. Shareholders should obtain current
market quotations prior to making any decision with respect to the merger.

          UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

        The following unaudited pro forma condensed combining financial
statements give pro forma effect to the merger using the purchase method of
accounting and the assumptions and adjustments set forth in the accompanying
notes to the pro forma condensed combining financial statements. This
presentation assumes the issuance of 7,638,748 shares of Kroll common stock in
connection with the merger. This assumption is based on an exchange ratio of
0.7389, which is calculated using an average stock price of Kroll of $16.916,
equal to the average of Kroll stock prices beginning two days before the public
announcement of the merger agreement and ending two days later. The actual
exchange ratio for the merger will be determined based on the volume weighted
average price of Kroll's common stock over a a period of 20 consecutive trading
days ending three trading days before the vote of the Ontrack shareholders at
the Ontrack special meeting.

        The purchase price has been allocated based on preliminary estimates of
the fair market value of Ontrack's assets and liabilities. See Note 1 to the
Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combining Financial Statements. The pro
forma adjustments are subject to change pending a final analysis of the fair
values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The impact of these
changes could be material.

        For purposes of Kroll's accounting and financial reporting, after the
completion of the merger, the value of the shares of Kroll common stock being
issued to Ontrack stockholders in the merger will be determined by multiplying
the number of shares of Kroll common stock being issued by the average of Kroll
stock prices beginning two days before the measurement date, approximating the
date the merger is completed, and ending two days later.

Periods Covered

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combining balance sheet as of December
31, 2001 is based on the individual historical balance sheets of Kroll and
Ontrack and gives effect to the merger as if it had occurred on December 31,
2001. The unaudited pro forma condensed combining statement of operations for
the year ended December 31, 2001 is based on the individual historical
statements of operations of Kroll and Ontrack and combines the results of
operations of Kroll and Ontrack for the year ended December 31, 2001, as if the
merger had occurred as of January 1, 2001.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combining financial statements are
based on estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are
preliminary and have been made solely for purposes of developing this pro forma
information. Unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information is presented
for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the
operating results that would have been achieved if the acquisition of Ontrack
had been consummated as of the beginning of the period indicated, nor is it
necessarily indicative of future results of operations. The pro forma condensed
combining financial information does not give effect to any cost savings or
restructuring and integration costs that may result from the integration of
Kroll's and Ontrack's businesses. Costs related to restructuring and integration
have not yet been determined.

        This unaudited pro forma condensed combining financial information is
based upon the respective historical audited consolidated financial statements
of Kroll and Ontrack and related notes incorporated by reference in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus and should be read in conjunction with those
statements and the related notes.

1.       Allocation of Purchase Price

        The allocation of Ontrack's purchase price among the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed is based on preliminary estimates of the fair market value.
These estimates of fair market value could change based on the completion of
Kroll's evaluation of the assets and liabilities of Ontrack, including
finalization of an independent appraisal of the assets acquired.

        The following table sets forth the components of the estimated purchase
price (in thousands):

             Common Stock issued.............................    $129,217
             Options issued*...............................        10,171
             Accrued transaction costs.......................       4,500
                                                                 --------
             Total purchase price........................        $143,888
                                                                 ========

               *The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of
               grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the
               following assumptions used for grants:

               Description
               --------------------
               Dividend yield               -
               Expected volatility          72.9%
               Risk-free interest rate      3.72%
               Expected lives               1 year

        The following table provides the preliminary allocation of the purchase
price based upon Ontrack's December 31, 2001 balance sheet (in thousands):

      Assets
             Cash, cash equivalents, marketable
             securities and accounts receivable.............   $ 39,415

          related to internally developed
          software ........................................       6,200

      Liabilities
             Accounts payable and other accrued liabilities      (6,091)
                                                                -------
      Total purchase price..................................   $143,888
                                                               ========

        In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations, and No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001. Under the new rules, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to
have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual

impairment tests in accordance with the Statements. Other intangible assets will
continue to be amortized over their useful lives.

        In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, Kroll will not
amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives recorded in this
acquisition. Kroll expects to perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and
indefinite lived intangible assets related to the merger.

2.      Pro Forma Adjustments (in thousands)

(a)     Total costs in excess of assets and other intangible assets acquired by
        Kroll in connection with the purchase of Ontrack:

Adjustment to calculate goodwill and other intangible assets and to allocate the
purchase price to the estimated fair value of Ontrack net assets acquired:

(b)     Estimated transaction costs to be incurred by Kroll in its acquisition
        of Ontrack.

(c)     Elimination of outstanding equity balances of Ontrack as of December 31,
        2001.

(d)     Issuance of Kroll's common stock for the acquisition of Ontrack, based
        on an average stock price for Kroll common stock . The average stock
        price was determined by taking the average of Kroll's stock price on the
        date of the announcement of the proposed acquisition and the two days
        before and after the date of the announcement of the proposed
        acquisition. The issuance was allocated between common stock and
        additional paid-in capital based on the par value of common stock.

       Shares issued times $.01 par value                        76
       Additional paid-in capital                           129,141

(e)     Amortization expense of the identifiable intangible assets acquired in
        the acquisition of Ontrack by Kroll of $1,550 is based on a four-year
        amortization period.

(f)     Additional weighted average shares of 7,639 outstanding was determined
        assuming the merger was completed on January 1, 2001 and the shares were
        outstanding for the entire year.

(g)     Goodwill of $4,086 on the books of Ontrack has been eliminated in
        accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 141.

(h)     Fair value of Ontrack options assumed by Kroll included in the total
        purchase price.

(i)     Elimination of goodwill amortization related to goodwill written off
        under Note 2(g).

                     COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF SHAREHOLDERS OF
                        ONTRACK AND SHAREHOLDERS OF KROLL

        After the merger, shareholders of Ontrack will become shareholders of
Kroll. Their rights will then be governed by the Kroll amended and restated
articles of incorporation and code of regulations and the Ohio General
Corporation Law. Presently, Ontrack shareholders' rights are governed by the
Ontrack articles of incorporation and bylaws and the Minnesota Business
Corporation Act. If the reincorporation merger is approved by Kroll shareholders
at the annual meeting, following the reincorporation merger, Kroll shareholders,
including former Ontrack shareholders, will become stockholders of Kroll Inc., a
Delaware corporation. Their rights will then be governed by the Kroll Delaware
certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation
Law. See "Kroll Proposal No. 5 - Approval of Agreement and Plan of Merger to
Reincorporate in Delaware."

        The following summary describes the material differences among the
Ontrack articles of incorporation and bylaws and the Kroll amended and restated
articles of incorporation and code of regulations and the Kroll Delaware
certificate of incorporation and bylaws. This summary is not, however, a
complete statement of all differences between rights of the holders of Kroll
common stock and Ontrack common stock and is qualified by the full text of each
document, the Minnesota Business Corporation Act and the Ohio General
Corporation Law and the Delaware General Corporation Law. You should carefully
read this entire joint proxy statement/prospectus and refer to the other
documents discussed below for a more complete understanding of the differences
among the rights of Ontrack shareholders, Kroll shareholders and Kroll Delaware
stockholders.

        o       5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.01, the rights
                and preferences of which may be determined by the board of
                directors.

        Voting Rights

        Under Minnesota, Ohio and Delaware law, shareholders are entitled to one
vote per share of common stock held by such shareholder. The Ontrack articles of
incorporation, the Kroll articles of incorporation and the Kroll Delaware
certificate of incorporation each prohibit cumulative voting for directors.

Board of Directors

        Board Size

        Minnesota law provides that the board of directors of a Minnesota
corporation shall consist of one or more directors as fixed by or in the manner
provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws. The Ontrack bylaws provide
that the board of directors shall consist of not less than three nor more than
nine directors, as may be designated by the board of directors from time to
time.

        Ohio law provides that the number of directors may be fixed by a
corporation's articles of incorporation or code of regulations, but may not be
less than three. However, if not so fixed, the number of directors is set at
three, provided further, that where all shares of a corporation are owned of
record by one or two shareholders, the number of directors may be less than
three, but not less than the number of shareholders. The Kroll code of
regulations provides that the number of directors shall never be less than three
or the number of shareholders of record, and that the number of directors may be
fixed or changed by a majority of the shares present and entitled to vote at a
properly held meeting of the shareholders called for the purpose of electing
directors. The Kroll code of regulations further provides that the number of
directors may be fixed or changed by a majority of the directors present and
entitled to vote at a properly called meeting.

        Under Delaware law, the board of directors shall consist of one or more
members. The number of directors shall be fixed by or in the manner provided in
the corporation's bylaws, unless the corporation's certificate of incorporation
fixes the number of directors, in which case a change in the number of directors
shall be made only by amendment of the certificate. The Kroll Delaware bylaws
provide that the number of directors constituting the board of directors shall
not be less than two nor more than ten, as determined by the board of directors.

        Board Classification

        Neither the board of directors of Ontrack nor the board of directors of
Kroll is divided into classes. Accordingly, all directors for both companies
generally are elected at each annual meeting of the company's shareholders.

        The Kroll Delaware certificate of incorporation and by-laws provides
that the Kroll Delaware board will be classified into three classes. One class,
consisting of three directors will serve until the 2003 annual meeting of
stockholders of Kroll Delaware. The second class, consisting of two directors,
will serve until the 2004 annual meeting of stockholders of Kroll Delaware. The
third class, consisting of three directors will serve until the 2005 annual
meeting of stockholders of Kroll Delaware. At each annual meeting of
stockholders of Kroll Delaware held in or after 2003, directors will be elected
for a three-year term to succeed the directors whose terms are expiring at that
annual meeting. See "Kroll Proposal No. 5 - Approval of Agreement and Plan of
Merger to Reincorporate in Delaware."

        Quorum Requirements

        Under Minnesota law, a majority of the directors then in office
constitutes a quorum. However, the articles of incorporation or bylaws may
require a higher or lower number of directors to establish a quorum. Neither the
Ontrack articles of incorporation, nor the Ontrack bylaws, modifies this quorum
requirement.

        Under Ohio law, a quorum of the board of directors consists of a
majority of the whole authorized number of directors. However, the articles of
incorporation or the code of regulations may establish a higher or lower number
of directors to constitute a quorum. Neither the Kroll articles of incorporation
nor the Kroll code of regulations modifies this quorum requirement.

        Under Delaware law, a majority of the directors then in office
constitutes a quorum, unless the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the
corporation of a corporation require a greater or lesser number, but in no event
less than one-third of the votes of the entire board. Neither the Kroll Delaware
certificate of incorporation nor the Kroll Delaware bylaws modifies this quorum
requirement.

        Nominations

        The Ontrack bylaws provide that a notice of proposed shareholder
nominations for the election of directors must be timely given in writing to the
secretary of Ontrack prior to the meeting at which directors are to be elected.
To be timely, the notice must be given by such shareholder to the secretary of
Ontrack not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the meeting. The
notice to Ontrack from a shareholder who intends to nominate a person at the
meeting for election as a director must contain:

        o       the name and address of record of the shareholder who intends to
                make the nomination;
        o       a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of
                shares of Ontrack entitled to vote at such meeting and intends
                to appear in person or by proxy to nominate the person or
                persons described in the notice;
        o       the name, age, business and residence addresses, and principal
                occupation or employment of each nominee;
        o       a description of all arrangements or understandings between the
                shareholder and each nominee and any other person or persons
                (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination
                or nominations are to be made by the shareholder;
        o       all other information regarding each nominee proposed by the
                shareholder that would be required to be included in a proxy
                statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities
                and Exchange Commission; and
        o       the consent of each nominee to serve as director if elected.

        Ontrack may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other
information as may reasonably be required by the corporation to determine the
eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as director. If the presiding
officer of a shareholder meeting determines that a person was not nominated in
accordance with the foregoing procedure, that person will not be eligible for
election as a director.

        The Kroll code of regulations provides that directors shall be elected
at the annual meeting of the shareholders, or, if not so elected, at a special
meeting of the shareholders. The only candidates who will be eligible for
election at such meeting will be those who have been nominated by the board of
directors and those who have been properly nominated by a shareholder. A
shareholder may nominate a director only if the shareholder delivers or sends by
certified mail a notice to the secretary of Kroll. The notice

shall be in writing and shall be given at least five and no more than 30 days
prior to the meeting, and shall contain:

        o       the name and residence of such shareholder;
        o       a representation that such shareholder is a holder of record of
                voting stock of Kroll and intends to appear in person or by
                proxy at such meeting to nominate the person or persons
                specified in the notice;
        o       the name and residence of such nominee; and
        o       the consent of such nominee to serve as a director if elected.

        If the chairman of the shareholder meeting determines that a person was
not nominated in accordance with the foregoing procedure, such person will not
be eligible for election as a director.

        The Kroll Delaware bylaws provide that nominations of candidates for
election as directors may be made by the board of directors or by any holder of
record of the capital stock of Kroll Delaware entitled to vote for the election
of directors that complies with the requirements for making nominations. A Kroll
Delaware stockholder that seeks to nominate a director must be present in person
at the annual meeting. Nominations for the election of directors must be made in
a written notice that is timely delivered to the secretary of Kroll. To be
timely, the notice must be delivered to, or mailed or received by Kroll at its
principal executive offices: (1) if for the first annual meeting after the
reincorporation merger, not later than the later of (x) the 75th day before the
date of this annual meeting or (y) the 15th day after Kroll Delaware publicly
announces the date of this annual meeting, or (2) for all subsequent annual
meetings, not less than 75 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary
date of the previous year's annual meeting, unless the annual meeting is
scheduled to be held more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after that
anniversary date, in which case notice is timely if delivered to or mailed and
received by Kroll not later than the later of (x) the 75th day before the date
of the annual meeting or (y) the 15th day after Kroll Delaware publicly
announces the date of the annual meeting.

        The stockholder's notice must state

        o       the name, age, business address and residence address of each
                person proposed to be nominated;
        o       the principal occupation or employment of each person proposed
                to be nominated;
        o       the class and number of shares of Kroll Delaware's capital stock
                beneficially owned by each person proposed to be nominated on
                the date of the notice;
        o       the consent of each nominee to serve as director if elected;
        o       the information regarding each nominee that is required to be
                disclosed pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
                Securities Exchange Act of 1934;
        o       the name and address of the stockholder and of the beneficial
                owners, if any, of Kroll Delaware's capital stock registered in
                the nominating stockholder's name and the name and address of
                any other stockholder known by the nominating stockholder to be
                supporting each nominee;
        o       the class and number of shares of Kroll Delaware's capital stock
                held of record, beneficially owned or represented by proxy by
                the nominating stockholder and by any other stockholder known by
                the nominating stockholder to be supporting each nominee; and
        o       a description of all arrangements or understandings between the
                nominating stockholder and each nominee and any other person
                relating to the nomination of that nominee by the nominating
                stockholder.

        If the Kroll Delaware board of directors, any committee designated by
the board or the presiding officer of the annual meeting determines that a
person was not nominated in accordance with the foregoing procedures, that
nominee will not be considered at the annual meeting.

        Cumulative Voting for Directors

        Under Minnesota law, cumulative voting in the election of directors is
mandatory unless the corporation's articles of incorporation provide that there
shall be no cumulative voting. The Ontrack articles of incorporation contain a
provision that eliminates cumulative voting.

        Under Ohio law, cumulative voting in the election of directors is
mandatory unless the corporation's articles of incorporation provide that there
shall be no cumulative voting. The Kroll articles of incorporation contain a
provision that eliminates cumulative voting.

        Under Delaware law, cumulative voting is permitted only if it is
specifically provided for in the corporation's certificate of incorporation. The
Kroll Delaware certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative
voting.

        Removal of Directors

        Minnesota law provides that, unless modified by the articles or bylaws
of the corporation or by shareholder agreement, the directors of a corporation
may be removed with or without cause by the affirmative vote of that proportion
or number of the voting power of the shares of the classes or series the
director represents which would be sufficient to elect such director (with an
exception for corporations with cumulative voting). The Ontrack articles of
incorporation and bylaws do not modify this right. In addition, under Minnesota
law, a director appointed by the board of directors to fill a vacancy or newly
created directorship resulting from an increase in the number of directors may
be removed from office at any time, with or without cause, by the affirmative
vote of a majority of the remaining directors if the shareholders have not
elected directors in the interim between the time of the appointment to fill the
vacancy and the time of the removal.

        Under Ohio law, unless the articles of incorporation of a corporation
provide otherwise, a director or directors may be removed from office with or
without cause by the vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power
entitling them to elect replacements. The Kroll articles of incorporation does
not modify this right.

        Under Delaware law, a director of a corporation with a classified board
of directors may be removed only for cause, unless the certificate of
incorporation otherwise provides. The Kroll Delaware certificate of
incorporation provides for a classified board of directors and specifically
provides that no director may be removed by action of the stockholders except
for cause. Consequently, a director of Kroll Delaware may be removed from office
only for cause.

        Board Action by Written Consent

        Under Minnesota law, an action may be taken by a written action signed
by all of the directors, and if the articles of incorporation so provide, any
action which does not require shareholder approval may be taken by written
action signed by a majority of the directors. The Ontrack articles of
incorporation contain a provision which permits the directors to act by written
action signed by the number of directors which would be required to take the
same action at a meeting of the board at which all directors were present. An
action of the board that requires shareholder approval may be taken without a
board meeting if all members of the board consent to such action in writing.

        Under Ohio law and the Kroll code of regulations, any action which may
be taken at a meeting of the directors may be taken without a meeting if
authorized in writing signed by all of the directors.

        Under Delaware law, unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws, the board of directors of a Delaware corporation may
take action without a meeting if all members of the board consent to such action
in writing. The Kroll Delaware certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not
contain any restriction on this right.

        Board Vacancies

        Under Minnesota law, unless different rules for filling vacancies are
provided for in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, vacancies resulting
from the death, resignation, removal or disqualification of a director may be
filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors, even
though less than a quorum, and vacancies resulting from a newly-created
directorship may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
directors serving at the time of the increase. The shareholders may also elect a
new director to fill a vacancy that is created by the removal of a director by
the shareholders. The Ontrack articles of incorporation do not modify the
procedures prescribed by Minnesota law.

        Under Ohio law and the Kroll code of regulations, vacancies on the board
of directors may be filled by the remaining directors even though less than a
quorum.

        Under Delaware law, unless otherwise provided in the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the corporation, vacancies and newly created
directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors
may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than
a quorum. If at any time there are no directors, then any officer or stockholder
may call a special meeting or apply to a court for the purpose of holding an
election. Additionally, if at the time of filling a vacancy or newly created
directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of
the whole board, a stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten percent of
the total number of outstanding shares may apply to a court for the purpose of
holding an election. The Kroll Delaware bylaws provide that vacancies, including
any vacancy created by the increase in the number of directors or the death,
resignation, disqualification or removal of a director, may be filled by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, even
if the remaining directors constitute less than a quorum, or, if the vacancy is
not so filled by the remaining directors, by the Kroll Delaware stockholders.

Shareholder Meetings

        Shareholder Action by Written Consent

        Under Minnesota law, any action required or permitted to be taken at a
meeting of the shareholders may be taken without a meeting by written action
signed by all of the shareholders entitled to vote on that action.

        Under Ohio law, unless prohibited by a corporation's articles of
incorporation or code of regulations, any action which may be taken at a
shareholder meeting may be taken in writing signed by all of the shareholders
who would be entitled to notice of such a meeting. The Kroll articles of
incorporation and code of regulations do not limit this right.

        Under Delaware law, unless otherwise provided in the corporation's
certificate of incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken at a
meeting of the stockholders may be taken without a meeting by written action
signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum

number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote were present and voted. The Kroll
Delaware certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that the stockholders
of Kroll Delaware may not take action by written consent.

        Ability to Call Special Meetings

        Under Minnesota law and the Ontrack bylaws, a special meeting of
shareholders may be called by the chairman of the board, the chief executive
officer, the chief financial officer, any two directors, or a shareholder or
shareholders holding ten percent or more of the shares entitled to vote on the
matters to be presented at the meeting. However, a special meeting called by
shareholders for the purpose of considering any action to directly or indirectly
facilitate or effect a business combination, including any action to change or
otherwise affect the composition of the board of directors for that purpose,
must be called by 25% or more of the voting power of all shares entitled to
vote.

        Ohio law and the Kroll code of regulations provide that special meetings
of shareholders may be called by the chairman of the board, the president, the
directors by action at a meeting, a majority of the directors acting without a
meeting, or persons who hold 50% of all shares outstanding and who are entitled
to vote at that meeting.

        Under Delaware law, a special meeting of stockholders may be called by
the board of directors or any other person authorized to do so in the
corporation's certificate of incorporation or bylaws. The Kroll Delaware
certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that special meetings of the
stockholders may be called only by the Executive Chairman of the Board, the
Chief Executive Officer or the affirmative vote of a majority of the board of
directors then in office.

        Notice of Meetings

        Under Minnesota law and the Ontrack bylaws, holders of Ontrack common
stock are entitled to at least ten but not more than 60 days' prior written
notice for each regular meeting and special meeting. Minnesota law requires that
notice of a meeting at which an agreement of merger or exchange is to be
considered shall be given to all shareholders of record, whether entitled to
vote or not, at least 14 days prior to the meeting.

        Under Ohio law and the Kroll code of regulations, holders of Kroll
common stock are entitled to at least at least seven but not more than 60 days'
prior written notice for each regular meeting and special meeting. Ohio law
requires that notice of a meeting at which an agreement of merger or exchange is
to be considered shall be given to all shareholders of record, whether entitled
to vote or not, at least seven days prior to the meeting.

        Under Delaware law and the Kroll Delaware bylaws, Kroll Delaware
stockholders are entitled to at least ten but not more than 60 days' prior
written notice for each annual meeting and special meeting of the stockholders.
Delaware law requires that notice of a meeting at which an agreement of merger
is to be considered shall be given to all stockholders of record, whether
entitled to vote or not, at least 20 days prior to the meeting.

        Quorum Requirements

        Under Minnesota law and the Ontrack bylaws, the holders of a majority of
the voting power of the shares entitled to vote at a meeting, represented either
in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum. If a quorum is present when a
duly called meeting is convened, the shareholders present may continue to
transact business until adjournment notwithstanding the withdrawal of a number
of

shareholders which leaves less than the number otherwise required for a quorum.
A majority of the shareholders present at any meeting shall have the power to
adjourn the meeting from time to time even if a quorum is not present.

        Under Ohio law and the Kroll code of regulations, the holders of shares
entitled to exercise a majority of the voting power of the corporation, present
in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for any meeting. The
shareholders present in person or by proxy may adjourn the meeting from time to
time even if a quorum is not present. In any matter brought before any meeting
of shareholders, the affirmative vote of the holders of shares representing a
majority of the shares actually cast shall be the act of the shareholders,
except that no action required to be authorized or taken by the holders of a
designated proportion of the shares of Kroll may be authorized or taken by a
lesser proportion.

        Under Delaware law, unless otherwise provided in the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of a corporation, a majority of the shares entitled to
vote, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a
meeting of the stockholders. The Kroll Delaware certificate of incorporation
provides that the holders of shares of voting stock representing a majority of
the voting power of the outstanding shares of voting stock issued, outstanding
and entitled to vote at a stockholders meeting, represented in person or by
proxy at that meeting, shall constitute a quorum.

        Advance Notice Provisions

        The Ontrack bylaws require that, for a shareholder proposal to properly
be brought before a regular meeting, the shareholder must comply with certain
procedures. The shareholder must give notice in writing to the secretary of
Ontrack not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to a meeting date
corresponding to the previous year's meeting. The notice shall set forth as to
each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting:

        o       a brief description of the business desired to be brought before
                the regular meeting and the reasons for conducting such business
                at the regular meeting;
        o       the name and address of record of the shareholders proposing
                such business;
        o       the class or series and number of shares of the corporation
                which are owned by such shareholder; and
        o       any material interest in the shareholder of such business.

        Additionally, the Ontrack bylaws provide special requirements for
shareholder proposals of nominations for the election of directors. See " -
Board of Directors - Nominations."

        The Kroll code of regulations does not provide any special requirements
to bring a shareholder proposal at a shareholder meeting, other than for the
nomination of directors. See " - Board of Directors - Nominations."

        The Kroll Delaware bylaws provide that, for a stockholder proposal to
properly be brought before an annual meeting, the stockholder must comply with
specified procedures. A Kroll Delaware stockholder that seeks to bring a
proposal before an annual meeting must be present in person at that meeting. The
proposal must be made in a written notice that is timely delivered to the
secretary of Kroll. To be timely, the notice must be delivered to, or mailed or
received by Kroll at its principal executive offices: (1) if for the first
annual meeting after the reincorporation merger, not later than the later of (x)
the 75th day before the date of this annual meeting or (y) the 15th day after
Kroll Delaware publicly announces the date of this annual meeting, or (2) for
all subsequent annual meetings, not less than 75 days nor more than 120 days
prior to the anniversary date of the previous year's annual meeting, unless the
annual meeting is scheduled to be held more than 30 days before or more than 60
days after that anniversary date, in which case notice is timely if delivered to
or mailed and received by Kroll not later than the later of (x) the 75th day
before the date of the annual meeting or (y) the 15th day after Kroll Delaware
publicly announces the date of the annual meeting.

        The notice shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to
bring before the annual meeting:

        o       a brief description of the business desired to be brought before
                the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting that business
                at that meeting;
        o       the name and address of the stockholder proposing that business;
        o       the class and number of shares of Kroll Delaware capital stock
                which are beneficially owned by that stockholder;
        o       the name and address of the beneficial owners, if any, of Kroll
                Delaware capital stock registered in that stockholder's name and
                the class and number of shares of Kroll Delaware capital stock
                beneficially owned by those owners;
        o       the name and address of any other stockholder known by the
                proposing stockholder to be supporting that business and the
                class and number of shares of Kroll Delaware capital stock
                beneficially owned by those other stockholders; and
        o       any material interest of the stockholder, or any stockholder
                known to be supporting the proposal, in that business.

        If the Kroll Delaware board of directors, any committee designated by
the board or the presiding officer of the annual meeting determines that a
stockholder proposal was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedures,
that proposal will not be considered at the annual meeting.

        Additionally, the Kroll Delaware bylaws provide special requirements for
stockholder proposals of nominations for the election of directors. See " -
Board of Directors - Nominations."

Voting Rights with respect to Extraordinary Corporate Transactions

        Under Minnesota law, the sale, lease, transfer or other disposition of
all or substantially all of a corporation's property and assets, if not made in
the usual and regular course of business, must be authorized at a shareholders
meeting by a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote.

        In addition, under Minnesota law, an agreement of merger, exchange or
consolidation must be approved by the directors of each constituent corporation
and adopted by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon. A greater vote may by required if
provided in a corporation's articles of incorporation. The Ontrack articles of
incorporation do not modify this voting requirement. Minnesota law also requires
the separate vote of any class or series of shares if any provision of the plan
of merger would, if contained in a proposed amendment to the articles, entitle
the class or series to vote as a class or series. Minnesota law provides

generally that, unless otherwise provided in a corporation's articles of
incorporation, no vote of the shareholders of the surviving corporation is
required to approve a merger if:

        o       the agreement of merger does not amend in any respect the
                corporation's articles of incorporation;

        o       each share outstanding immediately prior to the effective date
                is to be an identical outstanding share of the surviving
                corporation after the effective date; and

        o       the number of shares of the surviving corporation's common stock
                to be issued in the merger plus the number of shares of common
                stock into which any other securities to be issued in the merger
                are initially convertible do not exceed 20% of its common stock
                outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the
                merger.

The Ontrack articles of incorporation do not modify this voting requirement.

        Under Ohio law, a lease, sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition
of all or substantially all of the assets of a corporation, if not made in the
usual and regular course of business, must be authorized by the shareholders of
the selling or disposing corporation. The vote required is the affirmative vote
of the holders of shares entitling them to exercise two-thirds of the voting
power of the corporation, unless the articles of incorporation provide for a
different proportion, but not less than a majority of the voting power, and by
the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of any particular class that is
required by the articles of incorporation. The shareholders of the acquiring
corporation must also approve the lease or other acquisition of all or
substantially all of the assets of the disposing corporation if the transaction
involves the issuance or transfer by the acquiring corporation of a number of
its shares as will entitle the holders of those shares immediately after the
transaction to exercise one-sixth or more of the voting power of the acquiring
corporation.

        The Kroll articles of incorporation provide that any sale or other
disposition of all or substantially all of its assets must be approved by the
affirmative vote of the holders of shares entitled to exercise a majority of the
voting power of Kroll.

        In addition, under Ohio law, an agreement of merger or consolidation
must be adopted by the shareholders of each constituent corporation other than
the surviving corporation. The vote required is the affirmative vote of the
holders of shares entitling them to exercise at least two-thirds of the voting
power, unless the articles of incorporation provide for a different proportion,
but not less than a majority of the voting power, and by the affirmative vote of
the holders of shares of any particular class that is required by the articles
of incorporation. The shareholders of the surviving corporation must also adopt
an agreement of merger or consolidation if (1) the articles of incorporation or
the code of regulations of the surviving corporation require that its
shareholders adopt the agreement, (2) the merger or consolidation agreement
conflicts with or changes the articles of incorporation or the code of
regulations of the surviving corporation or authorizes any action that otherwise
would require adoption by the shareholders or (3) the merger involves the
issuance or transfer by the surviving corporation of a number of its shares as
will entitle the holders of those shares immediately after the merger to
exercise one-sixth or more of the voting power of the surviving corporation. The
vote required is the affirmative vote of the holders of shares entitling them to
exercise at least two-thirds of the voting power, unless the articles of
incorporation provide for a different proportion, but not less than a majority
of the voting power, and by the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of any
particular class that is required by the articles of incorporation. The Kroll
articles of incorporation provide that any merger or consolidation must be
approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of shares entitled to exercise a
majority of the voting power of Kroll.

        Under Delaware law, approval of mergers and consolidations requires the
affirmative vote or consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares entitled to vote, except that, unless required by the certificate of
incorporation, no vote of stockholders of the corporation surviving a merger is
necessary if: (1) the merger does not amend in any respect the certificate of
incorporation of the corporation; (2) each outstanding share immediately prior
to the effective date of the merger is to be an identical share of the surviving
corporation after the merger; and (3) either no common stock of the corporation
and no securities or obligations convertible into common stock are to be issued
in the merger, or the number of shares of common stock to be issued in the
merger plus the number of shares of common stock that are initially issuable on
conversion of other securities issued in the merger do not exceed 20% of the
common stock of the corporation outstanding immediately before the merger. The
Kroll Delaware certificate of incorporation does not modify this voting
requirement.

        In addition to the requirements discussed above, the antitakeover
provisions of Minnesota, Ohio and Delaware law impose different or additional
voting requirements. See " - Business Combinations, Control Share Acquisitions
and Anti-Takeover Provisions."

Amendments to Organizational Documents

        Articles of Incorporation

        Under Minnesota law, an amendment to the articles of incorporation
generally requires the affirmative vote of the holders of majority of the shares
present and entitled to vote unless a larger affirmative vote is required by the
corporation's articles. The Ontrack articles of incorporation do not contain any
provisions that require a larger affirmative vote in order to amend the articles
of incorporation. Prior to submitting a resolution for a shareholder vote, the
resolution must be approved by a majority of directors present at a meeting
where the resolution is considered, unless the resolution is proposed by a
shareholder or shareholders holding three percent or more of the voting power of
the outstanding shares entitled to vote. In addition, holders of an outstanding
class or series are entitled to vote as a class upon a proposed amendment,
whether or not entitled to vote thereon by the provisions of the articles, if
the amendment would have certain effects on the class or series of stock, such
as changing the number of shares in the class or changing the rights or
preferences of the class or series.

        Ohio law provides that a corporation's articles of incorporation may be
amended at a meeting held for that purpose by the holders of shares entitling
them to exercise at least two-thirds of the voting power of the corporation.
Ohio law permits corporations' articles of incorporation to provide for a
different proportion, but not less than a majority of the voting power. The
Kroll articles of incorporation provide for amendment by the affirmative vote of
the holders of shares entitled to exercise a majority of the voting power of
Kroll. The Kroll articles of incorporation also provide for their amendment by
Kroll consistent with and in the manner prescribed by Ohio law. Ohio law allows
directors to amend the articles of incorporation in limited circumstances
relating to:

        o       the issuance and terms of a class or series of stock, if
                provided in the corporation's articles;
        o       the authorization of shares necessary in connection with the
                issuance of shareholder-approved options or convertible
                securities; and
        o       the restatement of the articles to reflect changes in
                capitalization or mergers or consolidations.

        Under Delaware law, an amendment to the certificate of incorporation
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of majority of the shares entitled
to vote, unless the corporation's certificate of

incorporation requires a greater or lesser number for approval. The Kroll
Delaware certificate of incorporation does not change the vote required by
Delaware law. Additionally, under Delaware law, the holders of the outstanding
shares of a class are entitled to vote as a class upon any proposed amendment to
the certificate of incorporation, whether or not they are entitled to vote
thereon by the provisions of the corporation's certificate of incorporation, if
the amendment would increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized
shares of such class, increase or decrease the par value of the shares of such
class, or alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the
shares of such class so as to adversely affect them.

        Bylaws; Code of Regulations

        Minnesota law and the Ontrack bylaws provide that the power to adopt,
amend or repeal the bylaws is vested in the board. Minnesota law and the Ontrack
bylaws provide that the authority of the board of directors is subject to the
power of the shareholders to change or repeal such bylaws by a majority vote of
the shareholders at a meeting of the shareholders called for such purpose.
Moreover, the board of directors may not make or alter any bylaws fixing a
quorum for meetings of shareholders, prescribing procedures for removing
directors or filling vacancies in the board of directors, or fixing the number
of directors or their classifications, qualifications or terms of office. The
board may adopt or amend a bylaw to increase the number of directors. Under
Minnesota law, a shareholder or shareholders holding three percent or more of
the voting shares entitled to vote may propose a resolution to amend or repeal
bylaws adopted, amended or repealed by the board, in which event such
resolutions must be brought before the shareholders for their consideration
pursuant to the procedures for amending the articles of incorporation.

        Ohio law provides that a code of regulations may be adopted, amended or
repealed:

        o       at a meeting of the shareholders by the approval of a majority
                of the shareholders entitled to vote on the proposal;
        o       by a written consent signed by two-thirds of the shareholders
                entitled to vote on the proposal; or
        o       by a lesser, but not less than a majority, or a greater
                affirmative vote or consent as specified in the articles of
                incorporation or the code of regulations.

        The Kroll code of regulations provides for amendment by the affirmative
vote or written consent of the shareholders entitled to exercise a majority of
the voting power on the proposal or by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
directors to the extent permitted by Ohio law at the time of the amendment.

        Under Delaware law, the power to adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws is
vested in the board of directors and is subject to the power of the stockholders
to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws adopted, amended or repealed by the board. The
Kroll Delaware certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that the bylaws
may be amended or repealed by the board of directors or at any annual meeting of
stockholders or special meeting of stockholders called for that purpose by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes eligible to be cast on the
amendment or repeal by holders of voting stock, voting together as a single
class.

Payment of Dividends and Repurchase of Shares of Stock

        Under Minnesota law, a corporation may pay dividends or repurchase its
shares if the corporation will be able to pay its debts in the ordinary course
of business after paying the dividend or repurchasing

the shares. This is true regardless of whether the corporation has surplus or
net profits, but is subject to limitations for the benefit of preferred shares.

        Under Ohio law, a corporation may pay a dividend or distribution in
cash, property or shares. The dividend or distribution may not exceed the sum of
(1) surplus, which is defined as the excess of a corporation's assets over the
sum of its liabilities plus its stated capital, if any, and (2) an amount equal
to the difference between (x) the reduction in surplus that results from the
immediate recognition of the transition obligation under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106 and (y) the aggregate amount of the transition
obligation that would have been recognized as of the date of declaration of a
dividend or distribution if the corporation had elected to amortize its
recognition of the transition obligation under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 106. In addition, Ohio law provides that a corporation cannot
purchase or redeem its own shares if (1) immediately afterwards its assets are
less than the sum of its liabilities plus its stated capital, if any, or (2) the
corporation is insolvent or there is reasonable ground to believe that by the
purchase or redemption it would be rendered insolvent.

        Under Delaware law, a corporation may pay dividends only out of surplus,
which is defined generally as the stockholders' equity of the corporation less
the par value of the capital stock outstanding, or, if there exists no surplus,
out of the net profits of the corporation for the fiscal year in which the
dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. If the capital of the
corporation has diminished to an amount less than the aggregate amount of
capital represented by issued and outstanding stock having a liquidation
preference, the corporation may not declare and pay out of its net profits any
dividends to the holders of its common stock until the deficiency has been
repaired. In general, Delaware law provides that shares of a corporation's
capital stock may only be repurchased or redeemed by the corporation out of
surplus. To determine the surplus, assets and liabilities are valued at their
current fair market value. Assuming that such assets have a fair market value
greater than their book value and that liabilities have not increased in value
to a greater extent, such revaluation will increase the surplus of the
corporation and thereby permit the corporation to pay an increased dividend
and/or to repurchase a greater number of shares.

        It is the present policy of Kroll's board of directors to retain any
earnings for use in Kroll's business and it is anticipated that Kroll Delaware
will do the same.

Limitation of Liability of Directors

        Under Minnesota law, a corporation may limit a director's personal
liability to the corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach
of fiduciary duty except for:

        o       any breach of a director's duty of loyalty to the corporation
                and its shareholders;
        o       acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional
                misconduct or a knowing violation of law;
        o       illegal distributions or violations of Minnesota Securities Act;
        o       any transaction from which the director derived an improper
                personal benefit; or
        o       any act or omission occurring prior to the date when the
                provision in the articles eliminating or limiting liability
                becomes effective.

The Ontrack articles of incorporation and bylaws provide that, to the maximum
extent allowed by Minnesota law, no director of Ontrack will have any personal
liability to Ontrack or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of
fiduciary duty as a director. They further provide that no amendment or repeal
of such provision shall have any effect on the liability of an Ontrack director
for acts or omissions occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.

        Under Ohio law, with limited exceptions, a director may be liable in
damages for any action the director takes or fails to take as a director only if
it is proved by clear and convincing evidence that the director's action or
failure to act involved an act or omission undertaken with deliberate intent to
cause injury to the corporation or reckless disregard for the best interests of
the corporation. Neither the Kroll articles of incorporation nor the Kroll code
of regulations provide for a different standard.

        Under Delaware law, a corporation may include in its certificate of
incorporation a provision which would, subject to the limitations described
below, eliminate or limit directors' liability for monetary damage for breaches
of their fiduciary duty of care. Under Delaware law, a director's liability
cannot be eliminated or limited for:

        o       breaches of duty of loyalty;
        o       acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
                misconduct or a knowing violation of law;
        o       the payment of unlawful dividends or expenditure of funds for
                unlawful stock purchases or redemptions; or
        o       transactions from which a director derived an improper personal
                benefit.

        The Kroll Delaware certificate of incorporation provides for the
elimination or limitation of directors' liability to the fullest extent
permitted under Delaware law.

Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Employees

        Minnesota law requires a corporation to indemnify any director, officer
or employee who is made or threatened to be made party to a proceeding by reason
of the former or present official capacity of the director, officer or employee,
against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable expenses so long
as such person:

        o       has not been indemnified by another organization or person;
        o       acted in good faith;
        o       received no improper personal benefit and complied with
                applicable procedures relating to conflict of interest
                transactions;
        o       in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to
                believe the conduct was unlawful; and
        o       reasonably believed that the conduct was in the best interests
                of the corporation, or, in the case of a conflict of interest
                transaction, reasonably believed that the conduct was not
                opposed to the best interests of the corporation.

        Minnesota law permits a corporation to prohibit or limit indemnification
in its articles of incorporation or its bylaws. The Ontrack bylaws state that
Ontrack shall indemnify such persons for such expenses and liabilities to the
fullest extent allowed by Minnesota law.

        Ohio law permits a corporation to indemnify its directors, officers,
employees, or one who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a
director, trustee, officer, employee or agent of another entity, against
expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with a
legal proceeding so long as such person:

        o       acted in good faith;
        o       in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to
                believe the conduct was unlawful; and

        o       reasonably believed that the conduct was in, or not opposed to,
                the best interests of the corporation.

However, Ohio law prohibits indemnification if:

        o       the person is found liable for negligence or misconduct in the
                performance of his duties to the corporation, unless the court
                determines that indemnification is proper; or
        o       the only liability asserted against a director concerns unlawful
                distributions.

        The Kroll code of regulations provides for the indemnification of
directors, officers and any person serving at the request of an executive
officer of Kroll as a director, officer, partner, employee or agent of another
corporation or entity to the fullest extent allowed by Ohio law. The Kroll code
of regulations further provides that Kroll may, by action of the Kroll board,
grant rights to indemnification, to employees or agents of Kroll.

        Under Delaware law, a corporation has the power to indemnify any
directors, officer, employee or agent who is made or threatened to be made a
party to a proceeding by reason of the former or present official capacity of
the director, officer, employee or agent against judgments, fines, settlement
amounts and expenses reasonable incurred so long as such person:

        o       acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably
                believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
                corporation; and
        o       with respect to a criminal proceeding, the person had no
                reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.

A corporation may not indemnify a person who is found liable to the corporation
unless a court determines that the person is entitled to such indemnification. A
corporation is required to indemnify a present or former director or officer to
the extent that such person has been successful in the defense of an action. The
Kroll Delaware certificate of incorporation provides for the indemnification of
directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law.

Dissenters' and Appraisal Rights

        Under Minnesota law, dissenting shareholders are entitled to dissenter'
rights in connection with the lease, sale, exchange, transfer or certain other
dispositions of all or substantially all of the assets of a corporation and in
connection with certain amendments to its articles of incorporation which
adversely affect a shareholder's rights. In addition, shareholders of a
Minnesota corporation are entitled, except in limited situations, to dissenters'
rights in connection with any merger or with any exchange which requires a
shareholder vote. Shareholders of an acquiring corporation are entitled to
dissenters' rights in a merger, combination or majority share acquisition in
which such shareholders are entitled to vote. If dissenting shareholders have
complied with the procedures prescribed by Minnesota law, following the
effective date of the transaction, the corporation is required to remit to each
dissenting shareholder the amount the corporation estimates to be the fair value
of the shareholder's shares, plus interest, accompanied by certain other
documents. Shareholders are not required to return any such payment made by the
corporation, even if such payment is ultimately determined to exceed fair value
by a court. Finally, under Minnesota law, the corporation generally pays all
costs of the proceedings, unless a court determines that a shareholder acted
arbitrarily, vexatiously or not in good faith.

        Under Ohio law, dissenting shareholders are entitled to appraisal rights
in connection with the lease, sale, exchange, transfer or other dispositions of
all or substantially all of the assets of a corporation

and in connection with amendments to its articles of incorporation that
adversely affect a shareholder's rights. In addition, shareholders of an Ohio
corporation are entitled to appraisal rights in connection with any merger,
consolidation, combination or majority share acquisition that requires a
shareholder vote or in which shareholders are entitled to vote. Unless the
corporation pays a dissenter the demanded or subsequently agreed upon amount,
the dissenting shareholder may file a complaint with a court seeking a
determination of the fair cash value of the shares. The court shall render
judgment against the corporation for such amount. The costs of the proceeding
shall be assessed or apportioned as the court considers equitable.

        Under Delaware law, appraisal rights are available only in connection
with statutory mergers or consolidations. Generally, stockholders of a Delaware
corporation who dissent from a merger or consolidation of the corporation for
which a stockholders' vote is required are entitled to appraisal rights,
requiring the surviving corporation to purchase the dissenting shares at fair
value. There are, however, no statutory rights of appraisal for stockholders of
a Delaware corporation whose shares of stock are either:

        o       listed on a national securities exchange or designated as a
                national market system security on an interdealer quotation
                system by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.;
                or
        o       held of record by more than 2,000 stockholders.

In addition, there are no statutory rights of appraisal for stockholders of a
Delaware corporation that receive in the merger or consolidation:

        o       shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from
                the merger or consolidation;
        o       shares of stock of any other corporation (1) listed on a
                national securities exchange or designated as a national market
                system security on an interdealer quotations system by the
                National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or (2) held of
                record by more than 2,000 stockholders;
        o       cash instead of fractional shares;
        o       or any combination of the foregoing.

A corporation is not required to remit to dissenting stockholders the fair value
of the shares unless and until such fair value is determined by a court. A court
may, but is not required to, award a fair interest on such amount. Under
Delaware law, the costs of the proceedings are determined by the court and taxed
upon the parties as deemed equitable by the court under the circumstances.

Business Combinations, Control Share Acquisitions and Anti-Takeover Provisions

        The Minnesota business combination statute prohibits certain "business
combinations," as defined in the Minnesota Business Corporation Act, between a
Minnesota corporation with at least 100 shareholders, or a publicly held
corporation that has at least 50 shareholders, and an "interested shareholder"
for a four-year period following the share acquisition date by the interested
shareholder, unless certain conditions are satisfied. An "interested
shareholder" is generally defined to include a person who beneficially owns at
least ten percent of the votes that all shareholders would be entitled to cast
in an election of directors of the corporation. This restriction does not apply
if the transaction is approved by a committee of disinterested directors prior
to the other party becoming an interested shareholder.

        The Minnesota control share acquisition statute limits the ability of a
shareholder who acquires beneficial ownership exceeding various thresholds of
the percentage of voting power of a Minnesota

corporation (at least 20% but less than 33%; at least 33% but less than 50%; and
50% or more) from voting shares in excess of the threshold unless such
acquisition has been approved in advance by a majority of the voting power held
by shareholders unaffiliated with such shareholder. Specified acquisitions,
including the merger, are exempted from the provisions of the Minnesota control
share acquisition statute. The articles or bylaws may be amended by a committee
of disinterested directors to cause this restriction to be inapplicable.

        Minnesota law provides that during any tender offer, a publicly held
corporation may not enter into or amend an agreement, whether or not subject to
contingencies, that increases the current or future compensation of any officer
or director. In addition, under Minnesota law, a publicly held corporation is
prohibited from purchasing any voting shares owned for less than two years from
a five percent shareholder for more than market value unless the transaction has
been approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting
power of all shares entitled to vote or unless the corporation makes a
comparable offer to all holders of shares of the class or series of stock, or
shares convertible into that class or series, held by the five percent
shareholders.

        In addition to these anti-takeover measures, the Ontrack bylaws provide
special requirements to bring a shareholder proposal before a regular meeting,
including shareholder proposals regarding nominations for the election of
directors. See " - Shareholder Meetings - Advance Notice Provisions" and " -
Board of Directors - Nominations."

        Ohio law prohibits a shareholder from acquiring a control share of an
issuing public corporation without the prior authorization of the corporation's
shareholders. A control share acquisition is defined as any acquisition of
shares of a corporation that, when added to all other shares of that corporation
owned by the acquiring person, would enable that person to exercise levels of
voting power in any of the following ranges: at least 20% but less than 33%; at
least 33% but less than 50%; or 50% or more. This prohibition of control share
acquisitions does not apply if a corporation opts out of the statutory coverage
through provisions in the corporation's articles of incorporation or code of
regulations. Kroll has not adopted any such provisions. Consequently, the Ohio
control share acquisition statute currently applies to Kroll.

        Ohio law also prevents an "Interested Shareholder," which is defined as
a person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of an Ohio
corporation, from engaging in a "Chapter 1704 transaction," which is defined to
include mergers, consolidations, majority share acquisitions, a variety of other
transactions that would increase the Interested Shareholder's proportionate
share of stock, and transfers of assets to or for the benefit of an Interested
Shareholder or its affiliate that meet some financial requirements, with an Ohio
corporation for three years after the date that person became an Interested
Shareholder unless, among other things, before that person became an Interested
Shareholder the board of directors of the corporation approved the Chapter 1704
transaction or the transaction which resulted in the shareholder becoming an
Interested Shareholder. In addition, Ohio law provides that after the three-year
period described here, an Interested Shareholder may engage in a Chapter 1704
transaction with an Ohio corporation only if at least one of several additional
requirements, such as (1) if prior to the shareholder's becoming an Interested
Shareholder, the board of directors of the corporation had approved the
transaction resulting in the shareholder becoming an Interested Shareholder, or
(2) the Chapter 1704 transaction is approved by the affirmative vote of holders
of shares entitled to exercise at least two-thirds of the voting power of the
corporation and by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of
the disinterested shares, is satisfied.

        Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits certain
transactions between a Delaware corporation and an "interested stockholder." For
purposes of this provision an "interested stockholder" is a stockholder that is
directly or indirectly a beneficial owner of 15% or more of the voting

power of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation or its affiliate
or associate. This provision prohibits certain business combinations between an
interested stockholder and a corporation for a period of three years after the
date the interested stockholder acquired its stock, unless:

        o       the business combination is approved by the corporation's board
                of directors prior to the stock acquisition date;
        o       the interested stockholder acquired at least 85% of the voting
                stock of the corporation in the transaction in which he became
                an interested stockholder; or
        o       the business combination is approved by a majority of the board
                of directors and the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
                disinterested stockholders.

Delaware law contains no provisions similar to the control share acquisition
statute of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act or the provisions of Ohio law
relating to control share acquisitions.

        The foregoing discussion of similarities and material differences
between the rights of Ontrack shareholders, the rights of Kroll shareholders and
the rights of Kroll Delaware stockholders under their respective organizational
documents and applicable law is only a summary of some of the provisions of
those documents and does not purport to be a complete description of all of the
similarities and differences, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the corporate law of Minnesota, Ohio and Delaware and the full text of the
articles of incorporation, certificate of incorporation, bylaws and code of
regulations of each of Ontrack, Kroll and Kroll Delaware.

                             ONTRACK PROPOSAL NO. 2

            APPROVAL OF THE ONTRACK 2001 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

        The Ontrack board of directors adopted the Ontrack 2001 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan on September 27, 2001, subject to approval by Ontrack
shareholders. The purpose of the plan is to encourage stock ownership by
employees of Ontrack and its subsidiaries, and to incent these employees to
remain in employment, improve operations, increase profits, and contribute more
significantly to Ontrack's success, and to permit Ontrack to compete with other
corporations offering similar plans in obtaining and retaining the services of
competent employees. The plan was adopted to replace Ontrack's 1996 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan, which was terminated at the end of the third quarter of
2001 in light of a projected shortfall in available reserved shares during the
fourth quarter of 2001, which would have resulted in automatic termination of
the plan.

        There are 250,000 shares of Ontrack's common stock, $0.01 par value per
share, reserved for issuance under the plan. Currently, approximately 340
employees are eligible to participate under the plan, including officers who own
less than 5% of Ontrack's common stock.

        The plan is intended to qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan"
under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify under Section 423 of
the Internal Revenue Code, the plan must be approved by the Ontrack shareholders
within 12 months of its adoption by the Ontrack board of directors. If the
Ontrack merger with ODI Acquisition described in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is completed and the plan is not approved at the Ontrack
special meeting, the plan will not qualify under Section 423, and participants
who have purchase rights under the plan, which are referred to in the plan as
options, will recognize as ordinary income the difference between the fair
market value of the stock on the date of exercise and the purchase price.
Alternatively, if the merger is not completed and the plan is not approved by
the Ontrack shareholders within 12 months of its adoption by the Ontrack board,
the plan will not qualify under Section 423, with the tax consequences described
in the preceding sentence.

        As described in "The Merger Agreement - Other Material Covenants -
Treatment of Ontrack Stock Options and the Ontrack 2001 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan," if the merger described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is
completed, all outstanding purchase rights will be exercised for shares of
Ontrack common stock, these shares of Ontrack common stock will be converted to
shares of Kroll common stock as a result of the merger, and the plan will be
terminated. This will occur regardless of whether the plan is approved by the
Ontrack shareholders. Ontrack is asking its shareholders to approve the plan so
that the exercise of purchase rights to purchase shares under the plan upon
completion of the merger will qualify for tax treatment under Section 423.

Purchase Rights Under the Plan

        In general, the plan permits employees to purchase shares of Ontrack
common stock through payroll withholding during a specified period, called a
"phase," at a price equal to the lesser of 85% of the value of the common stock
on the commencement date of a phase, referred to as the "commencement date," or
85% of the value of a share of common stock on the date of termination of a
phase, referred to as the "termination date". Each phase will generally last for
three months, or for such shorter or longer period of time not to exceed 27
months as may be determined by the stock purchase committee of the board of
directors prior to each commencement date. Phases may run concurrently. Until
the ratification of the plan by Ontrack shareholders, the commencement date of
each phase will begin on the first day of each calendar quarter and the
termination date of each phase will be the last day of the calendar quarter in
which the adoption of the plan is ratified by Ontrack shareholders. The current
phases began on October 1, 2001, January 1, 2002 and April 1, 2002,
respectively. Regardless of whether Ontrack shareholders approve and approve the
plan, the termination date for each current phase will be the last business day
of the pay period ending immediately prior to the merger.

Term of Plan

        The plan commenced effective October 1, 2001, and will terminate on
September 30, 2010, unless terminated earlier as described below. The plan will
terminate on September 27, 2002 unless shareholder approval is received by such
time. However, shareholder approval is not necessary in the event the merger is
completed and, in that event, the plan will be terminated upon completion of the
merger. If the merger is completed, all outstanding purchase rights under the
plan will automatically be exercised on the last business day of the pay period
immediately preceding the completion of the merger, and each participant in the
plan will be issued shares of Ontrack common stock. These shares of common stock
will then be automatically be converted into the right to receive shares of
Kroll common stock in the merger on the same exchange ratio applicable to the
conversion of Ontrack common stock in the merger. Ontrack will terminate the
plan on the last business day of the pay period immediately preceding the
completion of the merger, and no purchase rights will be granted after
termination of the plan. See "The Merger Agreement - Other Material Covenants -
Treatment of Ontrack Stock Options and the Ontrack 2001 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan" for a description of the treatment of the plan in connection with the
merger.

Eligibility

        Any employee of Ontrack who is customarily employed by Ontrack for more
than 20 hours per week and more than five months in a calendar year, and who has
completed at least 30 days of continuous employment service for Ontrack prior to
the commencement date of a phase, is eligible to participate in the plan. Unless
otherwise determined by the Ontrack board of directors, employees of any
subsidiary of Ontrack may also may participate. All eligible employees who were
participants in the final purchase period of Ontrack's 1996 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan have automatically been enrolled in the first phase and subsequent
phases under the plan unless such employee chose to withdraw. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the plan, no employee may be granted a purchase
right under the plan to purchase shares of common stock if that employee,
immediately after the grant of the purchase right, would own stock (including
shares subject to the purchase right) possessing 5% or more of the total
combined voting power or value of all classes of issued and outstanding stock of
Ontrack.

Limitation on Purchase Rights

        No participant may be granted a purchase right to purchase shares of
common stock that would permit the participant to purchase shares in any
calendar year under the plan or any other employee stock purchase plan of
Ontrack with an aggregate fair market value in excess of $25,000 or with the
number of shares exceeding 20,000 shares per Phase.

Participation

        Eligible employees elect to participate in the plan by completing an
enrollment form and delivering it to Ontrack or its designated representative at
least 10 days prior to the Commencement Date of the applicable phase of the
plan. Payroll deductions must be in amounts calculated to be as uniform as
practicable throughout the phase, in the aggregate amount not less than 1% nor
in excess of 10% of such participant's pay for the term of the phase, or such
smaller percentage as may be determined by the stock purchase committee or board
of directors, as applicable, prior to the commencement of a phase. After the
commencement date of a phase, participants cannot increase or decrease the
amount of payroll deductions, but may withdraw from participation during the
phase, as described below.

Terms and Conditions of Purchase Rights

        A participant who is employed by Ontrack as of the commencement date of
a phase shall be granted a purchase right to purchase a number of shares of
Ontrack common stock determined by dividing the total amount credited to that
participant's account pursuant to payroll deductions by the price described
below. The purchase right price for employees who participate on a particular
commencement date shall be the lesser of: (1) 85% of the fair market value of
the shares on the commencement date, or (2) 85% of the fair market value of the
shares on the termination date of the applicable phase of the plan.

Exercise and Withdrawal

        Exercise of the purchase right occurs automatically on a particular
termination date unless a participant gives written notice at any time during
the applicable phase of the plan that he or she does not wish to continue to
participate during that phase, in which case all amounts withheld will be
refunded without interest accrued thereon. Upon exercise of a purchase right,
the participant shall also receive a cash payment equal to the balance, if any,
without interest accrued on the balance, in his or her account that was not used
for the purchase of common stock. Partial withdrawals of payroll deductions are
not allowed.

Reinvestment of Dividends

        Unless otherwise provided by the stock purchase committee, dividends on
a participant's shares are automatically reinvested in additional shares of
Ontrack common stock.

Administration and Amendment

        The plan is administered by the stock purchase committee, which consists
of two or more directors or employees of Ontrack who are appointed by the board
of directors. If the board of directors does not appoint a stock purchase
committee, the board of directors will administer the plan. The board of
directors may at any time amend the plan, except that no amendment may impair
any outstanding purchase right without shareholder approval.

Income Tax Consequences

        The plan is intended to qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan"
under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Neither the grant nor the
exercise of a purchase right to purchase shares under the plan will generally
have any tax consequences to the participants or to Ontrack. However, the
exercise of the purchase right may result in income for alternative minimum tax
purposes, and under proposed regulations which would become effective only if
finalized, the exercise of the purchase right on or after January 1, 2003 would
be subject to FICA and FUTA taxes on the excess of the fair market value of the
shares on the date of exercise over the exercise price paid by the participant
for the shares. If a participant holds the shares acquired upon the exercise of
his or her purchase rights for more than two years from the date the purchase
right is granted and one year from the time the shares are received, then
amounts realized by the participant on a sale or other disposition of the shares
will be ordinary income in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the fair market
value of the stock on the date of grant less the exercise price for the shares
(determined as if the option were exercised at the time of its grant), or (ii)
the fair market value of the shares on the date of disposition less the price
paid by the participant for the shares. Any further gain is treated as long-term
capital gain. If a participant holds shares purchased under the plan at the time
of his or her death, the required holding periods will automatically be deemed
to have been satisfied. Ontrack is not entitled to any deduction if the holding
period requirements are satisfied. If a participant sells or otherwise disposes
of the shares purchased under the plan before the holding period

requirements are satisfied, the participant will realize as ordinary income the
excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise of the
purchase right over the price paid by the participant for the shares; the
difference between the proceeds of sale and the fair market value of the shares
on the date of exercise will be treated as long-term or short-term capital gain
or loss, as the case may be. Ontrack is entitled to a tax deduction only to the
extent the participant realizes ordinary income as a result of the early
disposition.

        described in detail in "Ontrack Proposal No. 2 - Approval of the Ontrack
        2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan." The Nonqualified Stock Option Plan
        is described below.

        Nonqualified Stock Option Plan. Ontrack has a total of 400,000 shares of
common stock reserved for issuance under the Nonqualified Stock Option Plan. The
option plan was adopted by the Ontrack board on October 25, 1995 and will expire
on October 25, 2005 unless terminated prior to that date. The

option plan is not required to be and has not been approved by Ontrack
shareholders. Ontrack has not granted any options under the option plan since
December 31, 2001 and does not intend to do so. The option plan provides for the
granting of non-qualified stock options to directors, officers and employees of
Ontrack at the fair market value of Ontrack common stock at the grant date.
Options granted under the option plan are generally fully vested. The plan
generally has option terms under existing options of six years. As of December
31, 2001, 60,974 shares were reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding
options and 3,132 shares were available for grant under the option plan.

Vote Required

        Shareholder adoption and approval of the plan requires the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Ontrack common stock
represented at the Ontrack special meeting in person or by proxy and entitled to
vote.

        The Ontrack board of directors recommends a vote "FOR" adoption and
approval of the plan.
