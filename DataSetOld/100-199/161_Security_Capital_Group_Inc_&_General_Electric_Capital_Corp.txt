General Electric Capital Corporation ("GE Capital") and Security Capital. If the
merger is completed, Security Capital will become an indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of GE Capital, and you will receive $26.00 in cash for each of your
shares of Security Capital class B stock, subject to the substitution, at the
option of GE Capital, of a combination of cash and common shares of beneficial
interest of ProLogis Trust owned by Security Capital with an agreed aggregate
value of $26.00 per share. Each share of Security Capital class A stock will be
converted into the right to receive 50 times the per share class B
consideration.

     The Security Capital board has determined that the merger is advisable,
fair to and in the best interests of Security Capital and its stockholders.
ACCORDINGLY, THE SECURITY CAPITAL BOARD HAS APPROVED AND ADOPTED THE MERGER
AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER, AND RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE
MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER AT THE SPECIAL MEETING.

     The accompanying notice of special meeting and proxy statement explain the

     Your vote is very important. We cannot complete the merger unless holders
of shares entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on
the proposal approve the merger agreement and the merger. Accordingly, failing

recorded. You can also authorize a proxy to vote your shares of Security Capital

                      QUESTIONS & ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q:   WHY IS SECURITY CAPITAL PROPOSING THE MERGER?
A:   Security Capital believes that the merger fulfills its goal of
     substantially eliminating the trading discount to its net asset value, and
     that the current transaction presents stockholders with a significant
     premium to the market prices of Security Capital class A and class B stock
     over the past three years. Security Capital believes that Security Capital
     stockholders could expect to realize greater value from the proposed
     transaction with GE Capital than could be expected to be generated in a
     reasonable period were Security Capital to remain independent.

     To review  the  reasons  for the  merger in  greater  detail,  see pages __
     through __.

Q:   WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE MERGER?
A:   In the merger, Security Capital will merge with an indirect wholly owned
     subsidiary of GE Capital and survive as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary
     of GE Capital. The merger agreement is attached to this document as
     Appendix A. We encourage you to read it carefully.

Q:   WHAT WILL I RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?
A:   Security Capital class B stockholders:
     --------------------------------------
     In the merger, each share of Security Capital class B stock will be
     converted into the right to receive $26.00 in cash, subject to
     the substitution, at GE Capital's election, of a combination of cash and
     ProLogis common shares with an agreed aggregate value of $26.00.

     If GE Capital elects to substitute ProLogis common shares currently owned
     by Security Capital for a portion of the merger consideration, each share
     of class B stock will receive approximately 0.3 ProLogis common shares for
     each share of class B stock. The ProLogis common shares will be valued
     based on the average closing prices on the ten full trading days ending on
     ____ __, 2002 (two days before the stockholders meeting). Stockholders will
     also receive cash in lieu of fractional common shares of ProLogis. Class B
     stockholders will receive the remainder of the consideration in cash so
     that the total value received, with ProLogis common shares valued as
     described above, will remain $26.00 per share. We expect to issue an
     announcement two days before the stockholders meeting with the exact number
     of ProLogis common shares, if any, and the exact amount of cash to be
     received.

     A prospectus describing the ProLogis common shares which you may receive
     also has been sent to you. We encourage you to read it carefully.

     Security Capital class A stockholders:
     --------------------------------------
     In the merger, each share of Security Capital class A stock will be
     converted into the right to receive 50 times the per share class B
     consideration.

     Security Capital option holders:
     --------------------------------
     Following the merger, each option to purchase Security Capital class A or
     class B stock will be cancelled, and the holder will receive cash in the
     amount of the difference, or "spread," if any, between $26 in the case of
     an option to purchase class B stock or $1,300 in the case of an option to
     purchase class A stock, and the exercise price per share of such option
     (less applicable withholding taxes).

     If GE Capital elects to substitute ProLogis common shares, each option
     holder may elect to receive the merger consideration (less the applicable
     exercise price and withholding taxes) in lieu of a payment entirely in
     cash.

     Security Capital convertible debenture holders:
     -----------------------------------------------
     Following the merger, each Security Capital 6.5% convertible subordinated
     debenture due 2016 which has not been converted will remain outstanding and
     will be convertible, at the option of the holder, into the merger
     consideration received by holders of class A stock. Alternatively, prior to
     the merger, convertible debenture holders may elect to convert such
     debentures into Security Capital class A stock pursuant to the terms of
     such debentures, in which case they will receive the same consideration as
     other holders of class A stock.

     Security Capital series B preferred holders:
     --------------------------------------------
     Following the merger, each share of series B preferred stock which has not
     been converted will remain outstanding and will be convertible at the
     option of the holder into the merger consideration received by holders of
     class B stock. Alternatively, prior to the merger, series B preferred
     holders may elect to convert such shares into class B stock pursuant to the
     terms of the series B preferred stock, in which case they will receive

                                      -i-

     the same consideration as other holders of class B stock.

Q:   WHAT ARE THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER?
A:   The merger will be a taxable transaction to you. For United States federal
     income tax purposes, you will generally recognize gain or loss in the
     merger in an amount equal to the difference between the sum of the cash and
     the fair market value of the ProLogis common shares, if any, you receive or
     are deemed to receive, and your tax basis in Security Capital common stock.
     Because determining the tax consequences of the merger can be complicated,
     you should consult your own tax advisor in order to understand fully how
     the merger will affect you.

Q:   SHOULD I SEND IN MY SECURITY CAPITAL STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW?
A:   No. After the merger is completed, Security Capital stockholders will
     receive written instructions for exchanging their Security Capital
     stock certificates.  Please do not send in your Security Capital stock
     certificates with your proxy.

Q:   WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO COMPLETE THE MERGER?
A:   We are working to complete the merger as quickly as practicable. In
     addition to the required stockholder approvals, we must also obtain certain
     regulatory approvals. We expect to complete the merger in the first or
     second quarter of 2002.

Q:   DO I HAVE APPRAISAL RIGHTS?
A:   No. No rights of appraisal are available.

Q:   WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?
A:   Carefully read and consider the information contained in this document.
     There are several ways your shares can be represented at the stockholder
     meeting. You can attend the stockholder meeting in person or you can
     indicate on the enclosed proxy card how you want to vote and then sign and
     mail the proxy card in the enclosed return envelope as soon as possible.
     You may also authorize a proxy via the Internet or by telephone to vote
     your shares instead by following the instructions set forth on your proxy
     card.

     Your vote is important regardless of the number of shares that you own.

Q:   IF MY BROKER HOLDS MY SHARES IN "STREET NAME," WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY
     SHARES?
A:   Your broker will not vote your shares unless you follow the voting
     directions your broker provides to you.

     If you fail to provide your broker with instructions, it will have the same
     effect as a vote against the merger.

Q:   CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I HAVE DELIVERED MY PROXY?
A:   Yes.  You can change your vote by sending in a written notice of revocation
     or a later-dated, signed proxy card to the Secretary of Security Capital
     at or before the stockholders meeting or by attending the meeting in person
     and voting.

Q:   WHAT IF I DON'T VOTE?
A:   If you do not vote or if you return your proxy marked "ABSTAIN," it will
     have the same effect as a vote against the merger.

Q:   WHOM SHOULD I CALL WITH QUESTIONS?
A:   If you have any questions about the proposed merger, including how to
     complete and return your proxy card, please call the firm assisting us with
     the solicitation of proxies:

THE MERGER AND THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND MAY NOT CONTAIN ALL OF THE INFORMATION
THAT IS IMPORTANT TO YOU AS A SECURITY CAPITAL STOCKHOLDER. ACCORDINGLY, WE
ENCOURAGE YOU TO CAREFULLY READ THIS ENTIRE DOCUMENT AND THE DOCUMENTS TO WHICH
WE HAVE REFERRED YOU.

THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION

THE  PROPOSAL (PAGE __).  We are asking you to consider and vote upon a
     proposal to approve the merger agreement that provides for Security Capital
     to be acquired by GE Capital and the merger of an indirect wholly owned
     subsidiary of GE Capital with and into Security Capital.

WHAT YOU WILL RECEIVE (PAGE __). Upon completion of the merger, you will be
     entitled to receive $26.00 in value for each of your shares of Security
     Capital class B stock. A holder of a share of class A stock will receive 50
     times the value received by a holder of a share of class B stock. At the
     election of GE Capital, a portion of the class B consideration may consist
     of common shares of ProLogis Trust (which we refer to as ProLogis) owned by
     Security Capital. A PROSPECTUS DESCRIBING THE PROLOGIS COMMON SHARES WHICH
     YOU MAY RECEIVE ALSO HAS BEEN SENT TO YOU. WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO READ IT
     CAREFULLY.

     voting on the proposal, that the merger is advisable, fair to and in the
     best interests of Security Capital and its stockholders and has approved
     and adopted the merger agreement and the merger. The Security Capital board
     recommends that stockholders vote FOR approval of the merger agreement and
     the merger at the special meeting.

OPINION OF GOLDMAN SACHS (PAGE __ AND APPENDIX C). On December 14, 2001, Goldman
     Sachs delivered to the Security Capital board a written opinion, dated
     December 14, 2001, that, based upon and subject to the matters set forth in
     the opinion, as of the date of the opinion, the consideration to be
     received by the holders of the class A stock and the class B stock of
     Security Capital pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial
     point of view to the holders.

     Goldman Sachs provided its advisory services and its opinion for the
     information and assistance of the Security Capital board in connection with
     its consideration of the merger. Goldman Sachs' opinion is not a
     recommendation as to how any Security Capital stockholder should vote at
     the special meeting. THE FULL TEXT OF GOLDMAN SACHS' OPINION, WHICH SETS
     FORTH ASSUMPTIONS MADE, MATTERS CONSIDERED AND LIMITATIONS ON THE REVIEW
     UNDERTAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE OPINION, IS ATTACHED AS APPENDIX C TO
     THIS PROXY STATEMENT AND WE URGE YOU TO READ THE OPINION IN ITS ENTIRETY.

THE SPECIAL MEETING

DATE, TIME AND PLACE (PAGE __). The special meeting will be held on [ ], [ ]
     [ ], 2002 at __:00 a.m., local time at [ ].

REQUIRED VOTE (PAGE _). Approval of the merger requires the affirmative vote of
     the holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders
     of class A stock, class B stock and series B preferred stock, voting
     together as a single class.

     owned shares of Security Capital stock at the close of business on [ ] [ ],
     2002, the record date for the special meeting.  As of that date, [ ] shares

     (1)  by completing and returning the enclosed proxy card,

     (2)  by authorizing a proxy by telephone or through the Internet according
          to the instructions on the proxy card, or

     If you complete and return the enclosed proxy but wish to revoke it, you

THE MERGER

THE  STRUCTURE (PAGE __). On the terms and subject to the conditions of the
     merger agreement, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of GE Capital will
     merge with and into Security Capital. Security Capital will remain in
     existence as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of GE Capital. Security
     Capital common stockholders will have no equity interest in Security
     Capital or GE Capital after the merger.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT (PAGE __). The merger will be treated as a "purchase" for
     accounting purposes.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES (PAGE __). The merger
     will be a taxable transaction to you. For United States federal income tax
     purposes, you generally will recognize gain or loss in the merger in an
     amount equal to the difference between the sum of the cash and the fair
     market value of the ProLogis common shares, if any, you receive or are
     deemed to receive and your tax basis in Security Capital common stock.
     Because determining the tax consequences of the merger can be complicated,
     you should consult your own tax advisor in order to understand fully how
     the merger will affect you.

ANTITRUST MATTERS (PAGE __). Under United States federal antitrust law, the
     merger may not be completed until Security Capital and GE Capital have made
     filings with the United States Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust
     Division of the United States Department of Justice, and the applicable
     waiting periods have expired or been terminated. On January 3, 2002,
     Security Capital and GE Capital filed the requisite notification reports
     with the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. The
     waiting period will expire February 4, 2002 unless earlier terminated or
     extended. GE Capital and Security Capital do not believe the merger
     requires any other antitrust approvals, but if any such approvals are
     determined to be necessary, the parties will make the requisite filings
     expeditiously.

DISSENTERS' APPRAISAL RIGHTS (PAGE __). Under Maryland law, Security Capital
     stockholders will not have dissenters' rights to an appraisal of their
     shares in connection with the merger.

MERGER FINANCING (PAGE __). GE Capital expects to finance the merger from the
     issuance of its commercial paper in the ordinary course. Completion of the
     merger is not conditioned on any financing arrangements.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT (PAGE __ AND APPENDIX A)

CLOSING OF THE MERGER (PAGE __). Before we can complete the merger, we must
     satisfy a number of conditions. These include:

          o  approval of the merger agreement and the merger by the affirmative
             vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders
             of the voting securities of Security Capital voting together as a
             single class;

          o  absence of any legal prohibitions against the merger;

          o  expiration or early termination of applicable waiting periods under
             United States federal antitrust laws and any other applicable
             antitrust laws;

          o  receipt of other material governmental consents and approvals;

          o  no material adverse effect will have occurred with respect to
             Security Capital; and

          o  Security Capital's representations and warranties we be true and
             Security Capital will have complied with

                                      -ii-

             its obligations under the merger agreement.

     We expect to merge as promptly as practicable after all of the conditions
     to the merger have been satisfied or waived.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT (PAGE __).
     Security Capital and GE Capital may agree in writing to terminate the
     merger agreement at any time without completing the merger, even after
     Security Capital stockholders have approved the merger agreement and the
     merger. The merger agreement also may be terminated at any time prior to
     the effective time of the merger:

          o  by either party if any court or governmental agency issues a final
             order preventing the merger;

          o  by either party if the merger is not completed by August 14, 2002;

          o  by GE Capital if the Security Capital board changes its
             recommendation or fails to reconfirm its recommendation of the
             merger agreement and the merger or approves an alternative
             acquisition proposal;

          o  by Security Capital after giving GE Capital at least three days
             prior written notice of its intent to terminate the merger
             agreement because it has received a more favorable acquisition
             proposal which it intends to accept, GE Capital in the three-day
             period fails to increase the merger consideration to be equal to
             or greater than the alternative proposal, and Security Capital
             pays a termination fee of $120 million plus expenses of up to $40
             million and Security Capital immediately enters into an agreement
             with respect to the alternative transaction;

          o  by either party if the other party materially breaches its
             representations or agreements and fails to cure its breach within
             30 days after receiving notice of the breach or the breach is
             incapable of being cured prior to August 14, 2002; and

          o  by either party if Security Capital stockholders fail to approve
             the merger agreement and the merger at the special meeting
             (including any adjournments or postponements of the special
             meeting).

TERMINATION FEE IF MERGER IS NOT COMPLETED (PAGE __). In addition to the
     circumstances described above, we must also pay GE Capital a termination
     fee of $120 million and expenses of up to $40 million if:

          o  the merger agreement is terminated by GE Capital because the
             Security Capital board changes its recommendation or fails to
             reconfirm its recommendation of the merger agreement and the
             merger or approves an alternative acquisition proposal; or

          o  the merger agreement is terminated by either GE Capital or
             Security Capital because the Security Capital stockholders fail to
             approve the merger agreement and the merger after the Security
             Capital board has changed its recommendation or fails to reconfirm
             its recommendation of the merger agreement and the merger or
             approves an alternative acquisition proposal;

AND

          o  a third party has previously proposed publicly to acquire Security
             Capital; or

          o  within 12 months following the termination of the merger
             agreement, Security Capital is acquired or enters into a
             definitive agreement to be acquired by a third party.

SUPPORT AGREEMENTS (PAGE __ AND APPENDIX B).

     As an inducement to GE Capital to enter into the merger agreement, two
stockholders holding 7.39% of the voting power of Security Capital as of
December 31, 2001 have executed Support Agreements agreeing to vote their shares
in favor of the merger. The Support Agreements could discourage other persons
from trying or proposing to combine with Security Capital before we complete the
merger.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER (PAGE __).

     When the Security Capital board considered the merger and the merger
agreement, the Security Capital board was aware that certain of the officers

                                      -iii-

and directors of Security Capital have interests and arrangements that may be
different from, or in addition to, your interests as Security Capital
stockholders.

     ownership of Atlantic decreased to less than 50%. Accordingly, Atlantic was
     not consolidated effective January 1, 1997.

(2)  In January 2001, Security Capital acquired all of the assets of Security
     Capital U.S. Realty for 45.4 million shares of Class B stock and $565
     million in cash, resulting in higher revenues, expenses and real estate.

(3)  The realized gains in 2000 and 2001 were the result of the sale of
     substantially all of Security Capital's shares of Archstone Communities
     Trust.

(4)  These are loss provisions recorded at Homestead and relating to the sale of
     Strategic Hotel Capital in which Security Capital disposed of its 33%
     ownership in 1999.

(5)  Security Capital does not guarantee the debt of any of its consolidated
     or unconsolidated operating companies.

(6)  257,642 shares of series B preferred stock were issued on May 12, 1998, in
     exchange for the 139,000 shares of series A preferred stock and 3,293,288
     shares of class B stock.

(7)  Includes the conversion of class A stock into class B stock.

(8)  On September 29, 1997, Security Capital called for redemption its
     convertible debentures due 2014. Substantially all the holders of these
     debentures elected to convert their debentures into class A stock.

(9)  In June 2000, Security Capital completed a cash tender offer and a merger
     for substantially all of the publicly held shares of Homestead's common
     stock it did not already own. In November 2001, Security Capital sold all
     of its interest in Homestead.

VOTING YOUR SHARES

     We will vote all shares of Security Capital class A stock, class B stock
and series B preferred stock represented by properly executed proxies received
before or at the Security Capital special meeting in accordance with the
instructions indicated on those proxies, unless the proxies are revoked. If you
do not indicate any instructions on a properly executed proxy card, we will vote
the shares represented by the proxy FOR approval of the merger proposal. We urge
you to mark the box on the proxy card to indicate how to vote your shares.

     We will count properly executed proxies marked "Abstain" for purposes of
determining whether there is a quorum, but we will not vote any of the shares
represented by these proxies at the Security Capital special meeting. If you
hold your shares in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you must instruct
the broker or bank on how to vote your shares. If an executed proxy card is
returned by a broker or bank holding shares which indicates that the broker or
bank does not have discretionary authority to vote at the special meeting, the
shares will be considered present at the meeting for purposes of determining the
presence of a quorum, but will not be considered to have been voted. Your broker
or bank will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote by
following the information provided to you by your broker or bank. If you are a
participant in the Security Capital 401(k) Plan and you do not vote your
Security Capital common stock held by the 401(k) Plan, the administrator for the
401(k) Plan will instruct the trustee to vote your Security Capital stock in
proportion to the votes received from other participants. Abstentions, failures
to respond and broker non-votes will have the effect of votes against the merger
proposal, since the vote required to approve the merger proposal is based on the
total number of shares outstanding.

     We do not expect any matters other than those mentioned above to be brought
before the special meeting. If, however, other matters are presented, the
persons named as proxies will vote in accordance with their discretion with
respect to those matters, unless authority to do so is withheld in the proxy.

HOW TO REVOKE A PROXY

     You may revoke your proxy before we vote it at the special meeting in one
of three ways:

          o  notifying the Secretary of Security Capital in writing;

          o  submitting a later dated proxy; or

          o  appearing in person and voting at the special meeting if you are a
             holder of record.  Attendance at the special meeting will
             not in and of itself constitute revocation of a proxy.

     If you choose either of the first two methods, you must submit your notice
of revocation or your new proxy to the Secretary of Security Capital before your
proxy is voted at the special meeting. If you hold your shares through an
account at a brokerage firm or bank, or through the 401(k) Plan, you should
contact your brokerage firm or bank or, in the case of the 401(k) Plan, the plan
trustee, to change your vote.

                                      -5-

COST OF SOLICITATION

     Security Capital will bear its own costs of solicitation of proxies.
Security Capital has retained Georgeson, for a fee of $25,000 plus additional
charges related to telephone calls and other services, to assist in the
solicitation of proxies. Security Capital and Georgeson will also request banks,
brokers and other intermediaries holding Security Capital shares beneficially
owned by others to send this proxy statement to, and obtain proxies from, the
beneficial owners and will reimburse the holders for their reasonable expenses.
Security Capital may supplement its solicitation of proxies by mail through
solicitation by telephone, telegram and other electronic means, advertisements
and personal solicitation by the directors, officers or employees of Security
Capital. Security Capital will not pay any additional compensation to directors,
officers or employees for any such solicitation.

                                   THE MERGER

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

         At a series of meetings of the Security Capital Board held between
February 1999 and December 2001, the board reviewed with management Security
Capital's business, structure, relationships with its public and private
investees and ideas for creating stockholder value. At these meetings the board
discussed a number of ways to increase stockholder value, simplify the structure
of Security Capital and eliminate the discount to the underlying value of its
assets. Some of the topics discussed included selling its ownership interests in
businesses which no longer met its objectives and increasing its ownership
interests in other businesses, so that upon completion, Security Capital would
own all or a high percentage of six real estate businesses that function as
private operating divisions. The board also discussed other strategies which
might strengthen Security Capital's balance sheet.

         In connection with these board discussions, Security Capital took a
number of actions with respect to its interests in its portfolio companies.
These actions included the following:

         o  the sale of Security Capital's interests in Strategic Hotel Capital
            in September 1999;
         o  the acquisition of the remaining interests Security Capital did not
            own in Homestead Village Incorporated in June 2000;
         o  the sale of Security Capital's interests in Archstone-Smith Trust
            (formerly Archstone Communities Trust) between July 2000
            and February 2001;
         o  the acquisition of the remaining interests Security Capital did not
            own in Security Capital U.S. Realty in January 2001;
         o  the sale of Security Capital's interests in CWS Communities Trust
            in August 2001;
         o  the sale of Security Capital's interests in Homestead Village
            Incorporated in November 2001;
         o  the sale of Security Capital's interests in CarrAmerica during
            November and December 2001; and
         o  the entry into an agreement to purchase the remaining interest in
            Storage USA in December 2001.

In addition, as part of Security Capital's strategy to increase stockholder
value, Security Capital instituted a stock buyback program and between September
1999 and April 2001 purchased common stock and convertible debentures for a
total of $601 million.

         During the first quarter of 2000, GE Capital contacted Security Capital
regarding possible business opportunities involving the two firms. Discussions
were held between William Sanders and C. Ronald Blankenship of Security Capital
and Ronald Pressman and Steven Hoover of GE Capital. The discussions covered a
wide range of potential transactions, including the formation of a joint venture
to explore potential real estate transactions, the possible sale of one or more
of Security Capital's interests in its public and private investees, the
possibility of management taking Security Capital private and GE Capital
providing the financing for the potential transaction, and the possibility of
GE Capital taking an equity position in Security Capital. At that time shares of
the Class B stock were trading in the range of $12.00 to $14.69 per share.
Security Capital management, in consultation with the board, decided not to
pursue any of these matters.

         In February 2000, the Board of Directors of Security Capital U.S.
Realty, a former affiliate of Security Capital organized under Luxembourg law,
determined to sell $55,000,000 principal amount of 6.5% Convertible Subordinated
Debentures due 2016 of Security Capital that it owned, as well as shares of
Security Capital common stock, in order to provide funds for Security Capital
U.S. Realty to repurchase its own shares. Toward that end, Security Capital U.S.
Realty contacted a number of potential purchasers, including GE Capital. In
February 2000, GE Capital executed a confidentiality agreement with Security
Capital and performed due diligence on Security Capital. In March 2000, GE
Capital purchased the debentures from Security Capital U.S. Realty for
$39,875,000 in a private transaction. In March 2001, GE Capital sold the
debentures to an unaffiliated third party.

         Between March 2000 and September 2001, there were discussions from time
to time between Mr. Sanders and senior officers of GE Capital regarding possible
business opportunities involving the two firms, although no agreements were
reached. These discussions were regularly reported to the board at its quarterly
meetings.

         In November 2000, Archstone Communities Trust, at the request of
Security Capital pursuant to a registration rights agreement, filed a
registration statement for all the shares of beneficial interest of Archstone
then owned

                                      -7-

by Security Capital. As a result of earlier discussions between
Security Capital and GE Capital, in early 2001, Steven Hoover of GE Capital
contacted Messrs. Sanders and Blankenship and Constance Moore of Security
Capital regarding a possible purchase of the Archstone shares. Discussions were
held but no agreement was reached, and in February 2001, Security Capital sold
substantially all its remaining shares in Archstone in an underwritten secondary
public offering.

         In early 2001, Security Capital determined to sell its 94% ownership
interest in CWS Communities Trust. Security Capital retained Macquarie Capital
Partners, which is 40% owned by Security Capital, to assist in the sale of the
entire equity interest in CWS. Macquarie Capital Partners contacted a number of
potential buyers, including GE Capital, to determine if they would be interested
in purchasing CWS. GE Capital signed a confidentiality agreement and received
information regarding CWS. However, no agreement was reached and in August 2001
Chateau Communities Trust acquired all of CWS.

         On September 5, 2001, Mr. Sanders met with Michael Pralle, Alec Burger,
and Steven Hoover of GE Capital in New York City to again discuss possible
business opportunities involving the two companies. This meeting was arranged by
GE Capital and was the result of ongoing discussions which had been held between
Security Capital and GE Capital since early 2000. Mr. Sanders gave the GE
Capital representatives a presentation regarding Security Capital's current
business strategy.

         On September 25, 2001, in a telephone call between Alec Burger of GE
Capital and William Sanders of Security Capital, Mr. Burger brought up the
subject of GE Capital either acquiring Security Capital or management taking
Security Capital private and GE Capital providing the financing.

         Between October 1 and November 6, 2001, there were numerous phone calls
and meetings between Messrs. Sanders or Blankenship of Security Capital and
Michael Pralle, Alec Burger and other senior executives of GE Capital regarding
a possible acquisition of Security Capital by GE Capital. During this time
Security Capital provided GE Capital with public information regarding Security
Capital.

         In late October 2001, Mr. Sanders contacted individual members of the
Security Capital board regarding the discussions which were occurring between
Security Capital and GE Capital. These directors encouraged Mr. Sanders to
continue discussions.

         At the direction of the Security Capital board, in late October 2001,
Security Capital contacted Goldman, Sachs & Co. regarding a possible transaction
with GE Capital, and Security Capital retained Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz to
represent it as legal counsel in connection with a possible transaction with GE
Capital.

         On November 7, 2001, GE Capital and Security Capital executed a
confidentiality agreement. On November 7, 8 and 9, 2001, representatives of GE
Capital, and Merrill, Lynch & Co., Inc., financial advisor to GE Capital, met
with representatives of Security Capital and its financial advisor, at Security
Capital's offices in Santa Fe. Senior management of Security Capital gave
presentations regarding Security Capital's business and strategy.

         Between November 7 and November 16, 2001, Security Capital provided
additional information to GE Capital regarding Security Capital and its private
affiliates. During this period, Messrs. Sanders and Blankenship and Messrs.
Pralle and Burger held frequent discussions regarding terms of a possible
transaction, including price and consideration for a transaction. Mr. Sanders
conveyed to GE Capital that Security Capital would not be interested in pursuing
a transaction in which Security Capital stockholders received less than $26 in
cash per share. On November 16, 2001, Mr. Sanders called Mr. Burger and told him
that unless an agreement could be signed and announced by December 7, 2001,
Security Capital was not interested in pursuing a transaction with GE Capital.

         Between November 16 and November 21, 2001, discussions were suspended.
On the evening of November 21, 2001, Mr. Burger contacted Mr. Blankenship and
told him that GE Capital was willing to proceed with discussions concerning a
transaction. GE Capital then instructed its legal counsel, Weil, Gotshal &
Manges LLP, to begin preparation of a draft merger agreement and related
documentation.

                                      -8-

         On November 28, 2001, Mr. Blankenship participated in a conference call
with Alec Burger, other GE senior officers and counsel for Security Capital and
GE Capital to discuss the general terms of a possible transaction and a draft
merger agreement which had been prepared by counsel for GE Capital.

         On November 29, 2001, Mr. Sanders discussed with individual directors
of Security Capital, by telephone, the general outline of a possible transaction
with GE Capital. The directors encouraged management to continue discussions
with GE Capital.

         During the week of December 3, 2001, discussions between Security
Capital and GE Capital, and their respective financial and legal advisors,
continued. These discussions focused on the value to be received by Security
Capital stockholders in the transaction, the structure of the transaction, the
potential for the disposition of ProLogis shares owned by Security Capital, and
conditions to closing.

         Negotiations regarding the terms of the transaction, the potential
disposition of the ProLogis shares owned by Security Capital, conditions to
closing, support agreements and employment arrangements for senior officers of
Security Capital, and employee issues continued through December 12, 2001, with
numerous open issues.

         On December 7, 2001, at a regularly scheduled meeting, the board of GE
Capital approved the general terms of a transaction with Security Capital,
subject to approval by the Board of General Electric Company.

         On December 12, 2001, at a regularly scheduled Security Capital board
meeting, management presented a proposed transaction with GE Capital under which
GE Capital would acquire all the outstanding common stock of Security Capital in
a merger transaction for a fixed value of $26 per share of Class B stock, either
in the form of all cash or partially cash and partially shares of ProLogis at GE
Capital's election, and assume all outstanding indebtedness. Each share of class
A stock would be entitled to receive 50 times the per share consideration
received by holders of class B stock. Goldman Sachs made a financial
presentation to the board regarding the proposed transaction and advised the
board that, provided the terms of the draft merger agreement did not vary
materially from the terms presented to the board, it would be able to give a
fairness opinion on the transaction. Legal counsel to Security Capital discussed
the legal responsibilities of the board regarding the proposed transaction and
described the terms and conditions of the draft merger agreement and other
related matters.

         From December 12 to December 14, 2001, counsel to GE Capital and
counsel to Security Capital further discussed the draft merger agreement at the
direction of their respective clients. On the afternoon of December 14, 2001,
the Board of General Electric Company approved the terms of the merger
agreement.

         On the afternoon of December 14, 2001, at a special meeting of the
Security Capital board, management and its legal and financial advisors made
presentations to the board concerning the proposed merger and the status of
negotiations with GE Capital. Goldman Sachs made a financial presentation to the
board and gave its oral opinion (subsequently rendered in writing) to the board
that the consideration to be received in the transaction by the stockholders of
Security Capital was fair from a financial point of view. Legal counsel to
Security Capital described the consideration proposed to be paid in the merger
and the other material terms of the draft merger agreement, the support
agreements and the employment arrangements and other related matters. After
discussion and consideration, the Security Capital board determined that the
merger was advisable, approved the merger agreement and resolved to recommend to
the stockholders of Security Capital that they approve the merger agreement and
the merger.

     On the evening of December 14, 2001, after Security Capital's and GE
Capital's legal counsel had finalized the merger agreement and related matters,
Security Capital, GE Capital and EB Acquisition Corporation entered into the
merger agreement. On December 14, 2001, GE Capital and Security Capital issued a
joint press release announcing the merger and execution of the merger agreement.

SECURITY CAPITAL'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER; RECOMMENDATION OF THE SECURITY
CAPITAL BOARD

     At a special board meeting on December 14, 2001, the Security Capital board
determined that the merger is advisable, fair to and in the best interests of
Security Capital and its stockholders and, by the unanimous vote of all the

                                      -9-

directors present, approved and adopted the merger agreement, the support
agreements and the transactions contemplated by those agreements, including the
merger. ACCORDINGLY, THE SECURITY CAPITAL BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT SECURITY CAPITAL
STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR APPROVAL OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER AT THE
SPECIAL MEETING.

     In reaching its decision to approve and adopt the merger agreement, the
support agreements and the transactions contemplated by those agreements, and to
recommend that Security Capital stockholders vote to approve the merger
agreement and the merger, the Security Capital board considered the following
material factors:

     o   the current and historical market prices of Security Capital class A
         and class B stock relative to those of other industry participants and
         general market indices, including the fact that the respective
         $1,300.00 and $26.00 per share values represent premiums of 22.6% and
         25.6%, respectively, over the closing prices per share on the last
         trading day prior to the public announcement of the merger;

     o   the fact that the merger consideration provides $26.00 in value per
         share of class B stock and 50 times the per share class B consideration
         per share of class A stock, regardless of whether GE Capital elects to
         distribute shares of ProLogis;

     o   the fulfillment of Security Capital's goals of substantially
         eliminating the trading discount to its net asset value;

     o   the fact that the merger is not subject to any financing conditions;

     o   the  fact  that  the  merger  is not  subject  to the  approval  of GE
         stockholders;

     o   the presentations by Goldman Sachs on December 12, 2001 and its oral
         opinion of December 14, 2001, which was confirmed in a written opinion
         dated December 14, 2001, that, as of the date of such opinion, and
         based on and subject to the matters set forth in that opinion, the
         $26.00 and $1,300.00 per share in value to be received by holders of
         Security Capital class A and class B stock, respectively, pursuant to
         the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such
         holders (see "--Opinion of Goldman Sachs");

     o   the Security Capital board's familiarity with, and presentations by
         Security Capital's management and its financial advisor regarding, the
         business, operations, properties and assets, financial condition,
         competitive position, business strategy and prospects of Security
         Capital (as well as the risks involved in achieving those prospects),
         the financial budgets prepared by management, and current industry,
         economic and market conditions, both on an historical and on a
         prospective basis; and

     o   the views of management that, based on the foregoing, Security Capital
         stockholders could expect to realize greater value from the proposed
         transaction with GE Capital than could be expected to be generated in a
         reasonable time period if Security Capital were to remain independent.

     The Security Capital board also considered potential drawbacks or risks
relating to the merger, including the following material drawbacks and risks:

     o   the fact that the transaction would be taxable to Security Capital
         stockholders for United States federal income tax purposes; and

     o   the possibility that the termination fee and other provisions of the
         merger agreement, including GE Capital's right to match any superior
         proposal, and the terms of the support agreements might discourage
         other parties that might have an interest in a business combination
         with, or an acquisition of, Security Capital (see "The Merger

of Certain Persons in the Merger."

     The foregoing discussion addresses the material information and factors
considered by the Security Capital board in its consideration of the merger,
including factors that support the merger as well as those that may weigh
against it. In view of the variety of factors and the amount of information
considered, the Security Capital board did not find it practicable to and did
not make specific assessments of, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights
to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination. In addition,
the Security Capital board did not undertake to make any specific determination
as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was
favorable or unfavorable to its ultimate determination. The determination to
approve the merger was made after consideration of all of the factors as a
whole. In addition, individual members of the Security Capital board may have
given different weights to different factors.

PROJECTIONS

         Security Capital has advised GE Capital that it does not as a matter of
course make public any projections as to future performance, earnings or net
asset value, and the projections set forth below are included in this proxy
statement only because this information was provided to GE Capital. The
projections were not prepared with a view to public disclosure or compliance
with the published guidelines of the Commission or the guidelines established by
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants regarding projections or
forecasts. The projections do not purport to present operations or financial
condition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
Security Capital's independent auditors have not examined or compiled the
projections and accordingly assume no responsibility for them. Security Capital
has also advised GE Capital that its internal financial forecasts (upon which
the projections provided to GE Capital were based ) are, in general, prepared
solely for internal use and capital budgeting and other management decisions and
are subjective in many respects and thus susceptible to interpretations and
periodic revision based on actual experience and business developments. The
projections also reflect numerous assumptions made by management of Security
Capital, with respect to industry performance, general business, economic,
market and financial conditions and other matters, including effective tax rates
consistent with historical levels for Security Capital and the stock prices of
Security Capital's public investees, all of which are difficult to predict, many
of which are beyond Security Capital's control, and none of which are subject to
approval by GE Capital. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the
assumptions made in preparing the projections will prove accurate. It is
expected that there will be differences between actual and projected results,
and actual results may be materially greater or less than those contained in the
projections. The inclusion of the projections herein should not be regarded as
an indication that any of GE Capital, or Security Capital or their respective
affiliates or representatives considered or consider the projections to be a
reliable prediction of future events, and the projections should not be relied
upon as such. The projections, which do not reflect the redeployment of cash
generated from asset sales, anticipate earnings before depreciation,
amortization and deferred taxes (EBDADT) of $240.1 million for fiscal year 2002
(after payment of preferred stock dividends and interest on convertible debt),
EBDADT per share of $1.87 per share ($2.13 per share on a pro forma basis giving
effect to the completion of the Storage USA acquisition in March 2002) for
calendar year 2002, and post-tax net asset value (NAV) per share as of December
31, 2002 of $29.21. None of Security Capital or GE Capital or any of their
respective affiliates or representatives has made or makes any representation to
any person regarding the ultimate performance of Security Capital compared to
the information contained in the projections, and none of them intends to update
or otherwise revise the projections to reflect circumstances existing after the
date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event
that any or all of the assumptions underlying the projections are shown to be in
error.

OPINION OF GOLDMAN SACHS

         On December 14, 2001, Goldman Sachs delivered to the Security Capital
board a written opinion, dated December 14, 2001, that, based upon and subject
to the matters set forth in the opinion, as of the date of such opinion, the
consideration to be received by the holders of the class A stock and the class B
stock of Security Capital pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a
financial point of view to such holders.

         THE FULL TEXT OF THE WRITTEN OPINION OF GOLDMAN SACHS, DATED DECEMBER
14, 2001, WHICH SETS FORTH THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE, MATTERS CONSIDERED AND
LIMITATIONS ON THE REVIEW UNDERTAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE OPINION, IS ATTACHED
TO THIS PROXY STATEMENT AS APPENDIX C AND IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS
PROXY STATEMENT. GOLDMAN SACHS PROVIDED ITS ADVISORY SERVICES AND ITS OPINION
FOR THE INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE

                                      -11-

OF THE SECURITY CAPITAL BOARD IN CONNECTION WITH ITS CONSIDERATION OF THE
MERGER. THE GOLDMAN SACHS OPINION IS NOT A RECOMMENDATION AS TO HOW ANY HOLDER
OF CLASS A STOCK OR CLASS B STOCK SHOULD VOTE WITH RESPECT TO THE MERGER.
SECURITY CAPITAL STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE GOLDMAN SACHS OPINION IN ITS
ENTIRETY.

         In connection with its opinion, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other
things:

     o  the merger agreement and certain related documents;

     o  annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of
        Security Capital for the four years ended December 31, 2000;

     o  certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form
        10-Q of Security Capital for periods during 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001;

     o certain other communications from Security Capital to its stockholders;
and

     o  certain internal financial analyses and budgets for Security Capital
        prepared by its management. With respect to internal financial budgets
        prepared by Security Capital management in connection with calendar
        year 2002, Goldman Sachs did not utilize these budgets in performing
        any of the analyses described below because management's financial
        budgets did not account for deployment of available cash.

         Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior
management of Security Capital regarding their assessment of the strategic
rationale for the merger and the past and current business operations, financial
condition and future prospects of Security Capital. In addition, Goldman Sachs:

     o   reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the class A stock
         and class B stock of Security Capital and the reported price and
         trading activity for the equity securities of ProLogis;

     o   compared financial and stock market information for Security Capital
         with similar information for other companies the securities of which
         are publicly traded;

     o   reviewed the financial terms of recent business combinations in the
         real estate industry specifically and in other industries generally;
         and

     o   performed other studies and analyses Goldman Sachs considered
         appropriate (including where appropriate pro forma financial analyses
         as described below).

         Goldman Sachs has relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of
the financial, accounting and other information discussed with or reviewed by
it, and Goldman Sachs has assumed such accuracy and completeness for purposes of
rendering its opinion. In that regard, Goldman Sachs has assumed, with the
consent of Security Capital's board, that the internal financial budgets
prepared by the management of Security Capital have been reasonably prepared on
a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of
Security Capital. In addition, Goldman Sachs did not make an independent
evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities of Security Capital or any
of its subsidiaries and was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal.
Goldman Sachs was not requested to solicit and did not solicit interest from
other parties with respect to an acquisition of or other business combination
with Security Capital.

         The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented
by Goldman Sachs to Security Capital's board on December 12, 2001 in connection
with the board's consideration of the merger. It does not purport to be a
complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs. The order of
the analyses described, and the results of those analyses, do not represent the
relative importance or weight given to the analyses by Goldman Sachs. Except as
otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it
is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before
December 12, 2001, and is not necessarily indicative of current market
conditions.

                                      -12-

         THE FOLLOWING SUMMARIES OF FINANCIAL ANALYSES INCLUDE INFORMATION
PRESENTED IN TABULAR FORMAT. YOU SHOULD READ THESE TABLES TOGETHER WITH THE TEXT
OF EACH SUMMARY.

     SELECTED COMPANIES COMPARISON

         Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared selected financial information,
ratios and multiples for Security Capital to corresponding financial
information, ratios and multiples for the four publicly traded portfolio
companies of Security Capital (ProLogis, Regency Realty Corporation, Storage
USA. and CarrAmerica) and for other selected publicly traded companies from each
of the four real estate industry sectors in which the four portfolio companies
operate. On December 12, 2001, the day of Goldman's presentation to the Security
Capital board, CarrAmerica was still a portfolio company of Security Capital. On
November 19, 2001, CarrAmerica repurchased 32% of Security Capital's holdings in
CarrAmerica. Subsequently, on December 19, 2001, Security Capital sold the
remaining 68% of its holdings in CarrAmerica in an underwritten offering.

companies) consisted of:

         The multiples, ratios and other financial information reviewed by
Goldman Sachs were calculated based on the most recent publicly available
information and using closing share prices on December 7, 2001. The estimates of
funds from operations, or FFO, per share for Security Capital and for the
forty-two other companies included in the comparison were based on median
estimates provided by the Institutional Brokers Estimate System, or IBES, for
2001 and 2002. The median IBES estimates for FFO per share for Security Capital
was selected as the most appropriate estimate for comparison purposes. Although
Goldman Sachs reviewed Security Capital management's financial budgets, they
were not used in the analysis because Security Capital's management's financial
budgets did not account for deployment of available cash, whereas the IBES
estimates reflect research analysts' opinions and as-

                                      -13-

sumptions as to how Security Capital might use its available cash. In
addition, the estimates of net asset value, or NAV, per share for Security
Capital and for the forty-two other companies included in the comparison were
based on estimates provided by Green Street Advisors. Goldman Sachs' analysis of
the selected companies compared the following to the results for Security
Capital:

     o   the December 7, 2001 closing share price as a percentage of the
         52-week high share price;

     o   the annual dividend yield (based on the most recently reported
         dividend);

     o   the ratio of net debt (total debt less cash) to total market
         capitalization (the equity market value as of December 7, 2001 plus net
         debt and preferred equity). Net debt for Security Capital includes the
         cash proceeds from the sale of its full interest in Homestead and the
         sale of 32% of its holdings in CarrAmerica Realty to CarrAmerica Realty
         on November 19, 2001;

     o   the multiple of the closing share price on December 7, 2001 to
         estimated FFO per share for 2001 and 2002;

     o   the growth rate reflected by estimated 2001 and 2002 FFO per share;

     o   the ratio of (1) the multiple of estimated 2002 FFO per share
         represented by the closing share price on December 7, 2001 to (2) the
         growth rate calculated as described in the preceding bullet; and

     o   the premium (discount) to net asset value per share represented by the
         closing share price on December 7, 2001.

group of six industrial real estate companies (including ProLogis) are

     SELECTED TRANSACTIONS ANALYSIS

         Goldman Sachs reviewed 13 selected cash transactions in the real estate
industry since 1999 and 54 selected all stock or stock and cash transactions in
the real estate industry since 1994. The all stock or stock and cash
transactions were found not to be comparable to the proposed merger and were not
included in the analysis because: (i) in the proposed merger, a substantial, if
not the entire, part of the consideration will be cash, and (ii) the buyer in
the proposed merger is not a publicly traded real estate investment trust
whereas in the all stock or stock and cash transactions, the universe of buyers
was composed mostly of publicly traded real estate investment trusts. The
selected cash transactions consisted of acquisitions of the following companies:

        ------------------------------------------------------------------------
        ACQUIRED COMPANY                           PROPERTY TYPE

        Cabot Industrial Trust                     Industrial
        Franchise Finance Corporation              Net Lease
        Westfield America                          Regional Mall
        First Washington Realty Trust              Shopping Center
        Urban Shopping Centers                     Regional Mall
        Pacific Gulf Properties                    Diversified

        Cadillac Fairview                          Regional Mall
        Walden Residential                         Apartment
        Burnham Pacific Properties                 Shopping Center
        Berkshire Realty Investors                 Apartment

        Irvine Apartment Communities               Apartment
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Goldman Sachs analyzed and compared financial information relating to
these transactions to similar information for the proposed merger, including:

     o   the implied premium to the closing price of the acquired company's
         shares on the day prior to announcement of the transaction;

     o   the transaction FFO multiple calculated as the multiple of the implied
         price per share in the transaction to the estimated FFO per share for
         the acquired company at the time of the announcement of the
         transaction; and

     o   the implied premium (discount) to the net asset value per share of the
         acquired company (based on NAV estimates provided by Green Street
         Advisors).

         In comparing the selected transactions to the proposed merger, with
respect to the proposed merger, Goldman Sachs used (1) Security Capital's
management's estimates of 2001 per share earnings before depreciation,
amortization and deferred taxes, or EBDADT, which did not deviate materially
from median First Call FFO per share estimates for Security Capital, (2) a
December 7, 2001 closing share price for the class B stock of Security Capital,
and (3) an NAV per share of $26.85 which was calculated by Goldman Sachs based
on the September 30, 2001 $26.65 NAV (as disclosed in Security Capital's
September 30, 2001 quarterly supplemental information), as adjusted based on
current public market information and information provided by Security Capital's
management as described in the Net Asset Value Analysis section below. The
results of this analysis are summarized as follows:

NET ASSET VALUE ANALYSIS
         Goldman Sachs reviewed historical weekly closing stock price and
quarterly NAV (before and after deferred taxes) per share data for Security

         Goldman Sachs performed an NAV analysis of Security Capital to arrive
at a range of estimates for NAV per share of class B stock based on information
provided to Goldman Sachs by the management of Security Capital

                                      -17-

and analyses performed by research analysts who cover Security Capital.
Goldman Sachs utilized the following methodologies and assumptions in the NAV
analysis:

     o   Security Capital's investments in publicly traded companies were valued
         based on closing share prices as of December 7, 2001, with no liquidity
         discount applied. CarrAmerica is valued at the price for which Security
         Capital sold its shares;

     o   except for City Center Retail, Security Capital's investments in
         non-public companies were valued at original Security Capital cost
         (which may have the effect of understating NAV);

     o   the ongoing business of Security Capital Research and Management
         (comprising less than 5% of Security Capital's total assets) was valued
         in different ways by the several research analysts using the following
         different methodologies: fives times its estimated 2001 EBDADT, fives
         times its estimated 2001 EBITDA, 4% of its total assets and 1-3% of its
         assets under management;

     o   all other assets were valued at book value;

     o   liabilities (other than deferred tax liability) were derived from
         publicly available data as of September 30, 2001;

     o   all NAV calculations were reduced by an estimate of the deferred tax
         liability which Security Capital would be obligated to pay if it
         liquidated all of its investments; and

     o   all NAV calculations were adjusted to give effect to the sale of
         Security Capital's investment in Homestead (based on pro forma
         financial information contained in Security Capital's press release)
         and the sale of Security Capital's investment in CarrAmerica and the
         pending purchase by Security Capital of the remaining interest in
         Storage USA (based on information provided by Security Capital's
         management).

         The results of this analysis are summarized as follows:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                       HIGH             MEDIAN         LOW

    stock after deferred taxes represented by
    $26.00 per share merger consideration
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Goldman Sachs performed a "Look Through" NAV analysis, which values the
public portfolio companies based on their NAV as calculated by Green Street
Advisors, rather than based on their public market value. The resulting NAV per
share of class B stock after deferred taxes is reduced by $1.46 to $25.38.
Goldman Sachs conducted this analysis in order to adjust Security Capital's NAV
for any premiums or discounts ascribed by the market to the NAV of Security
Capital's public portfolio companies.

         The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not
necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting
portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering
the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes
underlying Goldman Sachs' opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination,
Goldman Sachs considered the results of all these analyses and did not attribute
any particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it. No company or
transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to
Security Capital or the merger.

                                      -18-

         The analyses were prepared solely for purposes of providing an opinion
to the Security Capital board as to the fairness from a financial point of view
of the consideration to be received by the holders of the class A stock and the
class B stock in the merger. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or
necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be
sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily
indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are
inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events
beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of Security
Capital, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future
results are materially different from those forecasted.

         As described above, the financial analysis presented by Goldman Sachs
to the Security Capital board was one of many factors taken into consideration
by the Security Capital board in making its determination to approve the merger.

         Goldman Sachs, as part of its investment banking business, is
continually engaged in performing financial analyses with respect to businesses
and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated
underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and
unlisted securities and private placements as well as for estate, corporate and
other purposes. Goldman Sachs is familiar with Security Capital, having provided
investment banking services to Security Capital and its affiliates from time to
time, including having acted as:

     o   an agent for Security Capital's public offering of $100 million
         aggregate principal amount of 7.75% Medium Term Notes, Series A
         in 1998;

     o   financial advisor in connection with the acquisition of Security
         Capital U.S. Realty in 2001;

     o   sole book runner and co-lead manager of the secondary public offering
         of Security Capital's 29.456 million shares of beneficial interest in
         Archstone Communities Trust in 2001; and

     o   sole book runner and sole lead manager of the secondary public offering
         of Security Capital's 16.873 million shares of common stock of
         CarrAmerica in 2001; and

having acted as its financial advisor in connection with, and having
participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the merger agreement.

         Goldman Sachs also has provided, and is currently providing, certain
investment banking services to GE Capital and its affiliates (including General
Electric Company, the ultimate parent company of GE Capital) from time to time,
including, but not limited to, having acted as:

     o   financial advisor in connection with GE Capital's purchase of MET Life
         Capital Credit Corporation in 1998;

     o   financial advisor in connection with GE Capital's purchase of Franchise
         Finance Corporation of America in 2001;

     o   financial advisor in connection with GE Capital's purchase of Mellon
         Financial Corporation in 2001; and

     o    underwriter of a significant  number of financing  transactions for GE
          Capital.

         In addition, Goldman Sachs may provide investment banking services to
GE Capital and its affiliates in the future. Goldman Sachs provides a full range
of financial advisory and securities services and, in the course of its normal
trading activities, may from time to time effect transactions and hold positions
in securities, including derivative securities, of Security Capital or General
Electric Company for its own account and for the accounts of customers.

         Pursuant to a letter agreement, dated October 29, 2001, Security
Capital exclusively engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in
connection with the possible sale of all or a portion of Security Capital.
Pur-

                                      -19-

suant to the terms of this letter agreement, Security Capital has agreed to
pay Goldman Sachs, upon completion of the merger, a fee of approximately $31
million. Security Capital also has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for its
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including attorneys' fees, and to indemnify
Goldman Sachs against certain liabilities, including certain liabilities under
the federal securities laws.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

     GENERAL

         The following is a summary of the material United States federal income
tax consequences of the merger to Security Capital stockholders. This summary is
based upon the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"), applicable current and proposed United States Treasury Regulations,
judicial authority, and administrative rulings and practice. Legislative,
judicial or administrative rules and interpretations are subject to change, at
any time, possibly on a retroactive basis, and, therefore, the following
statements and conclusions could be altered or modified. It is assumed that the
shares of Security Capital common stock are held as capital assets by a U.S.
Person. For purposes of this discussion, a "U.S. person" means a citizen or
resident of the United States, a corporation created or organized in the United
States or under the laws of the United States or of any State or political
subdivision of the foregoing, any estate whose income is includible in gross
income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source, or a trust
if, (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision
over the administration of the trust and (ii) one or more U.S. fiduciaries have
the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust. This discussion
does not address the aspects of United States federal income taxation that may
apply to pass-through entities. This discussion does not address all aspects of
United States federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular
Security Capital stockholder in light of that stockholder's personal investment
circumstances, or those stockholders subject to special treatment under the
United States federal income tax laws (for example, life insurance companies,
tax-exempt organizations, financial institutions, United States expatriates,
foreign corporations and nonresident alien individuals). In addition, this
discussion does not address the aspects of United States federal income taxation
that may be relevant to Security Capital stockholders who hold shares of
Security Capital common stock as part of a hedging, "straddle," conversion or
other integrated transaction, or Security Capital stockholders who acquired
their shares of Security Capital common stock through the exercise of employee
stock options or other compensation arrangements. In addition, the discussion
does not address any aspect of foreign, state or local taxation or estate and
gift taxation that may be applicable to a Security Capital stockholder.

     CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO SECURITY CAPITAL STOCKHOLDERS

         The receipt of the merger consideration in the merger will be a taxable
transaction for United States federal income tax purposes (and also may be a
taxable transaction under applicable state, local and other income tax laws). In
general, for United States federal income tax purposes, a holder of Security
Capital common stock will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between
the stockholder's adjusted tax basis in Security Capital common stock, and the
sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value of the ProLogis common
shares, if any, received or deemed received in respect thereof in the merger.
Gain or loss will be calculated separately for each block of shares converted in
the merger (i.e., shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction). The
gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and will be short-term gain or loss
if, at the effective time of the merger, the shares of Security Capital common
stock so converted were held for one year or less. If, at the effective time of
the merger, the shares of Security Capital common stock so converted were held
for more than one year, the gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss.
In the case of stockholders who are individuals, long-term capital gain is
currently eligible to be taxed at reduced rates for federal income tax purposes.
There are limitations on the deductibility of capital losses. The tax basis of
the ProLogis common shares received, if any, by a holder of Security Capital
common stock pursuant to the merger will be the fair market value of such shares
on the effective date of the merger.

         Some states and localities, including the state and city of New York,
impose transfer, sales, use, excise or similar taxes on certain indirect
transfers (including indirect transfers pursuant to corporate transactions such
as the merger) of an interest in real property (including leases) located
therein ("Transfer Taxes"). GE Capital has agreed to pay any such Transfer Taxes
that would be imposed as a result of the consummation of the merger (excluding
any taxes based on the gross or net income of any Security Capital stockholder)
or cause such Transfer Taxes to be paid. For United States federal income tax
purposes, the payments of Transfer Taxes may result in the deemed receipt of
additional consideration by such stockholder. In such event, such stockholder
should be entitled to claim a tax deduction or a reduction in the gain or an
increase in the loss realized on the sale of its shares of Security Capital
common stock in an amount equal to the amount of any such additional
consideration deemed to have been received.

                                      -20-

     BACKUP WITHHOLDING TAX

         Under the United States federal income tax backup withholding rules,
unless an exemption applies, GE Capital is required to and will withhold up to
30% of all payments to which a Security Capital stockholder or other payee is
entitled in the merger, unless the Security Capital stockholder or other payee
provides a tax identification number, or "TIN" (social security number, in the
case of an individual, or employer identification number, in the case of other
stockholders), and certifies under penalties of perjury that its TIN is correct,
the stockholder is not subject to backup withholding and the stockholder is a
United States person. Each Security Capital stockholder and, if applicable, each
other payee should complete and sign the substitute Form W-9 that will be part
of the letter of transmittal to be returned to the exchange agent (or other
agent) in order to provide the information and certification necessary to avoid
backup withholding, unless an applicable exemption exists and is otherwise
proved in a manner satisfactory to the exchange agent (or other agent). The
exemptions provide that certain Security Capital stockholders (including, among
others, corporations and certain foreign individuals) are generally not subject
to backup withholding. In order for a foreign individual to qualify as an exempt
recipient, however, he or she must submit a signed statement (such as a
Certificate of Foreign Status on Form W-8BEN) attesting to his or her exempt
status. Any amounts withheld will be allowed as a credit against the
stockholder's United States federal income tax liability for that year, provided
that the appropriate information is furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.

VIEW OF YOUR OWN PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.

     FIRPTA

     The following is a summary discussion of U.S. federal income tax
consequences under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980, as
amended ("FIRPTA") that applies to the receipt of merger consideration for
shares of class A stock and class B stock in the merger by a beneficial owner of
such shares that is not a U.S. person as defined above (a "non-U.S. holder").

         Generally, unless FIRPTA applies, a non-U.S. holder will not be subject
to U.S. federal income tax on any gain resulting from the receipt of the merger
consideration unless (a) the gain is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or
business of the non-U.S. shareholder or (b) that shareholder is an individual
who has been present in the U.S. for 183 days or more during the taxable year of
disposition and certain other conditions are satisfied. Under current law,
subject to the exception discussed in the paragraph below, a non-U.S. holder
generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax under FIRPTA on any gain
recognized on the receipt of the merger consideration for class A stock or class
B stock if Security Capital is or has been at any time within the shorter of the
five-year period preceding such disposition or such holder's holding period a
"United States real property holding corporation" (within the meaning of section
897(c)(2) of the Code) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Non-U.S. holders
should note that while not free from doubt, Security Capital believes that at
the effective time of the merger it will be or at some time during the five-year
period ending at the date of the merger it will have been a United States real
property holding corporation.

         If, as expected, Security Capital is treated as a United States real
property holding corporation, (A) a non-U.S. holder of class A stock or class B
stock which owns or is deemed to own more than 5% of such class A stock or class
B stock during the five-year period preceding such sale or other disposition
would be subject to United States federal income tax (generally at regular
capital gain rates) on a sale or other disposition of such class A stock or
class B stock, and (B) a non-U.S. holder that does not own and is not deemed to
own more than 5% of the class A stock or class B stock during the five-year
period preceding such sale or other disposition would not be subject to United
States federal income tax under FIRPTA on gain with respect to such shares
provided that such shares are "regularly traded on an established securities
market" (within the meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of the Code). Security Capital
believes that both the class A stock and the

                                      -21-

class B stock are "regularly traded on an established securities market" (within
the meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of the Code). No United States federal income
tax withholding under FIRPTA will be required so long as the class A stock and
the class B stock are regularly traded on an established securities market.

         Each non-U.S. holder is urged to consult its own tax advisor with
respect to the particular U.S. federal, state and local consequences to it of
the receipt of the merger consideration in exchange for class A stock or class B
stock, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any other
taxing jurisdiction. Each non-U.S. holder is also urged to consult its own tax
adviser with respect to the particular U.S. federal, state and local
consequences to it of the ownership and disposition of the stock of ProLogis.
Non-U.S. holders should also consult with their tax advisors concerning the
possible application of an income tax treaty that may modify certain of the U.S.
federal income tax consequences described above. ALL NON-U.S. HOLDERS SHOULD
CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS TO DETERMINE THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL, STATE AND
LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM IN VIEW OF THEIR OWN
PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.

GOVERNMENTAL AND REGULATORY APPROVALS

         Security Capital and GE Capital cannot complete the merger until they
have filed notifications with the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice and the Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended ("HSR Act"), and the applicable rules of
the Federal Trade Commission, and specified waiting periods have expired or
terminated. Each of Security Capital and GE Capital filed a Premerger
Notification and Report Form on January 3, 2002. The waiting period will expire
February 4, 2002, unless earlier terminated or extended. GE Capital and Security
Capital do not believe the merger requires any other antitrust approvals, but if
any such approvals are determined to be necessary, the parties will make the
requisite filings expeditiously.

         Security Capital and GE Capital believe that the proposed merger is
compatible with U.S. antitrust laws. However, at any time before or after
consummation of the merger, the Antitrust Division, the Federal Trade
Commission, other governmental authorities or private persons could take action
against the merger under the antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin
consummation of the merger, rescind the merger, cause Security Capital or GE
Capital to divest, in whole or in part, any of their assets or businesses,
and/or recover monetary damages. We can give no assurance that a challenge to
the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such challenge is made,
that it would not be successful.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     The merger will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in
accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141,
"Business Combinations." Under this method of accounting, the purchase price
will be allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their
estimated fair values at the effective time of the merger (with the excess of
the purchase price after such allocations being recorded as goodwill).

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER

   GENERAL

     Some members of Security Capital management and the Security Capital board
have certain interests in the merger that are different from or in addition to
the interests of Security Capital stockholders generally. These additional
interests relate to provisions in the merger agreement or Security Capital
employee benefit plans, as well as:

     o   modification of change of control agreements and agreements regarding
         employment terms;

     o   acceleration and payments in respect of outstanding Security Capital
         stock options and restricted stock units; and

                                      -22-

     o   indemnification of and provisions for liability insurance for Security
         Capital directors and officers.

     All of these additional interests, to the extent material, are described
below. The Security Capital board was aware of these interests and considered
them in approving and adopting the merger agreement and the merger.

   CHANGE OF CONTROL AGREEMENTS AND RELATED MATTERS

     GE Capital has entered into agreements, dated as of December 14, 2001, with
William D. Sanders, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, C. Ronald Blankenship,
Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer, Thomas G. Wattles, Managing Director,
Constance B. Moore, Managing Director of the Capital Division, Paul E. Szurek,
Managing Director of SC Group Incorporated and Chief Financial Officer Security
Capital, Anthony R. Manno, President and Managing Director of Security Capital
Research and Management Incorporated, A. Richard Moore, Managing Director of
Security Capital (EU) Management Incorporated, and Jeffrey A. Klopf, Senior Vice
President. The new agreements modified Security Capital's existing change of
control agreements with each of these executives, which remain in place as
modified.

     Each of the existing change of control agreements, as in effect before the
modifications provided for in the new agreements, provided for continued
employment of the executive for two years following a "change of control" with
position, duties, pay, benefits and perquisites no less favorable than those
that existed before the change of control. If the executive experienced a
Termination, as defined in the agreement, he or she would be entitled to pay and
benefits for a specified number of years. The number of years is three for
Messrs. Sanders, Blankenship and Wattles, two for Ms. Moore and Messrs. Szurek,
Manno and Moore, and one for Mr. Klopf. In addition, if the executive is subject
to the federal excise tax on "excess parachute payments," he or she will be made
whole for that tax by Security Capital. Each existing agreement defines a
Termination as a termination by Security Capital (or its successors) for any
reason other than death, disability or cause or by the executive upon (a) a
significant change in the Executive's authorities or duties or a breach by
Security Capital of its obligations under the agreement; (b) relocation of the
executive's office more than fifty (50) miles; (c) a reasonable determination by
the executive that, as a result of the change in control, there has been a
change in circumstances significantly affecting the nature and scope of the
executive's authorities and duties such that the Executive is unable to exercise
the authorities, powers, functions or duties associated with the Executive's
position or (d) the failure of Security Capital to obtain a satisfactory
agreement from any successor to assume such agreement.

     The new agreements modify the existing agreements by shortening the term to
one year following completion of the merger. Each new agreement also provides
that the executive will receive a specified amount in cash at the effective time
of the merger, which has been calculated to be equal to 50% of the cash
severance the executive would have received under the existing agreement upon a
Termination, plus an additional amount equal to the pro-rata bonus for the
portion of calendar year 2002 preceding the effective time of the merger based
on the executive's bonus for 2001. The aggregate amount of the specified amounts
for all eight executives is $11,996,250.

     Each new agreement further provides for an additional payment equal to the
same specified amount, at the end of the term or upon a Termination, whichever
occurs first. In addition, following termination of the executive's employment
for any reason other than cause, the executive and/or his family will continue
to receive medical and other benefits for up to three years.

     In addition, GE Capital has entered into an agreement, pursuant to which it
has recognized that equity compensation represents a significant portion of the
total compensation that Security Capital has provided to its executives, and has
agreed to work with Security Capital in good faith to design and grant a
mutually agreeable equity compensation program.

   EFFECT ON STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

     Each outstanding option and warrant to purchase Security Capital common
stock, and each restricted stock unit based on Security Capital common stock,
whether vested or unvested, that was previously granted by Security Capital and
its subsidiaries, and each right to receive deferred delivery of shares of
Security Capital common stock pursuant to previously exercised options, will
automatically be canceled at the effective time of the merger. GE Capital will,
or will cause the surviving corporation in the merger to, provide the holder of
each Security Capital stock option, the consideration described in the section
entitled "Merger Agreement - Treatment of Security Capital

                                      -23-

Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units." GE Capital has also agreed that
the account balances of all employees under Security Capital's 401(k) plan and
Nonqualified Savings Plan and of all non-employee directors under the Deferred
Fee Plan for Directors will vest upon completion of the merger. The portion of
such account balances under the Nonqualified Savings Plan and the Deferred Fee
Plan for Directors that are deemed invested in Security Capital common stock
will be converted upon completion of the merger into cash balances or, if GE
Capital elects to substitute ProLogis common shares for part of the cash
consideration, and the employee or director so elects, into an account deemed
invested in the applicable merger consideration.

     The executive officers and directors of Security Capital as a group hold
the following awards that are currently unvested and that will vest as a result
of the foregoing: unvested options as to 4,823 shares of class A stock and
3,901,784 shares of class B stock; restricted stock units representing 752,942
shares of class B stock; and unvested account balances under the 401(k) plan,
the Nonqualified Savings Plan and/or the Deferred Fee Plan for Directors.

   INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS

     In the merger agreement, GE Capital has agreed that Security Capital, as
the surviving corporation in the merger, will, and GE Capital will cause the
surviving corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law, each present and former director, officer and
employee of Security Capital or any of its subsidiaries for losses, expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), claims, damages or liabilities, or
amounts paid in settlement (other than those effected without its written
consent), arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the
effective time of the merger and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the effective time of the merger that are in whole or in part (i) based
on, or arising out of, the fact that such person is or was a director, officer
or employee of such party or a subsidiary of such party or (ii) based on,
arising out of or pertaining to the merger.

         For a period of six years after the effective time of the merger, GE
Capital shall cause to be maintained in effect the policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by Security Capital for the benefit of
those persons who are covered by such policies at the effective time of the
merger (or GE Capital may substitute therefor policies of at least the same
coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the effective time of the
merger), to the extent that such liability insurance can be maintained annually
at a cost to GE Capital not greater than two hundred percent of the premium for
the current Security Capital directors' and officers' liability insurance;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if such insurance cannot be so maintained or obtained at
such costs, GE Capital shall maintain or obtain as much of such insurance as can
be so maintained or obtained at a cost equal to two hundred percent of the
current annual premiums of Security Capital for such insurance.

     The merger agreement also provides that the indemnification provisions in
the charter and bylaws of Security Capital in effect at the effective time of
the merger will not be amended or otherwise repealed for six years after the
effective time of the merger in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights of individuals who at the effective time of the merger were directors or
officers of Security Capital, among others.

AMENDMENT TO SECURITY CAPITAL RIGHTS AGREEMENT, TAKEOVER STATUTES

     Security Capital amended the Rights Agreement, dated as of April 21, 1997,
between Security Capital and EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., as rights agent, to
provide that neither the merger nor the merger agreement will cause GE Capital
or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to become an "acquiring person" under
the Rights Agreement, or a "distribution date" or "shares acquisition date" to
occur, and that the Rights Agreement will expire immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger. In addition, Security Capital has exempted GE
Capital from the ownership limits of the Security Capital charter and exempted
the support agreements, the merger agreement and the merger from Maryland
takeover statutes which might otherwise have been applicable.

NO DISSENTERS' APPRAISAL RIGHTS

    Under Maryland law, Security Capital stockholders will not have dissenters'
rights to an appraisal of their shares in connection with the merger.

                                      -24-

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF ALL THE MATERIAL TERMS OF THE MERGER
AGREEMENT. THE SUMMARY IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE MERGER
AGREEMENT, A COPY OF WHICH IS ATTACHED TO THIS PROXY STATEMENT AS APPENDIX A.

STRUCTURE AND EFFECTIVE TIME

     The merger agreement provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and into
Security Capital. Security Capital will survive the merger and continue as an
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of GE Capital. The merger will become effective
at the time the articles of merger are accepted for record by the State
Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland (or at a later time if agreed
in writing by the parties and specified in the articles of merger). The parties
will file the articles of merger on the second business day after the
satisfaction or waiver of all conditions in the merger agreement, or such other
date as Security Capital and GE Capital may agree. We cannot assure you when, or
if, all the conditions to completion of the merger will be satisfied or waived.
See "--Conditions to the Consummation of the Merger." We intend to complete the
merger as promptly as practicable, subject to receipt of the Security Capital
stockholder approval and all requisite regulatory approvals. See "The
Merger--Governmental and Regulatory Approvals" and "--Reasonable Best Efforts;
Antitrust Law Matters" and "--Conditions to Consummation of the Merger."

MERGER CONSIDERATION

     The merger agreement provides that each share of Security Capital class B
stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be
converted at the effective time of the merger into the right to receive
consideration consisting, in all cases, of $26.00 in value from GE Capital. Each
holder of a share of class A stock will receive 50 times the class B
consideration per share. Except as provided below, the consideration will be
payable entirely in cash.

     GE Capital may elect (but no later than the 15th day before the stockholder
meeting) to include ProLogis common shares owned by Security Capital as part of
the consideration payable to Security Capital stockholders in the merger.
However, cash will be paid in lieu of fractional shares. If GE Capital so
elects, the holders of Security Capital class B stock would receive $26.00 in
cash per share less the value of the ProLogis common shares received by them
(with the ProLogis common shares valued based upon the 10-day trailing average
price of the ProLogis common shares two days prior to the Security Capital
stockholder meeting), and the holders of class A stock would receive 50 times
such amount per share. GE Capital may also revoke its election to include
ProLogis common shares as part of the merger consideration.

     Prior to the consummation of the merger, GE Capital may (but no earlier
than the 18th day before the Security Capital stockholder meeting) direct the
sale of any or all of the ProLogis common shares owned by Security Capital,
including to ProLogis, pursuant to a registered offering, negotiated third party
purchase, or otherwise. No such sale, regardless of price or timing, will change
the $26.00 in cash to be received by Security Capital class B stockholders for
their shares, or the 50 times such amount to be received by the class A
stockholders.

     GE Capital may also determine to cause Security Capital to retain its
ProLogis common shares, in which case holders of Security Capital class B stock
will still receive $26.00 in cash for their shares, and holders of Security
Capital class A stock 50 times such amount.

     All shares of Security Capital common stock held by any subsidiary of
Security Capital and any shares owned by GE Capital, Merger Sub or any
subsidiary of GE Capital or Merger Sub will be canceled at the effective time of
the merger, and no payment will be made for those shares.

PAYMENT PROCEDURES

     GE Capital will appoint a paying agent that will make payment of the merger
consideration in exchange for certificates representing shares of Security
Capital common stock. GE Capital will deposit sufficient cash with the paying
agent in order to permit the payment of the merger consideration and Security
Capital will make available to

                                      -25-

the paying agent ProLogis common shares in amounts and at times necessary
for the payment of the stock portion of the merger consideration, if
any. Promptly after the effective time of the merger, the paying agent will send
Security Capital stockholders a letter of transmittal and instructions
explaining how to send their stock certificates to the paying agent. The paying
agent will pay to the holder the cash portion of the merger consideration and
deliver the stock portion of the merger consideration, if any, payable in the
form of ProLogis common shares, minus any withholding taxes required by law, to
Security Capital stockholders promptly following the paying agent's receipt and
processing of Security Capital stock certificates and properly completed
transmittal documents.

TREATMENT OF SECURITY CAPITAL STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

     The merger agreement provides that, upon the closing date of the merger,
all then-outstanding stock options, warrants, and restricted stock units will be
cancelled in exchange for either a cash payment or, in certain cases, payment
partly in cash and partly in ProLogis common shares, in either case to be paid
by Security Capital or, at GE Capital's election, by Merger Sub. The amount of
the cash payment for each option will equal the amount of the merger
consideration payable per share of the class of Security Capital common stock
subject to the option, less the per-share exercise price of the option, times
the number of shares subject to the option, reduced by applicable withholding
taxes. In addition, all then-outstanding restricted stock units will be
cancelled in exchange for either a cash payment or a payment partly in cash and
partly in ProLogis common shares. The amount of the cash payment for each unit
or deferred share pursuant to a previously exercised stock option will equal the
amount of the merger consideration payable per share of the class of Security
Capital common stock subject to the unit or represented by the deferred share,
times (in the case of a unit) the number of shares represented by the unit. If
GE Capital elects to substitute ProLogis common shares, the holders of these
awards will be permitted to elect to receive a reduced cash payment plus the
appropriate number of ProLogis common shares, based upon the class of Security
Capital common stock that is subject to their options, units or deferred shares.
If any taxes are required to be withheld, they will be subtracted from the cash
payment and, if the cash payment is insufficient, the option holder will be
required to make up the difference in cash.

DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

     The merger agreement provides that the directors of Merger Sub immediately
before the effective time of the merger will be the initial directors of the
surviving corporation in the merger. The officers of Security Capital will be
the initial officers of the surviving corporation in the merger until their
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal.

COVENANTS; CONDUCT OF THE BUSINESS OF SECURITY CAPITAL PRIOR TO THE MERGER

     From the date of the merger agreement through the effective time of the
merger, Security Capital and its subsidiaries are required to comply with
certain restrictions on their conduct and operations. Security Capital has
agreed, and has agreed to cause its subsidiaries, and will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Public Investees, to conduct their respective
operations in the ordinary and usual course of business consistent with past
practice and, to seek to preserve intact their respective business
organizations, seek to keep available the services of their respective current

          agreement, (b) as consented to in writing by GE Capital, or (c) with
          respect to the consummation of the Storage USA Acquisition (as defined
          in the merger agreement), or as contemplated by the Storage USA
          Transaction Agreements (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and the
          merger contemplated thereby. The merger agreement provides that
          Security Capital will not increase the price to be paid in connection
          with the Storage USA Acquisition or make any material change to the
          Storage USA Transaction Agreements or grant any material waiver,
          consent or election thereunder, except with GE Capital's consent,
          which consent shall be given (or, in the absence of any response,
          deemed to have been given) within 24 hours of the delivery of such a
          request.

     Security Capital has also agreed that, prior to the effective time of the
merger, except as provided in the disclosure schedules to the merger agreement,
Security Capital will not, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause

               thereof, or (b) (1) automatic grants of Security Capital stock
               options to directors of Security Capital in accordance with plan
               terms in effect as of the date of the merger agreement, (2) the
               grant of new Security Capital stock options upon the exercise of
               outstanding Security Capital stock options containing a reload
               feature requiring a new option grant upon such exercise, (3) the
               grant of options, in the ordinary course consistent with past
               practice, by subsidiaries of Security Capital, or (4) the grant
               of restricted stock units pursuant to Security Capital's matching
               share program;

     (3)  (a) split, combine or reclassify any shares of their respective stock;

          with past dividend practice; (c) make any other actual, constructive
          or deemed distribution in respect of any shares of their respective
          stock or otherwise make any payments to stockholders in their capacity
          as such; or (d) redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire any of their
          respective securities or any securities of any of their respective

NO SOLICITATION OF ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS

     The merger agreement provides that, from the date of the merger agreement
until the termination of the merger agreement and except as expressly permitted
by the following provisions, Security Capital will not, nor will it permit any
of its subsidiaries to, nor will it authorize or permit any officer, director or
employee of, or any investment banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor or
representative of, Security Capital or any of its subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly:

     (a)  solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of any Acquisition
          Proposal; or

     (b)  participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish
          to any person any information with respect to, or take any other
          action to facilitate, any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or the
          making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected
          to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
          Security Capital board may furnish information to, or enter into
          discussions or negotiations with, any person that previously has made
          an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if, and only to
          the extent that,

               (1)  the Security Capital board, after consultation with and
                    having considered the advice of independent legal counsel,
                    determines in good faith that (x) such Acquisition Proposal
                    would, if consummated, constitute a Superior Proposal (as
                    hereinafter defined), and (y) such action is necessary for
                    the Security Capital board to comply with its duties to
                    Security Capital's stockholders under applicable law; and

               (2)  prior to taking such action, Security Capital (x) provides
                    reasonable notice to GE Capital (but in any event no later
                    than 24 hours prior to taking such action) to the effect
                    that it is taking such action and (y) receives from such
                    person an executed confidentiality/standstill agreement in
                    reasonably customary form, the terms of which, as applicable
                    to such person, in any event are at least as stringent as
                    those applicable to GE Capital in the confidentiality
                    agreement between GE Capital and Security Capital.

     Prior to providing any information to or entering into discussions or
negotiations with any person in connection with an Acquisition Proposal by such
person, Security Capital shall notify GE Capital of any Acquisition Proposal
(including the material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the
person making it) as promptly as practicable after its receipt thereof (and in
any event, no later than twenty-hours from receipt), and shall provide GE
Capital with a copy of any written Acquisition Proposal or amendments or
supplements thereto, and shall thereafter promptly inform GE Capital of the
status of any discussions or negotiations with such a third party, and any
material changes to the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, and
shall promptly give GE Capital a copy of any information delivered to such
person that has not previously been reviewed by GE Capital. Immediately after
the

                                      -30-

execution and delivery of the merger agreement, Security Capital will, and
will cause its subsidiaries and affiliates, and their respective officers,
directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
agents to, cease and terminate any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any possible
Acquisition Proposal.

         The merger agreement provides that the Security Capital board will not
withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to GE
Capital, its approval or recommendation of the merger agreement or the merger
unless the Security Capital board, after consultation with and having considered
the advice of independent legal counsel, determines in good faith that such
action is necessary for the Security Capital board to comply with its duties to
Security Capital's stockholders under applicable law. Except as set forth in
this provision, the Security Capital board will not approve or recommend or
permit Security Capital to enter into any agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement as described above)
made by any person other than GE Capital or Merger Sub. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Security Capital board, after having considered the advice of
independent legal counsel, determines in good faith that failing to take such
action would constitute a breach of the obligations of the Security Capital
board under applicable law, the Security Capital board may approve or recommend
an Acquisition Proposal (or amendment or supplement thereto) or cause Security
Capital to enter into an agreement with respect thereto, but in each case only
if:

     (a)  Security Capital provides written notice to GE Capital (a "Notice of
          Superior Proposal"), which notice must be received by GE Capital at
          least three business days (exclusive of the day of receipt by GE
          Capital of the Notice of Superior Proposal) prior to the time it
          intends to cause Security Capital to enter into such an agreement,
          advising GE Capital in writing that the Security Capital board has
          received an Acquisition Proposal (or amendment or supplement thereto)
          which it believes constitutes a Superior Proposal and which it intends
          to accept and, with respect to which, enter into a definitive
          agreement, subject to the above, providing a copy of any written offer
          or proposal describing the Superior Proposal, specifying the material
          terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the
          person making such Superior Proposal;

     (b)  as of the end of such three business day period referenced above, GE
          Capital shall have failed to notify Security Capital in writing that
          it has determined to revise the terms of the merger to provide that
          the merger consideration will be equal to or greater than the
          consideration to be paid to the Security Capital stockholders pursuant
          to the Superior Proposal; and

     (c)  Security Capital terminates the merger agreement within 48 hours after
          the lapse of the three business day period referenced above and
          immediately thereafter enters into an agreement with respect to such
          Superior Proposal.

         For purposes of the merger agreement, an "Acquisition Proposal" means
an inquiry, offer or proposal regarding any of the following (other than the
merger of Merger Sub with and into Security Capital) involving Security Capital:

     (a)  any merger, consolidation, share exchange, recapitalization, business
          combination or other similar transaction;

     (b)  any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other
          disposition of all or substantially all the assets of Security Capital
          and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single transaction or
          series of related transactions;

     (c)  any tender offer or exchange offer for twenty percent (20%) or more of
          the outstanding Security Capital common stock or the filing of a
          registration statement under the Securities Act in connection
          therewith; or

     (d)  any public announcement of a proposal, plan or intention to do any of
          the foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the foregoing.

                                      -31-

     A "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide Acquisition Proposal not directly
or indirectly initiated, solicited, encouraged or knowingly facilitated by
Security Capital after the date of the merger agreement in contravention of the
provisions thereof which the Security Capital board determines in good faith
judgment (based on the advice of an investment banker of nationally recognized
reputation), taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal:

     (a)  would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable
          to Security Capital's stockholders (in their capacity as
          stockholders), from a financial point of view, than the merger and

     (b)  is reasonably capable of being completed; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that for
          purposes of this definition, the term Acquisition Proposal shall be
          amended so that the reference to 20 percent shall be deemed to be a
          reference to 100 percent.

         Nothing prohibits Security Capital from taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or from making
any disclosure to Security Capital's stockholders which, in the good faith
reasonable judgment of the Security Capital board, based on the advice of
independent legal counsel, is required under applicable law; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that except as otherwise permitted, Security Capital does not withdraw or
modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, its position with respect to the
merger or approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, an
Acquisition Proposal.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

     GE Capital will cause the surviving corporation to honor the obligations of
Security Capital or any of its subsidiaries under the provisions of the
employment, consulting, termination, severance, change in control and
indemnification agreements between and among Security Capital or any of its
subsidiaries and any current or former officer, director, consultant or employee
of Security Capital or any such subsidiaries.

     Security Capital and GE Capital have agreed that, from the closing date of
the merger and until January 1, 2003, the compensation benefits to be provided
to current or former employees of Security Capital and any of its subsidiaries
will be, in the aggregate, no less favorable than those provided to them before
the merger or, in certain cases, those provided to similarly situated employees
of GE Capital, if greater.

     Security Capital's employees' prior service to Security Capital will
generally be taken into account in determining their benefits after the merger,
except for accrual of benefits under defined benefit pension plans and except if
duplication of benefits would result, and they will generally not be subject to
waiting periods or other limitations on their participation in any welfare
benefit plans of GE Capital and its subsidiaries that may apply to them after
the merger.

REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS; ANTITRUST LAW MATTERS

     GE Capital, Security Capital and Merger Sub have agreed to use reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, in good faith, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under the
merger agreement and applicable laws and regulations to consummate the merger
and to cause to be satisfied all conditions precedent to their respective
obligations under the merger agreement in each case as soon as practicable after
the date of the merger agreement.

          o    Each party agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to prepare
               and file as promptly as practicable following the date of the
               merger agreement all documentation to effect all necessary
               applications, notices, petitions, filings, and other documents
               and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, waivers,
               licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, rulings,
               authorizations and clearances necessary or advisable to be
               obtained from any third party and/or governmental entity in order
               to consummate the merger or any of the other transactions
               contemplated by the merger agreement ("Required Approvals");

                                      -32-

          o    Each party agrees to file a Notification and Report Form pursuant
               to the HSR Act with respect to the merger as promptly as
               practicable and in any event within 10 days of the merger
               agreement; and GE Capital agrees to make any other requisite
               antitrust filings as soon as reasonably practicable;

          o    GE Capital and Security Capital each shall use its reasonable
               best efforts to cooperate in all respects with each other in
               connection with any filing or submission to or any investigation
               or proceeding by a private party, the Federal Trade Commission
               (the "FTC"), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice
               (the "DOJ") or any other governmental entity;

          o    GE Capital and Security Capital each shall use its reasonable
               best efforts to (a) cooperate in all respects with each other in
               connection with any filing or submission and in connection with
               any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding
               initiated by a private party, (b) subject to applicable law,
               permit the other party to review and discuss in advance, and
               consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with,
               any proposed written or material oral communication between it
               and any governmental entity, (c) promptly inform each other of
               any supply to such other party any communication received by such
               party, or given to such party to, the DOJ, the FTC or any other
               governmental entity and of any material communication received or
               given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in
               each case regarding the merger; and (d) consult with each other
               in advance of any meeting or conference with the DOJ, the FTC or
               any other governmental entity or, in connection with any
               proceeding by a private party, with any other person, and to the
               extent permitted by the DOJ, the FTC or such other applicable
               governmental entity or other party, give the other party the
               opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
               conferences;

          o    if any objections are asserted with respect to the merger under
               any antitrust or competition law, GE Capital agrees to use its
               reasonable best efforts to resolve any antitrust concerns,
               federal, state, foreign or private, obtain all Required Approvals
               and obtain termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act or
               any other applicable law and the termination of any outstanding
               judicial or administrative orders prohibiting the closing of the
               merger so as to permit consummation of the merger as soon as
               practicable. If any administrative or judicial action or
               proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is
               instituted challenging any transaction contemplated by the merger
               agreement, Security Capital agrees to cooperate with GE Capital
               in responding thereto and GE Capital and Security Capital shall

               attempt to resolve any such action or proceeding and to have
               vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
               injunction or other order that prohibits, prevents or restricts
               consummation of the merger and to have such statute, rule,
               regulation, executive order, decree, injunction or administrative
               order repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable so as to permit
               consummation of the merger; and

          o    Security Capital shall cooperate with GE Capital and use its
               reasonable best efforts to obtain an opinion of counsel on or
               prior to the effective time of the merger satisfying the
               requirements of Article 9 of the Articles of Incorporation of
               Security Capital European Realty to allow GE Capital to be
               treated as an "Excluded Holder" thereunder.

     The merger agreement provides that GE Capital's "reasonable best efforts"
shall not require GE Capital to agree to or effect any divestiture, or to agree
to or to hold separate or hold in trust (or similar action involving) any part
of GE Capital's or Security Capital's business or operations, other than any of
Security Capital's business or operations with a net asset value in the
aggregate of no greater than $50 million.

REGISTRATION AND SALE OF PROLOGIS SHARES

     With the prior written consent of both Security Capital and GE Capital,
Security Capital may, at any time, sell any or all of the 49,903,814 ProLogis
common shares owned by Security Capital, including to ProLogis, pursuant to a
public offering or private placement, negotiated third-party purchase or
otherwise. In addition, Security Capital will, at the written request of GE
Capital, use its reasonable best efforts to effect a sale of ProLogis common
shares in the manner requested by GE Capital, and subject to approval by GE
Capital of any final pricing terms, provided that Security Capital shall not be
required to effect a sale of ProLogis common shares, or enter into any binding
agreement to effect a sale of ProLogis common shares, prior to the date which is
18 days prior to the then-applicable

                                      -33-

stockholders' meeting date. Security Capital will, after consultation with GE
Capital, determine the manager(s) and book runner(s) in the event of any sale of
ProLogis common shares that is an underwritten offering. In order to facilitate
a possible sale of ProLogis common shares and/or a distribution of ProLogis
common shares pursuant to the stock election, Security Capital will, on or
before December 17, 2001, exercise its registration rights under its investors
agreement with ProLogis and will use its reasonable best efforts to assist
ProLogis in filing and having declared effective one or more registration
statements, and any necessary supplements or amendments, with respect to the
ProLogis common shares, suitable for use in connection with the stock election
and/or sale of ProLogis common shares, and shall allow GE Capital to participate
in the process of registering the ProLogis common shares.

STORAGE USA ACQUISITION

     If a third party seeks to acquire Storage USA for consideration in excess
of that agreed to be paid pursuant to the Storage USA Transaction Agreements,
Security Capital will determine either:

     (a)  to seek GE Capital's consent to offer to increase the price to be paid
          by Security Capital in connection with the Storage USA acquisition; or

     (b)  not to do so.

     If Security Capital decides not to so increase the price to be paid by
Security Capital in connection with the Storage USA Acquisition, then, at the
written request of GE Capital, Security Capital will nevertheless offer to
increase the price to be paid in connection with the Storage USA Acquisition on
such terms as GE Capital may designate. Immediately upon any termination of the
merger agreement, GE Capital will pay to Security Capital an amount equal to the
aggregate amount of any such increased price designated by GE Capital that may
have been agreed with or accepted by Storage USA.

         1989 (the "ECMR"), the European Commission shall not have indicated
         prior to the closing date of the merger that it intends to initiate
         proceedings under the ECMR in respect of the merger nor refer the
         transactions or any matters arising therefrom to the competent
         authority of a member state under Article 9(1) of the ECMR.

     (4)  Any registration statement with respect to the ProLogis common shares

     Unless waived by Security Capital, the obligation of Security Capital to
consummate the merger is subject to the satisfaction of the following additional
condition:

         The representations and warranties of GE Capital or Merger Sub
         contained in the merger agreement are true and accurate as of the
         closing date (except for those representations and warranties that
         address matters only as to a particular date or only with respect to a
         specific period of time, which need only be true and accurate as of
         such date or with respect to such period) and GE Capital and Merger Sub
         have not breached or failed to perform or comply with any obligations,
         agreement or covenant required by the merger agreement to be performed
         or complied with by it except, in each case where the failure of such
         representations and warranties to be true and accurate, or the failure
         to perform or comply with such obligations, agreements or covenants, do
         not or would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
         aggregate, have a material adverse effect on GE Capital.

     Unless waived by GE Capital, the obligations of GE Capital to consummate
the merger are subject to the satisfaction of both of the following additional
conditions:

     (1)  No material adverse effect on Security Capital has occurred; and

     (2)  The representations and warranties of Security Capital contained in
          the merger agreement are true and accurate as of the closing date
          (except for those representations and warranties that address matters
          only as to a particular date or only with respect to a specific period
          of time, which need only be true and accurate as of such date or with
          respect to such period) and Security Capital has not breached or
          failed to perform or comply with any obligation, agreement or covenant
          required by the merger agreement to be performed or complied with by
          it except, in each case where the failure of such representations and
          warranties to be true and accurate, or the failure to perform or
          comply with such obligations, agreements or covenants, do not or would
          not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have
          a material adverse effect on Security Capital.

          results of operations of Security Capital and its subsidiaries or GE
          Capital and its subsidiaries, as the case may be, in each case taken
          as a whole, excluding the effects of changes to the extent related to
          (A) conditions in the United States, European or global economy or
          capital or financial markets generally, including changes in interest
          or exchange rates, (B) general changes in conditions (including
          changes in legal, regulatory or business conditions or changes in
          GAAP) in or otherwise affecting the industries in which Security
          Capital or GE Capital, as the case may be, conducts business, (C) the
          merger agreement, the announcement or performance of the merger
          agreement and the merger, including the impact thereof on
          relationships with customers, suppliers or employees, or (D) anything
          provided for or contemplated by the budget previously provided by

          Capital and Merger Sub, as the case may be, to perform its obligations
          under the merger agreement or consummate the merger.

TERMINATION

     The merger agreement may be terminated and the merger may be abandoned at
any time prior to the effective time of the merger (whether before or after
approval of the merger by Security Capital's stockholders):

     (1)  by mutual written consent of Security Capital and GE Capital;

     (2)  by either GE Capital or Security Capital if (A) a statute, rule or
          executive order prohibits the merger substantially on the terms
          contemplated by the merger agreement or (B) any governmental entity
          issues an or-

                                      -35-

          der, decree or ruling or takes any other action permanently
          restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the merger on the
          terms contemplated by the merger agreement and such order, decree,
          ruling or other action has become final and nonappealable;

     (3) by either GE Capital or Security Capital if the merger has not been
         consummated by August 14, 2002, provided that the party seeking to
         terminate the merger agreement has not breached in any material respect
         its obligations under the merger agreement in any manner that
         proximately contributed to the failure to consummate the merger on or
         before such date;

     (4) by GE Capital if the Security Capital board (A) publicly withdraws or
         modifies its recommendation of the merger agreement or the merger in a
         manner materially adverse to GE Capital, (B) fails to confirm its
         recommendation to Security Capital's stockholders that they approve and
         adopt the merger and the merger agreement within five business days
         after a written request by GE Capital that it do so if such request is
         made following the making of an Acquisition Proposal, or (C) approves
         or recommends an Acquisition Proposal made by any person other than GE
         Capital or Merger Sub;

     (5)  by Security Capital, if (A) the Security Capital board determines that
          an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal in accordance
          with the requirements of the merger agreement, (B) Security Capital
          delivers to GE Capital written notice of the determination by the
          Security Capital board to terminate the merger agreement and follows
          the procedures of the merger agreement, and (C) immediately prior to
          such termination Security Capital makes payment of the full amounts
          required by the merger agreement and immediately after such
          termination Security Capital enters into a definitive acquisition,
          merger or similar agreement to effect such Acquisition Proposal;

     (6)  by GE Capital if Security Capital breaches any of its representations,
          warranties or covenants contained in the merger agreement, which
          breach would give rise to the failure of the merger condition with
          respect to representations, warranties or covenants and which breach
          is either (A) reasonably capable of being cured within 30 business
          days after its receipt of written notice thereof from GE Capital but
          has not been cured within such time or (B) incapable of being cured by
          Security Capital prior to August 14, 2002;

     (7)  by Security Capital if any of GE Capital's representations and
          warranties contained in the merger agreement are not true and correct,
          except for such failures to be true and correct that individually or
          in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a material
          adverse effect on the ability of GE Capital to consummate the merger
          or perform its obligations under the merger agreement, and which
          failure is either (A) reasonably capable of being cured within 30
          business days after its receipt of written notice thereof from
          Security Capital but has not been cured within such time or (B)
          incapable of being cured by GE Capital prior to August 14, 2002; or

     (8)  by Security Capital or GE Capital if the holders of a majority of the
          votes entitled to be cast by the voting securities of Security Capital
          fail to approve the merger agreement and the merger at the special
          meeting.

TERMINATION FEE

     Security Capital must pay GE Capital a termination fee of $120 million if
     the merger agreement is terminated by Security Capital pursuant to
     paragraph (5) under "Termination" above or:

     (1)  the merger agreement is terminated by GE Capital because the Security
          Capital board has publicly withdrawn or modified in a manner
          materially adverse to GE Capital its recommendation of the merger
          agreement or the merger, failed to reconfirm its recommendation to
          Security Capital's stockholders that they approve and adopt the merger
          and the merger agreement within five business days after a written
          request by GE Capital that it do so if such request is made following
          the making of an Acquisition Proposal or approved or recommended an
          alternative Acquisition Proposal made by any person other than GE
          Capital or Merger Sub (any of the foregoing a "Change in
          Recommendation"); or

                                      -36-

     (2)  the merger agreement is terminated by either GE Capital or Security
          Capital because the Security Capital stockholders fail to approve the
          merger agreement and the merger after a Change in Recommendation;

         AND

     (a)  an Acquisition Proposal has previously been publicly proposed or
          publicly announced or any person has previously publicly announced to
          make an acquisition proposal; or

EXPENSES

     The merger agreement provides that all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby
will be paid by the party incurring the expenses, whether or not the merger is
consummated. Security Capital will reimburse GE Capital and Merger Sub for all
their expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and merger in
the event the merger agreement is terminated under circumstances in which a
termination fee would be required except that the aggregate amount of such
reimbursement together with the termination fee shall not exceed $160 million.

AMENDMENT

     Provisions of the merger agreement may be amended by action taken by
Security Capital, GE Capital and Merger Sub at any time before or after approval
of the merger by the stockholders of Security Capital but, after any such
approval, no amendment may be made which requires the approval of such
stockholders under applicable law without such approval.

                                      -37-

                               SUPPORT AGREEMENTS

    Two of the directors (each of whom is also a stockholder) of Security
Capital have entered into a support agreement with GE Capital and have granted
to two employees of GE Capital irrevocable proxies to vote 97,672.112 shares of
class A stock and 260,925 shares of class B stock (representing 7.39% of the
voting power as of December 31,2001) which are beneficially owned by them. These
stockholders have agreed that in the event they become the beneficial owners of
any additional shares of Security Capital, the support agreement will be
applicable to those shares as well. The stockholders have agreed to vote these
shares:

     o    for the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and all other
          transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the support
          agreement;

     o    against any action, agreement, transaction or proposal that would
          result in either GE Capital's or Security Capital's unilateral right
          to terminate the merger agreement; and

     o    in favor of any other matter necessary to the consummation of the
          transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and considered and
          voted upon by the stockholders of Security Capital.

     These stockholders have also agreed that neither they nor any affiliates
will:

     o    solicit or encourage the initiation of any inquiries or proposals
          regarding any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the merger
          agreement); or

     o    have any discussions with or provide any confidential information or
          data to any third party that would encourage, facilitate or further an
          Acquisition Proposal, or engage in any negotiations concerning an
          Acquisition Proposal, or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to
          make or implement an Acquisition Proposal.

     These stockholders have also agreed, until the termination of the support
agreement, not to:

     o    sell, assign, transfer, pledge, encumber or otherwise dispose of any
          of the stockholders' interest in the securities of Security Capital
          (except to charitable or similar organizations);

     o    deposit any of the stockholders' interest in the securities of
          Security Capital into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement
          or arrangement or grant any proxy or power of attorney with respect
          thereto which is inconsistent with the support agreement;

     o    enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or undertaking
          with respect to the direct or indirect sale, assignment, transfer or
          other disposition of any of the stockholders' interest in the
          securities of Security Capital (except as permitted above); or

     o    take any action that would make any representation or warranty of the
          stockholder untrue or incorrect in any material respect or have the
          effect of preventing or disabling the stockholder from performing its
          obligations under the support agreement.

    The support agreement will terminate on the earliest of:

     o    the date the merger agreement is terminated or modified in any manner
          adverse to the stockholder;

     o    the date GE Capital terminates the support agreement; and

     o    the day after the stockholders' meeting.

     A form of the Security Capital support agreement is attached as Appendix B
to this proxy statement. You should read it in its entirety.

          shares in the open market which represented a 9.8% ownership interest.

          outstanding shares, provided that PSERS does not purchase additional
          shares. PSERS acquired additional shares as a result of its ownership
          of Security Capital U.S. Realty ("US Realty") shares which were

    Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

                                 (in thousands)

On December 6, 2001, Security Capital announced it had entered into a definitive
agreement with Storage USA for a transaction in which all of the holders of
Storage USA common stock and operating partnership units (other than Security
Capital) will receive $42.00 in cash per share or partnership unit. The
accompanying pro forma financial information has been prepared as if this
transaction had occurred on September 30, 2001 for balance sheet purposes and
prior to January 1, 2000 for statement of earnings purposes. The acquisition was
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141. The pro forma adjustments
consist of:

     (a)  The pro forma columns represent Security Capital's balance sheet and
          statement of earnings after considering the effects of the purchase of
          Security Capital U.S. Realty in 2001, the sales of Archstone
          Communities Trust shares in 2000 and 2001, the sale of Homestead
          Village in 2001 and the sales of CarrAmerica shares in 2001. See
          Exhibit 99.1 of Form 8-K filed December 26, 2001, by Security Capital
          for further description of these pro forma columns.

     (b)  Security Capital's investment in Storage USA and equity in earnings
          from Storage USA are eliminated as Storage USA would be consolidated
          after the purchase.

     (c)  Represents the step-up in basis of Storage USA's real estate assets
          based on the assumed purchase price (see footnote (d)). The basis
          step-up is depreciated over 40 years.

     (d)  The assumed purchase price and related amounts will be paid in cash
          and is computed as follows:

          Cash payments to Storage USA's common shareholders
               for the 15,763 shares not owned by
               Security Capital                                   $ 662,047
          Cash payment to Storage USA's common operating
               partnership unit holders for the 3,103 common
               units outstanding                                    130,326
          Payment for Storage USA stock options and
               severance costs                                       39,740
          Income taxes paid by Security Capital                      40,725

                                                                ---------------

     (e)  Represents the elimination of Storage USA's deferred financing costs.

     (f)  Represents the pay off and retirement of Storage USA's line of credit.

     (g)  The elimination of the carrying amount of Storage USA's common
          operating partnership units assumes that all such units will elect
          cash payment. Minority interest expense is reduced for the amount
          attributable to the common operating partnership units. The remaining
          minority interest expense relates to the preferred operating
          partnership units.

     (h)  Represents the elimination of Storage USA's shareholders' equity.

     (i)  The provision for income tax expense is based on the statutory tax
          rate of 35%.

     (j)  As a result of the sale of Archstone, CarrAmerica and Homestead
          Village, Security Capital would have had cash on hand in excess of
          short-term borrowings. Under the SEC regulations governing the
          preparation of the pro forma financial statements, interest income
          from the use of proceeds from these sales is not considered to be an
          appropriate pro forma adjustment and, therefore, is not included in
          the pro forma financial statements. If interest income on cash
          proceeds in excess of short-term borrowings (using a rate of 3.0%)
          were included in the pro forma financial statements, Security
          Capital's pro forma income, net earnings from operations attributable
          to common shares, and per share net earnings from operations
          attributable to common shares before and after the acquisition of
          Storage USA would be as follows:

                                           Before the acquisition of      After the acquisition of
                                                 Storage USA                   Storage USA

      COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF SECURITY CAPITAL COMMON STOCK AND
                             PROLOGIS COMMON SHARES

     Upon completion of the merger, at GE Capital's election, holders of
Security Capital common stock may become entitled to receive ProLogis common
shares. A prospectus describing the ProLogis common shares which you may receive
has also been sent to you. You are encouraged to read it carefully. Security
Capital is a corporation organized under the Maryland General Corporation Law
("MGCL") and ProLogis is a real estate investment trust organized under the
Maryland REIT Law ("MRL").

     The following is a summary of some material differences between the rights
of holders of Security Capital common stock and the holders of ProLogis common
shares. These differences arise from differences between the MGCL, the Security
Capital charter and the Security Capital bylaws, on the one hand, and the MRL,
the ProLogis declaration of trust and the ProLogis bylaws, on the other hand.
This summary is qualified by the full text of each document. For information as

          WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
have approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein, and have deemed and declared
that such merger is fair to, advisable and in the best interests of their
respective companies and stockholders;

          WHEREAS, Parent has required, as a condition to its willingness to
enter into this Agreement, that each of the persons listed on Exhibit A hereto
enter into a Support Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (collectively, the
"SUPPORT AGREEMENTS"), simultaneously herewith, pursuant to which, among other
things, such persons have agreed to vote all of their Shares in favor of the
Merger (as hereinafter defined), on the terms and subject to the conditions
contained in the Support Agreements, and in order to induce Parent and Merger

approved the execution and delivery of the Support Agreements by such persons;

          WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Company,

                                   ARTICLE I

          SECTION 1.1 THE MERGER. At the Effective Time and upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the Maryland
General Corporation Law (the "MGCL"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
the Company (the "MERGER"). Following the Merger, the Company shall continue as
the surviving corporation (the "SURVIVING CORPORATION") and as an indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease.

          SECTION 1.2 EFFECTIVE TIME. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing such articles of merger or other appropriate documents (in
any such case, the "ARTICLES OF MERGER")

with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, as
applicable, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the
relevant provisions of the MGCL and shall make all other filings, recordings or
publications required by the MGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at the time specified in the Articles of Merger (the time
the Merger becomes effective being the "EFFECTIVE TIME").

          SECTION 1.3 CLOSING OF THE MERGER. The closing of the Merger (the
"CLOSING") will take place at a time and on a date to be specified by the
parties (the "CLOSING DATE"), which shall be no later than the second business
day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions), at the
offices of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, 767 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York
10153, or at such other time, date or place as agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto.

          SECTION 1.4 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. The Merger shall have the effects
set forth in the MGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub
shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

          SECTION 1.5 CHARTER AND BYLAWS. The Charter of the Company in effect
at the Effective Time (the "CHARTER") shall be the charter of the Surviving
Corporation until amended in accordance with applicable Law. The Amended and
Restated Bylaws of the Company in effect at the Effective Time shall be the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with applicable
Law.

          SECTION 1.6 DIRECTORS. The directors of Merger Sub at the Effective
Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, to hold office
in accordance with the charter and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal.

          SECTION 1.7 OFFICERS. The officers of the Company at the Effective
Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, to hold office
in accordance with the charter and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal.

                                   ARTICLE II

                               CONVERSION OF STOCK

          SECTION 2.1 CONVERSION OF STOCK. (a) As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any
Shares or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

          (b) MERGER SUB STOCK. Each issued and outstanding share of common
stock, par value $.01 per share, of Merger Sub shall be converted into and
become one fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A Common Stock, of the
Surviving Corporation.

                                       A-2

          (c) CANCELLATION OF MERGER SUB-OWNED STOCK. All Shares that are owned
by any subsidiary of the Company and any Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or
any subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub shall be cancelled and retired and shall
cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

          (d) EXCHANGE OF SHARES. Each issued and outstanding Class A Share and
Class B Share (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section
2.1(b) and, to the extent applicable, Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter
defined)) shall be converted into the right to receive, respectively, the Class
A Merger Consideration and the Class B Merger Consideration (the Class A Merger
Consideration together with the Class B Merger Consideration, the "MERGER
CONSIDERATION"). All such Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such Shares shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with
Section 2.2, without interest.

          (e) PREFERRED STOCK. To the extent not converted into Class B Shares
prior to the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding share of Series B
Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Voting Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per
share (the "PREFERRED STOCK"), of the Company shall remain issued and
outstanding and Parent shall cause the Company to perform all of the obligations
of the Company with respect to the Preferred Stock, including the obligation to
pay, upon conversion by the holder of such Preferred Stock, in respect of each
share of Preferred Stock, the Class B Merger Consideration multiplied by that
number of Class B Shares into which each share of Preferred Stock was
convertible as of the Closing Date.

          SECTION 2.2 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES. (a) PAYING AGENT. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank, trust company or other person,
reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act as agent for the holders of the
Shares in connection with the Merger (the "PAYING AGENT") to receive the funds
and securities if applicable to which holders of the Shares shall become
entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(d). Parent shall, from time to time, make
available to the Paying Agent funds in amounts and at times necessary for the
payment of the Cash Consideration as provided herein and the Company shall, from
time to time, make available to the Paying Agent shares of ProLogis Common Stock
in amounts and at times necessary for the payment of the Stock Consideration, if
any. All interest earned on such funds shall be paid to Parent.

          (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding Shares (the "CERTIFICATES") whose Shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.1 (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effective, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form not
inconsistent with this Agreement as Parent may specify, with the consent of the
Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and (ii) instructions
for use in surrendering the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Cash
Consideration and issuance of the Stock Consideration, if any. Upon surrender of
a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly exe-

                                       A-3

cuted, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying
Agent, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to promptly pay to the holder of such
Certificate the Cash Consideration and issue the Stock Consideration, if any,
and the Certificate so surrendered shall thereupon be cancelled. In the event of
a surrender of a Certificate representing Shares which are not registered in the
transfer records of the Company under the name of the person surrendering such
Certificate, payment may be made to a person other than the person in whose name
the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes (as hereinafter
defined) required by reason of payment to a person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent
that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration, which the holder thereof has the right to
receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on the Merger Consideration
payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article
II.

          (c) TRANSFER BOOKS; NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN STOCK. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of the Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates representing ownership of the Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such Shares,
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

          (d) TERMINATION OF FUND; NO LIABILITY. At any time following twelve
months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds and securities (including
any interest or dividends received with respect thereto) which had been made
available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of
Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration
payable upon due surrender of their Certificates, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for the Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

          (e) LOST CERTIFICATES. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement.

                                       A-4

          SECTION 2.3 WITHHOLDING TAXES. Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct
and withhold, from the Cash Consideration payable to a holder of Shares,
pursuant to the Merger any withholding or other Taxes (as hereinafter defined)
as are required to be deducted or withheld under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "CODE"), or any applicable provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation.

          SECTION 2.4 STOCK OPTIONS; RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. (a) Upon the
Closing Date, each then outstanding option or warrant to purchase Class A Shares
(a "CLASS A OPTION") and each then outstanding option or warrant to purchase
Class B Shares (a "CLASS B OPTION" which together with a Class A Option, a
"COMPANY STOCK OPTION"), whether or not then exercisable, shall be cancelled by
the Company and in consideration of such cancellation and except to the extent
that Parent or Merger Sub and the holder of any such Company Stock Option
otherwise agree, the Company (or, at Parent's option, Merger Sub) shall pay to
each holder of a Company Stock Option, on the Closing Date, the excess of (i)
the Applicable Consideration (as defined below) over (ii) the product of (A) the
per-share exercise price of such Company Stock Option and (B) the number of
shares subject to such Company Stock Option, less (C) all required tax
withholdings; provided, that if the amount described in clause (ii) exceeds the
cash portion of the Applicable Consideration, the holder shall be obligated to
pay the amount of such excess to the Company or Merger Sub, as applicable, in
cash and the Company or Merger Sub, as applicable, shall deliver only the
non-cash portion of the Applicable Consideration to the holder.

          (b) Upon the Closing Date, each then

          (c) outstanding restricted stock unit (each a "RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT")
whether or not then vested, shall be cancelled by the Company and the Company
shall pay to the holder thereof the Applicable RSU Consideration (as defined
below), less all required tax withholdings. "THE APPLICABLE CONSIDERATION" means
either the Applicable RSU Cash Consideration or the Applicable RSU Merger
Consideration, as elected by the holder before the Closing.

          (d) The "APPLICABLE CONSIDERATION" means either the Applicable Cash
Consideration or the Applicable Merger Consideration, as elected by the holder
of any Company Stock Option or Restricted Stock Unit before the Closing,
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, if the holder of a Company Stock Option or Restricted Stock
Unit does not make such an election, he or she shall be deemed to have elected
to receive the Applicable Cash Consideration. The "APPLICABLE CASH
CONSIDERATION" means (w) in the case of a Class A Option or Restricted Stock
Unit with respect to Class A Stock, $1,300, and in the case of a Class B Option
or Restricted Stock Unit with respect to Class B Stock, $26, in either case
times (x) the number of shares subject to such Company Stock Option or
Restricted Stock Unit. The "APPLICABLE MERGER CONSIDERATION" means (y) in the
case of a Class A Option or Restricted Stock Unit with respect to Class A Stock,
the Class A Merger Consideration, and in the case of a Class B Option or
Restricted Stock Unit with respect to Class B Stock, the Class B Merger
Consideration, in either case times (z) the number of shares subject to such
Company Stock Option or Restricted Stock Unit.

                                       A-5

          (e) Except as otherwise required by Section 6.6, the Company shall
take all actions necessary and appropriate so that all stock option or other
equity based plans maintained with respect to the Shares, including the plans
listed in Section 3.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (as hereinafter
defined) ("COMPANY OPTION PLANS"), shall, terminate as of the Effective Time and
the provisions in any other benefit plan providing for the issuance, transfer or
grant of any stock of the Company or any interest in respect of any stock of the
Company shall be deleted as of the Effective Time, and the Company shall take
all reasonable actions to ensure that following the Effective Time no holder of
a Company Stock Option or any participant in any Company Option Plan shall have
any right thereunder to acquire any stock of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or
the Surviving Corporation.

          SECTION 2.5 DISSENTING SHARES. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that Section 3-202 of the MGCL applies
to the Merger, Shares (the "DISSENTING SHARES") that are outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and which are held by stockholders who shall have
properly objected to the Merger, who shall have not voted in favor of the Merger
and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such shares in
accordance with Section 3-203 of the MGCL (the "DISSENTING STOCKHOLDERS") shall
not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, as applicable. Such stockholders instead shall be entitled to
receive payment of the appraised value of such Shares held by them in accordance
with the provisions of such Section 3-203, except that all Dissenting Shares
held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall
have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Shares under the MGCL
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become
exchangeable, as of the Effective Time, for the right to receive, without any
interest thereon, the Merger Consideration, upon surrender in the manner
provided in Section 2.2 of the Certificate or Certificates that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, represented such Shares.

          SECTION 2.6 INCLUSION OF ADJUSTMENT TO MERGER CONSIDERATION. (a)
Parent shall be entitled, by delivery to the Company of written notice at any
time prior to the date which is 15 days prior to Stockholders Meeting Date (as
hereinafter defined) (the date such notice is delivered, "ANNOUNCEMENT DATE"),
to elect (the "STOCK ELECTION") to make the ProLogis Common Stock owned by the
Company a part of the Merger Consideration and to reduce the amount of cash to
be included in the Merger Consideration, all in accordance with and as set forth
in the following and the definitions of the various terms set forth below. In
the event the Stock Election is made, and not revoked in accordance with
paragraph (c) below, the following adjustments shall be made:

     (i)  the Class A Cash Consideration shall be decreased by an amount
          equal to the ProLogis Stock Value multiplied by the Class A Per Share
          Factor, so that the amount of cash to be received by each holder of a
          share of Class A Common Stock in the Merger, together with the Class A
          Stock Consideration valued using the methodology set forth in clause
          (i) of the definition of ProLogis Stock Value, shall be $1300;

     (ii) the Class A Stock Consideration shall be a number of shares of
          ProLogis Common Stock equal to the total number of shares of ProLogis
          Common Stock to be

                                       A-6

          a part of the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
          Stock Election multiplied by the Class A Per Share Factor;

    (iii) the Class B Cash Consideration shall be decreased by an amount equal
          to the ProLogis Stock Value multiplied by the Class B Per Share
          Factor, so that the amount of cash to be received by each holder of a
          share of Class B Common Stock in the Merger, together with the Class B
          Stock Consideration valued using the methodology set forth in clause
          (i) of the definition of ProLogis Stock Value, shall be $26;

     (iv) the Class B Stock Consideration shall be a number of shares of
          ProLogis Common Stock equal to the total number of shares of ProLogis
          Common Stock to be a part of the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
          Stock Election multiplied by the Class B Per Share Factor;

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall be under no obligation to cause the
issuance of fractional shares of ProLogis Common Stock, and may substitute cash
in lieu of such fractional shares. In that connection, as soon as practicable
after the Closing Date, the Company shall, itself or through an agent, determine
the number of whole shares and fractional shares of the ProLogis Common Stock to
be delivered to each holder of Shares, aggregate all such fractional shares and
sell the whole shares obtained thereby, in the open market or otherwise, in each
case at then prevailing trading prices, and to cause to be distributed to each
such holder or for the benefit of each beneficial owner, in lieu of any
fractional share, such holder's or owner's ratable share of the proceeds of such
sale, after making appropriate deductions of the amount required to be withheld
for federal income tax purposes and after deducting an amount equal to all
brokerage charges, commissions and transfer taxes attributed to such sale.

          (b) As soon as practicable after the Announcement Date, Parent and the
Company shall issue a joint press release announcing Parent's election, subject
to its right of revocation, to include Stock Consideration in the Merger
Consideration, and as soon as the ProLogis Stock Value is determinable, Parent
and the Company shall issue a joint press release announcing the amounts of the
Class A Cash Consideration, the Class A Stock Consideration, the Class B Cash
Consideration and the Class B Stock Consideration.

          (c) Parent may revoke the Stock Election at any time, provided that no
such revocation may be made if such revocation would make it reasonably
necessary, based upon the advice of the Company's independent counsel, to delay
the Company Stockholder Meeting. Following any such revocation, the Class A
Merger Consideration shall again be $1,300 and the Class B Merger Consideration
shall again be $26. As soon as practicable after any such revocation, Parent and
the Company shall issue a joint press release announcing such revocation.

                                       A-7

                                  ARTICLE III

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
                                 OF THE COMPANY

          Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the
Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "COMPANY
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE") (each section of which qualifies the correspondingly
numbered representation and warranty or covenant to the extent specified
therein; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that an item included on a Company Disclosure
Schedule with respect to any section or subsection of this Agreement shall be
deemed to relate to each other section or subsection of this Agreement but only
to the extent that such relationship is reasonably inferable), the Company
hereby represents and warrants to each of Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

          SECTION 3.1 ORGANIZATION AND QUALIFICATION; SUBSIDIARIES. (a) The
Company and each of its subsidiaries is a corporation or legal entity duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation and has all requisite corporate, partnership
or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its businesses as now conducted and proposed by the Company to be
conducted, except where the failure to be duly organized, existing and in good
standing or to have such power and authority would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the ability
of the Company to consummate the Merger or perform its obligations hereunder.

          (b) Section 3.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list
of all subsidiaries of the Company. Except as listed in Section 3.1 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly,
beneficially or of record, any shares of stock or other security of any other
entity or any other investment in any other entity, that would be a subsidiary
of the Company.

          (c) The Company and each of its subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the
property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted
by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure
to be duly organized, existing and in good standing or to have such power and
authority would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to consummate
the Merger or perform its obligations hereunder.

          (d) The Company has heretofore delivered to Parent accurate and
complete copies of the Charter and bylaws, as currently in effect, of the
Company.

          SECTION 3.2 CAPITALIZATION OF THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES;
CERTAIN INFORMATION REGARDING THE PUBLIC INVESTEES. (a) The authorized stock of
the Company consists of: (i) 15,543,012 Class A Shares, of which 882,171.302
Class A Shares were issued and outstanding as of the close of business on
November 30, 2001, (ii) 234,199,346 Class B Shares, of which 93,827,130 Class B
Shares were issued and outstanding as of the close of business on November 30,
2001, and (iii) 257,642 shares of Preferred Stock, of which 257,642 shares were
issued

                                       A-8

and outstanding as of the close of business on November 30, 2001. All of
the issued and outstanding Shares and shares of Preferred Stock have been
validly issued, and are duly authorized, fully paid, non-assessable and free of
preemptive rights. As of November 30, 2001, 8,769,035 Class B Shares and 133,105
Class A Shares were reserved for issuance and issuable upon or otherwise
deliverable in connection with the exercise of outstanding Company Stock Options
and 1,305,350 shares were reserved for issuance under Restricted Stock Units
issued pursuant to the Company Option Plans. Except as set forth in Section
3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, since November 30, 2001, no shares of
the Company's stock have been issued other than pursuant to Company Stock
Options already in existence on such date or upon conversion of Convertible
Notes or vesting of Restricted Stock Units, and, since November 30, 2001, no
Company Stock Options or Restricted Stock Units have been granted. Except as set
forth above, and except for the conversion of outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock into a maximum of 6,606,205 Class B Shares, the conversion of the
Company's 6.5% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2016 (the "CONVERTIBLE
NOTES") into a maximum of 195,982 Class A Shares and the issuance of securities
upon the exercise, exchange or redemption of the Rights, as of the date hereof,

Company; (iii) no options or other rights to acquire from the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, and no obligations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
to issue, any stock, voting securities or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for stock or voting securities of the Company; and (iv) no equity
equivalents, interests in the ownership or earnings of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or other similar rights (including stock appreciation rights)
(collectively, "COMPANY SECURITIES"). There are no outstanding obligations of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any Company Securities. Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth information regarding the current exercise price, date of
grant and number granted of Company Stock Options for each holder thereof.
Following the Effective Time, no holder of Company Stock Options will have any
right to receive shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation upon exercise of
the Company Stock Options.

          (b) Except as set forth in Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, all of the outstanding stock of the Company's subsidiaries is owned by
the Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien (as hereinafter
defined) or any other limitation or restriction (including any restriction on
the right to vote or sell the same, except as may be provided as a matter of
Law). There are no securities of the Company or its subsidiaries convertible
into or exchangeable for, no options or other rights to acquire from the Company
or its subsidiaries, and no other contract, understanding, arrangement or
obligation (whether or not contingent) providing for the issuance or sale,
directly or indirectly of, any stock or other ownership interests in, or any
other securities of, any subsidiary of the Company. There are no outstanding
obligations of the Company or its subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any outstanding shares of stock or other ownership interests
in any subsidiary of the Company. Except as set forth in Section 3.2(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts
or other agreements or understandings to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is bound relating to the voting of any shares of stock of the
Company or any subsidiary of the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, "LIEN"
means, with respect to any asset (including any security) any mortgage, lien,
pledge, charge, security interest or encumbrance of any kind in respect of such
asset.

                                       A-9

          (c) Section 3.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, for
each Public Investee, the amount and nature of all securities of such Public
Investee owned by the Company and its subsidiaries. To the knowledge of the
Company, each of the outstanding shares of stock of each Public Investee is duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable (to the extent such
concepts are recognized in the applicable jurisdiction), and is owned by the
Company and its subsidiaries free and clear of all Liens (other than as set
forth in Section 3.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule) and has not been
issued in violation of any preemptive or similar rights. Other than as set forth
in Section 3.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls, agreements, understandings,
claims or other commitments or rights of any type relating to the issuance,
sale, transfer or voting of any securities of any Public Investee to which the
Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound.

          SECTION 3.3 AUTHORITY RELATIVE TO THIS AGREEMENT; STOCKHOLDER
APPROVAL. (a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the Merger. No other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company or any of its subsidiaries are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Merger (other than,
with respect to the Merger and this Agreement, to the extent required by Law,
the Company Requisite Vote (as hereinafter defined)). This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid,
legal and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms.

          (b) The Company Board has, by unanimous vote of those present, duly
and validly authorized the execution and delivery of this Agreement and approved
the consummation of the Merger, and taken all corporate actions required to be
taken by the Company Board for the consummation of the Merger. The Company Board
has directed that this Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of the Company
for their approval to the extent required by Law. The affirmative approval of
the holders of Shares representing a majority of the votes that may be cast by
the holders of all outstanding Shares and shares of Preferred Stock (voting
together as a single class) as of the record date for the Company Stockholder
Meeting (the "COMPANY REQUISITE VOTE") is the only vote of the holders of any
class or series of stock of the Company necessary to adopt this Agreement and
approve the Merger.

          SECTION 3.4 REPORTS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. (a) The Company has filed
all required forms, reports and documents with the SEC since January 1, 1998,
each of which has complied in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "SECURITIES ACT"),
and the Exchange Act, each as in effect on the dates such forms, reports and
documents were filed. The Company has heretofore delivered to Parent, in the
form filed with the SEC (including any amendments thereto), (i) its Annual
Reports on Form 10-K for each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 1998, 1999
and 2000, respectively, (ii) all definitive proxy statements relating to the
Company's meetings of stockholders (whether annual or special) held since
January 1, 1998, and (iii) all other reports or registration statements filed by
the Company with the SEC since January 1, 1998 (the "COMPANY SEC REPORTS"). None
of such forms, reports or documents, including any financial statements or
schedules included or incorporated by reference therein, contained, when filed,
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they

                                      A-10

were made, not misleading. The consolidated financial statements of the Company
included in the Company SEC Reports complied as to form in all material respects
with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations
of the SEC with respect thereto and fairly present, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis ("GAAP") (except as
may be indicated in the notes thereto), the consolidated financial position of
the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their
consolidated results of operations and changes in financial position for the
periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited interim financial
statements, to normal year-end adjustments). Since January 1, 1998, there has
not been any change, or any application or request for any change, by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries in accounting principles, methods or policies
for financial accounting or Tax purposes (subject, in the case of the unaudited
interim financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments).

          (b) The Company and each of its subsidiaries have timely filed all
material reports, registrations and statements, together with any amendments
required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required to file since
December 31, 1998 with any U.S., state or foreign regulatory authorities or
self-regulatory organization (each, a "REGULATORY AGENCY" "), and have paid all
material fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith. Except
for normal examinations conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the regular course
of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, no Regulatory Agency has
initiated any proceeding or investigation or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened any investigation into the business or operations of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries since December 31, 1998, except for such proceedings or
investigations which would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries
taken as a whole.

          SECTION 3.5 NO UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Except as and to the extent
publicly disclosed by the Company in the Company SEC Reports, as of December 31,
2000 (the "AUDIT DATE"), none of the Company or its subsidiaries had any
liabilities or material obligations of any nature, whether or not accrued,
contingent or otherwise, and whether due or to become due or asserted or
unasserted, except for any such liabilities or obligations which do not or which
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.

          SECTION 3.6 ABSENCE OF CHANGES. Except as and to the extent publicly
disclosed by the Company in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date of
this Agreement, since the Audit Date the business of the Company and its
subsidiaries has been carried on only in the ordinary and usual course
consistent with past practice, none of the Company or its subsidiaries has
incurred any liabilities of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or
otherwise, which do or which would reasonably be expected to have, and there
have been no events, changes or effects with respect to the Company or its
subsidiaries, which do or which would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company and
its subsidiaries taken as a whole.

          SECTION 3.7 PROXY STATEMENT. The proxy statement relating to the
Merger (the "PROXY STATEMENT") will not, on the date the Proxy Statement
(including any amendment or supplement thereto) is first mailed to stockholders
of the Company, contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in

                                      A-11

order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading or shall, at the time of the Company
Stockholder Meeting or at the Effective Time, omit to state any material fact
necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to
the solicitation of proxies which shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect. The Proxy Statement will, when filed by the Company with the
SEC, comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions
of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company makes no representation or warranty with respect to
the statements made in any of the foregoing documents based on and in conformity
with information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub
specifically for inclusion therein.

the Company, its subsidiaries or any trade or business (whether or not
incorporated) which is or has ever been under common control, or which is or has

valuations, if applicable; and (v) summary plan descriptions, if applicable.

          (c) As of the date hereof, except as would not reasonably be expected

          (e) Each of the Employee Benefit Plans which is intended to be
"qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
determination letter from the IRS to the effect that such plan is "qualified"
and that the trusts maintained pursuant thereto are exempt from federal income
taxation under Section 501 of the Code. The Company knows of no fact which would
adversely affect the qualified status of any such Pension Plan or the exemption
of such trust, in either case, that cannot be corrected without a material
adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.

          (f) None of the Employee Benefit Plans provide for continuing
post-employment health or life insurance coverage for any participant or any
beneficiary of a participant except as may be required under the Consolidated

Schedule, no stock or other security issued by the Company forms or has formed a
material part of the assets of any Employee Benefit Plan.

          (h) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the Merger will by itself or in combination with any other event
(i) result in any material payment becoming due, or materially increase the
amount of compensation due, to any current or former employee of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries; (ii) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable
under any Employee Benefit Plan; or (iii) result in the acceleration of the time
of payment or vesting of any such material benefits.

          (i) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan that is maintained
primarily for employees in a jurisdiction outside the United States (the
"FOREIGN PLANS") except as does not or which would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company
and its subsidiaries taken as a whole:

               (i)      all employer and employee contributions to each Foreign
Plan required by law or by the terms of such Foreign Plan have been made, or, if
applicable, accrued in accordance with normal accounting practices;

               (ii)     the fair market value of the assets of each funded
Foreign Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Foreign Plan funded through
insurance or the book reserve established for any Foreign Plan, together with
any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued
benefit obligations, as of the Closing Date, with respect to all current or
former participants in such plan according to the actuarial assumptions and
valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to such
Foreign Plan and no transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such
assets or insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations; and

registered and has been maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory
authorities.

of the Company or any of its subsidiaries for federal income tax purposes by the

as follows:

          SECTION 4.1 ORGANIZATION. (a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws
of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has all requisite corporate,
partnership or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its businesses as now conducted or proposed by Parent
to be conducted, except where the failure to be duly organized, existing and in
good standing or to have such power would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the ability of
Parent to consummate the Merger or perform its obligations hereunder.

          (b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed and in
good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the property owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
duly qualified or licensed and in good standing does not and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
adverse affect on the ability of Parent to consummate the Merger or perform its
obligations hereunder.

          (c) Parent has heretofore delivered to the Company accurate and
complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Parent and the
charter and bylaws of Merger Sub as currently in effect.

          SECTION 4.3 PROXY STATEMENT. The information to be provided in writing
by Parent to the Company specifically for use in the Proxy Statement will not

consents or approvals or to make such filings or give such notice do not or
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the ability of Parent to consummate the Merger or
perform its obligations hereunder. Neither the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub nor the consummation by
Parent or Merger Sub of the Merger will (i) conflict with or result in any
breach of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or
similar governing documents) of Parent or the charter or bylaws (or similar
governing documents) of Merger Sub, (ii) result in a violation or breach of, or
constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or

or Lien) under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, lease, license, contract, agreement or other instrument or
obligation to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by which any of them or
any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or (iii) violate any
Law applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective properties or
assets, except in the case of (ii) or (iii) for violations, breaches or defaults
which do not or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the

               (ii)      prepare and file with the SEC (in consultation with
Parent, and affording Parent an opportunity to review and comment thereon) a
preliminary proxy relating to the Merger and this Agreement and (x) obtain and
furnish the information required to be included by the SEC in the Proxy
Statement and, after consultation with Parent, respond promptly to any comments
made by the SEC with respect to the preliminary proxy and cause a definitive
proxy, including any amendment or supplement thereto to be mailed to its
stockholders at the earliest practicable date, but in no event prior to the time
that the ProLogis Registration Statement (as hereinafter defined) shall have
been declared effective by the SEC; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company without
consultation with Parent and its counsel and (y) use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain the necessary approvals of the Merger and this Agreement by its
stockholders; and

               (iii)     unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance
with Article VIII, subject to its rights pursuant to Section 6.3(b), include in
the Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Company Board that stockholders
of the Company vote in favor of the approval and adoption of the Merger and this
Agreement.

          (a) Parent shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares then
owned by it, Merger Sub or any of its other subsidiaries in favor of the
approval and adoption of the Merger and this Agreement.

          SECTION 6.2 REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each party hereto will use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, in good faith, all actions, and do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement
and applicable laws and regulations to consummate the Merger and to cause to be
satisfied all conditions precedent to its obligations under this Agreement, in
each case as soon as practicable after the date hereof, including, consistent
with the foregoing, (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with the
objective of being in a position to consummate the Merger as promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement all documentation to effect all
necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings, and other documents and to
obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, waivers, licenses, orders,
registrations, approvals, permits, rulings, authorizations and clearances
necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the "REQUIRED
APPROVALS"), and (ii) using its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Required
Approvals.

                                      A-30

          (b) (i) Each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Merger
as promptly as practicable and in any event within 10 business days of the date
hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act, and (ii)
Parent agrees to make any other requisite antitrust filings as soon as
reasonably practicable and the Company agrees to provide Parent with such
assistance as Parent requests for the purposes of filing such requisite
antitrust filings and, if such filings are made, each party agrees to supply as
promptly as practical any additional information and documentary material that
may be required or requested by the relevant governmental authority.

          (c) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any
filing or submission to or any investigation or proceeding by a private party,
the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the "DOJ") or any other Governmental Entity.

          (d) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the
efforts referenced in Section 6.2 (a) to obtain all Required Approvals, use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in
connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private
party, (ii) subject to applicable law, permit the other party to review and
discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in
connection with, any proposed written or material oral communication (or other
correspondence or memoranda) between it and any Governmental Entity, (iii)
promptly inform each other of and supply to such other party any communication
(or other correspondence or memoranda) received by such party from, or given by
such party to, the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Entity and of any
material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, in each case regarding the Merger contemplated hereby, and (iv)
consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with the DOJ,
the FTC or any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding
by a private party, with any other person, and to the extent permitted by the
DOJ, the FTC or such other applicable Governmental Entity or other person, give
the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences.

          (e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the
parties contained in this Section 6.2, if any objections are asserted with
respect to the Merger contemplated hereby under any antitrust or competition
law, Parent agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any antitrust
concerns, federal, state, foreign or private, obtain all Required Approvals and
obtain termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act or any other
applicable law and the termination of any outstanding judicial or administrative
orders prohibiting the Closing so as to permit consummation of the Merger as
soon as practicable. In furtherance and not in limitation thereof, if any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a
private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any law or
regulation, or if any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree,
injunction or administrative order is enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced
by a Governmental Entity that would make the Merger illegal or would otherwise
prohibit or materially impair or delay the consummation the Merger, the Company
shall cooperate with Parent in all respects in responding thereto, and each
shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest, resist and/or
attempt to resolve any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,

                                      A-31

reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger contemplated by this Agreement,
and to have such statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, injunction
or administrative order repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable so as to permit
consummation of the Merger.

          (f) The parties acknowledge and agree that Parent's "reasonable best
efforts" as it is referenced in this Section 6.2 shall not require Parent to
agree to or effect any divestiture, or to agree to or to hold separate or hold
in trust (or similar action involving) any part of Parent's or the Company's
business or operations, other than any of the Company's business or operations
with a net asset value in the aggregate of no greater than $50 million.

          (g) The Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain an opinion of counsel on or prior to the Effective Time
satisfying the requirements of Article 9 of the Articles of Incorporation of
Security Capital European Realty to allow Parent to be treated as an "Excluded
Holder" thereunder.

          SECTION 6.3 ACQUISITION PROPOSALS. (a) From the date hereof until the
termination hereof and except as expressly permitted by the following provisions
of this Section 6.3, the Company will not, nor will it permit any of its
subsidiaries to, nor will it authorize or permit any officer, director or
employee of, or any investment banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor or
representative of, the Company or any of its subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of any Acquisition
Proposal (as hereinafter defined) or (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect
to, or take any other action to facilitate, any Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
Company Board may furnish information to, or enter into discussions or
negotiations with, any person that previously has made an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal if, and only to the extent that, (A) the Company
Board, after consultation with and having considered the advice of independent
legal counsel, determines in good faith that (x) such Acquisition Proposal
would, if consummated, constitute a Superior Proposal (as hereinafter defined),
and (y) such action is necessary for the Company Board to comply with its duties
to the Company's stockholders under applicable Law and (B) prior to taking such
action, the Company (x) provides reasonable notice to Parent (but in any event
no later than 24 hours prior to taking such action) to the effect that it is
taking such action and (y) receives from such person an executed
confidentiality/standstill agreement in reasonably customary form, the terms of
which, as applicable to such person, in any event are at least as stringent as
those applicable to Parent in the Confidentiality Agreement between Parent and
the Company. Prior to providing any information to or entering into discussions
or negotiations with any person in connection with an Acquisition Proposal by
such person, the Company shall notify Parent of any Acquisition Proposal
(including the material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the
person making it) as promptly as practicable after its receipt thereof (and in
any event, no later than twenty-hours from receipt), and shall provide Parent
with a copy of any written Acquisition Proposal or amendments or supplements
thereto, and shall thereafter promptly inform Parent of the status of any
discussions or negotiations with such a third party, and any material changes to
the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, and shall promptly give
Parent a copy of any information delivered to such person that has not

                                      A-32

previously been reviewed by Parent. Immediately after the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, the Company will, and will cause its subsidiaries and
affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants and other agents to, cease and terminate any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any possible Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees
that it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals or
entities referred to in the first sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken
in this Section 6.3(a).

          (b) The Company Board will not withdraw or modify, or propose to
withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger unless the Company Board, after
consultation with and having considered the advice of independent legal counsel,
determines in good faith that such action is necessary for the Company Board to
comply with its duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable Law.
Except as set forth in this Section 7.3(b), the Company Board will not approve
or recommend or permit the Company to enter into any agreement with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement as described in
Section 6.3(a)) made by any person other than Parent or Merger Sub.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company Board, after having considered the
advice of independent legal counsel, determines in good faith that failing to
take such action would constitute a breach of the obligations of the Company
Board under applicable law, the Company Board may approve or recommend an
Acquisition Proposal (or amendment or supplement thereto) or cause the Company
to enter into an agreement with respect thereto, but in each case only if (i)
the Company provides written notice to Parent (a "NOTICE OF SUPERIOR PROPOSAL"),
which notice must be received by Parent at least three business days (exclusive
of the day of receipt by Parent of the Notice of Superior Proposal) prior to the
time it intends to cause the Company to enter into such an agreement, advising
Parent in writing that the Company Board has received an Acquisition Proposal
(or amendment or supplement thereto) which it believes constitutes a Superior
Proposal and which it intends to accept and, with respect to which, enter into a
definitive agreement, subject to the provisions of this Section 6.3(b),
providing a copy of any written offer or proposal describing the Superior
Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal
and identifying the person making such Superior Proposal, (ii) as of the end of
such three business day period referenced above, Parent shall have failed to
notify the Company in writing that it has determined to revise the terms of the
Merger to provide that the Merger Consideration will be equal to or greater than
the consideration to be paid to the Company stockholders pursuant to the
Superior Proposal, and (iii) the Company terminates this Agreement in accordance
with the requirements of Section 8.1(f) within 48 hours after the lapse of the
three-day period referenced above and immediately thereafter enters into an
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal. For purposes of this
Agreement, a "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means any bona fide Acquisition Proposal not
directly or indirectly initiated, solicited, encouraged or knowingly facilitated
by the Company after the date of this Agreement in contravention of the
provisions hereof which the Company Board determines in good faith judgment
(based on the advice of an investment banker of nationally recognized
reputation), taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal, (i) would, if
consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable to the Company's
stockholders (in their capacity as stockholders), from a financial point of
view, than the Merger and (ii) is reasonably capable of being completed;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that for purposes of this definition, the term Acquisition
Proposal shall have the meaning assigned to

                                      A-33

such term in Section 9.11 except that the reference to 20 percent in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to 100
percent.

          (c) Nothing contained in this Section 6.3 shall prohibit the Company
from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the
Company's stockholders which, in the good faith reasonable judgment of the
Company Board, based on the advice of independent legal counsel, is required
under applicable Law; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that except as otherwise permitted in
Section 6.3(b), the Company does not withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw
or modify, its position with respect to the Merger or approve or recommend, or
propose to approve or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal.

          SECTION 6.4 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company will consult with one another before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as
may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., as determined by Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, and except by the Company with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or similar matter or related matter as
contemplated by Section 6.3.

          SECTION 6.5 INDEMNIFICATION; DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INSURANCE. (a)
From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now,
or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of the parties hereto or any
subsidiary thereof (each an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY" and, collectively, the
"INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") against all losses, expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses), claims, damages or liabilities or, subject to the
proviso of the next succeeding sentence, amounts paid in settlement, arising out
of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time that are in whole
or in part (i) based on, or arising out of the fact that such person is or was a
director, officer or employee of such party or a subsidiary of such party or
(ii) based on, arising out of or pertaining to the Merger. In the event of any
such loss, expense, claim, damage or liability (whether or not arising before
the Effective Time), (i) Parent shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, promptly after statements therefor are received and
otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request reimbursement of
documented expenses reasonably incurred, in either case to the fullest extent
not prohibited by the MGCL and upon receipt of any affirmation and undertaking
required by the MGCL, (ii) Parent will cooperate in the defense of any such
matter and (iii) any determination required to be made with respect to whether
an Indemnified Party's conduct complies with the standards set forth under the
MGCL and Parent's certificate of incorporation or bylaws shall be made by
independent counsel mutually acceptable to Parent and the Indemnified Party;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).
The Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm with respect to
each related matter except to the extent there is, in the opinion of counsel to
an Indemnified Party, under applicable

                                      A-34

standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between
positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties.

          (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause to be maintained in effect the policies of directors' and officers'
liability insurance maintained by the Company for the benefit of those persons
who are covered by such policies at the Effective Time (or Parent may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time), to the extent that such liability
insurance can be maintained annually at a cost to Parent not greater than two
hundred percent of the premium for the current Company directors' and officers'
liability insurance; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if such insurance cannot be so
maintained or obtained at such costs, Parent shall maintain or obtain as much of
such insurance as can be so maintained or obtained at a cost equal to two
hundred percent of the current annual premiums of the Company for such
insurance.

          (c) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent shall assume the obligations set for in this
Section 6.5.

          (d) To the fullest extent permitted by Law, from and after the
Effective Time, all rights to indemnification now existing in favor of the
employees, agents, directors or officers of the Company and its subsidiaries
with respect to their activities as such prior to the Effective Time, as
provided in the Company's charter or bylaws, in effect on the date thereof or
otherwise in effect on the date hereof, shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six years from
the Effective Time.

          (e) The provisions of this Section 6.5 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives.

          SECTION 6.6 EMPLOYEE MATTERS. (a) Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor the obligations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
under the provisions of all employment, consulting, termination, severance,
change in control and indemnification agreements between and among the Company
or any of its subsidiaries and any current or former officer, director,
consultant or employee of the Company or any such subsidiaries. During the
period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the close of the next fiscal
year ending at least two years from the Closing Date (the "CONTINUATION
PERIOD"), Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to the current or
former employees of the Company and any of its subsidiaries (other than
employees covered by any collective bargaining agreement) ("COMPANY EMPLOYEES")
compensation and employee benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate
than the Applicable Required Benefits, as defined below. "APPLICABLE REQUIRED
BENEFITS" shall mean: (i) for Company Employees who are employed by the Company,
the compensation and benefits that are provided to such Company Employees
immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided, that beginning on such date,
not later than January 1, 2003, as Parent shall determine, the "APPLICABLE
REQUIRED BENEFITS" shall mean the compensation and benefits provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent (determined based on position,
compensation level and location) from time to time, if greater (such
compensation and benefits in the aggregate, the

                                      A-35

"PARENT BENEFITS"); (ii) for all other Company Employees who participate in the
employee benefit plans of the Company immediately prior to the Closing Date,
either the compensation and benefits provided to such Company Employees
immediately prior to the Closing Date or, at Parent's option, the Parent
Benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent; (iii) in the case
of those Company Employees who do not participate in the employee benefit plans
of the Company as of the Closing Date but who are scheduled to begin so
participating as of April 2002, (A) until April 2002, the compensation and
benefits they are being provided immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
from and after April 2002, the compensation and benefits they are scheduled to
be provided from and after April 2002, or (B) at Parent's option, the Parent
Benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent; and (iv) for all
other Company Employees, compensation and benefits that are no less favorable in
the aggregate than those provided to such Company Employees immediately prior to
the Closing Date.

          (b) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of Parent and
its affiliates providing benefits to any Company Employee after the Closing Date
(the "NEW PLANS"), and subject to applicable law and obligations under
applicable collective bargaining agreements, each Company Employee shall be
credited with his or her years of service with the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, as the case may be, before the Closing Date, to the same extent as
such Company Employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for such
service under any similar Employee Benefit Plans, as applicable, except to the
extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits and except for
purposes of benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans. In addition,
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject to applicable
law and obligations under applicable collective bargaining agreements: (i) each
Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans which are welfare benefit plans to the
extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable
Employee Benefit Plan, as applicable, in which such Company Employee
participated immediately before the Closing Date (such plans, collectively, the
"OLD Plans"); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall
cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of
such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
Company Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Company Employee's
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his
or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had
been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

          (c) Parent shall ensure that the account balance of each participant
in the SCGroup Incorporated Nonqualified Savings Plan (the "NSP") or the SCGroup
Deferred Fee Plan for Directors (the "DFP") fully vests as of the Closing Date,
and that the portion of such account valued with respect to Class A Shares or
Class B Shares shall, at the election of the participant, be converted into
either (i) a cash balance in the amount of $1300 per Class A Share or $26 per
Class B Share, as applicable, or (ii) a cash balance equal to the Class A Cash
Consideration or the Class B Cash Consideration, as applicable, times the number
of shares credited to such account, plus a hypothetical number of shares of
ProLogis Common Stock equal to the Class A Stock Consideration or the Class B
Stock Consideration, as applicable, times the number

                                      A-36

of shares credited to such account. Any portion of such account that is
converted into a cash balance may be deemed invested by the participant in any
of the available investment choices under the NSP or the DFP, as applicable, and
any portion thereof that is converted into hypothetical shares of ProLogis
Common Stock shall continue to be deemed invested in such shares until such time
as the participant elects, in accordance with the NSP or the DFP, as applicable,
to invest such balance in another available investment choice; provided, that
after such conversions, the NSP or the DFP, as applicable, need not permit
participants to elect to invest any addition balances in such shares. Until at
least December 31, 2002, Parent shall (i) maintain or cause the Company to
maintain the NSP in accordance with its terms, except as provided above in this
Section 6.6(c), (ii) allow Company Employees to participate in the NSP and to
defer compensation into the NSP, (iii) make matching contributions with respect
to employee deferrals (including deferrals with respect to the awards described
in Section 6.6(e)), in each case, consistent with the Company's past practice
and on terms no less favorable than those in effect immediately prior to the
date hereof, and (iv) ensure that each Participant's account under the NSP
(including any stock balance converted to a cash balance pursuant to this
Section) and any increase thereto is maintained in accordance with the terms of
the NSP and with the Company's ordinary past practice. Parent may amend or
terminate, or cause the Company to amend or terminate, the NSP effective on or
after January 1, 2003, but in no event shall any such amendment or termination,
whenever occurring, result in a change in the timing, method or amounts of the
distributions made to any Company Employee who is a participant in the NSP
immediately before the Effective Time.

          (d) For so long after the Closing Date as the Company or any of its
subsidiaries maintains a 401(k) plan (all such plans, the "COMPANY 401(K)
PLAN"), and Parent maintains a 401(k) plan with a loan feature for similarly
situated employees, Parent shall cause the Company 401(k) Plan to retain the
loan feature of such plan. Effective as of the Closing, the Company will fully
vest the account balances of each participant in the Company 401(k) Plan who is
a Company Employee.

          (e) To the extent not paid prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall pay
a cash bonus award with respect to the 2001 calendar year to each Company
Employee listed on Section 6.6(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule equal to
the amount listed on such schedule (each such award, a "2001 BONUS AWARD").
Parent shall pay the 2001 Bonus Awards no later than January 31, 2002 and shall
allow each Company Employee participating in the NSP upon the Closing Date to
defer a portion of his or her 2001 Bonus Award under the NSP in accordance with
deferral elections in place prior to the Closing Date.

          SECTION 6.7 SEC FILINGS. The Company and Parent shall notify the other
promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other
government officials in connection with any filing made pursuant hereto and of
any request by the SEC or its staff or any other government officials for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or any other filings or for
additional information and will supply the other with copies of all
correspondence between such party or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other government officials, on the other
hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, the Merger or any other filing. The
Company shall, and Parent shall and shall cause Purchaser to, cause all
documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC or other regulatory
authorities under Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 to comply in all material respects
with all applicable re-

                                      A-37

quirements of law and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Whenever
any event occurs which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement or any other filing, the Company will, or Parent will
cause Parent to, as the case may be, promptly inform the other of such
occurrence and cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff or any other
government officials and/or mailing to stockholders of the Company, such
amendment or supplement.

          SECTION 6.8 OBLIGATIONS OF MERGER SUB. Parent will take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement
and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

          SECTION 6.9 TAKEOVER STATUTES; RIGHTS PLAN; OWNERSHIP LIMIT. (a) If
any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the Merger, each of Parent
and the Company shall take such actions as are necessary so that the Merger may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on
the Merger.

          (b) The Company Board shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, (i) amend the Rights Agreement or (ii) take any action with respect to,
or make any determination under, the Rights Agreement, including a redemption of
the Rights.

          (c) The Company Board shall not take any action to exempt any person
(other than Parent, Merger Sub and each of their respective affiliates) from the
Ownership Limit provisions set forth in Article FIFTH of the Charter.

          SECTION 6.10 NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of
(i) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event the occurrence or nonoccurrence
of which would reasonably be expected to cause any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement to be materially untrue or inaccurate, or (ii) any
failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, materially to comply with
or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it hereunder; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice; and provided further that failure
to give such notice shall not be treated as a breach of covenant for the
purposes of Section 7.2(b) unless and except to the extent that the failure to
give such notice results in material prejudice to the other party.

          SECTION 6.11 COMPANY FUNDS. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the date hereof, the Company shall inform the Company Funds of the Merger. If
and to the extent necessary, the Company shall assist each of the Company Funds
to prepare and file with the SEC, or other applicable Governmental Entity, as
soon as is reasonably practicable a preliminary proxy statement, together with a
form of proxy, to be used in connection with the meeting of the stockholders of
each such Company Fund for the purpose of approving new Investment Company
Advisory Agreements, or other applicable agreements, with the current advisor of
each such Fund, substantially on the terms of the current Investment Company
Advisory Agreements, to take effect at the Effective Time, and, as promptly as
practicable thereafter, subject to compliance with the rules and regulations of
the SEC to the extent applicable, a definitive proxy state-

                                      A-38

ment with respect to such meeting shall be mailed to the stockholders of such
Company Fund. Each such proxy statement shall comply as to form in all material
respects with all applicable Law.

          SECTION 6.12 OTHER ADVISORY CONTRACT CONSENTS. (a) As soon as
reasonably practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall inform the Funds
that are not Company Funds of the Merger contemplated by this Agreement and
request that such Funds take such actions as may be necessary in connection with
the deemed assignment, as defined in Section 202(a) of the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940, as amended (the "ADVISERS ACT") (the "DEEMED ASSIGNMENT") of the
advisory agreements to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party
relating to such Fund.

          (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, the
Company shall inform its investment advisory clients that are parties to
Non-Investment Company Advisory Agreements ("NICAAS") of the Merger contemplated
by this Agreement. The Company shall request written consent of each such client
to the deemed assignment of its NICAA and use reasonable commercial efforts to
obtain such consent; or in the case of NICAAs which prohibit assignment or state
by their terms that they terminate upon assignment, the Company will use its
reasonable commercial efforts to enter into new agreements in substantially
identical terms to be effective upon Closing and the deemed assignment. Parent
agrees that, except in the case of NICAAs that prohibit assignment or state by
their terms that they terminate upon assignment or do not, by their terms,
require written consent of the client, the Company may obtain consent by
requesting written consent as aforesaid and informing such client: (x) of the
Company's intention to effect a deemed assignment of such NICAAs; (y) of the
Company's intention to continue the advisory services, pursuant to the NICAAs
with such client after the Closing if such client does not terminate such NICAAs
prior to the Closing; and (z) that the consent of such client will be implied if
such client continues to accept such advisory services for at least 30 days
after the Closing without termination (to the extent permitted by the Advisers
Act, and any rules, regulations or interpretations of the SEC thereunder).

          SECTION 6.13 TRANSFER TAXES. Subject to Section 2.2(b), Parent shall
pay or cause to be paid any transfer, sales, use, excise and similar Taxes and
fees for which the Company Stockholders may be liable (but not any Taxes
measured by or based on gross or net income of any Company stockholders) arising
from or payable by reason of the Merger.

          SECTION 6.14 REGISTRATION AND SALE OF PROLOGIS COMMON STOCK. With the
prior written consent of both the Company and the Parent, the Company may at any
time sell any or all of the shares of the ProLogis Common Stock, including to
ProLogis, pursuant to a public offering or private placement, negotiated
third-party purchase or otherwise (a "PROLOGIS SALE"). In addition, the Company
will, at the written request of Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to
effect a ProLogis Sale in the manner requested by Parent, and subject to
approval by Parent of any final pricing terms, provided that the Company shall
not be required to effect a ProLogis Sale, or enter into any binding agreement
to effect a ProLogis Sale, prior to the date which is 18 days prior to the
then-applicable Stockholders Meeting Date (provided that if a "road show" with
respect to a ProLogis sale to be effected by a public offering shall have been
commenced on or after the date which is 22 days prior to the then-applicable
Stockholders Meeting Date, and there shall thereafter be a delay or postponement
of the Stockholders Meeting Date, the relevant date

                                      A-39

which is 18 days prior to the previously-applicable Stockholders Meeting Date
shall not be changed for purposes of this sentence). The Company will, after
consultation with Parent, determine the manager(s) and book runner(s) in the
event of any ProLogis Sale that is an underwritten offering. In order to
facilitate a possible ProLogis Sale and/or a distribution of ProLogis Common
Stock pursuant to the Stock Election, the Company will, on or before December
17, 2001, exercise its rights under Section 6 of the Third Amended and Restated
Investors Agreement between ProLogis and the Company, dated as of September 9,
1997, as amended, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist ProLogis
in filing and having declared effective one or more registration statements, and
any necessary supplements or amendments, with respect to the shares of ProLogis
Common Stock, suitable for use in connection with the Stock Election and/or the
ProLogis Sale, and shall allow Parent to participate in the process of so
registering the ProLogis Common Stock.

          SECTION 6.15 STORAGE USA ACQUISITION. In the event any third party
shall seek to acquire Storage USA for consideration in excess of that agreed to
be paid pursuant to the Storage USA Transaction Agreements, the Company shall
determine to either (x) seek Parent's consent to offer to increase the price to
be paid by the Company in connection with the Storage USA Acquisition or (y) not
to do so. If the Company determines not to so increase the price to be paid by
the Company in connection with the Storage USA Acquisition, then, at the written
request of Parent, the Company will nevertheless offer to increase the price to
be paid in connection with the Storage USA Acquisition on such terms as Parent
may designate. Immediately upon any subsequently termination of this Agreement
whether pursuant to Article VIII or otherwise (or, if the Storage USA
Acquisition sha
