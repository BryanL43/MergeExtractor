(1) This Registration Statement registers the maximum number of shares of common
    stock, par value $.01 per share, of Quest Diagnostics Incorporated estimated
    to be issuable in connection with (a) the exchange offer by Quest
    Diagnostics Incorporated through its wholly owned subsidiary, Quest
    Diagnostics Newco Incorporated, for all of the outstanding shares of common
    stock, par value $.01 per share, of Unilab Corporation, and (b) the merger
    of Unilab Corporation with Quest Diagnostics Newco Incorporated. The maximum
    number, 12,114,047, equals the sum of (a) the product of (i) 33,573,700, the
    total number of shares of Unilab Corporation common stock outstanding as of
    May 14, 2002, and (ii) 0.3256, and (b) the product of (i) 3,631,603, the
    number of outstanding options to purchase shares of Unilab Corporation
    common stock, less the number of outstanding options to purchase shares of
    Unilab Corporation common stock to be cancelled upon consummation of the
    offer, and (ii) 0.3256.
(2) Estimated solely for the purpose of calculating the registration fee
    pursuant to Rules 457(f)(1) and (3) and Rule 457(c) of the Securities Act of
    1933, as amended, based on the product of (a) $29.34, the average of the
    high and low sales prices of Unilab Corporation common stock as reported by
    the Nasdaq National Market on May 14, 2002 and (b) 37,205,303 shares of
    Unilab Corporation common stock, the number of shares of Unilab Corporation
    common stock outstanding at the close of business on May 14, 2002, assuming
    the exercise of all options to purchase Unilab Corporation common stock.
(3) Computed in accordance with Rule 457(f) under the Securities Act to be
    $100,428, which is equal to 0.000092 multiplied by the proposed maximum
    aggregate offering price of $1,091,603,590.

                               UNILAB CORPORATION
  SUBJECT, IN EACH CASE, TO THE PRORATION AND ELECTION PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN
      THIS PROSPECTUS AND THE RELATED LETTER OF ELECTION AND TRANSMITTAL.

THE OFFER AND WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS WILL EXPIRE AT 12:00 MIDNIGHT, NEW YORK CITY
TIME, ON MONDAY, JUNE 17, 2002, UNLESS EXTENDED. SHARES TENDERED PURSUANT TO
THIS OFFER MAY BE WITHDRAWN AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE OFFER.

     On April 2, 2002, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with
Unilab Corporation to acquire all the outstanding shares of Unilab common stock.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF UNILAB HAS DETERMINED THAT THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, INCLUDING THE OFFER AND THE MERGER, ARE
FAIR TO AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF UNILAB AND UNILAB STOCKHOLDERS, HAS
APPROVED AND DECLARED THE ADVISABILITY OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, INCLUDING THE OFFER AND THE MERGER, AND
RECOMMENDS THAT UNILAB STOCKHOLDERS ACCEPT THE OFFER AND, IF APPLICABLE, VOTE IN
FAVOR OF THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

     We are offering to exchange 0.3256 of a share of Quest Diagnostics
Incorporated common stock (including the associated right to purchase preferred
stock), or to pay $26.50 in cash, for each outstanding share of Unilab common
stock that is validly tendered and not properly withdrawn in the offer, subject
to the proration and election procedures described in this prospectus and the
related letter of election and transmittal. In the offer, Unilab stockholders
may elect to receive shares of Quest Diagnostics common stock or cash in
exchange for each of their shares of Unilab common stock. However, the aggregate
cash consideration that Unilab stockholders may receive is subject to a pro rata
reduction because not more than 30% of the shares of Unilab common stock
outstanding immediately prior to the expiration of the offer can be exchanged
for cash. See "The Offer -- Basic Terms" for a detailed description of the
proration procedure.

     The purpose of our offer is for Quest Diagnostics to acquire control of,
and ultimately the entire common equity interest in, Unilab. After completion of
the offer, we intend to merge Unilab with Quest Diagnostics Newco Incorporated,
our wholly owned subsidiary. In that merger, each outstanding share of Unilab
common stock that is not exchanged in the offer will be converted into 0.3256 of
a share of Quest Diagnostics common stock, subject to appraisal rights if
available under Delaware law. Accordingly, if your shares of Unilab common stock
are not exchanged in the offer, and the merger is effected, you will receive
0.3256 of a share of Quest Diagnostics common stock for each Unilab share that
you own, the receipt of which may be delayed due to the possibility of a delay
in completing the merger after completion of the offer. NOTWITHSTANDING THE
AMOUNT, IF ANY, OF CASH PAID IN THE OFFER, STOCKHOLDERS WHO DO NOT TENDER THEIR
SHARES OF UNILAB COMMON STOCK IN THE OFFER WILL NOT RECEIVE ANY CASH
CONSIDERATION IN EXCHANGE FOR THEIR UNILAB SHARES IN THE MERGER (EXCEPT FOR
CASH, IF ANY, THAT IS PAID IN LIEU OF FRACTIONAL SHARES OF QUEST DIAGNOSTICS
COMMON STOCK OR CASH THAT MAY BE RECEIVED FOLLOWING THE EXERCISE OF APPRAISAL
RIGHTS, IF APPLICABLE).

     Our obligation to exchange shares of Quest Diagnostics common stock and
cash for shares of Unilab common stock in the offer is subject to the conditions
listed under "The Offer -- Conditions to the Offer", including the condition
that a majority of the shares of Unilab common stock outstanding on a fully
diluted basis be tendered into the offer.

     Quest Diagnostics' common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange
under the symbol "DGX", and Unilab's common stock is listed on the Nasdaq
National Market under the symbol "ULAB".

     NEITHER THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES
COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED OF THE SECURITIES TO BE ISSUED UNDER THIS
PROSPECTUS OR DETERMINED IF THIS PROSPECTUS IS ACCURATE OR ADEQUATE. ANY
REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

     SEE "RISK FACTORS" BEGINNING ON PAGE 9 FOR A DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN FACTORS
THAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER IN CONNECTION WITH THE OFFER.

     WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR A PROXY AND YOU ARE REQUESTED NOT TO SEND US A PROXY.
Any solicitation of proxies will be made only pursuant to separate proxy
solicitation materials complying with the requirements of Section 14(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

              QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION

Q:  WHO IS OFFERING TO EXCHANGE MY SECURITIES?

A:  We are Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, the nation's leading provider of
    diagnostic testing and related services for the healthcare industry. Quest
    Diagnostics Newco Incorporated, which we refer to as Purchaser, is a newly
    formed Delaware corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary. Purchaser has
    been organized in connection with this transaction and has not carried on
    any activities other than in connection with this transaction.

Q:  WHAT IS QUEST DIAGNOSTICS PROPOSING?

A:  We are offering, through Purchaser, to exchange shares of Quest Diagnostics
    common stock, which we refer to as Quest Diagnostics shares, or cash for
    each outstanding share of Unilab common stock, which we refer to as Unilab
    shares. After the successful completion of the offer and the satisfaction of
    other conditions specified in the merger agreement, Unilab will be merged
    with Purchaser.

Q:  WHAT CAN I RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY UNILAB SHARES IN THE OFFER?

A:  In exchange for each of your Unilab shares that are validly tendered and not
    properly withdrawn in the offer, you may elect to receive 0.3256 of a Quest
    Diagnostics share, or $26.50 in cash. However, the total cash consideration
    you may receive in exchange for your Unilab shares is subject to a pro rata
    reduction because not more than 30% of the Unilab shares outstanding
    immediately prior to the expiration of the offer can be exchanged for cash.

    An election to receive Quest Diagnostics shares for all of your Unilab
    shares will not be subject to proration.

    For more information on the election procedure and the manner in which
    Unilab shares will be exchanged, please read the detailed information set
    forth under "The Offer -- Basic Terms and Procedure for Tendering and
    Electing" beginning on page 35.

Q:  WHAT IF THE HOLDERS OF MORE THAN 30% OF UNILAB'S SHARES ELECT TO RECEIVE
    CASH IN THE OFFER? HOW WILL THE PRORATION PROCEDURE AFFECT ME IF I HAVE
    ELECTED TO RECEIVE CASH IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES?

A:  If the holders of more than 30% of the Unilab shares outstanding immediately
    prior to the expiration of the offer, which we refer to as the maximum cash
    election number, elect to receive cash in exchange for all of their Unilab
    shares, then all such cash electing Unilab shares will be exchanged on a pro
    rata basis into a combination of cash and Quest Diagnostics shares so that
    the total number of Unilab shares exchanged for cash does not exceed the
    maximum cash election number.

    THIS MEANS THAT THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE 100% OF THE
    OFFER CONSIDERATION IN THE FORM OF CASH FOR EACH UNILAB SHARE THAT YOU
    PROPERLY ELECT TO EXCHANGE FOR THE CASH CONSIDERATION. HOWEVER, REGARDLESS
    OF THE NUMBER OF UNILAB SHARES THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF CASH ELECTIONS, EACH
    UNILAB STOCKHOLDER ELECTING TO RECEIVE CASH IN EXCHANGE FOR ALL OF HIS OR
    HER UNILAB SHARES WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE CASH FOR AT LEAST 30% OF SUCH
    STOCKHOLDER'S UNILAB SHARES.

    For a more detailed description of the proration procedure, see "The
    Offer -- Basic Terms".

Q:  HOW WAS THE EXCHANGE RATIO OF 0.3256 OF A QUEST DIAGNOSTICS SHARE FOR EACH
    UNILAB SHARE DETERMINED?

A:  This ratio was determined by dividing $26.50 by the average closing trading
    price of a Quest Diagnostics share on the New York Stock Exchange for the
    five trading days ended March 28, 2002.

Q:  WHAT EFFECT WILL CHANGES TO THE PRICE OF QUEST DIAGNOSTICS SHARES HAVE ON
    WHAT I RECEIVE IN THE OFFER OR THE MERGER?

A:  Because the number of Quest Diagnostics shares that you will receive in the
    offer or the merger is fixed at 0.3256, the price that you receive for the
    Quest Diagnostics shares if you should decide to sell them after receipt

                                        iv

    will vary depending on their trading price at that time. For example, on
    April 2, 2002, the date of the announcement of the transaction, 0.3256 of a
    Quest Diagnostics share would have been worth $26.96, based on the closing
    price for each Quest Diagnostics share of $82.79 on April 1, and on May 15,
    2002, 0.3256 of a Quest Diagnostics share would have been worth $29.58 based
    on the closing price of $90.86 for each Quest Diagnostics share on May 14.
    There can be no assurance as to what price the Quest Diagnostics shares will
    trade at the time of the expiration of the offer or the closing of the
    merger.

Q:  WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO MY UNILAB SHARES IF I DO NOT EXCHANGE THEM IN THE OFFER?

A:  If you decide not to tender your Unilab shares in the offer and the merger
    occurs, you will receive 0.3256 of a Quest Diagnostics share in exchange for
    each Unilab share that you own. This is the same consideration that you
    would have received had you tendered your shares in the offer and either
    made no election as to the form of consideration you wished to receive or
    elected to receive Quest Diagnostics shares. NOTWITHSTANDING THE AMOUNT, IF
    ANY, OF CASH PAID IN THE OFFER, YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE ANY CASH CONSIDERATION
    IN EXCHANGE FOR YOUR UNILAB SHARES IN THE MERGER (EXCEPT FOR CASH, IF ANY,
    THAT IS PAID IN LIEU OF FRACTIONAL QUEST DIAGNOSTICS SHARES OR FOLLOWING THE
    EXERCISE OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS, IF APPLICABLE TO THE MERGER).

Q:  WILL I RECEIVE ANY FRACTIONAL QUEST DIAGNOSTICS SHARES IN THE OFFER OR THE
    MERGER?

A:  You will not receive any fractional Quest Diagnostics shares in the offer or
    the merger. Instead, you will receive cash in an amount equal to the then
    market value of any fractional shares you would otherwise have been entitled
    to receive.

Q:  HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO COMPLETE THE OFFER AND THE MERGER?

A:  We hope to complete the offer by Monday, June 17, 2002, the initial
    scheduled expiration date. However, we may decide, or be required, to extend
    the offer if certain conditions of the offer have not been satisfied by the
    initial scheduled expiration date. We expect to complete the merger shortly
    after successful completion of the offer or, if Unilab stockholder approval
    is required, shortly after such approval is obtained either at a special
    meeting of the Unilab stockholders called for that purpose or following the
    receipt of the requisite approval of Unilab stockholders acting by written
    consent. If the conditions to the offer are satisfied, including the minimum
    tender condition, Purchaser will have sufficient votes to adopt the merger
    agreement without the need for any other Unilab stockholders to vote in
    favor of such adoption.

Q:  WILL I HAVE TO PAY ANY FEES OR COMMISSIONS?

A:  If you are the record owner of Unilab shares and you tender your Unilab
    shares directly to the offer exchange agent, you will not have to pay
    brokerage fees or incur similar expenses. If you own your Unilab shares
    through a broker or other nominee, and your broker tenders the Unilab shares
    on your behalf, your broker may charge you a fee for doing so. You should
    consult your broker or nominee to determine whether any charges will apply.

Q:  WHAT DOES UNILAB'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS THINK OF THE OFFER AND THE MERGER?

A:  Unilab's board of directors has determined that the merger agreement and the
    transactions contemplated thereby, including the offer and the merger, are
    fair to and in the best interests of Unilab and Unilab's stockholders, and
    recommends that Unilab's stockholders accept the offer and, if applicable,
    adopt the merger agreement. Information about the recommendation of Unilab's
    board of directors is more fully set forth in Unilab's Solicitation/
    Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, which is being mailed to
    Unilab's stockholders together with this prospectus.

Q:  HAVE ANY UNILAB STOCKHOLDERS AGREED TO TENDER THEIR SHARES?

A:  Yes. Pursuant to an agreement dated April 2, 2002, Kelso Investment
    Associates VI, L.P. and KEP VI, LLC, which on such date collectively owned
    approximately 37.0% of the outstanding Unilab shares on a fully diluted
    basis and 41.2% of the outstanding
                                        v

Unilab shares on a non-fully diluted basis, have agreed to tender and not
withdraw all of their Unilab shares in the offer. In addition to agreeing to
tender and not withdraw their Unilab shares, each of these stockholders have
     agreed to vote their shares against any competing transaction and, if the
     merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, to sell their
     Unilab shares to us. For more information about this agreement, see "The
     Stockholders Agreement" on page 71.

Q:  WHAT PERCENTAGE OF QUEST DIAGNOSTICS SHARES WILL UNILAB STOCKHOLDERS OWN
    AFTER THE OFFER?

A:  If all Unilab stock options are exercised prior to the consummation of the
    offer, and if all Unilab stockholders elect to receive Quest Diagnostics
    shares in the offer, then former Unilab stockholders would own approximately
    11.1% of the outstanding Quest Diagnostics shares after the offer, based
    upon the number of Unilab shares and Quest Diagnostics shares outstanding on
    May 14, 2002.

    If no Unilab stock options are exercised between the date of this prospectus
    and prior to the consummation of the offer, and if Unilab stockholders
    receive 70% of the offer consideration in the form of Quest Diagnostics
    shares, then former Unilab stockholders would own approximately 7.3% of the
    outstanding Quest Diagnostics shares after the offer, based upon the number
    of Unilab shares and Quest Diagnostics shares outstanding on May 14, 2002.

Q:  WHAT ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER?

A:  The offer is subject to several significant conditions, including:

     - 50.1% of the outstanding Unilab shares, on a fully diluted basis, having
       been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, which we refer to as
       the minimum tender condition,

     - all waiting periods under applicable antitrust laws having expired or
       been terminated,

     - the registration statement, of which this prospectus is a part, having
       been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or
       SEC, and not being subject to any stop order or proceedings seeking a
       stop order,

     - the Quest Diagnostics shares to be issued in the offer and the merger
       having been approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, subject
       to official notice of issuance,

     - Unilab and/or Quest Diagnostics not having failed to perform in any
       material respect any of their respective obligations, covenants or
       agreements contained in the merger agreement, and

     - Unilab and/or Quest Diagnostics not having breached any of their
       respective representations or warranties contained in the merger
       agreement, except for breaches that have not resulted in or are not
       reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect on Unilab and
       its subsidiary or Quest Diagnostics and its subsidiaries, as the case may
       be, in each case taken as a whole.

     These conditions and other conditions to the offer are discussed in this
     prospectus under "The Offer -- Conditions to the Offer" beginning on page
     46.

Q:  HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO TENDER IN THE OFFER?

A:  You will have at least until 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Monday,
    June 17, 2002, to decide whether to tender your Unilab shares in the offer.
    If you cannot deliver everything that is required in order to make a valid
    tender by that time, you may be able to use a guaranteed delivery procedure
    which is described under "The Offer -- Procedure for Tendering and
    Electing".

Q:  CAN THE OFFER BE EXTENDED, AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES?

A:  Yes. Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, in certain circumstances,
    we will be obligated to extend the offer in increments of not more than ten
    business days each up to September 30, 2002, if the conditions to the offer
    have not been satisfied or waived prior to such time. The offer may also be
    extended at our option for a period of not more than ten business days if
    all of the
                                        vi

    conditions to the offer have been satisfied or waived, but the number of
    Unilab shares tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the offer equals more
    than 80%, but less than 90%, of the outstanding Unilab shares on a fully
    diluted basis. For a detailed description of the circumstances under which
    the offer may or must be extended, see "The Offer -- Extension, Termination
    and Amendment".

Q:  HOW WILL I BE NOTIFIED IF THE OFFER IS EXTENDED?

A:  If we extend the offer, we will inform the offer exchange agent of that
    fact, and will issue a press release giving the new expiration date no later
    than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day after the day on which the
    offer was previously scheduled to expire. See "The Offer -- Extension,
    Termination and Amendment".

Q:  HOW DO I ACCEPT THE OFFER?

A:  To tender your Unilab shares, you should do the following:

     - if you hold Unilab shares in your own name, complete and sign the
       enclosed letter of election and transmittal and return it with your
       Unilab share certificates to Computershare Trust Company of New York, the
       offer exchange agent, at the appropriate address specified on the back
       cover page of this prospectus before the expiration date of the offer,

     - if you hold your Unilab shares in "street name" through a broker,
       instruct your broker as to your election and to tender your Unilab shares
       before the expiration date, or

     - if your Unilab share certificates are not immediately available or if you
       cannot deliver your Unilab share certificates and any other required
       documents to the offer exchange agent prior to the expiration of the
       offer, or you cannot complete the procedure for delivery by book-entry
       transfer on a timely basis, you may still tender your Unilab shares if
       you comply with the guaranteed delivery procedures described under "The
       Offer -- Procedure for Tendering and Electing".

Q:  HOW DO I MAKE MY ELECTION?

A:  You may elect to receive Quest Diagnostics shares or cash for each of your
    Unilab shares in the offer by indicating your preference on the letter of
    election and transmittal. You do not have to elect to exchange all of your
    Unilab shares into one form of consideration or the other. Instead, you may
    elect to receive the cash consideration in exchange for some of your Unilab
    shares, and you may elect to receive Quest Diagnostics shares in exchange
    for other of your Unilab shares.

    Any election that you make to receive the cash consideration will be subject
    to the proration procedure described in this prospectus.

    If you validly tender your Unilab shares but fail to properly make an
    election, you will be deemed to have elected to receive Quest Diagnostics
    shares and you will receive 0.3256 of a Quest Diagnostics share for each
    Unilab share that you validly tender for exchange. If you decide to change
    your election after you have tendered your Unilab shares, you must first
    withdraw your tendered shares and then re-tender your Unilab shares prior to
    the expiration of the offer with a new letter of election and transmittal
    that indicates your revised election. See "The Offer -- Withdrawal Rights
    and Change of Election".

Q:  UNTIL WHAT TIME CAN I WITHDRAW PREVIOUSLY TENDERED SHARES?

A:  You may withdraw previously tendered Unilab shares any time prior to the
    expiration of the offer, and, unless we have accepted Unilab shares pursuant
    to the offer, you may also withdraw any tendered Unilab shares at any time
    after July 13, 2002 if the offer is still pending. Once we have accepted
    Unilab shares for exchange pursuant to the offer, all tenders become
    irrevocable. See "The Offer -- Withdrawal Rights and Change of Election".

Q:  HOW DO I WITHDRAW PREVIOUSLY TENDERED SHARES?

A:  To withdraw previously tendered Unilab shares, you must deliver a written or
    facsimile notice of withdrawal with the required

                                       vii

information to the offer exchange agent while you still have the right to
withdraw. If you tendered Unilab shares by giving instructions to a broker or
bank, you must instruct the broker or bank to arrange for the withdrawal of your
     Unilab shares. See "The Offer -- Withdrawal Rights and Change of Election".

Q:  IF A MAJORITY OF THE UNILAB SHARES ARE TENDERED AND ACCEPTED FOR EXCHANGE,
    WILL UNILAB CONTINUE AS A PUBLIC COMPANY?

A:  If at least a majority of the outstanding Unilab shares on a fully diluted
    basis are tendered and accepted for exchange, Quest Diagnostics will effect
    the merger if all of the conditions to the merger contained in the merger
    agreement have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived by Quest
    Diagnostics. If the merger takes place, Unilab will no longer be publicly
    owned. Even if the merger does not take place, if we purchase all the
    tendered Unilab shares, there may be so few remaining Unilab stockholders
    and publicly held Unilab shares that Unilab shares will no longer be
    eligible to be traded through the Nasdaq National Market or on a securities
    exchange. In that event, there may not be a public trading market for Unilab
    shares, and Unilab may cease making filings with the SEC or otherwise cease
    being required to comply with the SEC rules relating to publicly held
    companies.

Q:  AM I ENTITLED TO APPRAISAL RIGHTS?

A:  Unilab stockholders do not have appraisal rights in connection with the
    offer.

    If we acquire less than 90% of the outstanding Unilab shares in the offer,
    we intend to effect a long-form merger to acquire the balance of the Unilab
    shares not exchanged in the offer. Unilab stockholders that do not validly
    tender their Unilab shares in the offer will not have appraisal rights in
    connection with the long-form merger.

    However, if we acquire 90% or more of the outstanding Unilab shares in the
    offer, we intend to effect a short-form merger to acquire the balance of the
    Unilab shares not exchanged in the offer. Holders of Unilab shares that do
    not validly tender their shares in the offer will have the right under
    Delaware law to dissent and demand appraisal of their Unilab shares in
    connection with the short-form merger.

     For more information on appraisal rights, see "The Offer -- Appraisal
     Rights" on page 46.

Q:  WILL I BE TAXED ON THE QUEST DIAGNOSTICS SHARES AND CASH THAT I RECEIVE?

A:  Assuming the merger is completed as planned, the offer and the merger are
    expected to be treated together as a tax-free "reorganization" for United
    States federal income tax purposes. As a result, if you exchange all of your
    Unilab shares for Quest Diagnostics shares in the offer and/or the merger,
    you will not recognize any gain or loss except with respect to cash received
    in lieu of fractional Quest Diagnostics shares. If you exchange all of your
    Unilab shares for cash in the offer, you generally will recognize gain or
    loss measured by the difference between the aggregate amount of cash
    received for your Unilab shares and your tax basis in those Unilab shares.
    If you exchange some of your Unilab shares for Quest Diagnostics shares in
    the offer and/or the merger and you exchange some of your Unilab shares for
    cash in the offer, you will recognize gain, but not loss, equal to the
    lesser of (1) the amount of cash you received in the offer and (2) an amount
    equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the sum of the amount of cash you
    received in the offer and the fair market value of the Quest Diagnostics
    shares you received in the offer and/or the merger over (b) the aggregate
    tax basis in all of your Unilab shares.

    The tax consequences described in the preceding paragraph assume that the
    merger will be completed as planned as a tax-free "forward merger" or
    tax-free "reverse merger". Under certain limited conditions described
    herein, however, the merger may be completed as a taxable "reverse merger",
    in which case you will recognize all of your gain or loss on the disposition
    of your Unilab shares in the offer and/or the reverse merger, regardless of
    whether you exchange your Unilab shares for Quest Diagnostics shares or
    cash.

                                       viii

    You are urged to carefully read the discussion under "The Offer -- Certain
    Federal Income Tax Consequences" beginning on page 42, and to consult your
    tax advisor on the consequences of participation in the offer or the merger.

Q:  IS QUEST DIAGNOSTICS' FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE RELEVANT TO MY DECISION TO
    TENDER MY UNILAB SHARES IN THE OFFER?

A:  Yes. If you tender Unilab shares in the offer you may become a stockholder
    of Quest Diagnostics, either because you elect to receive Quest Diagnostics
    shares in exchange for your Unilab shares, or because you received a pro
    rated combination of cash and Quest Diagnostics shares after electing to
    receive the cash consideration in exchange for your Unilab shares. You
    should therefore consider our financial performance before you decide to
    tender your Unilab shares in the offer. In considering Quest Diagnostics'
    financial performance, you should review the pro forma financial information
    contained in this prospectus as well as the documents incorporated by
    reference in this prospectus, including, among others, Quest Diagnostics'
    Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quest Diagnostics' Quarterly Report on Form
    10-Q, because they contain detailed business, financial and other
    information about us. See "Where You Can Find More Information About Quest
    Diagnostics and Unilab" on page 107.

Q:  DO THE STATEMENTS ON THE COVER PAGE REGARDING THIS PROSPECTUS BEING SUBJECT
    TO CHANGE AND THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SEC NOT YET BEING
    EFFECTIVE MEAN THAT THE OFFER HAS NOT COMMENCED?

A:  No. The offer has commenced and the effectiveness of the registration
    statement is not necessary for you to tender Unilab shares. The SEC rules
    permit exchange offers to begin before the related registration statement
    has become effective, although we cannot accept for exchange any Unilab
    shares tendered in the offer until the SEC has declared the May 15, 2002
    registration statement effective and the other conditions to the offer have
    been satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived.

Q:  WHERE CAN I FIND OUT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT QUEST DIAGNOSTICS AND UNILAB?

A:  You can find out information about Quest Diagnostics and Unilab from various
    sources described under "Additional Information" on page iii and under
    "Where You Can Find More Information about Quest Diagnostics and Unilab"
    beginning on page 107.

Q:  WHO CAN I CALL WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT THE OFFER?

A:  You can contact our information agent, Georgeson Shareholder Communications
    Inc., collect at 212-440-9800 or toll-free at 1-866-318-0509, or the dealer
    manager, Merrill Lynch & Co., toll-free at 1-866-276-1462.

     Unilab is the largest independent clinical laboratory testing company in
California and one of the largest in the nation, with revenues of $390 million
during 2001. Unilab offers a broad range of clinical laboratory testing services
used by physicians and other healthcare providers in the detection, diagnosis,
evaluation, monitoring and treatment of diseases and other medical conditions.

THE OFFER (PAGE 35)

  Summary of the Offer

     We have entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Unilab, dated as
of April 2, 2002, and amended as of May 13, 2002, which we refer to as the
merger agreement. Pursuant to the merger agreement, we are offering, through
Purchaser, to exchange Quest Diagnostics shares or cash for each outstanding
Unilab share. In the offer, Unilab stockholders may elect to receive either
0.3256 of a Quest Diagnostics share, or $26.50 in cash, for each Unilab share
that is validly tendered and not withdrawn. However, the aggregate amount of
cash that Unilab stockholders may receive in the offer is subject to a pro rata
reduction because there is a limit to the number of Unilab shares that will be
exchanged for cash as described in the following paragraph. The ratio of 0.3256
of a Quest Diagnostics share for each Unilab share was determined by dividing
$26.50 by the average closing trading price of a Quest Diagnostics share on the
New York Stock Exchange for the five trading days ended March 28, 2002.

     In the offer, not more than 30% of the number of Unilab shares outstanding
immediately prior to the expiration of the offer can be exchanged for cash. As a
result, if the holders of more than such number of Unilab shares elect to
receive cash in exchange for all their Unilab shares, then all such cash
electing Unilab shares will be exchanged on a pro rata basis for a combination
of cash and Quest Diagnostics shares so that the aggregate number of Unilab
shares exchanged for cash does not exceed 30% of the number of Unilab shares
outstanding immediately prior to the expiration of the offer.

     Because there is a limit on the number of Unilab shares that will be
exchanged for cash in the offer, there can be no assurance that you will receive
100% of the offer consideration in the form of cash for each Unilab share that
you properly elect to exchange for the cash consideration. Instead, depending
upon the number of Unilab shares that are the subject of proper cash elections,
you may receive a pro rated combination of cash and Quest Diagnostics shares for
the Unilab shares that you elect to exchange for cash. However, regardless of
the number of Unilab shares that are the subject of cash elections, each Unilab
stockholder electing to receive cash in exchange for all of his or her Unilab
shares will be entitled to receive cash for at least 30% of such stockholder's
Unilab shares. For a more detailed description of the proration procedure, see
"The Offer -- Basic Terms".

     An election to receive Quest Diagnostics shares for all your Unilab shares
will not be subject to proration.

     You will not receive any fractional Quest Diagnostics shares in the offer.
Instead, you will receive cash in an amount equal to the then market value of
any fractional shares you would otherwise have been entitled to receive.

     The term "expiration date" means 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on
Monday, June 17, 2002, unless we extend the period of time during which this
offer is open, in which case the term "expiration date" means the latest time
and date on which the offer, as so extended, expires.

  Conditions to the Offer

     Our obligation to exchange Quest Diagnostics shares or cash for Unilab
shares is subject to several conditions referred to under "The
Offer -- Conditions to the Offer" beginning on page 46, including conditions
that require that there be validly tendered into the offer and not withdrawn at
least 50.1% of the aggregate number of outstanding Unilab shares on a fully
diluted basis, which we refer to as the minimum tender condition, and receipt of
all required regulatory approvals.

  Timing of the Offer

     Our offer is currently scheduled to expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City
time, on Monday, June 17, 2002. However, we may decide, or be required, to
extend our offer from time to time as necessary until September 30, 2002 if
certain conditions to the offer have not been satisfied or waived prior to such
time. See "The Offer -- Extension, Termination and Amendment" beginning on page
36.

  Extension, Termination and Amendment

     The merger agreement provides that, unless Unilab otherwise agrees, we
must, and, in the case of the third bullet below, we have the option to, extend
the offer in the following circumstances for one or more periods not in excess
of ten business days each:

     - beyond the initial scheduled expiration date, until September 30, 2002,
       if, at the scheduled or extended expiration date of the offer, any of the
       conditions to the offer have not been satisfied or waived, until all of
       these conditions are satisfied or waived. However, we are not obligated
       to extend the offer pursuant to this provision of the merger agreement,
       but we may elect to do so in accordance with the terms of the merger
       agreement, if the minimum tender condition is not satisfied at the time
       that the extension would otherwise be required as long as certain
       specified conditions to the offer have been satisfied, which conditions
       are expressly set forth in the merger agreement, and we have publicly
       announced this fact and our intention not to extend the offer at least
       two business days prior to the date that the extension would otherwise
       have been required,

     - for any period required by any SEC rule, regulation or position or any
       period required by applicable law, or

     - for an aggregate period of not more than ten business days beyond the
       latest applicable date that would otherwise be permitted as described in
       the first and second bullets above, if, as of the expiration date, all of
       the conditions to the offer have been satisfied or waived, but the number
       of Unilab shares validly tendered and not withdrawn equals more than 80%,
       but less than 90%, of the outstanding Unilab shares on a fully diluted
       basis. However, if we elect to extend the expiration date pursuant to
       this provision of the merger agreement, we will be deemed to have
       irrevocably waived all of the conditions to the offer set forth in detail
       under the caption "The Offer -- Conditions to the Offer". Except as
       described in this provision of the merger agreement, we are not permitted
       to extend the offer without the prior written consent of Unilab at the
       time that all conditions to the offer have been satisfied or waived.

     Subject to the SEC's applicable rules and regulations and the terms of the
merger agreement, we also reserve the right to waive any of the conditions to
the offer and to make any change in the terms of or conditions to the offer.
However, without Unilab's consent, we cannot:

     - decrease the consideration payable in the offer,

     - change the form of consideration to be paid in the offer to a form other
       than cash or Quest Diagnostics shares,

     - decrease the aggregate amount of cash available in the offer or change
       the relative amount of cash and Quest Diagnostics shares available in the
       offer,

     - reduce the number of Unilab shares to be purchased in the offer,

     - impose conditions to the offer in addition to those set forth in the
       merger agreement,

     - modify or waive the minimum tender condition,

     - except pursuant to the merger agreement, change the expiration date, or

     - make any other change that is adverse to the Unilab stockholders or to
       stockholders that have elected a particular form of consideration in the
       offer.

     We will follow any extension, termination, amendment or delay, as promptly
as practicable, with a public announcement. Any announcement of an extension
will be issued no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the next business
day after the previously scheduled expiration date. Subject to applicable law,
including Rules 14d-4(d), 14d-6(c) and 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, which we refer to as the Exchange Act, which require that any material
change in the information published, sent or given to the stockholders in
connection with the offer be promptly sent to stockholders in a manner
reasonably designed to inform stockholders of such change, and without limiting
the manner in which we may choose to make any public announcement, we assume no
obligation to publish, advertise or otherwise communicate any such

public announcement other than by making a release to the Dow Jones News Service
or the PR Newswire Association, Inc. During any such extension of the offer, all
Unilab shares previously tendered and not properly withdrawn will remain subject
to the offer, subject to your right to withdraw your Unilab shares.

 Exchange of Unilab Shares; Delivery of Quest Diagnostics Shares and Cash

     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of our offer, including, if
the offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of any extension or
amendment, we will accept for exchange, and will exchange, Unilab shares validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn as promptly as practicable after the
expiration date. The offer exchange agent will deliver, or cause to be
delivered, cash and Quest Diagnostics shares in exchange for Unilab shares
pursuant to the offer as soon as practicable after it receives notice of our
acceptance of the validly tendered Unilab shares.

  Withdrawal Rights

     Unilab shares tendered pursuant to the offer may be withdrawn at any time
prior to the expiration date of the offer, and, unless we have previously
accepted and paid for them pursuant to the offer, may also be withdrawn at any
time after July 13, 2002. Once we have accepted Unilab shares for exchange
pursuant to the offer, all tenders not previously withdrawn become irrevocable.

  Procedure for Tendering Shares

     For you to validly tender Unilab shares pursuant to our offer, you must,

     - prior to the expiration of the offer, deliver to the offer exchange agent
       at one of its addresses set forth on the back cover of the prospectus a
       properly completed and duly executed letter of election and transmittal,
       or a manually signed facsimile of that document, together with any
       required signature guarantees, and any other required documents, and the
       certificates representing the tendered Unilab shares,

     - prior to the expiration of the offer, deliver to the offer exchange agent
       at one of such addresses either (a) a properly completed and duly
       executed letter of election and transmittal, or a manually signed
       facsimile of that document, together with any required signature
       guarantees, or (b) an agent's message, which is explained below, in each
       case with any other required documents, and transfer the Unilab shares
       tendered pursuant to the procedures for book-entry transfer set forth in
       the section of the prospectus entitled "The Offer -- Procedure for
       Tendering and Electing", or

     - comply with the guaranteed delivery procedures described in "The
       Offer -- Procedure for Tendering and Electing -- Guaranteed Delivery".

  Election Procedure

     In exchange for each of your Unilab shares, you may elect to receive cash
or Quest Diagnostics shares, subject, in the case of an election to receive
cash, to the proration procedure described in this prospectus, by indicating
your preference on the letter of election and transmittal. You are not required
to exchange all of your Unilab shares into one form of consideration or the
other. Instead, if you own more than one Unilab share, you may elect to receive
the cash consideration in exchange for some of your Unilab shares and you may
elect to receive Quest Diagnostics shares in exchange for other of your Unilab
shares. If you validly tender your Unilab shares, but fail to properly make an
election, you will be deemed to have elected to receive Quest Diagnostics shares
and you will receive 0.3256 of a Quest Diagnostics share for each Unilab share
that you tender for exchange in the offer. If you decide to change your election
after you have tendered your Unilab shares, you must first withdraw your
tendered shares and then re-tender your shares with a new letter of election and
transmittal that indicates your revised election prior to the expiration of the
offer.

REASONS FOR THE OFFER (PAGE 29)

     We believe the proposed transaction represents a compelling opportunity to
enhance value for both Quest Diagnostics and Unilab stockholders. The boards of
directors of Quest Diagnostics and Unilab have each separately approved the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
including the offer and the merger. For a list of the factors considered by each
board of directors in making its determination, please see "Reasons for the
Offer" on page 29 and Unilab's Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9, which accompanies the prospectus.

RISK FACTORS (PAGE 9)

     In deciding whether to tender your Unilab shares pursuant to the offer, you
should read carefully this prospectus, the accompanying
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 of Unilab and the other
documents to which we refer you. You should also carefully consider the
following factors:

     Risk Factors Relating to the Offer and the Merger

     - Quest Diagnostics shares to be received by Unilab stockholders in the
       offer and the merger will fluctuate in value and, accordingly, at the
       time you receive such shares in the offer or the merger, may be worth
       less than or more than the equivalent of the $26.50 in cash you would
       have received if you had elected and received cash for your Unilab
       shares,

     - the need for governmental approvals may delay consummation of the offer
       and the merger, which, among other things, may affect the trading prices
       of Quest Diagnostics shares and Unilab shares and could result in Unilab
       stockholders receiving Quest Diagnostics shares with a market value lower
       than expected,

     - if the Internal Revenue Service successfully challenged the treatment of
       the transaction as a tax-free reorganization or if the merger were
       effected as a taxable reverse merger, the transaction would be fully
       taxable for you; and

     - the acceptance of Unilab shares in the offer may reduce their liquidity
       and market value during the period prior to the consummation of the
       merger, may result in their delisting from the Nasdaq National Market and
       may cause the Unilab shares to lose their status as "margin securities".

     Risks Relating to Ownership of Quest Diagnostics Shares

     - integration of operations may be difficult and, if unsuccessfully
       executed, may have a material adverse impact on Quest Diagnostics'
       business,

     - the acquisitions of AML and Unilab may not produce the anticipated
       benefits,

     - Quest Diagnostics may not be able to achieve the anticipated benefits of
       its Six Sigma and Standardization initiatives,

     - failure to timely or accurately bill for services could have a material
       adverse impact on Quest Diagnostics' net revenues and bad debt expense,

     - failure in the information technology systems of Quest Diagnostics,
       including failures resulting from systems conversions, could
       significantly increase turnaround time and otherwise disrupt Quest
       Diagnostics' operations, which could reduce its customer base and result
       in lost net revenues,

     - the development of new, more cost-effective tests that can be performed
       by physicians in their offices or by patients could negatively impact
       Quest Diagnostics' testing volume and net revenues,

     - FDA regulation of laboratory-developed genetic testing could lead to
       increased cost and delay in introducing new genetic tests,

     - efforts by third party payers, including the government, to reduce
       utilization and pricing could have a material adverse impact on Quest
       Diagnostics' net revenues and profitability,

     - failure to provide a higher quality of service than that of its
       competitors could have a material adverse impact on Quest Diagnostics'
       net revenues and profitability,

     - if Quest Diagnostics fails to comply with extensive laws and regulations,
       it could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant
       changes to its operations,

     - the final privacy regulations that will take effect in 2003 and proposed
       federal security regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and
       Accountability Act of 1996 may increase Quest Diagnostics' costs,

     - Quest Diagnostics' tests and business processes may infringe on the
       intellectual property rights of others, which could cause Quest
       Diagnostics to engage in costly litigation, pay substantial damages or
       prohibit it from selling certain of its tests,

     - professional liability litigation could have an adverse financial impact
       on Quest Diagnostics and an adverse impact on Quest Diagnostics' client
       base and reputation,

     - substantial debt may impair the financial and operating flexibility of
       Quest Diagnostics,

     - future sales of Quest Diagnostics shares could adversely affect the price
       of Quest Diagnostics shares, and

     - certain provisions of its charter, by-laws and Delaware law may delay or
       prevent a change of control of Quest Diagnostics.

THE MERGER (PAGE 55)

     We intend, as promptly as practicable after completion of the offer, to
seek to merge Unilab with Purchaser. Upon completion of the merger, each Unilab
share that has not been exchanged or accepted for exchange in the offer will be
converted into 0.3256 of a Quest Diagnostics share. NOTWITHSTANDING THE AMOUNT,
IF ANY, OF CASH PAID IN THE OFFER, STOCKHOLDERS WHO DO NOT TENDER THEIR UNILAB
SHARES IN THE OFFER WILL NOT RECEIVE ANY CASH CONSIDERATION IN EXCHANGE FOR
THEIR UNILAB SHARES IN THE MERGER (EXCEPT FOR CASH, IF ANY, THAT IS PAID IN LIEU
OF FRACTIONAL QUEST DIAGNOSTICS SHARES AND FOLLOWING THE EXERCISE OF APPRAISAL
RIGHTS, IF AVAILABLE IN THE MERGER).

     If, after completing the offer, we have acquired between 50.1% and 90% of
the outstanding Unilab shares, we will effect a long-form merger as permitted
under Delaware law to acquire the balance of the outstanding Unilab shares. If,
after completing the offer, we have acquired 90% or more of the outstanding
Unilab shares, we will effect a short-form merger as permitted under Delaware
law to acquire the balance of the outstanding Unilab shares without having a
vote of Unilab stockholders.

THE STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT (PAGE 71)

     Concurrently with entering into the merger agreement, we entered into a
stockholders agreement with Kelso Investment Associates VI, L.P. and KEP VI,
LLC, which we refer to as Kelso, under which they have agreed, among other
things, to validly tender and not withdraw their Unilab shares into the offer,
to vote their Unilab shares against any transaction that would compete with this
one, and to sell their Unilab shares to us, at our discretion, for the same
consideration they would have received in the offer, if the merger agreement is
terminated under certain circumstances. On April 2, 2002, these stockholders
collectively owned either beneficially or of record 13,841,178 Unilab shares,
constituting approximately 37% of the Unilab shares outstanding at such time on
a fully diluted basis and 41.2% of the Unilab shares outstanding at such time on
a non-fully diluted basis. For a more detailed description of the terms and
conditions of the stockholders agreement, see page 71, "The Stockholders
Agreement".

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS (PAGE 74)

     In considering the recommendation of the Unilab board of directors to
accept the offer and, if applicable, adopt the merger agreement, Unilab
stockholders should be aware that some members of the Unilab board of

directors and Unilab management may have interests in the transactions that will
be in addition to, or different from, interests of other Unilab stockholders.
For example, certain Unilab executives have entered into employment agreements
with Quest Diagnostics and Unilab under which they will continue employment with
Quest Diagnostics and Unilab following the transaction, and the investment
banking firm of which a member of Unilab's board of directors is a partner will
receive a fee upon the closing of the transaction. The employment agreements
with certain Unilab executives provide that Quest Diagnostics will grant such
persons stock options to purchase Quest Diagnostics shares.

     Generally, all outstanding unvested service stock options and most
outstanding unvested performance stock options to purchase Unilab shares will
become vested at the effective time of the merger and all unexercised stock
options will become stock options to purchase Quest Diagnostics shares, with
appropriate adjustments to be made to the number of shares and the exercise
price under such stock options based on the exchange ratio.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS (PAGE 46)

     The offer does not entitle you to appraisal rights. However, the merger may
entitle you to appraisal rights with respect to your Unilab shares. For a
detailed description of the circumstances in which appraisal rights will be
available in the merger, see "The Offer -- Appraisal Rights".

CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES (PAGE 42)

     Assuming the merger is completed as planned, the offer and the merger are
expected to be treated together as a tax-free "reorganization" for United States
federal income tax purposes. As a result, if you exchange all of your Unilab
shares for Quest Diagnostics shares in the offer and/or the merger, you will not
recognize any gain or loss except with respect to cash received in lieu of
fractional Quest Diagnostics shares. If you exchange all of your Unilab shares
for cash in the offer, you generally will recognize gain or loss measured by the
difference between the aggregate amount of cash received for your Unilab shares
and your tax basis in those Unilab shares. If you exchange some of your Unilab
shares for Quest Diagnostics shares in the offer and/or the merger and you
exchange some of your Unilab shares for cash in the offer, you will recognize
gain, but not loss, equal to the lesser of (1) the amount of cash you received
in the offer and (2) an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the sum of
the amount of cash you received in the offer and the fair market value of the
Quest Diagnostics shares you received in the offer and/or the merger over (b)
the aggregate tax basis in all your Unilab shares.

     The tax consequences described in the preceding paragraph assume that
Unilab will be merged with and into Purchaser in a tax-free "forward merger" or
that Purchaser will be merged with and into Unilab in a tax-free "reverse
merger". Under certain limited conditions described herein, however, Purchaser
may, at our discretion, be merged with and into Unilab in a taxable "reverse
merger". In this case, instead of the tax consequences described in the
preceding paragraph, you will recognize all of your gain or loss on the
disposition of your Unilab shares in the offer and/or the reverse merger,
regardless of whether you exchange your Unilab shares for Quest Diagnostics
shares or cash.

     THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO ALL
UNILAB STOCKHOLDERS, INCLUDING CERTAIN UNILAB STOCKHOLDERS SPECIFICALLY REFERRED
TO ON PAGE 42. YOUR TAX CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING ANY STATE, LOCAL AND NON-UNITED
STATES TAX CONSEQUENCES, WILL DEPEND ON YOUR OWN SITUATION. YOU SHOULD CONSULT
YOUR TAX ADVISOR TO DETERMINE THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE OFFER AND
MERGER TO YOU.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE OFFER AND THE MERGER (PAGE 52)

     Quest Diagnostics will account for the merger as a purchase for financial
reporting purposes.

COMPARATIVE PER SHARE MARKET PRICE INFORMATION (PAGE 79)

     Quest Diagnostics shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under
the symbol "DGX". Unilab shares trade on the Nasdaq National Market under the
symbol "ULAB".

     On April 1, 2002, the last full trading day before the public announcement
of the merger agreement, the closing stock price of Quest Diagnostics shares on
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transaction Tape was $82.79 and the
closing stock price of Unilab shares on the Nasdaq National Market was $25.00,
and on May 14, 2002, the last full trading day prior to the printing of this
prospectus, the closing stock price of Quest Diagnostics shares on the New York
Stock Exchange Composite Transaction Tape was $90.86 and the closing stock price
of Unilab shares on the Nasdaq National Market was $29.33. Unilab stockholders
are urged to obtain current market quotations for Quest Diagnostics and Unilab
shares before deciding whether to tender their Unilab shares in the offer and,
if tendering, before electing the form of offer consideration they wish to
receive.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     In deciding whether to tender your Unilab shares pursuant to the offer, you
should carefully read this prospectus, the accompanying
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 of Unilab and the other
documents to which we refer you. You should also carefully consider the risks
described below before making a decision to tender your Unilab shares. The risks
and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing Quest
Diagnostics. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to Quest
Diagnostics or that it currently deems immaterial may also adversely affect its
business and operations.

RISKS RELATING TO THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

QUEST DIAGNOSTICS SHARES TO BE RECEIVED BY UNILAB STOCKHOLDERS IN THE OFFER AND
THE MERGER WILL FLUCTUATE IN VALUE

     The market price of the Quest Diagnostics shares to be issued in the offer
and the merger may change as a result of changes in our or Unilab's business,
operations or prospects, market assessments of the impact of the offer and the
merger or general market conditions. Although our principal business is similar
to that of Unilab, our results of operations, as well as the market price of
Quest Diagnostics shares, may be affected by factors different from those
affecting Unilab's results of operations and the market price of Unilab shares.
Because the market price of the Quest Diagnostics shares fluctuates, the value
of the Quest Diagnostics shares to be received by Unilab stockholders in the
offer or the merger will depend upon the market price of Quest Diagnostics
shares at the time they are received pursuant to the offer or the merger. There
can be no assurance as to this value. In addition, because the fraction of a
Quest Diagnostics share being offered for each Unilab share is fixed, there is
no limit to the amount by which the value of the consideration that you actually
receive in the offer or the merger could decline from the value of such fraction
of a share on the date of this prospectus. Accordingly, at the time you receive
Quest Diagnostics shares in the offer or the merger, such shares may be worth
less than or more than the equivalent of the $26.50 in cash that you would have
received if you had elected and received cash for your Unilab shares.

THE NEED FOR GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS MAY DELAY CONSUMMATION OF THE OFFER AND THE
MERGER, WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MAY AFFECT THE TRADING PRICES OF QUEST
DIAGNOSTICS SHARES AND UNILAB SHARES AND COULD RESULT IN UNILAB STOCKHOLDERS
RECEIVING QUEST DIAGNOSTICS SHARES WITH A MARKET VALUE LOWER THAN EXPECTED

     The offer is conditioned upon the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
of 1976, as amended, which we refer to as the HSR Act. Delays in the
consummation of the offer and the merger resulting from the failure of the HSR
Act waiting period to expire following the initial 30-day waiting period, among
other things, may cause the trading price of Quest Diagnostics shares to decline
and that could result in Unilab stockholders receiving Quest Diagnostics shares
with a market value lower than expected.

     You are urged to carefully read the discussion under "The
Offer -- Conditions to the Offer" beginning on page 46 and "Regulatory
Approvals" beginning on page 48 for more information.

IF THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGED THE TREATMENT OF THE
TRANSACTION AS A REORGANIZATION OR IF THE MERGER WERE EFFECTED AS A TAXABLE
REVERSE MERGER, THE TRANSACTION WOULD BE FULLY TAXABLE FOR YOU

     We and Unilab have structured the offer and the merger so as to qualify as
a tax-free reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes that
should be tax free to you to the extent that you receive Quest Diagnostics
shares. We believe that the offer and the merger will be so treated if the
minimum tender condition for the offer is satisfied, the merger is completed
promptly after the offer in accordance with the current terms of the merger
agreement and applicable state law and certain other requirements are satisfied.
However, no assurance can be given that the Internal Revenue Service would not
challenge the treatment of the offer and the merger as an integrated transaction
that constitutes such a reorganization for United States federal income tax
purposes. If the Internal Revenue Service successfully challenged the treatment
of the offer and the merger as a reorganization or if the merger were effected
as a taxable reverse merger of Purchaser with and into Unilab, which Quest
Diagnostics can elect at its discretion to effect under certain limited

circumstances, you would recognize all of your gain or loss on the disposition
of your shares in the offer and/or the merger. You are urged to carefully read
the discussion under "The Offer -- Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences"
beginning on page 42, and to consult your tax advisor on the consequences of
participation in the offer and/or the merger.

THE ACCEPTANCE OF UNILAB SHARES IN THE OFFER MAY REDUCE THEIR LIQUIDITY AND
MARKET VALUE DURING THE PERIOD PRIOR TO THE CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER, MAY
RESULT IN THEIR DELISTING FROM THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET AND MAY CAUSE THE
UNILAB SHARES TO LOSE THEIR STATUS AS "MARGIN SECURITIES"

     The acceptance of Unilab shares pursuant to the offer will reduce the
number of holders of Unilab shares that might otherwise trade publicly, and may
therefore reduce the liquidity and market value of the remaining Unilab shares
held by the public during the period prior to the consummation of the merger.
Depending on the number of Unilab shares acquired pursuant to the offer, Unilab
shares may no longer meet the requirements of the Nasdaq National Market for
continued listing. Should that occur, it is possible that Unilab shares would be
traded on other securities exchanges or in the over-the-counter market, and that
price quotations would be reported by those other exchanges or by other sources,
but we can provide no assurances that this will be the case. The Unilab shares
may also no longer constitute "margin securities" for the purposes of the
Federal Reserve Board's margin regulations, in which event the Unilab shares
would be ineligible as collateral for margin loans made by brokers.

RISKS RELATING TO OWNERSHIP OF QUEST DIAGNOSTICS SHARES

     Some of the following factors relate principally to Quest Diagnostics'
business and the industry in which it operates. Other factors relate principally
to an investment in Quest Diagnostics shares. If any of the matters included in
the following risks were to occur, Quest Diagnostics' business, financial
condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially
adversely affected. In such case, all or part of an investment in Quest
Diagnostics shares could be lost.

INTEGRATION OF OPERATIONS MAY BE DIFFICULT AND, IF UNSUCCESSFULLY EXECUTED, MAY
HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON QUEST DIAGNOSTICS' BUSINESS

     On April 1, 2002, Quest Diagnostics acquired American Medical Laboratories,
Incorporated, or AML, which has annual revenues of approximately $300 million
and has principal laboratories in Chantilly, Virginia and in Las Vegas, Nevada.
While Quest Diagnostics is not closing any of AML's principal laboratories, the
process of integrating the operations of both Unilab and AML at the same time
that Quest Diagnostics is standardizing its existing operations, systems and
processes will be difficult and will require the dedication of significant
management resources. Each of these acquisitions involves the integration of
separate companies that have previously operated independently and have
different systems, processes and cultures. The process of combining such
companies may be disruptive to their businesses and may cause an interruption
of, or a loss of momentum in, such businesses as a result of the following
difficulties, among others:

     - loss of key customers or employees;

     - inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies among the
       companies being combined make it more difficult to implement and
       harmonize company-wide financial, accounting, billing, information and
       other systems;

     - failure to maintain the quality of services that such companies have
       historically provided;

     - diversion of management's attention from the day-to-day business of Quest
       Diagnostics as a result of the need to deal with the foregoing
       disruptions and difficulties; and

     - the added costs of dealing with such disruptions.

In addition, because most of Quest Diagnostics' clinical laboratory testing is
performed under arrangements that are terminable at will or on short notice, any
such interruption of or deterioration in its services may result in a customer's
decision to stop using Quest Diagnostics for clinical laboratory testing. We
cannot assure you

that Quest Diagnostics will be able to retain key technical and management
personnel or that Quest Diagnostics will realize the anticipated benefits of the
acquisitions of AML and Unilab, either at all or in a timely manner. As part of
its growth strategy, Quest Diagnostics may in the future acquire additional
clinical laboratories or other healthcare-related businesses.

THE ACQUISITIONS OF UNILAB AND AML MAY NOT PRODUCE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS

     Even if Quest Diagnostics is able to successfully complete the integration
of the operations of AML and Unilab, Quest Diagnostics may not be able to
realize all or any of the benefits that it expects to result from such
integrations, either in monetary terms or in a timely manner. Upon completion of
the integration of the operations of Unilab, which is expected to occur within
two years after closing, the acquisition of Unilab is expected to generate
annual synergies of approximately $30 million. Quest Diagnostics also expects to
generate additional annual synergies of approximately $15 million by the end of
2004 from the integration of AML's operations. However, there can be no
assurance that such synergies will be realized and, if realized at all, in such
amounts.

QUEST DIAGNOSTICS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF ITS SIX
SIGMA AND STANDARDIZATION INITIATIVES

     Quest Diagnostics is implementing a Six Sigma initiative throughout its
organization. Six Sigma is a management approach that requires a thorough
understanding of customer needs and requirements, process discipline, rigorous
tracking and measuring of services, and training of employees in methodologies
so that they can be held accountable for improving results. During the second
half of 2001, Quest Diagnostics began to integrate its Six Sigma initiative with
its initiative to standardize operations, systems and processes across all of
Quest Diagnostics by adopting identified "company best" practices. Quest
Diagnostics has previously announced that it expects that successful
implementation of these initiatives will result in measurable improvements in
customer satisfaction and will generate at least $150 million in annual net
benefits by the end of 2004. We cannot assure you that Quest Diagnostics will be
able to realize the anticipated benefits of its Six Sigma and Standardization
initiatives, either at all or in a timely manner.

FAILURE TO TIMELY OR ACCURATELY BILL FOR SERVICES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE
IMPACT ON QUEST DIAGNOSTICS' NET REVENUES AND BAD DEBT EXPENSE

     Billing for laboratory services is extremely complicated. Quest Diagnostics
provides testing services to a broad range of healthcare providers. Quest
Diagnostics considers a "payer" as the party that pays for the test and a
"customer" as the party who refers tests to it. Depending on the billing
arrangement and applicable law, Quest Diagnostics must bill various payers, such
as patients, insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid, physicians and employer
groups, all of which have different billing requirements. In addition, auditing
for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal
compliance policies and procedures adds further complexity to the billing
process. Among many other factors complicating billing are:

     - pricing differences between Quest Diagnostics' fee schedules and the
       reimbursement rates of the payers;

     - disputes with payers as to which party is responsible for payment; and

     - disparity in coverage and information requirements among various
       carriers.

     Quest Diagnostics believes that most of its bad debt expense, which was
6.0% of its net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001, is the result of
several non credit-related issues, primarily missing or incorrect billing
information on requisitions received from healthcare providers. In general, in
order not to compromise patient care, Quest Diagnostics performs the requested
tests and reports test results regardless of whether the billing information is
incorrect or missing. Quest Diagnostics subsequently attempts to contact the
provider to obtain any missing information or rectify incorrect billing
information. Missing or incorrect information on requisitions adds complexity to
and slows the billing process, creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions, and
generally increases the aging of accounts receivable. When all issues relating
to the missing or incorrect

information are not resolved in a timely manner, the related receivables are
written off to the allowance for doubtful accounts.

FAILURE IN THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS OF QUEST DIAGNOSTICS, INCLUDING
FAILURES RESULTING FROM SYSTEMS CONVERSIONS, COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE
TURNAROUND TIME AND OTHERWISE DISRUPT QUEST DIAGNOSTICS' OPERATIONS, WHICH COULD
REDUCE ITS CUSTOMER BASE AND RESULT IN LOST NET REVENUES

     Information systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of Quest
Diagnostics' business, including laboratory testing, customer service, logistics
and management of medical data. Quest Diagnostics' success depends, in part, on
the continued and uninterrupted performance of its information technology, or
IT, systems. Quest Diagnostics' computer systems are vulnerable to damage from a
variety of sources, including telecommunications failures, malicious human acts
and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security measures, some of
Quest Diagnostics' servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic
break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Despite the
precautions Quest Diagnostics has taken, unanticipated problems affecting its
systems could cause failures in its IT systems. Sustained or repeated system
failures that interrupt the ability of Quest Diagnostics to process test orders,
deliver test results or perform tests in a timely manner would adversely affect
its reputation and likely result in a loss of customers and net revenues.

     Quest Diagnostics is in the process of standardizing its systems, which is
a difficult process and will take several years to complete. Quest Diagnostics
plans to begin to develop and implement a new laboratory information system and
a new billing system that combine the functionality of its principal existing
systems. Quest Diagnostics expects that the development and implementation of
the enhanced systems will take several years. During systems conversions of this
type, workflow may be temporarily interrupted, which may cause backlogs. In
addition, the implementation process, including the transfer of databases and
master files to new data centers, presents significant conversion risks that
could cause failures in Quest Diagnostics' IT systems and disrupt Quest
Diagnostics' operations.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW, MORE COST-EFFECTIVE TESTS THAT CAN BE PERFORMED BY
PHYSICIANS IN THEIR OFFICES OR BY PATIENTS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT QUEST
DIAGNOSTICS' TESTING VOLUME AND NET REVENUES

     The diagnostics testing industry is faced with changing technology and new
product introductions. Advances in technology may lead to the development of
more cost-effective tests that can be performed outside of an independent
clinical laboratory such as (1) point-of-care tests that can be performed by
physicians in their offices and (2) home testing that can be performed by
patients. Development of such technology and its use by Quest Diagnostics'
customers would reduce the demand for Quest Diagnostics' laboratory testing
services and negatively impact Quest Diagnostics' revenues.

     Currently, most clinical laboratory testing is categorized as "high" or
"moderate" complexity, and thereby subject to extensive and costly regulation
under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA.
Manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their
sales by marketing point-of-care laboratory equipment to physicians and by
selling test kits approved for home use to both physicians and patients.
Over-the-counter diagnostics tests are automatically deemed under CLIA to be
"waived" tests, which may then be performed in physician office laboratories as
well as by patients in their homes with minimal regulatory oversight. The Food
and Drug Administration, or FDA, has regulatory responsibility over instruments,
test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories and recently
has taken responsibility from the Center for Disease Control, or CDC, for test
classification. Increased approval of home test kits could lead to increased
testing by physicians in their offices, which could affect Quest Diagnostics'
market for laboratory testing services and negatively impact Quest Diagnostics'
revenues.

FDA REGULATION OF LABORATORY-DEVELOPED GENETIC TESTING COULD LEAD TO INCREASED
COSTS AND DELAY IN INTRODUCING NEW GENETIC TESTS.

     In the past, the FDA has claimed regulatory authority over
laboratory-developed tests, but has exercised enforcement discretion in not
regulating tests performed by CLIA-certified laboratories. In response to recent
recommendations by the DHHS Secretary's Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing,
or SACGT, the FDA is considering whether to regulate laboratory-developed
genetic testing. CDRH, a branch of the FDA, is considering a proposal to require
laboratories to submit a "template" of information about their laboratory-
developed genetic tests before they may introduce new genetic tests. CBER,
another branch of the FDA, in draft compliance guidance and in letters to
laboratories, has expressed the view that analyte specific reagents, or ASRs,
used in laboratory-developed tests for HIV Genotyping for Drug Resistance must
have pre-market approval. Representatives of clinical laboratories, including
Quest Diagnostics, and the American Clinical Laboratory Association, the
industry's trade association, have met with both branches of the FDA to address
their respective issues and expect to continue those discussions until the FDA's
issues and concerns are resolved. FDA regulation of laboratory-developed genetic
testing could lead to increased costs and delay in introducing new genetic
tests.

EFFORTS BY THIRD PARTY PAYERS, INCLUDING THE GOVERNMENT, TO REDUCE UTILIZATION
AND PRICING COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON QUEST DIAGNOSTICS' NET
REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY

     Government payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as private
payers, including managed care organizations, have taken steps and may continue
to take steps to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare
services, including clinical laboratory services. Primarily as a result of
recent reimbursement rate reductions and utilization controls implemented by
government regulations, the percentage of Quest Diagnostics' aggregate net
revenues derived from Medicare and Medicaid programs declined from 20% in 1995
to 14% in 2001. For a more detailed description of the developments in
government regulations, investors should read carefully Quest Diagnostics' most
recent annual report on Form 10-K incorporated by reference into this
prospectus.

     In addition to changes in government reimbursement programs, private
payers, including managed care organizations, are demanding discounted fee
structures or the assumption by clinical laboratory service providers of all or
a portion of the financial risk through capitated payment contracts. Under
capitated payment contracts, clinical laboratories receive a fixed monthly fee
per individual enrolled with the managed care organization for all laboratory
tests performed during the month regardless of the number or cost of the tests
actually performed. In particular, managed care organizations, which have
significant bargaining power, frequently negotiate for capitated payment
contracts. In 2001, Quest Diagnostics derived approximately 9% of its revenues
from capitated payment contracts with managed care organizations. As the number
of patients covered by managed care organizations increased during the 1990s,
more patients were covered under capitated payment contracts, which resulted in
reduced opportunities for higher priced fee-for-service business and adversely
affected Quest Diagnostics' profit margin.

     Quest Diagnostics expects efforts to impose reduced reimbursements and more
stringent cost controls by government and other payers to continue. If Quest
Diagnostics cannot offset additional reductions in the payments it receives for
its services by reducing costs, increasing test volume and/or introducing new
procedures, it could have a material adverse impact on Quest Diagnostics' net
revenues and profitability.

FAILURE TO PROVIDE A HIGHER QUALITY OF SERVICE THAN THAT OF ITS COMPETITORS
COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON QUEST DIAGNOSTICS' NET REVENUES AND
PROFITABILITY

     While there has been significant consolidation in the clinical laboratory
testing business in recent years, it remains a fragmented and highly competitive
industry. Quest Diagnostics competes with three types of laboratory
providers -- hospital-affiliated laboratories, other independent clinical
laboratories and physician-office laboratories. Most physicians have admitting
privileges or other relationships with hospitals as part of their medical
practice. Almost all hospitals maintain an on-site laboratory to perform routine
clinical testing on their inpatients and outpatients. Many hospitals leverage
their relationships with community physicians and

encourage the physicians to send their outreach (non-hospital patients) testing
to the hospital's laboratory. In addition, hospitals that own physician
practices generally require the physicians to refer tests to the hospital's
affiliated laboratories. As a result of this affiliation between hospitals and
community physicians, Quest Diagnostics competes against hospital-affiliated
laboratories primarily based on quality of service. Quest Diagnostics' failure
to provide service superior to hospital-affiliated laboratories and other
laboratories could have a material adverse impact on Quest Diagnostics' net
revenues and profitability.

IF QUEST DIAGNOSTICS FAILS TO COMPLY WITH EXTENSIVE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, IT
COULD SUFFER FINES AND PENALTIES OR BE REQUIRED TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO
ITS OPERATIONS

     Quest Diagnostics is subject to extensive and frequently changing federal,
state and local laws and regulations. Quest Diagnostics believes that, based on
its experience with government settlements and public announcements by various
government officials, the federal government continues to strengthen its
position on healthcare fraud. In addition, legislative provisions relating to
healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially
increased funding, powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse.
While Quest Diagnostics believes that it is in material compliance with all
applicable laws, many of the regulations applicable to Quest Diagnostics,
including those relating to billing and reimbursement of tests and those
relating to relationships with physicians and hospitals, are vague or indefinite
and have not been interpreted by the courts. They may be interpreted or applied
by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could
require Quest Diagnostics to make changes in its operations, including its
billing practices. If Quest Diagnostics fails to comply with applicable laws and
regulations, it could suffer civil and criminal fines and penalties, including
the loss of licenses or its ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and
other federal and state healthcare programs, in addition to recoupment of prior
billings.

     During the mid-1990s, Quest Diagnostics and SmithKline Beecham Clinical
Laboratories, or SBCL, which we acquired in 1999, settled government claims that
primarily involved industry-wide billing and marketing practices that both
companies believed to be lawful. The aggregate amount of the settlements for
these claims exceeded $500 million. The federal or state governments may bring
additional claims based on new theories as to Quest Diagnostics' practices that
Quest Diagnostics believes to be in compliance with law. The federal government
has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements as the amount of potential
fines and penalties far exceeds the rates at which Quest Diagnostics is
reimbursed. In addition, the government has the remedy of excluding a
non-compliant provider from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs,
which represented approximately 14% of Quest Diagnostics' aggregate net revenues
during 2001.

     At March 31, 2002, Quest Diagnostics' recorded reserves, relating primarily
to billing claims, including those indemnified by SBCL, approximated $13
million. Although Quest Diagnostics' management believes that established
reserves for both indemnified and non-indemnified claims are sufficient, it is
possible that additional information may become available that may cause the
final resolution of these matters to exceed established reserves by an amount
which could be material to Quest Diagnostics' results of operations and cash
flows in the quarter in which such claims are settled. Quest Diagnostics does
not believe that these issues will have a material adverse effect on its overall
financial condition. However, Quest Diagnostics understands that there may be
pending qui tam claims brought by former employees or other "whistle blowers" as
to which Quest Diagnostics has not been provided with a copy of the complaint
and accordingly cannot determine the extent of any potential liability.

     For additional information, see Quest Diagnostics' most recent annual
report on Form 10-K and most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q incorporated
by reference into this prospectus.

THE FINAL PRIVACY REGULATIONS THAT WILL TAKE EFFECT IN 2003 AND PROPOSED FEDERAL
SECURITY REGULATIONS UNDER THE HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY
ACT OF 1996 MAY INCREASE QUEST DIAGNOSTICS' COSTS

     Pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996, or HIPAA, on December 28, 2000, the Secretary of the Department of Health
and Human Services, or HHS, issued final regulations that established
comprehensive federal standards with respect to the use and disclosure of

protected health information by health plans, healthcare providers and
healthcare data clearinghouses. The regulations establish a complex regulatory
framework on a variety of subjects, including:

     - the circumstances under which disclosures and uses of protected health
       information require a general patient consent, specific authorization by
       the patient, or no patient consent or authorization,

     - the content of notices of privacy practices for protected health
       information,

     - patients' rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of the
       disclosures and uses of protected health information, and

     - administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities
       that use or receive protected health information.

     The regulations establish a "floor" and do not supersede state laws that
are more stringent. Therefore, Quest Diagnostics is required to comply with both
federal privacy standards and varying state privacy laws. In addition, for
healthcare data transfers relating to citizens of other countries, Quest
Diagnostics will need to comply with the laws of other countries. The federal
privacy regulations became effective in April 2001 for healthcare providers, but
healthcare providers have until April 2003 to comply with the regulations. In
March 2002, HHS issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or NPRM, to modify the
final privacy standards. In addition, final standards for electronic
transactions were issued in August 2000 and will become effective in October
2002. Covered entities that file a compliance plan with HHS not later than the
compliance date describing how they will come into compliance with the rules
will not be considered non-compliant before October 16, 2003. These regulations
provide uniform standards for code sets (codes representing medical procedures
and laboratory tests and diagnosis codes, which are used, among others, in
connection with the identification and billing of medical procedures and
laboratory tests), electronic claims, remittance advice, enrollment, eligibility
and other electronic transactions.

     Finally, the proposed security and electronic signature regulations issued
by the Secretary of HHS in August 1998 pursuant to HIPAA are expected to be
finalized this year. HIPAA provides for significant fines and other penalties
for wrongful disclosure of protected health information. Compliance with the
HIPAA requirements, when finalized, will require significant capital and
personnel resources from all healthcare organizations, including Quest
Diagnostics. However, Quest Diagnostics will not be able to estimate the cost of
complying with all of these regulations, which it expects to be significant,
until after all the regulations are finalized.

QUEST DIAGNOSTICS' TESTS AND BUSINESS PROCESSES MAY INFRINGE ON THE INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS, WHICH COULD CAUSE QUEST DIAGNOSTICS TO ENGAGE IN
COSTLY LITIGATION, PAY SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES OR PROHIBIT IT FROM SELLING CERTAIN
OF ITS TESTS

     Other companies or individuals, including Quest Diagnostics' competitors,
may obtain patents or other property rights that would prevent, limit or
interfere with the ability of Quest Diagnostics to develop, perform or sell its
tests or operate its business. As a result, Quest Diagnostics may be involved in
intellectual property litigation and it may be found to infringe on the
proprietary rights of others, which could force it to do one or more of the
following:

     - cease developing, performing or selling products or services that
       incorporate the challenged intellectual property,

     - obtain and pay for licenses from the holder of the infringed intellectual
       property right,

     - redesign or reengineer its tests,

     - change its business processes, or

     - pay substantial damages, court costs and attorneys' fees, including
       potentially increased damages for any infringement held to be willful.

     Patents generally are not issued until several years after an application
is filed. The possibility that, before a patent is issued to a third party,
Quest Diagnostics may be performing a test or other activity covered by the
patent is not a defense to an infringement claim. Thus, even tests that Quest
Diagnostics develops could become the subject of infringement claims if a third
party obtains a patent covering those tests.

     Infringement and other intellectual property claims, regardless of their
merit, can be expensive and time-consuming to litigate. In addition, any
requirement for Quest Diagnostics to re-engineer its tests or change its
business processes could substantially increase its costs or force it to
interrupt product sales or delay new test releases. In the past, Quest
Diagnostics has settled several disputes regarding its alleged infringement of
intellectual property of third parties. Quest Diagnostics is currently involved
in settling several additional disputes. Quest Diagnostics does not believe that
resolution of these disputes will have a material adverse effect on its
operations or financial condition. However, infringement claims could arise in
the future as patents could be issued on tests or processes that Quest
Diagnostics may be performing, particularly in such emerging areas as gene-based
testing and other specialty testing.

PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY LITIGATION COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE FINANCIAL IMPACT ON
QUEST DIAGNOSTICS AND AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON QUEST DIAGNOSTICS' CLIENT BASE AND
REPUTATION

     As a general matter, providers of clinical laboratory testing services may
be subject to lawsuits alleging negligence or other similar legal claims. These
suits could involve claims for substantial damages. Any professional liability
litigation could also have an adverse impact on Quest Diagnostics' client base
and reputation. Quest Diagnostics maintains various professional liability
insurance programs for claims that could result from providing or failing to
provide clinical laboratory testing services, including inaccurate testing
results and other exposures. However, Quest Diagnostics is essentially
self-insured for most of these claims. Quest Diagnostics does maintain coverage
which caps its exposure on individual claims. The basis for Quest Diagnostics'
insurance reserves is the actuarially determined projected losses based upon its
historical loss experience. Quest Diagnostics' management believes that present
insurance coverage and reserves are sufficient to cover currently estimated
exposures, but Quest Diagnostics cannot assure you that we will not incur
liabilities in excess of recorded reserves. Similarly, although Quest
Diagnostics believes that it will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage
in the future at acceptable costs, Quest Diagnostics cannot assure you that it
will be able to do so.

SUBSTANTIAL DEBT MAY IMPAIR THE FINANCIAL AND OPERATING FLEXIBILITY OF QUEST
DIAGNOSTICS

     As of March 31, 2002, Quest Diagnostics would have had approximately $1,824
million of debt outstanding on a pro forma basis after giving effect to (1) the
AML acquisition, (2) the completion of the proposed acquisition of Unilab, (3)
the borrowings of approximately $475 million under Quest Diagnostics' existing
credit facilities to consummate the AML acquisition and (4) the borrowings of
approximately $525 million under Quest Diagnostics' new bridge credit facility
to finance the anticipated cash required in connection with the Unilab
acquisition, assuming 30% of the Unilab shares are exchanged for cash, and the
refinancing of Unilab's existing debt. On May 2, 2002, Quest Diagnostics repaid
$100 million of principal amount outstanding under its $325 million unsecured
revolving credit facility, reducing AML-related acquisition debt from $475
million to $375 million.

     On May 10, 2002, Quest Diagnostics had outstanding debt of approximately
$1.2 billion. In addition, Quest Diagnostics has a $550 million Unilab-related
bridge facility commitment, approximately $221 million available under its
unsecured revolving credit facility and approximately $90 million in cash.
Except for operating leases, Quest Diagnostics does not have any off-balance
sheet financing arrangements in place or available. Set forth in the table
below, for each of the next five years, is the aggregate amount of principal,
interest and total payments with respect to Quest Diagnostics' debt, including
capital leases. This table is presented on a pro forma basis taking into account
the AML and Unilab-related borrowings described above

and the May 2, 2002 repayment of $100 million of principal under its $325
million unsecured revolving credit facility.

2007..................................................    65,625     46,796     112,421

     The foregoing table assumes that the entire $525 million bridge loan
facility is refinanced into a five-year term loan with quarterly amortization of
principal, that the closing of the exchange offer occurs in June 2002 and that
the first scheduled amortization payment is September 30, 2002. While there is
no assurance that Quest Diagnostics will be able to refinance the entire bridge
loan facility, Quest Diagnostics has a $275 million term loan commitment to
refinance a portion of such bridge loan facility.

     The foregoing table assumes that the $75 million of borrowings outstanding
under the revolving credit facility as of May 10, 2002 will remain outstanding
until the final maturity of the revolving credit facility in 2006.

     The foregoing table excludes the principal payments due on the $300 million
secured receivables credit facility, portions of which mature in 2002 and 2003.
However, it is Quest Diagnostics' current intention to roll-over this facility
annually as it has done since 2001. If Quest Diagnostics is not able to
roll-over all or part of this facility, it will need to refinance this secured
receivables credit facility with cash on-hand, its unsecured revolving credit
agreement or a new financing agreement.

     The foregoing table assumes that the holders of 1.75% contingent
convertible debentures due 2021 will not exercise their option on November 30,
2004 and 2005 to require Quest Diagnostics to repurchase the holders'
debentures. If these options are exercised by the holders, Quest Diagnostics may
choose to repurchase the debentures with cash or its common stock or a
combination of cash and common stock, at a purchase price equal to the principal
amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Quest Diagnostics may not have the
financial resources, or be able to arrange financing, to pay in cash for all of
the debentures that might be delivered by holders of debentures seeking to
exercise their options. As a result, any payment to the holders in common stock
will be dilutive to then existing stockholders of Quest Diagnostics.

     Quest Diagnostics' debt portfolio is sensitive to changes in interest
rates. Interest rates on the unsecured revolving credit facility and bridge loan
facility are also subject to a pricing schedule that fluctuates based on changes
in Quest Diagnostics credit rating from Standard and Poor's and Moody's
Investors Service. As of March 31, 2002, Quest Diagnostics would have had
approximately $1,007 million of floating rate debt on a pro forma basis after
giving effect to the AML and Unilab acquisitions that are described in clauses
(1) through (4) in the first paragraph of this risk factor. If the applicable
interest rate fluctuates by 1%, interest expense will fluctuate by approximately
$10.2 million annually. In addition, any future borrowings by Quest Diagnostics
under the unsecured revolving credit facility, the secured receivables credit
facility or the issuance of other floating rate debt will expose Quest
Diagnostics to additional interest rate risk.

     Quest Diagnostics' debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants.
These restrictions could limit the ability of Quest Diagnostics to use operating
cash flow in other areas of its business because it must use a portion of these
funds to make principal and interest payments on its debt.

     Quest Diagnostics has obtained ratings on its debt from Standard and Poor's
and Moody's Investors Service. There can be no assurance that any rating so
assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be
lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency's
judgment, future

circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in
Quest Diagnostics or the clinical testing industry, so warrant.

     Quest Diagnostics and its subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in
the future. Quest Diagnostics' ability to make principal and interest payments
depends on its ability to generate cash in the future. If additional debt is
added to the current debt of Quest Diagnostics, a greater portion of its cash
flows will be needed to satisfy its debt service obligations, and if it does not
generate sufficient cash to meet its debt service requirements, Quest
Diagnostics may need to seek additional financing. This may make it more
difficult for Quest Diagnostics to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable
to it or at all. As a result, Quest Diagnostics would be more vulnerable to
general adverse economic, industry and capital markets conditions as well as the
other risks associated with indebtedness.

FUTURE SALES OF QUEST DIAGNOSTICS' SHARES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PRICE OF
QUEST DIAGNOSTICS SHARES

     As of May 14, 2002, approximately 9.3 million Quest Diagnostics shares were
issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options under Quest Diagnostics'
employee stock option plans, and its non-employee director stock option plan,
and an additional approximately 7.1 million Quest Diagnostics shares were
reserved for the issuance of additional options and shares under these plans. In
addition, at the closing, up to an additional approximately 1.2 million Quest
Diagnostics' shares will be issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options
under Unilab's stock option plans. Quest Diagnostics also issues shares of its
common stock under its employee stock purchase plan, employee stock ownership
plan and supplemental deferred compensation plan. In addition, up to an
additional approximately 2.9 million Quest Diagnostics shares could be issued
upon conversion of Quest Diagnostics' 1.75% convertible debentures due 2021 in
accordance with the terms of the indenture.

     In addition, SmithKline Beecham, which owns approximately 22.1 million
outstanding Quest Diagnostics shares or approximately 22.8% of the outstanding
Quest Diagnostics shares as of May 14, 2002, is entitled to demand up to four
times that Quest Diagnostics register SmithKline Beecham's Quest Diagnostics
shares and to participate in registered offerings initiated by Quest Diagnostics
or a third party. Also, SmithKline Beecham has three million Quest Diagnostics
shares registered in a shelf registration statement and may sell shares pursuant
to Rule 144 under the Securities Act. In addition, during the year following the
completion of the offer, the Kelso stockholders, which collectively own
approximately 13,841,178 Unilab shares, will be entitled to demand that Quest
Diagnostics register the Quest Diagnostics shares that they will own following
the completion of the offer.

     Future sales of Quest Diagnostics shares and instruments convertible or
exchangeable into such shares and transactions involving equity derivatives
relating to shares, including sales or transactions by SmithKline Beecham, or
the perception that such sales or transactions could occur, could adversely
affect the market price of Quest Diagnostics shares.

CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF ITS CHARTER, BY-LAWS AND DELAWARE LAW MAY DELAY OR PREVENT
A CHANGE OF CONTROL OF QUEST DIAGNOSTICS

     Quest Diagnostics' corporate documents and Delaware law contain provisions
that may enable Quest Diagnostics' management to resist a proposal regarding a
change of control of Quest Diagnostics. These provisions include a staggered or
classified board of directors, limitations on persons authorized to call a
special meeting of stockholders and advance notice procedures required for
stockholders to make nominations of candidates for election as directors or to
bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders. Quest Diagnostics also
has a stockholder rights plan designed to make it more costly and thus more
difficult to gain control of Quest Diagnostics. These anti-takeover defenses
might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control. In addition, Quest
Diagnostics, unlike Unilab, is subject to Section 203 of the DGCL. These
provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for
our stockholders to elect directors and cause Quest Diagnostics to take other
corporate actions. In addition, the existence of these provisions, together with
Delaware law, might hinder or delay an attempted takeover other than through
negotiations with Quest Diagnostics' board of directors.

            SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA FOR QUEST DIAGNOSTICS

     The following table summarizes selected historical financial data for Quest
Diagnostics and its subsidiaries at the dates and for each of the periods
presented. Quest Diagnostics derived the selected historical financial data for
the years 1997 through 2001 from its audited consolidated financial statements.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Quest
Diagnostics' Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001, all per share data
has been restated to reflect Quest Diagnostics' two-for-one stock split effected
on May 31, 2001. Quest Diagnostics derived the historical financial data for the
three months ended March 31, 2002 and 2001 from its unaudited interim
consolidated financial statements. The unaudited interim consolidated financial
statements reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are
necessary for a fair statement of the financial condition and results of
operations as of and for the periods presented. Except as otherwise disclosed in
the notes to the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, all such
adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The unaudited interim consolidated
financial statements have been compiled without audit and are subject to
year-end adjustments. Operating results for the interim periods are not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.
The selected historical financial data is only a summary and should be read
together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes, and
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations included in Quest Diagnostics' Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the

- ---------------
(a)  In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued
     SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", or SFAS 142, which
     was adopted by Quest Diagnostics on January 1, 2002. Assuming the
     nonamortization provisions of SFAS 142 had been effective at the beginning
     of fiscal 2001, net income for the three months ended March 31, 2001 would
     have increased by $8.6 million, representing the reduction in goodwill
     amortization, net of taxes.

(b)  On August 16, 1999, Quest Diagnostics completed the acquisition of
     SmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratories, Inc., or SBCL. Consolidated
     operating results for 1999 include the results of operations of SBCL
     subsequent to the closing of the acquisition. See Note 3 to the
     consolidated financial statements included in Quest Diagnostics' Form 10-K
     for the year ended December 31, 2001, which is incorporated by reference
     into this prospectus.

(c)  Represents charges incurred in conjunction with Quest Diagnostics' debt
     refinancing in the second quarter of 2001, as discussed in Note 7 to the
     consolidated financial statements included in Quest Diagnostics' Form 10-K
     for the year ended December 31, 2001, which is incorporated by reference
     into this prospectus.

(d)  During the second quarter of 2000, Quest Diagnostics recorded a net special
     charge of $2.1 million. This net charge resulted from a $13.4 million
     charge related to the costs to cancel certain contracts that Quest
     Diagnostics believed were not economically viable as a result of the SBCL
     acquisition, and which were principally associated with the cancellation of
     a co-marketing agreement for clinical trials testing services, which
     charges were in large part offset by a reduction in reserves attributable
     to a favorable resolution of outstanding claims for reimbursements
     associated with billings of certain tests.

(e)  Represents charges principally incurred in conjunction with the acquisition
     and planned integration of SBCL, as discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated
     financial statements included in Quest Diagnostics' Form 10-K for the year
     ended December 31, 2001, which is incorporated by reference into this
     prospectus.

(f)  Includes a charge of $16 million to write-down goodwill reflecting the
     estimated impairment related to Quest Diagnostics' consolidation plan
     announced in the fourth quarter of 1997.

(g)  In conjunction with Quest Diagnostics' debt refinancing in the second
     quarter of 2001, Quest Diagnostics recorded an extraordinary loss of $36
     million ($22 million, net of taxes). The loss represented the write-off of
     deferred financing costs of $23 million, associated with the debt which was
     refinanced, and $12.8 million of payments related primarily to the tender
     premium incurred in connection with the cash tender offer for Quest
     Diagnostics' 10 3/4% senior subordinated notes due 2006.

(h)  During the fourth quarter of 2000, Quest Diagnostics recorded an
     extraordinary loss of $4.8 million ($2.9 million, net of taxes)
     representing the write-off of deferred financing costs resulting from the
     prepayment of $155 million of term loans under its senior secured credit
     facility.

(i)  In conjunction with the acquisition of SBCL, Quest Diagnostics repaid the
     entire amount outstanding under Quest Diagnostics' then existing credit
     agreement. The extraordinary loss recorded in the third quarter of 1999
     represented $3.6 million ($2.1 million, net of taxes) of deferred financing
     costs which were written-off in connection with the extinguishment of the
     credit agreement.

(j)  Potentially dilutive common shares primarily include stock options and
     restricted common shares granted under Quest Diagnostics' Employee Equity
     Participation Program. During periods in which net income available for
     common stockholders is a loss, diluted weighted average common shares
     outstanding will equal basic weighted average common shares outstanding,
     since under these circumstances, the incremental shares would have an
     anti-dilutive effect.

(k)  On December 31, 2001, Quest Diagnostics repurchased all of its then
     outstanding preferred stock for its par value of $1 million plus accrued
     dividends.

(l)  Includes a fourth quarter charge of $5.3 million, which was part of the
     $6.8 million charge recorded in the same quarter, to increase the provision
     for doubtful accounts to recognize the reduced recoverability of certain
     receivables from accounts which were no longer to be served as a result of
     the consolidation plan announced in the fourth quarter of 1997.

(m) Adjusted EBITDA represents income (loss) before extraordinary loss, income
    taxes, net interest expense, depreciation, amortization and special items.
    Special items include the provisions for restructuring and other special
    charges reflected in the selected historical financial data above, $8.9
    million of costs related to the integration of SBCL which were included in
    operating costs and expensed as incurred in 2000, a $3.0 million gain
    related to the sale of an investment in 1999 and charges of $2.5 million and
    $6.8 million recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in
    1998 and 1997, respectively, related to Quest Diagnostics' consolidation of
    its laboratory network announced in the fourth quarter of 1997. Adjusted
    EBITDA is presented and discussed because management believes that Adjusted
    EBITDA is a useful adjunct to net income and other measurements under
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States since it is a
    meaningful measure of a company's performance and ability to meet its future
    debt service requirements, fund capital expenditures and meet working
    capital requirements. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial
    performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States and should not be considered as an alternative to (i) net income (or
    any other measure of performance under generally accepted accounting
    principles) as a measure of performance or (ii) cash flows from operating,
    investing or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows or as a
    measure of liquidity.

                 SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA FOR UNILAB

     The following table summarizes selected historical financial data for
Unilab at the dates and for each of the periods presented. Unilab derived the
selected historical financial data for the years 1997 through 2001 from its
audited financial statements. Unilab derived the historical financial data for
the three months ended March 31, 2002 and 2001 from its unaudited interim
financial statements. The unaudited interim financial statements reflect all
adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair
statement of the financial condition and results of operations as of and for the
periods presented. Except as otherwise disclosed in the notes to the unaudited
interim financial statements, all such adjustments are of a normal recurring
nature. The unaudited interim financial statements have been compiled without
audit and are subject to year-end adjustments. Operating results for the interim
periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for
the full year. The selected historical financial data is only a summary and
should be read together with the financial statements and related notes, and
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations included in Unilab's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three
months ended March 31, 2002 and Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2001.

(a) In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 142, which was adopted by Unilab on
    January 1, 2002. Assuming the nonamortization provisions of SFAS 142 had
    been effective at the beginning of fiscal 2001, net income for the three
    months ended March 31, 2001 would have increased by $1.2 million,
    representing the reduction in goodwill amortization, net of taxes.

(b) The provision for special charges includes non-recurring charges of $3.0
    million related to a federal investigation under the False Claims Act
    relating to Unilab's billings, $2.5 million paid to Unilab's majority
    stockholder for the termination of annual fees for financial advisory
    services provided to Unilab, $0.9 million related to the secondary offering
    of Unilab's common stock and $0.6 million of legal fees related to the
    settlement of claims brought by a former employee regarding employment
    benefits. See Note 5 to the financial statements included in Unilab's Form
    10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001 which is incorporated by reference
    into this prospectus.

(c) The provision for special charges includes a non-recurring charge of $25.2
    million for merger/recapitalization expenses related primarily to financial
    advisory fees, other financing fees and expenses, legal and accounting fees,
    printing costs, severance costs and other miscellaneous items incurred in
    connection with Unilab's merger with UC Acquisition Sub, Inc. The provision
    for special charges also includes a non-recurring charge of $0.6 million
    related to a settlement with a group of insurance companies regarding claims
    by the insurance companies that Unilab over-billed them in the early to
    mid-1990s in connection with several chemistry profile tests that were
    previously the subject of a settlement agreement with the government. See
    Notes 4 and 5 to the financial statements included in Unilab's Form 10-K for
    the year ended December 31, 2001 which is incorporated by reference into
    this prospectus.

(d) Includes $0.1 million of non-cash charges related to stock-based
    compensation for options issued to non-employee consultants in 2001.

(e) Includes $23.8 million of stock-based compensation comprised of a $1.5
    million non-cash charge related to service options issued to non-employee
    consultants that were accelerated in 2001 and $22.3 million of non-cash
    charges related to performance-based stock options that met certain
    contingent vesting provisions in 2001. See Note 10 to the financial
    statements included in Unilab's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
    2001 which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus.

(f) In 2001, Unilab recorded an extraordinary loss of $10.7 million ($6.3
    million, net of taxes) representing the retirement premium and the write-off
    of deferred financing costs and discount related to debt which was retired
    with certain of the proceeds from the company's IPO completed on June 6,
    2001. See Notes 8 and 9 to the financial statements included in Unilab's
    Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001 which is incorporated by
    reference into this prospectus.

(g) In 1999, Unilab recorded an extraordinary loss of $20.8 million representing
    the retirement premium and the write-off of deferred financing costs related
    to debt, which was retired in connection with the Company's recapitalization
    in 1999. See Notes 4, 7 and 8 to the financial statements included in
    Unilab's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001 which is
    incorporated by reference into this prospectus.

(h) All periods presented were retroactively adjusted to reflect a 1 for
    0.986312 reverse stock split of Unilab's common stock, effected on May 16,
    2001. See Note 9 to the financial statements included in Unilab's Form 10-K
    for the year ended December 31, 2001 which is incorporated by reference into
    this prospectus.

(i) Adjusted EBITDA represents income (loss) before extraordinary loss, income
    taxes, net interest expense, depreciation, amortization and special items.
    Special items include the provision for special charges reflected in the
    selected historical financial data above and $0.1 million and $23.8 million,
    respectively, of stock-based compensation charges included in selling,
    general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31,
    2001 and for the year ended December 31, 2001. Adjusted EBITDA is presented
    because it is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company's ability
    to generate cash flow and to service or incur indebtedness. Adjusted EBITDA
    should not be considered an alternative to net income as a measure of
    operating results or to cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity
    or performance in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA as presented may not
    be comparable to similarly captioned measures used by other companies.
    Moreover, Unilab's principal financing agreements contain covenants in which
    Adjusted EBITDA is used as a measure of financial performance.

              SUMMARY UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL DATA

     The following summary of unaudited pro forma combined financial data is
based on the historical financial statements of Quest Diagnostics, AML and
Unilab, adjusted to give effect to the acquisitions of AML and Unilab by Quest
Diagnostics. (See "The Companies -- Quest Diagnostics and Purchaser -- Recent
Developments at Quest Diagnostics"). The summary unaudited pro forma combined
financial data has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the
unaudited pro forma combined financial statements and related notes under the
heading "Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements" on page 80. The
unaudited pro forma combined financial data was prepared to illustrate the
estimated effects of the acquisitions of AML and Unilab, the repayment of
substantially all of AML's and Unilab's existing outstanding debt and the
borrowings under Quest Diagnostics' existing credit facilities and anticipated
bridge loan facility. The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet data as of
March 31, 2002 gives effect to the AML and Unilab acquisitions, the repayment of
substantially all of AML's and Unilab's existing outstanding debt and the
borrowings under Quest Diagnostics' existing credit facilities and anticipated
bridge loan facility as if they had occurred on March 31, 2002. The unaudited
pro forma combined statements of operations and per share data assume the AML
and Unilab acquisitions, the repayment of substantially all of AML's and
Unilab's existing outstanding debt and the borrowings under Quest Diagnostics'
existing credit facilities and anticipated bridge loan facility were effected on
January 1, 2001. The unaudited pro forma combined financial data is not
necessarily indicative of the combined financial position or results of
operations that would have been realized had Quest Diagnostics, AML and Unilab
been a single entity during the periods presented. In addition, the unaudited
pro forma combined financial data is not necessarily indicative of the future
results that Quest Diagnostics will experience after the acquisitions. The
unaudited pro forma combined financial data should be read in conjunction with
the historical financial statements of Quest Diagnostics and Unilab incorporated
by reference into this document.

OTHER DATA:

- ---------------

(a) The provision for special charges includes $6.0 million related to the
    operations of Quest Diagnostics and $6.9 million related to the operations
    of Unilab. The $6.0 provision related to the operations of Quest Diagnostics
    represents charges incurred in conjunction with Quest Diagnostics' debt
    refinancing in the second quarter of 2001 as discussed in Note 7 to the
    consolidated financial statements in Quest Diagnostics' Form 10-K for the
    year ended December 31, 2001, which is incorporated by reference into this
    prospectus. The $6.9 million provision related to the operations of Unilab
    includes non-recurring charges of $3.0 million related to a federal
    investigation under the False claims Act relating to Unilab's billings, $2.5
    million paid to Unilab's majority stockholder for the termination of annual
    fees for financial advisory services provided to Unilab, $0.9 million
    related to the secondary offering of Unilab's common stock and $0.6 million
    of legal fees related to the settlement of claims brought by a former
    employee

    regarding employment benefits. See Note 5 to the financial statements
    included in Unilab's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001 which is
    incorporated by reference into this prospectus.

(b) Potentially dilutive common shares primarily include stock options and
    restricted common shares granted under our Employee Equity Participation
    Program. Basic and diluted net income per common share on a pro forma
    combined basis gives effect to the assumed 8.5 million shares of Quest
    Diagnostics common stock issued to Unilab stockholders to effectuate the
    acquisition of Unilab, assuming that the Unilab acquisition closed on
    January 1, 2001. For purposes of the unaudited pro forma combined financial
    statements, we assumed that all outstanding options to acquire shares of
    Unilab common stock were exercised and that $297 million of cash was paid to
    Unilab stockholders in the offer, with the remaining portion of the purchase
    price paid through the issuance of approximately 8.5 million shares of
    common stock of Quest Diagnostics.

(c) Adjusted EBITDA represents income (loss) before extraordinary loss, income
    taxes, net interest expense, depreciation, amortization and special items.
    Special items include the provisions for special charges reflected in the
    summary unaudited pro forma combined financial data above and for the year
    ended December 31, 2001, $23.8 million of stock-based compensation charges
    for Unilab, included in selling, general and administrative expenses,
    comprised of a $1.5 million non-cash charge related to service options
    issued to non-employee consultants that were accelerated in June 2001 and
    $22.3 million of non cash charges related to performance-based stock options
    that met certain contingent vesting provisions in 2001. Adjusted EBITDA is
    presented and discussed because management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is
    a useful adjunct to net income and other measurements under accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States since it is a meaningful
    measure of a company's performance and ability to meet its future debt
    service requirements, fund capital expenditures and meet working capital
    requirements. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance
    under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and
    should not be considered as an alternative to (i) net income (or any other
    measures of performance under generally accepted accounting principles) as a
    measure of performance or (ii) cash flows from operating, investing or
    financing activities as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of
    liquidity.

                      UNAUDITED COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA

     We have summarized below the per share information for Quest Diagnostics
and Unilab on a historical, unaudited pro forma combined and unaudited pro forma
diluted equivalent basis for the periods and as of the dates indicated below.
The unaudited pro forma combined financial data has been derived from and should
be read in conjunction with the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial
statements and related notes under the heading "Unaudited Pro Forma Combined
Financial Statements" on page 80. The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet
per share data as of March 31, 2002 gives effect to the AML and Unilab
acquisitions, the repayment of substantially all of AML's and Unilab's existing
outstanding debt and the borrowings under Quest Diagnostics' existing credit
facilities and anticipated bridge loan facility as if they had occurred on March
31, 2002. The unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations per share
data assume the AML and Unilab acquisitions, the repayment of substantially all
of AML's and Unilab's existing outstanding debt and the borrowings under Quest
Diagnostics' existing credit facilities and anticipated bridge loan facility
were effected on January 1, 2001. The unaudited pro forma combined financial
data is not necessarily indicative of the combined financial position or results
of operations that would have been realized had Quest Diagnostics, AML and
Unilab been a single entity during the periods presented. In addition, the
unaudited pro forma combined financial data is not necessarily indicative of the
future results that Quest Diagnostics will experience after the acquisitions.
You should read this information in conjunction with the historical financial
statements of Quest Diagnostics and Unilab incorporated by reference into this
document.

Diagnostics Incorporated and its subsidiaries as "Quest Diagnostics". Quest
Diagnostics is the successor to a New York corporation known as MetPath Inc.
that was organized in 1967. From 1982 to 1996, Quest Diagnostics was a
subsidiary of Corning Incorporated, which we refer to as "Corning". On December
31, 1996, Corning distributed all of the outstanding shares of common stock of
Quest Diagnostics to the shareholders of Corning.

     Quest Diagnostics is the nation's leading provider of diagnostic testing,
information and related services for the healthcare industry with net revenues
in excess of $3.6 billion during 2001. Quest Diagnostics offers a broad range of
clinical laboratory testing services used by physicians in the detection,
diagnosis, evaluation, monitoring and treatment of diseases and other medical
conditions. Quest Diagnostics has a more extensive national network of
laboratories and patient service centers than its competitors and for the year
ended December 31, 2001, Quest Diagnostics' net revenues were sixty-five percent
greater than those of its nearest competitor. Quest Diagnostics has the leading

molecular diagnostics, as well as non-hospital based anatomic pathology services
and testing for drugs of abuse.

     Quest Diagnostics processed over 105 million requisitions during 2001. Each
requisition form accompanies a patient specimen, indicating the tests to be
performed and the party to be billed for the tests. Quest Diagnostics' customers
include physicians, hospitals, managed care organizations, employers,
governmental institutions and other independent clinical laboratories.

     Quest Diagnostics currently has a nationwide network of approximately 1,400
patient service centers, 30 principal laboratories serving major metropolitan

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AT QUEST DIAGNOSTICS

     On April 1, 2002, Quest Diagnostics completed the acquisition of all of the
outstanding voting stock of AML, and LabPortal Inc., an affiliate of AML, in an
all-cash transaction with a combined value of approximately $500 million, which
included the assumption of approximately $160 million in debt. At the close of
the AML acquisition, Quest Diagnostics used cash on-hand and borrowed $300
million under its existing secured receivables credit facility and $175 million
under its existing unsecured revolving credit facility to finance the purchase
price and to repay substantially all of AML's then outstanding debt. As part of
the transaction, Quest Diagnostics acquired all of AML's operations, including
full-service laboratories located in Chantilly, Virginia and in Las Vegas,
Nevada, as well as patient service centers, and hospital sales, service and
logistics capabilities. The acquisition of AML strengthened Quest Diagnostics'
leading position with hospitals, with its Virginia laboratory providing Quest
Diagnostics with an east coast esoteric reference laboratory to complement Quest
Diagnostics' Nichols Institute on the west coast. In addition, AML has an
anatomic pathology business served by approximately 30 board certified
specialist pathologists. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information
included in this prospectus includes financial information of AML.

     The unaudited pro forma combined financial information included in this
prospectus does not include financial information regarding LabPortal, Inc.
Approximately $11 million of the combined value for the AML and LabPortal Inc.
acquisitions was attributable to LabPortal.

                             REASONS FOR THE OFFER

          QUEST DIAGNOSTICS' REASONS FOR THE OFFER; FACTORS CONSIDERED

     In approving the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, including the offer and the merger, the Quest Diagnostics
board of directors considered a number of factors, including the following:

          1.  Quest Diagnostics' Growth Strategy.  The Quest Diagnostics board
     of directors considered the acquisition of Unilab in view of Quest
     Diagnostics' growth strategy, which includes selective acquisitions. In
     particular, the Quest Diagnostics board of directors considered the
     complementary nature of the companies' respective businesses and the
     potential for enhancing stockholder value through a combination with
     Unilab, including the fact that the acquisition of Unilab will result in
     Quest Diagnostics becoming the market leader in diagnostics testing in the
     State of California, currently the nation's largest market and fastest
     growing state as measured in absolute terms.

          2.  Enhanced Service; Benefits to Customers.  The Quest Diagnostics
     board of directors considered the fact that the acquisition of Unilab will
     enhance service for all customers in California, with expanded access
     through a combined network of approximately 50 rapid response laboratories
     and 500 patient service centers throughout California. In addition, the
     board of directors considered that Unilab's customers will benefit from the
     convenience of "one-stop" shopping for their diagnostics testing needs as a
     result of having access to the innovative technologies and expanded
     esoteric testing menu offered by Nichols Institute, Quest Diagnostics' west
     coast esoteric laboratory. In 2001, Unilab referred approximately $18
     million worth of esoteric testing to other laboratories.

          3.  Synergies.  The Quest Diagnostics board of directors considered
     management's expectation of achieving annual benefits of approximately $30
     million within two years following consummation of the merger, which is
     when Quest Diagnostics expects the integration of Unilab to be completed.

          4.  Terms of the Transaction.  The Quest Diagnostics board of
     directors considered the terms of the transaction as contemplated by the
     merger agreement, including the representations and warranties, covenants,
     termination provisions and conditions to the offer and the merger, and the
     stockholders agreement, including the option to acquire the Unilab shares
     owned by the Kelso stockholders.

          5.  Financial Considerations.  The Quest Diagnostics board of
     directors considered certain financial issues, including information
     relating to the financial condition, results of operations, earnings and
     businesses of Unilab, on both a historical and prospective basis, and Quest
     Diagnostics' current expectation that the acquisition will ultimately
     result in the benefits described above, as well as incremental revenues,
     and provide a rate of return in excess of Quest Diagnostics' cost of
     capital.

          6.  Unilab Management Team.  The Quest Diagnostics board of directors
     considered the quality and experience of the members of Unilab's existing
     management team, and the terms and conditions upon which such persons have
     generally agreed to remain employed by the surviving corporation following
     the offer and the merger.

          7.  Risk Factors.  The Quest Diagnostics board of directors considered
     certain of the matters set forth in this prospectus under the heading,
     "Risk Factors".

     The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the
Quest Diagnostics board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but
includes the material factors considered by the Quest Diagnostics board of
directors. In view of the variety of factors considered in connection with its
evaluation of the offer and the merger, the Quest Diagnostics board of directors
did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign
relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its
determination and recommendation. In addition, individual directors may have
given differing weights to different factors.

                 REASONS FOR THE UNILAB BOARD'S RECOMMENDATION

     Unilab's board of directors, by a vote of those directors present and
voting at the meeting at which the merger agreement was considered, approved the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the offer
and the merger, and determined that the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, including the offer and the merger, are fair to and in the best
interests of Unilab and its stockholders. The Unilab board recommends that
Unilab's stockholders accept the offer and tender their Unilab shares pursuant
to the offer.

     Information about the recommendation of Unilab's board of directors is more
fully described in Unilab's Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9, which is being mailed to Unilab's stockholders together with this
prospectus.

                            BACKGROUND OF THE OFFER

     Quest Diagnostics from time to time consults with its financial advisors
and reviews various strategic alternatives, including the possibility of
acquiring or merging with other companies involved in the clinical testing
industry in the United States. In this connection, during 2000, Quest
Diagnostics began considering opportunities for expanding its operations in
California to complement its current businesses.

     Similarly, Unilab, which was a privately-held company from November 23,
1999 until June 6, 2001, regularly considers a variety of strategic alternatives
as part of the continuous evaluation of its businesses and plans. In connection
with this process, Unilab's management periodically evaluated various
alternatives for expanding its clinical laboratory testing business both within
and outside the state of California, the state within which Unilab primarily
conducts its business, including through acquisitions of other laboratories.

     In February 2000, Robert E. Whalen, Unilab's Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, other members of Unilab's senior management and representatives of KEP
Investment Associates VI, L.P. and KEP VI, LLC, Unilab's significant stockholder
that we refer to as Kelso, met with Robert A. Hagemann, Quest Diagnostics' Chief
Financial Officer, other members of Quest Diagnostics' management and
representatives from Quest Diagnostics' financial advisors, Merrill Lynch & Co.
The parties discussed a potential transaction between the companies involving
the combination of the California operations of Quest Diagnostics and Unilab.

     During the period from February 2000 through October 2000, there were
periodic contacts between representatives of Quest Diagnostics and Unilab,
including preliminary discussions concerning a potential business combination
transaction involving the companies.

     In early January 2001, Mr. Whalen, other members of Unilab's senior
management and representatives of Kelso met with Mr. Hagemann and several
members of Quest Diagnostics' management. At the meeting, Quest Diagnostics and
Unilab executed a confidentiality agreement. Also at the meeting, Unilab
provided Quest Diagnostics with financial information and representatives of
Quest Diagnostics conducted a preliminary due diligence examination of Unilab.

     Following the January meeting, in a proposal delivered to Michael B.
Goldberg and David I. Wahrhaftig, each a member of Unilab's board of directors
and a principal of Kelso, Kenneth W. Freeman, Quest Diagnostics' Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer, indicated Quest Diagnostics' interest in acquiring
Unilab. The Unilab board of directors determined that the terms of the proposal
were inadequate. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Goldberg delivered to Mr. Freeman a
counterproposal responding to Quest Diagnostics' proposal. The valuation levels
discussed by the parties at that time were, on a per share basis, lower than the
per share consideration that is payable to Unilab's stockholders in the offer
and the merger. Several weeks later, Mr. Freeman advised Mr. Goldberg that Quest
Diagnostics' earlier proposal to acquire Unilab had been withdrawn.

     In May 2001, representatives of Unilab and Quest Diagnostics again met to
discuss the operations and financial performance of their respective companies.
No formal discussions between the parties concerning the terms of a potential
transaction between the companies took place at the meeting, no timetable for
future meetings was established, and there were no assurances given by either
party that any further discussions between the parties would take place.

     On June 6, 2001, Unilab consummated an initial public offering of
approximately 6.7 million shares of common stock.

     On October 6, 2001, Unilab consummated a secondary offering of
approximately 8.0 million shares of common stock.

     Following Unilab's initial public offering of common stock, Quest
Diagnostics continued to monitor the financial performance of Unilab. In
addition, in late October 2001, Mr. Freeman and Mr. Whalen met to discuss the
operations of their respective companies and a potential transaction involving
such companies.

     On November 20, 2001, Quest Diagnostics and Unilab entered into a mutual
confidentiality agreement in order to facilitate an exchange of information
between the companies. Following the execution of the

confidentiality agreement, Unilab provided additional financial information to
Quest Diagnostics in order to assist Quest Diagnostics in evaluating a potential
transaction between the companies. During this period, representatives of Unilab
and Quest Diagnostics held several discussions concerning the cost savings that
might be realized by a transaction between the two companies.

     In late November 2001, Unilab engaged James Maher, a partner at Park Avenue
Equity Management and a member of Unilab's board of directors, to negotiate the
terms of a potential transaction with Quest Diagnostics.

     In early January 2002, representatives of Quest Diagnostics met with
members of senior management of Unilab to further discuss and analyze the
financial information that Unilab had provided to Quest Diagnostics in November
and to discuss Unilab's recent financial performance.

     On January 8, 2002, Mr. Freeman and Mr. Whalen met in Los Angeles. During
this meeting, Mr. Freeman advised Mr. Whalen of the strategic benefits that he
believed could be realized in the event of a business combination transaction
between Quest Diagnostics and Unilab.

     Following his meeting with Mr. Whalen, at the suggestion of Mr. Whalen, Mr.
Freeman contacted Mr. Maher to request a meeting to discuss the merits of a
possible business combination transaction between Quest Diagnostics and Unilab
and the proposed valuation for such a transaction.

     On January 14, 2002, Mr. Freeman and Mr. Maher met at Mr. Maher's offices
in New York City. During this meeting, Mr. Freeman and Mr. Maher discussed, on a
preliminary basis, the merits of a potential business combination transaction
between Quest Diagnostics and Unilab, and the potential benefits that could be
realized by stockholders of both companies in the event of such a transaction.
Mr. Freeman also advised Mr. Maher of Quest Diagnostics' initial proposal for a
transaction between the companies, under which Quest Diagnostics would acquire
all of the outstanding Unilab shares at a price of $26.00 per share, payable
solely in Quest Diagnostics shares. Mr. Maher informed Quest Diagnostics that
the proposal received by Unilab was not sufficient, and indicated that Unilab
was interested in a transaction with a significant cash component and a higher
per-share price.

     Following this meeting, Mr. Freeman briefed members of Quest Diagnostics'
senior management team, and such persons began a more detailed review of the
potential business combination transaction.

     During the period from January 16, 2002 through February 8, 2002,
representatives of Quest Diagnostics, including Mr. Freeman, engaged in various
discussions with Mr. Maher regarding the proposed business combination,
including discussions regarding the form of consideration, transaction structure
and the transaction process.

     On January 28, 2002, Quest Diagnostics formally retained the investment
banking firm of Merrill Lynch to provide financial advisory services in
connection with the proposed business combination transaction.

     On February 8, 2002, Kenneth Finnegan, Quest Diagnostics' Vice President,
Business Development, delivered to Mr. Maher a draft proposal setting forth the
general terms upon which Quest Diagnostics would be willing to proceed with an
acquisition of Unilab, including terms relating to value, transaction structure
and transaction protection measures. Quest Diagnostics' proposal contemplated
the acquisition of Unilab pursuant to a cash election exchange offer, with a
back-end merger for the same consideration, at a price of $26.50 per share, with
a minimum of seventy percent of the consideration to be paid in the form of
Quest Diagnostics shares. The terms of the proposal were also conditioned on
Unilab's aggregate transaction-related fees not exceeding $12 million.

     In addition, also on February 8, 2002, Mr. Freeman advised Mr. Whalen of
the general terms of a proposed employment arrangement between Mr. Whalen and
Quest Diagnostics in the event of consummation of the proposed transaction.

     Following a discussion of Quest Diagnostics' proposal with members of
Unilab's board of directors and management, and with Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher and Flom LLP, Unilab's outside legal counsel, Mr. Maher advised Quest
Diagnostics that Unilab was unwilling to commit to an exclusivity period for a

transaction on the terms proposed by Quest Diagnostics, including the
requirement that Kelso be committed to the transaction.

     During the period from February 8, 2002 through February 26, 2002, the
parties and their respective advisors continued to engage in discussions
regarding the terms of the proposed business combination transaction. During
this period, representatives of Quest Diagnostics advised Mr. Maher that the
price contemplated by the February 8 proposal was conditioned on an exclusive
negotiating period and that Quest Diagnostics was unwilling to engage in a
competitive bidding process for Unilab.

     From late February through March 2, 2002, representatives of Quest
Diagnostics and its legal and financial advisors conducted a business, financial
and legal due diligence examination of Unilab at a data room in Woodland Hills,
California. In addition, certain representatives of Quest Diagnostics met with
members of Unilab's management team to conduct detailed business and operational
due diligence on Unilab. Representatives of Quest Diagnostics and its legal and
financial advisors continued their due diligence review of Unilab over the
course of the following few weeks.

     On February 22, 2002, Shearman & Sterling, Quest Diagnostics' outside legal
advisors, delivered drafts of the merger agreement and the stockholders
agreement to Skadden, Arps for distribution to Unilab and Kelso.

     On February 27, 2002, Quest Diagnostics held a regularly scheduled meeting
of its board of directors. During this meeting, Mr. Freeman informed the Quest
Diagnostics board of directors as to the status of negotiations and the status
of Quest Diagnostics' due diligence examination of Unilab. The Quest Diagnostics
board of directors discussed the business, financial and legal issues presented
by the proposed transaction and authorized Mr. Freeman to continue pursuing the
proposed transaction.

     Between February 28, 2002 and March 6, 2002, representatives of Quest
Diagnostics, Unilab and their respective legal and financial advisors
participated in several telephone calls regarding the structure and terms of the
proposed business combination transaction as reflected in the draft merger
agreement and stockholders agreement. Throughout the negotiations, Quest
Diagnostics insisted that it would not proceed with the transaction if Unilab
had the ability to terminate the transaction to accept a third-party offer, and
unless Kelso was contractually committed to supporting the transaction. Quest
Diagnostics also insisted that the transaction be conditioned upon reaching
satisfactory post-transaction employment arrangements with certain key Unilab
executives.

     On March 4, 2002, Mr. Freeman and Mr. Maher discussed the proposed business
combination transaction by telephone call. During this conversation, Mr. Freeman
and Mr. Maher discussed various open issues relating to the proposed
transaction, including certain issues related to value, management compensation
and transaction protections.

     On March 6, 2002, representatives of Quest Diagnostics, including Mr.
Finnegan, and representatives of Shearman & Sterling and Merrill Lynch met in
the New York City offices of Shearman & Sterling with representatives of Unilab,
Kelso, including Messrs. Goldberg and Wahrhaftig, and Skadden, Arps to negotiate
the terms of the proposed transaction as reflected in the draft merger agreement
and stockholders agreement.

     During the period from March 7, 2002 through April 2, 2002, representatives
of Quest Diagnostics, Unilab, and their respective legal and financial advisors
continued to negotiate the specific terms of the merger agreement and the
stockholders agreement.

     On March 8, 2002, representatives of Unilab and its financial advisors met
with representatives of Quest Diagnostics, including Mr. Hagemann, and other
senior Quest Diagnostics executives, in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey to conduct
a financial and legal due diligence examination of Quest Diagnostics.

     On March 11, 2002, representatives of Unilab and its financial advisors met
with representatives of Quest Diagnostics, including Mr. Freeman, in New York
City to conduct a further due diligence review of Quest Diagnostics.
Representatives of Unilab and its legal and financial advisors continued their
due diligence review of Quest Diagnostics over the next few weeks.

     On March 20, 2002, Quest Diagnostics held a special telephonic meeting of
its board of directors to consider the status of the proposed transaction.
During this meeting, Mr. Freeman updated the Quest Diagnostics board of
directors as to the status of negotiations and the status of Quest Diagnostics'
due diligence examination of Unilab. Merrill Lynch made a presentation to the
board of directors concerning various financial aspects of the proposed
transaction, and Shearman & Sterling updated the board of directors regarding
the legal aspects of the proposed transaction. The Quest Diagnostics board of
directors discussed the business, financial and legal issues presented by the
proposed transaction and authorized Mr. Freeman to continue pursuing the
proposed transaction.

     On March 24, 2002, representatives of Quest Diagnostics met with certain
members of the Unilab management team, including Mr. Whalen, Brian Urban,
Unilab's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, David Gee,
Unilab's Executive Vice President and General Counsel, Emmett Kane, Unilab's
Executive Vice President, Northern California, and Jeffery Lanzolatta, Unilab's
Executive Vice President, Southern California, at the offices of Quest
Diagnostics in New Jersey in order to negotiate the terms of such persons'
employment arrangements with the surviving corporation following consummation of
the proposed transaction.

     On March 25, 2002, Mr. Freeman and Mr. Maher discussed the proposed
business combination transaction by telephone call. During this call, Mr.
Freeman advised Mr. Maher as to Quest Diagnostics' position in respect of the
remaining open issues.

     During the week of March 25, 2002, representatives of Unilab and Quest
Diagnostics and their respective legal counsel and other advisors finalized
negotiations on the terms of the merger agreement, stockholders agreement and
other related transaction documents. The parties also finalized the terms of
post-transaction employment arrangements for the senior members of Unilab's
management team. In the course of negotiating the terms of these arrangements,
both Quest Diagnostics and Unilab insisted on certain modifications to the
existing employment arrangements with certain of Unilab's senior executives.
Quest Diagnostics also insisted on a reduction in the aggregate transaction fees
payable by Unilab to its outside advisors in connection with the transaction.

     On the afternoon of April 1, 2002, Quest Diagnostics held a special
telephonic meeting of its board of directors. After discussion, which included
updates on the financial and legal aspects of the proposed transaction from
Quest Diagnostics senior management and its outside legal and financial
advisors, the Quest Diagnostics board of directors approved the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the offer and the merger, and
the stockholders agreement, and approved the form of such agreements.

     On April 1, 2002, a special meeting of the Unilab board of directors was
held, at which all of Unilab's directors were present in person or by telephone.
At this meeting, the Unilab board of directors approved the merger agreement and
the stockholders agreement, and the transactions contemplated thereby, and
resolved to recommend that Unilab stockholders tender their shares into the
offer and, if necessary, vote to adopt the merger agreement.

     Prior to the opening of the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq National
Market on April 2, 2002, Quest Diagnostics and Unilab executed the merger
agreement and the stockholders agreement, and issued a joint press release
announcing the transaction. A joint conference call was held on the morning of
April 2, 2002 to discuss the transaction.

                                   THE OFFER

BASIC TERMS

     Exchange of Unilab Shares.  We are offering to exchange 0.3256 of a Quest
Diagnostics share, or $26.50 in cash, without interest, for each outstanding
Unilab share that is validly tendered and not withdrawn in the offer, subject in
each case to the proration and election procedures described in this prospectus
and the related letter of election and transmittal. The ratio of 0.3256 of a
Quest Diagnostics share for each Unilab share was determined by dividing $26.50
by the average closing trading price of a Quest Diagnostics share on the New
York Stock Exchange for the five trading days ended March 28, 2002.

     Election of Quest Diagnostics Shares and/or Cash.  In the offer, Unilab
stockholders may elect to receive Quest Diagnostics shares, which we refer to as
the "stock consideration", or cash in exchange for each of their validly
tendered and not withdrawn Unilab shares. However, the aggregate cash
consideration that Unilab stockholders may receive in the offer is subject to a
pro rata reduction because not more than 30% of the number of Unilab shares
outstanding immediately prior to the expiration of the offer, which we refer to
as the "maximum cash election number", can be exchanged for cash.

     If the number of validly tendered and not withdrawn Unilab shares properly
electing to receive the cash consideration in the offer is equal to or less than
the maximum cash election number, then each such "cash electing" Unilab share
will be exchanged for $26.50 in cash, without interest, and all validly tendered
and not withdrawn Unilab shares electing the stock consideration will be
exchanged for 0.3256 of a Quest Diagnostics share.

     However, because there is a limit to the total amount of cash that will be
paid in the offer, in certain circumstances, each validly tendered Unilab share
electing to receive the cash consideration will be exchanged on a pro rata basis
for a combination of cash and a fraction of a Quest Diagnostics share. This will
occur in the event that the number of validly tendered and not withdrawn Unilab
shares, the holders of which have elected to receive the cash consideration,
exceeds the maximum cash election number. In this case, each validly tendered
and not withdrawn Unilab share will be exchanged as follows:

     - each validly tendered Unilab share properly electing to receive the stock
       consideration will be exchanged for 0.3256 of a Quest Diagnostics share,
       and

     - each validly tendered Unilab share properly electing to receive $26.50 in
       cash, without interest, will be exchanged for (a) an amount of cash,
       without interest, equal to the product of (x) $26.50 and (y) a fraction,
       which we refer to as the cash fraction, the numerator of which will be
       the maximum cash election number (that is, 30% of the number of Unilab
       shares outstanding immediately prior to the expiration of the offer), and
       the denominator of which will be the total number of validly tendered and
       not withdrawn Unilab shares electing to receive the cash consideration,
       and (b) a number of Quest Diagnostics shares equal to the product of (x)
       0.3256 of a Quest Diagnostics share, and (y) a fraction equal to one
       minus the cash fraction.

     BECAUSE THERE IS A LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF UNILAB SHARES THAT WILL BE
EXCHANGED FOR CASH IN THE OFFER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE
100% OF THE OFFER CONSIDERATION IN THE FORM OF CASH FOR EACH OF THE UNILAB
SHARES THAT YOU PROPERLY ELECT TO EXCHANGE FOR CASH. HOWEVER, REGARDLESS OF THE
NUMBER OF UNILAB SHARES THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF CASH ELECTIONS, EACH UNILAB
STOCKHOLDER ELECTING TO RECEIVE CASH IN EXCHANGE FOR ALL OF HIS OR HER UNILAB
SHARES WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE CASH FOR AT LEAST 30% OF HIS OR HER UNILAB
SHARES.

     An election to receive Quest Diagnostics shares for all of your Unilab
shares will not be subject to proration.

     You will not receive any fractional Quest Diagnostics shares. Instead, you
will receive cash in an amount equal to the market value of any fractional
shares you would otherwise have been entitled to receive.

     The offer is scheduled to expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on
Monday, June 17, 2002, unless we (subject to the terms and conditions of the
offer and the merger agreement, as described below)

extend the period during which the offer is open, in which case the term
"expiration date" means the latest time and date at which the offer, as so
extended, expires.

     Transfer Charges.  If you are the record owner of your Unilab shares and
you tender your Unilab shares directly to the offer exchange agent, you will not
be obligated to pay any charges or expenses of the offer exchange agent or any
brokerage commissions. If you own your Unilab shares through a broker or other
nominee, and your broker tenders the Unilab shares on your behalf, your broker
may charge you a fee for doing so. You should consult your broker or nominee to
determine whether any charges will apply. Except as set forth in the
instructions to the letter of election and transmittal, transfer taxes on the
exchange of Unilab shares pursuant to our offer will be paid by Unilab.

     Conditions to the Offer.  Our obligation to exchange Quest Diagnostics
shares or cash for Unilab shares pursuant to the offer is subject to several
conditions referred to below under "Conditions to the Offer", including the
minimum tender condition and receipt of regulatory approvals.

     We are making this offer in order to acquire at least 50.1% of the
aggregate number of outstanding Unilab shares, on a fully diluted basis. We
intend, as soon as possible after completion of the offer, to have Unilab merge
with and into Purchaser or, depending on certain tax matters, to have Purchaser
merge with and into Unilab. The purpose of the merger is to acquire all Unilab
shares not tendered and exchanged pursuant to the offer. In the merger, each
then outstanding Unilab share, except for, if applicable, Unilab shares held in
Unilab's treasury or by Quest Diagnostics, Purchaser or any of their wholly
owned subsidiaries or by stockholders exercising appraisal rights, if available,
will be converted into 0.3256 of a Quest Diagnostics share. Stockholders who do
not tender their Unilab shares in the offer will not receive any cash
consideration in exchange for their Unilab shares in the merger (except for
cash, if any, payable in lieu of fractional Quest Diagnostics shares or
following the exercise of appraisal rights, if applicable).

EXTENSION, TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

     The merger agreement provides that, unless Unilab otherwise agrees, we must
or, in the case of the third bullet below, we have the option to, extend the
offer in the following circumstances for one or more periods (not in excess of
ten business days each):

     - beyond the initial scheduled expiration date, up to September 30, 2002,
       if, at the scheduled or extended expiration date of the offer, any of the
       conditions to the offer have not been satisfied or, to the extent
       permitted, waived, until the conditions to the offer are satisfied or
       waived. However, we will not be obligated to extend the offer pursuant to
       this provision of the merger agreement, but may elect to do so in
       accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, if the minimum tender
       condition is not satisfied at the time such extension would otherwise be
       required as long as certain other conditions to the offer have been
       satisfied (which conditions are expressly set forth in the merger
       agreement) and we have publicly announced this fact and our intention not
       to extend the offer at least two business days prior to the date that the
       extension would otherwise have been required,

     - for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
       position of the SEC or the SEC's staff applicable to the offer or any
       period required by applicable law, or

     - for an aggregate period of not more than ten business days beyond the
       latest applicable date that would otherwise be permitted under the first
       or second bullet above, if, as of the expiration date, all of the
       conditions to the offer have been satisfied or waived, but the number of
       Unilab shares validly tendered and not withdrawn equals more than 80%,
       but less than 90%, of the outstanding Unilab shares on a fully diluted
       basis. However, if we elect to extend the expiration date pursuant to
       this provision of the merger agreement, we will be deemed to have
       irrevocably waived all of the conditions to the offer set forth in full
       detail under the caption "The Offer -- Conditions to the Offer". Except
       as described in this provision of the merger agreement, we are not
       permitted to extend the offer without the prior written consent of Unilab
       at the time that all conditions to the offer have been satisfied or, to
       the extent permitted, waived.

     If we decide, or are required, to extend our offer as described above, we
will make an announcement to that effect no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City
time, on the next business day after the previously scheduled expiration date.

     During any such extension, all Unilab shares previously tendered and not
properly withdrawn will remain subject to the offer, subject to your right to
withdraw your Unilab shares. You should read the discussion under the caption
"Withdrawal Rights and Change of Election" for more details.

     Subject to the SEC's applicable rules and regulations and the terms of the
merger agreement, we reserve the right to waive any of the conditions to the
offer and to make any change in the terms of or conditions to the offer.
However, without Unilab's consent, we cannot:

     - decrease the consideration payable in the offer,

     - change the form of consideration to be paid in the offer to a form other
       than cash or Quest Diagnostics shares,

     - decrease the aggregate amount of cash available in the offer or change
       the relative amount of cash available in the offer,

     - reduce the number of Unilab shares to be purchased in the offer,

     - impose conditions to the offer in addition to those set forth in the
       merger agreement,

     - modify or waive the minimum tender condition,

     - except pursuant to the merger agreement, change the expiration date, or

     - make any other change that is adverse to Unilab stockholders or to
       holders that have elected a particular form of consideration in the
       offer.

     We will make a public announcement of any extension, termination, amendment
or delay of the offer as promptly as practicable. In the case of an extension,
any announcement will be issued no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on
the next business day after the previously scheduled expiration date. Subject to
applicable law (including Rules 14d-4(c), 14d-6(c) and 14e-1 under the Exchange
Act, which require that any material change in the information published, sent
or given to Unilab stockholders in connection with the offer be promptly sent to
stockholders in a manner reasonably designed to inform stockholders of the
change) and without limiting the manner in which we may choose to make any
public announcement, we assume no obligation to publish, advertise or otherwise
communicate any such public announcement other than by making a release to the
Dow Jones News Service or the PR Newswire Association, Inc.

     If we make a material change in the terms of our offer or the information
concerning the offer, or if we waive a material condition of the offer, we will
extend the offer to the extent required by Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act.
If, prior to the expiration date, subject to the terms of the merger agreement,
we change the percentage of Unilab shares being sought or the consideration we
are offering, that change will apply to all Unilab stockholders whose Unilab
shares are accepted for exchange pursuant to our offer. If, at the time notice
of that change is first published, sent or given to you, the offer is scheduled
to expire at any time earlier than the tenth business day from and including the
date that the notice is first so published, sent or given, we will extend the
offer until the expiration of that ten business day period.

     For purposes of our offer, a "business day" means any day other than a
Saturday, Sunday or federal holiday and consists of the time period from 12:01
a.m. through 12:00 midnight, New York City time.

PROCEDURE FOR TENDERING AND ELECTING

     Unilab has provided us with its stockholder list and security positions
listing, including the most recent list of names, addresses and security
positions of non-objecting record holders and beneficial owners in the
possession of Unilab, for the purpose of disseminating the offer to Unilab's
stockholders. We will mail this offer and the related letter of election and
transmittal to record holders of Unilab's shares whose names appear on this
stockholder list and we will furnish this offer and the related letter of
election and transmittal, for

subsequent transmittal to beneficial owners of Unilab shares, to brokers,
dealers, commercial banks, trust companies and similar persons whose names, or
the names of whose nominees, appear on the stockholder list or, if applicable,
who are listed or are participants in a clearing agency's security position
listing.

     Valid Tender.  For you to validly tender Unilab shares pursuant to our
offer, you must,

     - prior to the expiration of the offer, deliver to the offer exchange agent
       at one of its addresses set forth on the back cover of the prospectus a
       properly completed and duly executed letter of election and transmittal,
       or a manually signed facsimile of that document, together with any
       required signature guarantees, and any other required documents, and the
       certificates representing the tendered Unilab shares,

     - prior to the expiration of the offer, deliver to the offer exchange agent
       at one of such addresses either (a) a properly completed and duly
       executed letter of election and transmittal, or a manually signed
       facsimile of that document, together with any required signature
       guarantees, or (b) an agent's message, which is explained below, in each
       case with any other required documents, and transfer the Unilab shares
       tendered pursuant to the procedures for book-entry transfer set forth in
       the section of the prospectus entitled "The Offer -- Procedure for
       Tendering and Electing", or

     - comply with the guaranteed delivery procedures described in "The
       Offer -- Procedure for Tendering and Electing".

     The term "agent's message" means a message, transmitted by The Depository
Trust Company, which we refer to as the "Book-Entry Transfer Facility", to, and
received by, the offer exchange agent and forming a part of a book-entry
confirmation, which states that the Book-Entry Transfer Facility has received an
express acknowledgment from the participant in the Book-Entry Transfer Facility
tendering the Unilab shares which are the subject of the book-entry
confirmation, that the participant has received and agrees to be bound by the
terms of the letter of election and transmittal and that we may enforce that
agreement against the participant.

     Valid Election.  In the offer, Unilab stockholders will have the option to
exchange each of their Unilab shares for:

     - 0.3256 of a Quest Diagnostics share, or

     - $26.50 in cash, without interest, except that the aggregate cash
       consideration that Unilab stockholders may elect to receive in the offer
       is subject to a pro rata reduction because not more than 30% of the
       number of Unilab shares outstanding immediately prior to the expiration
       of the offer can be exchanged for cash. See "The Offer -- Basic Terms"
       for a description of the proration procedure.

     Unilab stockholders may elect to receive Quest Diagnostics shares or,
subject to the proration procedure, cash in exchange for all of their Unilab
shares. However, you are not required to exchange all of your Unilab shares into
one form of consideration or the other. INSTEAD, IF YOU OWN MORE THAN ONE UNILAB
SHARE, YOU MAY ELECT TO RECEIVE THE CASH CONSIDERATION IN EXCHANGE FOR SOME OF
YOUR UNILAB SHARES, AND YOU MAY ELECT TO RECEIVE QUEST DIAGNOSTICS SHARES IN
EXCHANGE FOR OTHER OF YOUR UNILAB SHARES.

     To make a valid election, you must select one of the options on the letter
of election and transmittal, or, if you hold your shares in "street name"
through a broker, you must instruct your broker as to your election. IF YOU
VALIDLY TENDER UNILAB SHARES BUT FAIL TO MAKE AN ELECTION, YOU WILL BE DEEMED TO
HAVE ELECTED TO RECEIVE QUEST DIAGNOSTICS SHARES IN EXCHANGE FOR ALL OF YOUR
TENDERED UNILAB SHARES.

     Book-Entry Transfer.  The offer exchange agent will establish accounts with
respect to Unilab shares at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility for purposes of the
offer within two business days after the date of this prospectus, and any
financial institution that is a participant in the Book-Entry Transfer Facility
may make book-entry delivery of the Unilab shares by causing the Book-Entry
Transfer Facility to transfer such Unilab shares into the offer exchange agent's
account in accordance with the Book-Entry Transfer Facility's procedure for the
transfer. However, although delivery of Unilab shares may be effected through
book-entry at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility, you must transmit to the offer
exchange agent at one of its addresses set forth on the back cover page of this
prospectus, the letter of election and transmittal (or a manually signed

facsimile thereof), with any required signature guarantees, or an agent's
message, and any other required documents, or you must follow the guaranteed
delivery procedures described below. A tender by book-entry transfer will be
completed upon receipt by the offer exchange agent prior to the expiration date
of all such documents and of a book-entry confirmation from the Book-Entry
Transfer Facility. DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS TO THE BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER FACILITY
DOES NOT CONSTITUTE DELIVERY TO THE OFFER EXCHANGE AGENT.

     Signature Guarantees.  Signatures on all letters of election and
transmittal must be guaranteed by an eligible institution, except in cases in
which Unilab shares are tendered either (1) by a registered Unilab stockholder
who has not completed the box entitled "Special Payment Instructions" or
"Special Delivery Instructions" on the letter of election and transmittal, or
(2) for the account of an eligible institution.

     If the certificates for Unilab shares are registered in the name of a
person other than the person who signs the letter of election and transmittal,
or if payment is to be made to, or certificates for unexchanged Unilab shares
are to be returned to, a person other than the registered holder(s), the
certificates must be endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in
either case signed exactly as the name or names of the registered owner or
owners appear on the certificates, with the signature(s) on the certificates or
stock powers guaranteed by an eligible institution.

     The method of delivery of Unilab share certificates and all other required
documents, including delivery through the Book-Entry Transfer Facility, is at
your option and risk, and the delivery will be deemed made only when actually
received by the offer exchange agent. If delivery is by mail, we recommend
registered mail with return receipt requested, properly insured. In all cases,
you should allow sufficient time to ensure timely delivery.

     IN ORDER TO PREVENT UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX BACKUP WITHHOLDING
WITH RESPECT TO CASH RECEIVED PURSUANT TO OUR OFFER, YOU MUST PROVIDE THE OFFER
EXCHANGE AGENT WITH YOUR CORRECT TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER AND CERTIFY THAT
YOU ARE NOT SUBJECT TO BACKUP WITHHOLDING OF UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX BY
COMPLETING THE SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9 INCLUDED IN THE LETTER OF ELECTION AND
TRANSMITTAL. SOME UNILAB STOCKHOLDERS (INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, CORPORATIONS AND
SOME FOREIGN INDIVIDUALS) MAY BE EXEMPT FROM THESE BACKUP WITHHOLDING
REQUIREMENTS. IN ORDER FOR A FOREIGN INDIVIDUAL STOCKHOLDER TO QUALIFY AS AN
EXEMPT RECIPIENT, THE STOCKHOLDER MUST SUBMIT AN APPLICABLE INTERNAL REVENUE
SERVICE FORM W-8, SIGNED UNDER PENALTIES OF PERJURY, ATTESTING TO THAT
INDIVIDUAL'S EXEMPT STATUS.

     Guaranteed Delivery.  If you wish to tender Unilab shares pursuant to our
offer and your certificates are not immediately available or you cannot deliver
the certificates and all other required documents to the offer exchange agent
prior to the expiration date, or cannot complete the procedure for book-entry
transfer on a timely basis, your Unilab shares may nevertheless be tendered, so
long as all of the following conditions are satisfied:

     - you make your tender by or through an eligible institution;

     - a properly completed and duly executed notice of guaranteed delivery,
       substantially in the form made available by us, is received by the offer
       exchange agent as provided below prior to the expiration date; and

     - the certificates for all tendered Unilab shares (or a confirmation of a
       book-entry transfer of such shares into the offer exchange agent's
       account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility as described above), in
       proper form for transfer, together with a properly completed and duly
       executed letter of election and transmittal (or a manually signed
       facsimile thereof), with any required signature guarantees (or, in the
       case of a book-entry transfer, an agent's message) and all other
       documents required by the letter of election and transmittal are received
       by the offer exchange agent within three New York Stock Exchange trading
       days after the date of execution of such notice of guaranteed delivery.

     You may deliver the notice of guaranteed delivery by hand or transmit it by
facsimile transmission or mail to the offer exchange agent and you must include
a guarantee by an eligible institution in the form set forth in that notice.

     In all cases, we will exchange Unilab shares tendered and accepted for
exchange pursuant to our offer only after timely receipt by the offer exchange
agent of (a) certificate or certificates for Unilab shares (or timely
confirmation of a book-entry transfer of such shares into the offer exchange
agent's account at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility as described above), (b)
properly completed and duly executed letter or letters of election and
transmittal (or a manually signed facsimile thereof), along with any required
signature guarantees, or an agent's message in connection with a book-entry
transfer and (c) any other required documents. Accordingly, tendering
stockholders may receive their consideration at different times depending on
when share certificates or book-entry confirmations are actually received by the
offer exchange agent.

     Appointment of Attorneys-In-Fact and Proxies.  By executing a letter of
election and transmittal as set forth above, you irrevocably appoint our
designees as your attorneys-in-fact and proxies, each with full power of
substitution, to the full extent of your rights with respect to your Unilab
shares tendered and accepted for exchange by us and with respect to any and all
other Unilab shares and other securities issued or issuable in respect of the
Unilab shares on or after April 2, 2002. That appointment is effective, and
voting rights will be affected, when and only to the extent that we accept for
payment the Unilab shares that you have tendered with the offer exchange agent.
All such proxies will be considered coupled with an interest in the tendered
Unilab shares and therefore will not be revocable. Upon the effectiveness of
such appointment, all prior proxies that you have given will be revoked, and you
may not give any subsequent proxies (and, if given, they will not be deemed
effective). Our designees will, with respect to the Unilab shares for which the
appointment is effective, be empowered, among other things, to exercise all of
your voting and other rights as they, in their sole discretion, deem proper at
any annual, special or adjourned meeting of Unilab's stockholders or otherwise.
We reserve the right to require that, in order for Unilab shares to be deemed
validly tendered, immediately upon our exchange of those Unilab shares, we must
be able to exercise full voting rights with respect to such Unilab shares.

     Determination of Validity.  We will determine questions as to the validity,
form, eligibility (including time of receipt) and acceptance for exchange of any
tender of Unilab shares or election with respect to your Unilab shares, in our
sole discretion, and our determination will be final and binding. We reserve the
absolute right to reject any and all tenders of Unilab shares that we determine
are not in proper form or the acceptance or exchange for which may, in the
opinion of our counsel, be unlawful. We also reserve the right to waive any
defect or irregularity in the tender of Unilab shares, whether or not similar
defects or irregularities are waived in the case of other holders of Unilab
shares. Subject to the SEC's applicable rules and regulations and the terms of
the merger agreement, which are described in this document, we also reserve the
right to waive any of the conditions to the offer and to make any change in the
terms of or conditions to the offer. However, without Unilab's consent, we
cannot (a) decrease the consideration payable in the offer, (b) change the form
of consideration to be paid in the offer to a form other than cash or Quest
Diagnostics shares, (c) decrease the aggregate amount of cash available in the
offer or change the relative amount of cash available in the offer, (d) reduce
the number of Unilab shares to be purchased in the offer, (e) impose conditions
to the offer in addition to those set forth in the merger agreement, (f) modify
or waive the minimum tender condition, (g) except pursuant to the merger
agreement, change the date on which the offer is scheduled to expire or (h) make
any other change that is adverse to Unilab stockholders or to holders that have
elected a particular form of consideration in the offer. We will give oral or
written notice of any such delay, termination or amendment to the offer exchange
agent and by making a public announcement. No tender of Unilab shares will be
deemed to have been validly made until all defects and irregularities in the
tender of any Unilab shares have been cured or waived. Neither we, the offer
exchange agent, the information agent, the dealer manager nor any other person
will be under any duty to give notification of any defects or irregularities in
the tender of any Unilab shares or with respect to an election relating to any
tendered Unilab shares or will incur any liability for failure to give any such
notification. Our interpretation of the terms and conditions of our offer
(including the letter of election and transmittal and instructions thereto) will
be final and binding.

     Binding Agreement.  The tender of Unilab shares pursuant to any of the
procedures described above will constitute a binding agreement between us and
you upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the offer.

     THE METHOD OF DELIVERY OF UNILAB SHARE CERTIFICATES AND ALL OTHER REQUIRED
DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING DELIVERY THROUGH THE BOOK-ENTRY TRANSFER FACILITY, IS AT
YOUR OPTION AND RISK, AND THE DELIVERY WILL BE DEEMED MADE

ONLY WHEN ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE OFFER EXCHANGE AGENT. IF DELIVERY IS BY MAIL,
WE RECOMMEND REGISTERED MAIL WITH RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, PROPERLY INSURED. IN
ALL CASES, YOU SHOULD ALLOW SUFFICIENT TIME TO ENSURE TIMELY DELIVERY.

WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS AND CHANGE OF ELECTION

     Withdrawal Rights.  Unilab shares tendered pursuant to the offer may be
withdrawn at any time prior to the expiration date, and, unless we have
previously accepted and paid for them pursuant to the offer, may also be
withdrawn at any time after July 13, 2002. Once we accept and pay for Unilab
shares pursuant to the offer, your tender is irrevocable.

     For your withdrawal to be effective, the offer exchange agent must receive
from you a written, telex or facsimile transmission notice of withdrawal at one
of its addresses set forth on the back cover of this prospectus, and your notice
must include your name, address, social security number, the certificate
number(s) and the number of Unilab shares to be withdrawn, as well as the name
of the registered holder, if it is different from that of the person who
tendered those Unilab shares.

     A financial institution must guarantee all signatures on the notice of
withdrawal, unless those Unilab shares have been tendered for the account of any
eligible institution. If physical certificates have been delivered or otherwise
identified to the offer exchange agent, the name of the registered holder and
the serial numbers of the particular certificates evidencing the Unilab shares
withdrawn must also be furnished to the offer exchange agent, as stated above,
prior to the physical release of the certificates. If Unilab shares have been
tendered pursuant to the procedures for book-entry transfer discussed under the
section entitled "Procedure for Tendering and Electing", any notice of
withdrawal must specify the name and number of the account at the Book-Entry
Transfer Facility to be credited with the withdrawn Unilab shares and must
otherwise comply with the Book-Entry Transfer Facility's procedures.

     WE WILL DECIDE ALL QUESTIONS AS TO THE FORM AND VALIDITY (INCLUDING TIME OF
RECEIPT) OF ANY NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION, AND OUR DECISION
SHALL BE FINAL AND BINDING. NEITHER WE, THE OFFER EXCHANGE AGENT, THE
INFORMATION AGENT, THE DEALER MANAGER NOR ANY OTHER PERSON WILL BE UNDER ANY
DUTY TO GIVE NOTIFICATION OF ANY DEFECTS OR IRREGULARITIES IN ANY NOTICE OF
WITHDRAWAL OR WILL INCUR ANY LIABILITY FOR FAILURE TO GIVE ANY NOTIFICATION.

     Any Unilab shares properly withdrawn will be deemed not to have been
validly tendered for purposes of our offer. However, you may re-tender withdrawn
Unilab shares by following one of the procedures discussed under the caption
entitled "Procedure for Tendering and Electing" at any time prior to the
expiration date.

     Revocation or Change of Election.  Any election is irrevocable, except that
Unilab shares tendered may be withdrawn at any time prior to the expiration date
and, unless previously accepted and paid for pursuant to the offer, may also be
withdrawn at any time after July 13, 2002. After an effective withdrawal, you
may change your election and re-tender withdrawn Unilab shares by following one
of the procedures discussed under the caption entitled "Procedure for Tendering
and Electing" at any time prior to the expiration date.

EXCHANGE OF UNILAB SHARES; DELIVERY OF QUEST DIAGNOSTICS SHARES AND CASH

     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of our offer (including, if
the offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of the extension or
amendment), we will accept for exchange, all Unilab shares validly tendered, and
not properly withdrawn, prior to the expiration date, as promptly as practicable
after the expiration date. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence,
subject to applicable rules of the SEC and the terms of the merger agreement, we
may, among other things, delay acceptance for exchange, or the exchange of,
Unilab shares in order to comply with any applicable law or obtain any
government or regulatory approvals.

     In all cases, exchange of Unilab shares tendered and accepted for exchange
pursuant to the offer will be made only after timely receipt by the offer
exchange agent of certificates for those Unilab shares (or a confirmation of a
book-entry transfer of those Unilab shares in the offer exchange agent's account
at the Book-Entry Transfer Facility) pursuant to the procedures set forth in the
section entitled "Procedure for Tendering

and Electing", a properly completed and duly executed letter of election and
transmittal (or a manually signed facsimile of that document), with any required
signature guarantees or an agent's message, in the case of a book-entry
transfer, and any other required documents.

     For purposes of the offer, we will be deemed to have accepted for exchange,
and thereby exchanged, Unilab shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
as, if and when we notify the offer exchange agent of our acceptance of the
tenders of those Unilab shares pursuant to the offer. The offer exchange agent
will deliver cash and Quest Diagnostics shares in exchange for Unilab shares
pursuant to the offer and cash instead of fractional Quest Diagnostics shares as
soon as practicable after receipt of our notice. The offer exchange agent will
act as agent for tendering Unilab stockholders for the purpose of receiving
Quest Diagnostics shares and cash (including cash to be paid instead of
fractional Quest Diagnostics shares) from us and transmitting such shares and
cash, if any, to you. YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE ANY INTEREST ON ANY CASH THAT WE PAY
YOU, EVEN IF THERE IS A DELAY IN MAKING THE EXCHANGE.

     If we do not accept any tendered Unilab shares for exchange for any reason
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the offer, or if certificates are
submitted for more Unilab shares than are tendered, we will return certificates
for such unexchanged Unilab shares without expense to the tendering stockholder
or, in the case of Unilab shares tendered by book-entry transfer of unexchanged
Unilab shares into the offer exchange agent's account at the Book-Entry Transfer
Facility pursuant to the procedures set forth above under the section entitled
"Procedure for Tendering and Electing", those Unilab shares will be credited to
an account maintained within the Book-Entry Transfer Facility, as soon as
practicable following expiration or termination of the offer.

     We reserve the right to transfer or assign, from time to time, in whole or
in part, to one or more of our wholly owned subsidiaries, the right to purchase
all or any of the Unilab shares tendered pursuant to the offer, but any such
transfer or assignment will not relieve us of our obligations under the offer
and will not prejudice your rights to receive Quest Diagnostics shares and/or
cash in exchange for Unilab shares validly tendered and accepted for exchange
pursuant to the offer.

CASH INSTEAD OF FRACTIONAL QUEST DIAGNOSTICS SHARES

     We will not issue certificates representing fractional Quest Diagnostics
shares. Instead, each tendering stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to a
fractional Quest Diagnostics share will receive cash in an amount equal to that
fraction multiplied by the then prevailing price on the New York Stock Exchange
for a Quest Diagnostics share, as determined by the price received by the offer
exchange agent for such fractional shares, after all fractional shares have been
aggregated and sold by the offer exchange agent through one or more member firms
of the New York Stock Exchange.

EXCHANGE FUND; DISTRIBUTIONS ON QUEST DIAGNOSTICS SHARES

     Prior to the date on which Purchaser accepts for payment or exchange all
Unilab shares, Parent will deposit into an exchange fund administered by the
offer exchange agent, referred to as the offer exchange fund, cash and
certificates representing Quest Diagnostics shares that will be payable in the
offer. The offer exchange agent will, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, make
cash payments and deliver the Quest Diagnostics shares contemplated to be issued
pursuant to the offer out of the offer exchange fund. Any cash and Quest
Diagnostics shares remaining in the offer exchange fund seven business days
following the date on which Purchaser accepts for payment or exchange all Unilab
shares will be returned to Quest Diagnostics, which will then be responsible to
make payments to Unilab stockholders that have validly tendered their Unilab
shares pursuant to the offer.

CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

     The following is a general summary of certain United States federal income
tax consequences to Unilab stockholders that exchange Unilab shares for Quest
Diagnostics shares and/or cash pursuant to the offer and the merger. This
discussion is based on provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, and administrative and
judicial interpretations thereof, all as in

effect as of the date hereof and all of which are subject to change, possibly
with retroactive effect. This discussion does not address all aspects of United
States federal income taxation that may be applicable to Unilab stockholders in
light of their particular circumstances or to Unilab stockholders subject to
special treatment under United States federal income tax law (including, without
limitation, partnerships, certain financial institutions, insurance companies,
tax-exempt entities, dealers in securities, traders in securities that elect to
apply a mark-to-market method of accounting, certain U.S. expatriates, persons
that hold Unilab shares as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion transaction or
other integrated investment, Unilab stockholders whose functional currency is
not the United States dollar and Unilab stockholders who acquired Unilab shares
through the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation).

     This discussion is limited to Unilab stockholders that hold their Unilab
shares as capital assets and does not consider the tax treatment of Unilab
stockholders that hold Unilab shares through a partnership or other pass-through
entity. In addition, this summary does not discuss any aspect of state, local or
foreign taxation.

     We expect that the offer and the merger will be treated as a single
integrated transaction for United States federal income tax purposes. If the
offer and the merger are so treated and assuming that the merger is effected as
a tax-free forward merger of Unilab with and into Purchaser or as a tax-free
reverse merger of Purchaser with and into Unilab, then the offer and such merger
are expected to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. As such, the United States federal income
tax consequences of the offer and the merger can be generally summarized as
follows:

     - Exchange of Unilab Shares Solely for Quest Diagnostics Shares.  A Unilab
       stockholder that exchanges all of his or her Unilab shares for Quest
       Diagnostics shares pursuant to the offer and/or the merger will not
       recognize any gain or loss except with respect to cash received in lieu
       of fractional Quest Diagnostics shares.

     - Exchange of Unilab Shares Solely for Cash or for Cash and Quest
       Diagnostics Shares.  A Unilab stockholder that exchanges all of his or
       her Unilab shares for cash pursuant to the offer generally will recognize
       capital gain or loss measured by the difference between the amount of
       cash received and the adjusted tax basis of such Unilab shares exchanged
       therefor. A Unilab stockholder that exchanges his or her Unilab shares
       for Quest Diagnostics shares pursuant to the offer and/or the merger and
       cash pursuant to the offer will recognize gain (but not loss) in an
       amount equal to the lesser of (1) the amount of cash received pursuant to
       the offer and (2) an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the sum
       of the amount of cash received pursuant to the offer and the fair market
       value of the Quest Diagnostics shares received pursuant to the offer
       and/or the merger over (b) the stockholder's adjusted tax basis in his or
       her Unilab shares. The gain recognized will be capital gain unless the
       receipt of cash by the stockholder has the effect of a distribution of a
       dividend, in which case such gain will be treated as ordinary dividend
       income to the extent of the stockholder's ratable share of accumulated
       earnings and profits as calculated for United States federal income tax
       purposes. The Internal Revenue Service has indicated in rulings that any
       reduction in the interest of a minority stockholder that owns a small
       number of shares in a publicly and widely held corporation and that
       exercises no control over corporate affairs would not be treated as
       having the effect of a distribution of a dividend and thus would result
       in capital gains (as opposed to dividend) treatment. In determining
       whether the receipt of cash has the effect of a distribution of a
       dividend, certain constructive ownership rules must be taken into
       account.

     - Tax Basis for Quest Diagnostics Shares.  A Unilab stockholder will have
       an aggregate tax basis in the Quest Diagnostics shares received pursuant
       to the offer and/or the merger equal to the stockholder's aggregate
       adjusted tax basis in his or her Unilab shares surrendered pursuant to
       the offer and/or the merger (1) reduced by (a) the portion of the
       stockholder's adjusted tax basis in his or her Unilab shares surrendered
       in the offer and/or the merger that is allocable to fractional Quest
       Diagnostics shares for which cash is received and (b) the amount of cash,
       if any, received by the stockholder pursuant to the offer and (2)
       increased by the amount of gain (including any portion of such gain that
       is treated as a dividend as described above), if any, recognized by the
       stockholder (but not including the gain recognized upon the receipt of
       cash received in lieu of fractional Quest Diagnostics shares pursuant to
       the offer).

     - Holding Period for Quest Diagnostics Shares.  The holding period for
       Quest Diagnostics shares received by a Unilab stockholder pursuant to the
       offer and/or the merger will include the holding period for the Unilab
       shares surrendered in the offer and/or the merger.

     - Cash Received in Lieu of Fractional Quest Diagnostics Shares.  If a
       Unilab stockholder receives cash in lieu of fractional Quest Diagnostics
       shares in the offer and/or the merger, the stockholder generally will
       recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount
       of cash received in lieu of the Quest Diagnostics fractional shares and
       the portion of the stockholder's adjusted tax basis in his or her Unilab
       shares surrendered that is allocable to the fractional shares.

     Any recognized capital gain on the exchanges described above will be
long-term capital gain if the stockholder's holding period with respect to his
or her Unilab shares exceeds one year.

     Under the merger agreement, Quest Diagnostics and Unilab have each agreed
to seek an opinion of its respective counsel, Shearman & Sterling, counsel to
Quest Diagnostics, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, counsel to
Unilab, that based upon the facts provided by Quest Diagnostics and Unilab and
customary representations and assumptions, among other things, the offer and the
merger will be treated as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, which we refer to as the tax opinions.
Quest Diagnostics and Unilab each expect to be able to obtain its respective tax
opinion if:

     - as expected, the proposed merger occurs in the ordinary course after
       completion of the offer,

     - Quest Diagnostics and Unilab are able to deliver to counsel customary
       representations as to certain factual matters relevant to the offer and
       the merger,

     - there is no adverse change in the United States federal income tax law,
       and

     - if (A) the transaction is effected as a forward merger, immediately prior
       to the effective time of the forward merger, the aggregate market value
       of all Quest Diagnostics shares payable to Unilab stockholders upon
       consummation of the offer and the merger, based upon the lower of the
       closing price of Quest Diagnostics shares on the New York Stock Exchange
       Composite Tape on the date immediately prior to the effective time of the
       merger or the date that Quest Diagnostics accepts Unilab shares for
       payment or exchange pursuant to the offer, which we refer to as the stock
       value, is not less than 42% of the sum of the stock value and all cash
       payable to Unilab stockholders upon consummation of the offer and the
       merger; or (B) the transaction is effected as a reverse merger, (i) the
       aggregate value of all cash payable to Unilab stockholders upon
       consummation of the offer and the merger is less than 18% of the
       aggregate value of the stock value and all cash payable to Unilab
       stockholders upon consummation of the offer and the merger, and (ii)
       Unilab stockholders constituting more than 82% of the outstanding Unilab
       shares exchange such shares solely for Quest Diagnostics shares in the
       offer and the merger.

     Receipt of the tax opinions is not a condition to completing the offer or
the forward merger but is a condition to the completion of the tax-free reverse
merger. If Quest Diagnostics and Unilab obtain the tax opinions, then the merger
will be effected as a forward merger or as a tax-free reverse merger depending
upon which of the above conditions are satisfied. If, however, Quest Diagnostics
or Unilab is not able to obtain its respective tax opinion, then Quest
Diagnostics expects that it will exercise its discretion to change the merger in
form to a taxable reverse merger, which, as summarized below, will be a fully
taxable transaction for all holders of Unilab shares, but not for Quest
Diagnostics, Purchaser or Unilab.

     If the taxable reverse merger is consummated, the tax consequences to
Unilab stockholders would differ materially from those summarized above. In
general, each Unilab stockholder will recognize capital gain or loss in the
offer and/or the taxable reverse merger in an amount equal to the difference
between (1) the sum of the amount of cash received pursuant to the offer and the
fair market value of Quest Diagnostics shares received pursuant to the offer
and/or the taxable reverse merger, and (2) the stockholder's adjusted tax basis
in his or her Unilab shares. The capital gain or loss will be long-term capital
gain or loss if the stockholder had held such Unilab shares for more than one
year.

     The determination by counsel as to whether the offer and the tax-free
merger will be treated as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code will depend upon the facts and law existing
at the effective time of the proposed merger. It is possible that Quest
Diagnostics and/or Unilab will not be able to obtain its respective tax opinion.
An opinion of counsel is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or any
court. Thus, no assurance can be given that the merger will be a tax-free merger
as opposed to a taxable reverse merger.

     THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION IS INTENDED ONLY AS A SUMMARY AND DOES NOT PURPORT
TO BE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR LISTING OF ALL POTENTIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX
CONSEQUENCES OF THE OFFER AND THE MERGER. UNILAB STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO
CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL
AND FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE OFFER AND THE MERGER TO THEM.

PURPOSE OF THE OFFER

     Purpose.  We are making the offer to acquire at least 50.1% of the
outstanding Unilab shares on a fully diluted basis. The purpose of our offer is
for Quest Diagnostics to acquire control of, and ultimately the entire common
equity interest in, Unilab. As promptly as practicable after completion of the
offer, we intend to complete a merger with Unilab in which each outstanding
Unilab share that is not exchanged in the offer (except for any Unilab shares
held in Unilab's treasury and any Unilab shares held by Quest Diagnostics,
Purchaser or Unilab stockholders who perfect their appraisal rights, if
available) will be converted into 0.3256 of a Quest Diagnostics share. If your
Unilab shares are not exchanged in the offer and the merger occurs, you will
receive 0.3256 of a Quest Diagnostics share pursuant to the merger, the receipt
of which may be delayed due to the possibility of a delay in completing the
merger after completion of the offer. NOTWITHSTANDING THE AMOUNT, IF ANY, OF
CASH PAID IN THE OFFER, STOCKHOLDERS WHO DO NOT TENDER THEIR UNILAB SHARES IN
THE OFFER WILL NOT RECEIVE ANY CASH CONSIDERATION IN EXCHANGE FOR THEIR UNILAB
SHARES IN THE MERGER (EXCEPT FOR CASH, IF ANY, THAT IS PAID IN LIEU OF
FRACTIONAL QUEST DIAGNOSTICS SHARES OR FOLLOWING THE EXERCISE OF APPRAISAL
RIGHTS, IF APPLICABLE).

     As of the date of this prospectus neither Quest Diagnostics nor, to our
knowledge, the directors and executive officers of Quest Diagnostics own any
Unilab shares.

THE MERGER

     Approval of the Merger.  Under Section 251 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, or DGCL, the approval of the board of directors of a company
and the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of its outstanding shares
are required to approve and adopt a merger agreement. The Unilab board of
directors has previously approved the merger. If we complete the offer and the
minimum tender condition has been satisfied, we would have a sufficient number
of Unilab shares to approve the merger without the affirmative vote of any other
holder of Unilab shares. Therefore, unless the merger is consummated in
accordance with the short-form merger provisions under the DGCL (described
below), the only remaining required corporate action of Unilab will be the
approval and adoption of the merger agreement by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the outstanding Unilab shares, which will require a longer period of
time to effect than would be the case with a short-form merger. This is referred
to as a long-form merger.

     Possible Short-Form Merger.  Section 253 of the DGCL would permit the
merger to occur without a vote of Unilab's stockholders in a short-form merger
if Quest Diagnostics were to acquire at least 90% of the outstanding Unilab
shares in the offer. No action by the stockholders of Unilab, other than by
Quest Diagnostics acting as the 90% stockholder, will be required to consummate
the short-form merger.

     Unilab has advised Purchaser that, as of May 14, 2002, 33,573,700 Unilab
shares were issued and outstanding, 3,786,258 shares were reserved for issuance
pursuant to outstanding employee stock options, and no shares were held in
Unilab's treasury. As a result, as of such date, the minimum tender condition
would be satisfied if Purchaser acquired 18,717,339 Unilab shares in the offer.
Also, as of such date, Purchaser could cause a short-form merger to become
effective in accordance with the DGCL, without a meeting of Unilab's
stockholders, if Purchaser acquired 30,216,330 Unilab shares in the offer,
assuming no exercise of outstanding Unilab stock options.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Unilab stockholders do not have appraisal rights in connection with the
offer. If we complete the offer but less than 90% of the outstanding Unilab
shares are validly tendered and not withdrawn in the offer, we intend to effect
a long-form merger (as described above) as permitted under Section 251 of the
DGCL. Unilab stockholders who have not exchanged their Unilab shares in the
offer will not have appraisal rights in connection with a long-form merger.

     However, if at least 90% of the outstanding Unilab shares are validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn in the offer, we intend to effect a
short-form merger pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL, and Unilab stockholders
at the time of the short-form merger will have the right under Section 262 of
the DGCL to dissent and demand appraisal of their Unilab shares. Under Section
262 of the DGCL, dissenting stockholders who comply with the applicable
statutory procedures may be entitled to receive a judicial determination of the
fair value of their Unilab shares, exclusive of any element of value arising
from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, and to receive payment of
this fair value in cash, together with a fair rate of interest, if any. We
cannot assure you as to the methodology a court would use to determine fair
value or how a court would select which of the elements of value are to be
included in such a determination.

     The foregoing is not a complete statement of the law relating to appraisal
rights and is qualified in its entirety by the summary of procedures for seeking
appraisal rights, which is set out in Annex C to this prospectus and
incorporated herein by reference, and the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL,
which is reprinted in its entirety after the summary in Annex C to this
prospectus and incorporated herein by reference.

CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER

     The offer is subject to a number of conditions. These conditions are
described below:

     Minimum Tender Condition.  There must be validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn prior to the expiration of the offer the number of Unilab shares that
will constitute at least 50.1% of the aggregate number of outstanding Unilab
shares on a fully diluted basis (as though all options exercisable for Unilab
shares had been converted, exercised or exchanged) as of the date that we accept
the Unilab shares pursuant to our offer. Based on information supplied by
Unilab, the number of Unilab shares needed to satisfy the minimum tender
condition would have been 18,717,339 as of May 14, 2002.

     Antitrust Condition.  All waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino

          Diagnostics or Purchaser to effectively exercise full rights of
          ownership of any Unilab shares to be accepted in the offer on all
          matters properly presented to Unilab's stockholders, including,
          without limitation, the approval and adoption of the merger agreement
          and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

          2.  there having been:

        - any law enacted, promulgated, amended, issued or deemed applicable to
          (i) Quest Diagnostics, Unilab or any of their respective subsidiaries
          or (ii) any transaction contemplated by the merger agreement, or

        - any order of any kind entered, promulgated or enforced by any court or
          governmental authority, which prohibits, restrains, restricts or
          enjoins the consummation of the offer or has the effect of making the
          offer illegal, in each case, by any legislative body or governmental
          authority that would result, directly or indirectly, in any of the
          consequences referred to in paragraph (1) above;

          3.  there having occurred:

        - a declaration of a banking moratorium or any suspension of payments in
          respect of banks in the United States, or

        - any limitation, whether or not mandatory, by any governmental
          authority on the extension of credit by banks or other lending
          institutions;

          4.  other than with respect to any order that is the subject of
     paragraph (1) or (2) above, there having been enacted, entered, promulgated
     or enforced by any court or governmental authority any order which
     prohibits, restrains, restricts or enjoins the consummation of the offer or
     has the effect of making the offer illegal;

          5.  either:

        - Unilab having breached or failed to perform in any material respect
          its obligations, covenants or agreements under the merger agreement,

        - the representations and warranties of Unilab contained in the merger
          agreement that are qualified by reference to a Unilab material adverse
          effect (as defined in the merger agreement -- see "The Merger
          Agreement -- Representations and Warranties") not having been true and
          correct when made or as of the date when Quest Diagnostics accepts
          Unilab shares for payment as if made at or at and as of such time
          (other than representations and warranties which by their terms
          address matters only as of another specified date, which will be true
          and correct only as of such date), or

        - the representations and warranties of Unilab contained in the merger
          agreement that are not so qualified not having been true and correct
          when made or as of the date when Quest Diagnostics accepts Unilab
          shares for payment as if made at or at and as of such time (other than
          representations and warranties which by their terms address matters
          only as of another specified date, which will be true and correct only
          as of such date), except in the case of this bullet only, for such
          inaccuracies as have not resulted, or are not reasonably likely to
          result, in a Unilab material adverse effect;

          6.  there not having occurred or exist any events, circumstances,
     changes, occurrences, facts or effects that have had or would reasonably be
     expected to have a Unilab material adverse effect (as defined in the merger
     agreement); and

          7.  the merger agreement not having been terminated in accordance with
     its terms,

which, in our reasonable judgment in any such case, and regardless of the
circumstances (including any action or inaction by Quest Diagnostics or any of
its affiliates) giving rise to any such condition, makes it inadvisable to
proceed with such acceptance for exchange or payment.

     The conditions to the offer described above are solely for our benefit and
we may assert them regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such
conditions. We may, in our sole discretion, waive these conditions in whole or
in part, other than the minimum tender condition. The determination as to
whether any condition has been satisfied will be in our reasonable judgment and
will be final and binding on all parties. The failure by us at any time to
exercise any of the foregoing rights will not be deemed a waiver of any such
right and each such right will be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted
at any time and from time to time.

     Conditions to Acceptance of Unilab Shares for Payment or Exchange.  In
addition to the conditions to the offer described above and notwithstanding
anything else to the contrary contained in the merger agreement, among other
things, Quest Diagnostics will not (unless Unilab notifies Quest Diagnostics
otherwise) be permitted to accept for payment or exchange any Unilab shares
pursuant to the offer if, at such time,

     - Quest Diagnostics has breached or failed to perform in any material
       respect its obligations, covenants or agreements under the merger
       agreement,

     - the representations and warranties of Quest Diagnostics contained in the
       merger agreement that are qualified by reference to a Quest Diagnostics
       material adverse effect (as defined in the merger agreement -- see "The
       Merger Agreement -- Representations and Warranties") were not true and
       correct when made or as of the date when Quest Diagnostics accepts Unilab
       shares for payment as if made at or at and as of such time (other than
       representations and warranties which by their terms address matters only
       as of another specified date, which will be true and correct only as of
       such date), or

     - the representations and warranties of Quest Diagnostics contained in the
       merger agreement that are not so qualified were not true and correct when
       made or as of the date when Quest Diagnostics accepts Unilab shares for
       payment as if made at or at and as of such time (other than
       representations and warranties which by their terms address matters only
       as of another specified date, which will be true and correct only as of
       such date), except in the case of this bullet only, for such inaccuracies
       that have not resulted, or are not reasonably likely to result, in a
       Quest Diagnostics material adverse effect.

REGULATORY APPROVALS

     Based upon our examination of publicly available information with respect
to Unilab and review of certain information furnished by Unilab, and based upon
discussions between our representatives and representatives of Unilab during our
investigation of Unilab, see "Background of the Offer", except as set forth
herein, we are not aware of any licenses or regulatory permits that appear to be
material to the business of Unilab and its subsidiary, taken as a whole, and
that might be adversely affected by our acquisition of Unilab shares in the
offer. In addition, except as set forth herein, we are not aware of any
non-routine approvals or other consents by or from any governmental authority or
administrative or regulatory agency that would be

required to consummate our acquisition or ownership of the Unilab shares. Should
any such approval or other action be required, we expect to seek such approval
or action, except as described under "State Takeover Laws". Should any such
approval or other action be required, we cannot be certain that we would be able
to obtain any such approval or action without substantial conditions or that
adverse consequences might not result to Unilab's business, or that certain
parts of Unilab's, Quest Diagnostics' or any of their respective subsidiaries'
businesses might not have to be disposed of or held separate in order to obtain
such approval or action. In that event, we may not be required to purchase any
Unilab shares in the offer.

     State Takeover Laws.  Unilab is incorporated under the laws of the State of
Delaware. In general, Section 203 of the DGCL prevents an "interested
stockholder", generally a person who owns or has the right to acquire 15% or
more of a corporation's outstanding voting stock, or an affiliate or associate
thereof, from engaging in a "business combination", which includes mergers and
certain other transactions, with a Delaware corporation for a period of three
years following the date such person became an interested stockholder unless,
among other things, prior to such date the board of directors of the corporation
approved either the business combination or the transaction in which the
interested stockholder became an interested stockholder. UNILAB HAS OPTED OUT OF
SECTION 203 IN ITS CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION. ACCORDINGLY, SECTION 203 IS
INAPPLICABLE TO THE OFFER AND THE MERGER.

     A number of states have adopted takeover laws and regulations that purport
to be applicable to attempts to acquire securities of corporations that are
incorporated in those states or that have substantial assets, shareholders,
principal executive offices or principal places of business in those states.
Except as described herein, we do not know whether any of these laws will, by
their terms, apply to the offer and the merger and we have not complied with any
such laws. To the extent that these state takeover statutes purport to apply to
the offer or the merger, we believe that there are reasonable bases for
contesting such laws.

     In 1982, the Supreme Court of the United States, in Edgar v. Mite Corp.,
invalidated on constitutional grounds the Illinois Business Takeovers Statute,
which, as a matter of state securities law, made takeovers of corporations
meeting certain requirements more difficult. The reasoning in that decision is
likely to apply to certain other state takeover statutes. In 1987, however, in
CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of America, the Supreme Court of the United States
held that the State of Indiana could as a matter of corporate law and, in
particular, those aspects of corporate law concerning corporate governance,
constitutionally disqualify a potential acquiror from voting on the affairs of a
target corporation without the prior approval of the remaining shareholders, as
long as those laws were applicable only under certain conditions. Subsequently,
in TLX Acquisition Corp. v. Telex Corp., a federal district court in Oklahoma
ruled that the Oklahoma statutes were unconstitutional insofar as they apply to
corporations incorporated outside Oklahoma, because they would subject those
corporations to inconsistent regulations. Similarly, in Tyson Foods, Inc. v.
McReynolds, a federal district court in Tennessee ruled that four Tennessee
takeover statutes were unconstitutional as applied to corporations incorporated
outside Tennessee. This decision was affirmed by the United States Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. In December 1988, a federal district court in
Florida held, in Grand Metropolitan plc v. Butterworth, that the provisions of
the Florida Affiliated Transactions Act and Florida Control Share Acquisition
Act were unconstitutional as applied to corporations incorporated outside of
Florida. Based upon these decisions, we believe that there would be a reasonable
basis for contesting state takeover laws which may be attempted to be enforced
in connection with the offer and the merger.

     Antitrust.  Under the HSR Act and the rules that have been promulgated
thereunder by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, certain acquisition
transactions may not be consummated unless specified information has been
furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, referred to
herein as the Antitrust Division, and the FTC and certain waiting period
requirements have been satisfied. The exchange of Unilab shares for cash and
Quest Diagnostics shares pursuant to the offer is subject to such requirements.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the HSR Act, Quest Diagnostics and Unilab
filed a Premerger Notification and Report Form with respect to the offer with
the Antitrust Division and the FTC on April 24, 2002 and April 22, 2002,
respectively.

     Under the provisions of the HSR Act applicable to our offer, we may not
consummate the purchase of Unilab shares until the expiration, or earlier
termination, of a 30-calendar day waiting period following the filing by Quest
Diagnostics.

     Accordingly, the waiting period under the HSR Act applicable to the
purchase of Unilab shares pursuant to the offer will expire at 11:59 p.m., New
York City time, on May 24, 2002, unless the FTC and the Antitrust Division
grants early termination of such waiting period or the FTC or the Antitrust
Division extends such waiting period by requesting additional information or
documentary material prior to the expiration of the waiting period. Pursuant to
the HSR Act, we have requested early termination of the waiting period
applicable to the offer. There can be no assurance that the 30-calendar day HSR
Act waiting period will be terminated early. If either the FTC or the Antitrust
Division requests additional information or documentary material from Quest
Diagnostics with respect to the offer, the waiting period with respect to the
offer would expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the thirtieth calendar
day (or the first business day thereafter) after the date of substantial
compliance with such request. If the acquisition of Unilab shares is delayed
pursuant to a request by the FTC or the Antitrust Division for additional
information or documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act, we must extend the
offer in increments up to September 30, 2002 and, in any event, the purchase of
and payment for Unilab shares will be deferred until at least 30 days after the
request is substantially complied with, unless the merger agreement is earlier
terminated in accordance with its terms or unless the waiting period is sooner
terminated by the FTC or the Antitrust Division, as applicable. Only one
extension of such waiting period pursuant to a request for additional
information is authorized by the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder.
Thereafter, the consummation of the offer and the merger could be enjoined
preliminarily or permanently by a court order on antitrust or competition
grounds, or temporarily with the consent of Quest Diagnostics and Unilab. Any
such extension of the waiting period, entry of a court injunction, or decision
by Quest Diagnostics and Unilab to postpone the consummation of the offer will
not give rise to any withdrawal rights not otherwise provided for by applicable
law and outlined in this prospectus. See "Withdrawal Rights and Change of
Election". It is a condition to the offer that the waiting period applicable
under the HSR Act to the offer expire or be terminated. See "The
Offer -- Conditions to the Offer" on page 46.

     The FTC and the Antitrust Division scrutinize the legality under the
antitrust laws of transactions such as our proposed acquisition of Unilab
pursuant to the offer and merger. At any time before or after the acquisition of
Unilab shares pursuant to the offer by Purchaser, the FTC or the Antitrust
Division could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary
or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the acquisition
of Unilab shares pursuant to the offer or seeking the divestiture of Unilab
shares purchased by Purchaser or the divestiture of substantial assets of Quest
Diagnostics, Unilab or their respective subsidiaries. Private parties and state
attorneys general may also bring legal action under federal or state antitrust
laws under certain circumstances. Based upon an examination of information
available to us relating to the businesses in which Quest Diagnostics, Unilab
and their respective subsidiaries are engaged, we believe that the acquisition
of Unilab shares will not violate the antitrust laws. Nevertheless, there can be
no assurance that a challenge to the offer on antitrust grounds will not be made
or, if such a challenge is made, what the result would be. See "The
Offer -- Conditions to the Offer" on page 46 for a description of certain
conditions to the offer, including conditions with respect to litigation.

CERTAIN EFFECTS OF THE OFFER

     Reduced Liquidity; Possible Delisting.  The tender of Unilab shares
pursuant to the offer will reduce the number of holders of Unilab shares, and
the number of Unilab shares that might otherwise trade publicly, and could
adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the remaining Unilab shares
held by the public.

     Nasdaq National Market Listing.  Depending upon the number of Unilab shares
purchased in the offer, Unilab shares may no longer meet the requirements of the
National Association of Securities Dealers for continued inclusion on the Nasdaq
National Market, which requires that an issuer either:

     - have at least 750,000 publicly held shares, held by at least 400 round
       lot stockholders, with a market value of at least $5,000,000, have at
       least two market makers, have net tangible assets of at least

       $4 million (although this criteria remains effective only until November
       1, 2002), and have a minimum bid price of $1, or

     - have at least 1,100,000 publicly held shares, held by at least 400 round
       lot stockholders, with a market value of at least $15,000,000, have a
       minimum bid price of $5, have at least 4 market makers and have either
       (x) a market capitalization of at least $50,000,000 or (y) a total of at
       least $50,000,000 in assets and revenues, respectively.

     If the Nasdaq National Market ceased publishing quotations for Unilab
shares, it is possible that Unilab shares would continue to trade in the
over-the-counter market and that price or other quotations would be reported by
other sources. The extent of the public market for such Unilab shares and the
availability of such quotations would depend, however, upon such factors as the
number of stockholders and/or the aggregate market value of such shares
remaining at such time, the interest in maintaining a market in the Unilab
shares on the part of securities firms, the possible termination of registration
under the Exchange Act as described below, and other factors. We cannot predict
whether the reduction in the number of Unilab shares that might otherwise trade
publicly would have an adverse or beneficial effect on the market price for, or
marketability of, the Unilab shares or whether it would cause future market
prices to be greater or lesser than the price we are presently offering.

     We intend to cause the delisting of Unilab shares from the Nasdaq National
Market following consummation of the offer and the merger.

     Status as "Margin Securities".  Unilab shares are presently "margin
securities" under the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, which, among
other things, allows brokers to extend credit on the collateral of Unilab
shares. Depending on the factors similar to those described above with respect
to listing and market quotations, following consummation of the offer, Unilab
shares may no longer constitute "margin securities" for the purposes of the
Federal Reserve Board's margin regulations, in which event Unilab shares would
be ineligible as collateral for margin loans made by brokers.

     Going Private Transactions.  The SEC has adopted Rule 13e-3 under the
Exchange Act which is applicable to certain "going private" transactions and
which may under certain circumstances be applicable to the merger or another
business combination following the purchase of Unilab shares pursuant to the
offer in which we seek to acquire the remaining shares of Unilab shares not held
by us. We believe that Rule 13e-3 will not be applicable to the merger. Rule
13e-3 requires, among other things, that certain financial information
concerning Unilab and certain information relating to the fairness of the
proposed transaction and the consideration offered to minority shareholders in
such transaction be filed with the SEC and disclosed to stockholders prior to
consummation of the merger or other business combination.

     Registration Under the Exchange Act.  Unilab shares are currently
registered under the Exchange Act. Unilab can terminate that registration upon
application to the SEC if the outstanding shares are not listed on a national
securities exchange and if there are fewer than 300 holders of record of Unilab
shares. Termination of registration of Unilab shares under the Exchange Act
would reduce the information that Unilab must furnish to its stockholders and to
the SEC and would make certain provisions of the Exchange Act, such as the
short-swing profit recovery provisions of Section 16(b) and the requirement of
furnishing a proxy statement in connection with stockholders meetings pursuant
to Section 14(a) and the related requirement of furnishing an annual report to
stockholders, no longer applicable with respect to all Unilab shares. In
addition, if Unilab shares are no longer registered under the Exchange Act, the
requirements of Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act with respect to
"going-private" transactions would no longer be applicable to Unilab.
Furthermore, the ability of "affiliates" of Unilab and persons holding
"restricted securities" of Unilab to dispose of such securities pursuant to Rule
144 under the Securities Act may be impaired or eliminated. If registration of
the Unilab shares under the Exchange Act were terminated, they would no longer
be eligible for Nasdaq National Market listing or for continued inclusion on the
Federal Reserve Board's list of "margin securities". We currently intend to
terminate the registration of the Unilab shares under the Exchange Act as soon
after consummation of the offer as the requirements for such termination are
met.

SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS

     Assuming that 30% of the Unilab shares outstanding prior to the expiration
of the offer are exchanged for cash in the offer and that the balance of the
Unilab shares are exchanged for Quest Diagnostics shares in the offer and the
merger, the aggregate cash required by Purchaser to consummate the offer and the
merger and to pay related fees and expenses of both Purchaser and Unilab is
estimated to be approximately $316 million. Pursuant to a commitment letter,
dated March 27, 2002, Bank of America, N.A. and Merrill Lynch Capital
Corporation have agreed to lend Quest Diagnostics an aggregate amount of $550
million in the form of a syndicated bridge loan facility in connection with the
offer and the merger. Quest Diagnostics expects to use a portion of the proceeds
of the bridge financing to pay the cash consideration and the fees and expenses
of the offer and the merger. The offer is not conditioned upon the bridge
financing or any other financing being obtained.

     Under the bridge loan facility, the $550 million will be available as a
term loan with an original maturity of 364 days from the date of execution of
definitive loan documentation, at which date the bridge loan facility will
terminate and all amounts outstanding will become due and payable in full. The
bridge loan facility will be available, at the option of Quest Diagnostics, in
up to three borrowings.

     Quest Diagnostics may prepay the bridge loan facility, in whole or in part
at any time without penalty, and the unutilized portion of the bridge loan
facility may be irrevocably cancelled, in whole or in part, upon three days
prior written notice by Quest Diagnostics.

     Quest Diagnostics, at its option, may elect that the loans comprising each
borrowing bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the ABR or the Eurodollar
Rate plus an applicable margin that is dependent on Quest Diagnostics' debt
rating. For purposes of the bridge loan facility, "ABR" means the higher of (i)
the rate of interest publicly announced by Bank of America as its prime rate in
effect at its principal office in Charlotte, NC, and (ii) the federal funds
effective rate from time to time plus 0.5%. All per annum rates will be
calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days (or 365/366 days, in the case of
ABR loans) for actual days elapsed. During the occurrence of any payment default
under the bridge loan facility, the rate of interest applicable to each
outstanding loan will be increased by 2%.

     For further information with respect to the bridge loan facility, we refer
you to the commitment letter, which is incorporated herein by reference.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE MERGER

     The merger of Unilab with Purchaser will be accounted for as a "purchase",
as such term is used under accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States, commonly referred to as "GAAP", for accounting and financial
reporting purposes. Unilab will be treated as the acquired corporation for such
purposes. Therefore, the total merger consideration paid by Quest Diagnostics in
connection with the merger, together with the direct costs of the merger, will
be allocated to Unilab's assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair
market values, with any excess being accounted for as goodwill.

     We have prepared the unaudited pro forma combined financial information
contained in this prospectus using the purchase accounting method to account for
the merger. See "Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements" on page 80.

FEES AND EXPENSES

     Quest Diagnostics has retained Merrill Lynch to act as dealer manager in
connection with the offer and to provide certain financial advisory services to
Quest Diagnostics in connection with the offer and the merger. Merrill Lynch
will receive customary compensation for these services and will be reimbursed
for out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable expenses of counsel and other
advisors. We have agreed to indemnify Merrill Lynch and related persons against
certain liabilities and expenses in connection with their services as the dealer
managers and financial advisors, including certain liabilities and expenses
under the federal securities laws. Merrill Lynch is currently engaged by Quest
Diagnostics and has in the past provided, and may in the future provide,
financial advisory and financing services to Quest Diagnostics, including in
connection with

Quest Diagnostics' acquisition of AML, and has received, and may receive, fees
for rendering these services. In the ordinary course of Merrill Lynch's
business, Merrill Lynch and its affiliates may actively trade securities of
Quest Diagnostics and Unilab for their own accounts and for the accounts of
customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in
these securities.

     We have retained Georgeson Shareholder Communications, Inc. as information
agent in connection with the offer. The information agent may contact Unilab
stockholders by mail, telephone, telex, telegraph and personal interview and may
request brokers, dealers and other nominee stockholders to forward material
relating to the offer to beneficial owners of Unilab shares. We will pay the
information agent reasonable and customary compensation for these services in
addition to reimbursing the information agent for its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses. We have agreed to indemnify the information agent against certain
liabilities and expenses in connection with the offer, including certain
liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws.

     In addition, we have retained Computershare Trust Company of New York as
the offer exchange agent. We will pay the offer exchange agent reasonable and
customary compensation for its services in connection with the offer, will
reimburse the exchange agent for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and will
indemnify the offer exchange agent against certain liabilities and expenses,
including certain liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws.

     Except as set forth above, we will not pay any fees or commissions to any
broker, dealer or other person for soliciting tenders of Unilab shares pursuant
to the offer. We will reimburse brokers, dealers, commercial banks and trust
companies and other nominees, upon request, for customary clerical and mailing
expenses incurred by them in forwarding offering materials to their customers.

STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING

     Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol
"DGX". We will make an application to list on the New York Stock Exchange the
Quest Diagnostics shares that we will issue pursuant to the offer and the
merger.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF THE MATERIAL PROVISIONS OF THE
MERGER AGREEMENT. THIS SUMMARY IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE
COMPLETE TEXT OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, WHICH IS ATTACHED AS ANNEX A TO THIS
PROSPECTUS AND INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. ALL UNILAB STOCKHOLDERS ARE
URGED TO READ THE MERGER AGREEMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY BECAUSE IT IS THE LEGAL
DOCUMENT THAT GOVERNS THE OFFER AND THE MERGER.

THE OFFER

     Terms of the Offer.  The merger agreement provides for the commencement by
Purchaser of the offer to exchange 0.3256 of a Quest Diagnostics share, or to
pay an amount of $26.50 in cash, for each Unilab share that is validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn in the offer, subject to the proration and election
procedures described in this prospectus and the related letter of election and
transmittal. Under the merger agreement, Unilab stockholders may elect to
receive Quest Diagnostics shares or cash in exchange for each of their Unilab
shares, except that if the number of validly tendered and not withdrawn Unilab
shares electing to receive the cash consideration in the offer exceeds 30% of
the aggregate number of Unilab shares outstanding immediately prior to the
expiration date, then:

     - each validly tendered Unilab share electing to receive Quest Diagnostics
       shares in the offer will be exchanged for 0.3256 of a Quest Diagnostics
       share, and

     - each validly tendered Unilab share electing to receive the cash
       consideration will be exchanged for a pro rated combination of cash and
       Quest Diagnostics shares equal to the sum of:

      - an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) $26.50
        and (y) the cash fraction (as defined in "The Offer -- Basic Terms"),
        and

      - a number of Quest Diagnostics shares equal to the product of (x) 0.3256
        of a Quest Diagnostics share and (y) a fraction equal to one minus the
        cash fraction.

     In the event the number of Unilab shares, the holders of which have elected
to receive the cash consideration, is equal to or less than 30% of the aggregate
number of Unilab shares outstanding immediately prior to the expiration date,
then all such Unilab shares will be exchanged for $26.50 in cash, without
interest, and all shares, the holders of which have elected to receive Quest
Diagnostics shares, will be exchanged for 0.3256 of a Quest Diagnostics share.

     Conditions to the Offer.  Purchaser's obligation to accept for payment and
pay for any Unilab shares tendered in the offer is subject to the satisfaction
of the minimum tender condition and the other conditions that are described in
"The Offer -- Conditions to the Offer" on page 46. In addition, Purchaser is not
permitted to accept for payment or exchange any Unilab shares in the offer
unless, at such time, it has satisfied the conditions described in "The
Offer -- Conditions to the Offer -- Conditions to Acceptance of Unilab Shares
for Payment or Exchange" on page 46.

     Extension, Termination and Amendment.  Purchaser has expressly reserved the
right to waive any of the conditions to the offer or to make any changes in the
terms of or conditions to the offer, except that, without the consent of Unilab,
Purchaser is prohibited from:

     - decreasing the consideration payable in the offer,

     - changing the form of consideration to be paid in the offer to a form
       other than cash or Quest Diagnostics shares,

     - decreasing the aggregate amount of cash available in the offer or
       changing the relative amount of cash available in the offer,

     - reducing the number of Unilab shares to be purchased in the offer,

     - imposing conditions to the offer in addition to those set forth in the
       merger agreement,

     - modifying or waiving the minimum tender condition,

     - except pursuant to the merger agreement, changing the date on which the
       offer is scheduled to expire, or

     - making any other change that is adverse to the Unilab stockholders or to
       holders that have elected a particular form of consideration in the
       offer.

     The merger agreement provides that, unless Unilab otherwise agrees,
Purchaser must, or in the case of the third bullet below, has the option to,
extend the offer for one or more periods (not in excess of ten business days
each):

     - beyond the initial scheduled expiration date, up to September 30, 2002,
       if, at the scheduled or extended expiration date of the offer, any of the
       conditions to the offer have not been satisfied or, to the extent
       permitted, waived, until the conditions to the offer are satisfied or, to
       the extent permitted, waived,

     - for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
       position of the SEC or the SEC's staff applicable to the offer or any
       period required by applicable law, or

     - for an aggregate period of not more than ten business days beyond the
       latest applicable date that would otherwise be permitted under the first
       or second bullet above, if, as of the expiration date, all of the
       conditions to the offer have been satisfied or waived, but the number of
       Unilab shares validly tendered and not withdrawn equals more than 80%,
       but less than 90%, of the outstanding Unilab shares on a fully diluted
       basis.

     Purchaser will not be obligated to extend the offer pursuant to the first
bullet, but may elect to do so in accordance with the terms of the merger
agreement, if the minimum tender condition is not satisfied at the time such
extension would otherwise be required as long as certain other conditions to the
offer have been satisfied (which conditions are expressly set forth in the
merger agreement) and we have publicly announced such fact and our intention not
to extend the offer at least two business days prior to the date that the
extension would otherwise have been required. If Purchaser elects to extend the
expiration date pursuant to the third bullet above, we will be deemed to have
irrevocably waived all of the conditions to the offer set forth in full detail
under the caption "The Offer -- Conditions to the Offer". Except as provided in
the third bullet above, we are not permitted to extend the offer without the
prior written consent of Unilab at the time that all conditions to the offer
have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived.

     Prompt Payment for Unilab Shares After Closing of the Offer.  Subject to
the conditions of the offer, Purchaser will accept for payment and pay for, as
promptly as practicable after the expiration of the offer, all Unilab shares
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn in the offer.

     For a further description of the mechanics of the offer, please refer to
the section of this prospectus entitled "The Offer", beginning on page 35.

THE MERGER

     Terms of the Merger.  The merger agreement provides that Unilab will be
merged with and into Purchaser as promptly as practicable after the satisfaction
or, if permissible, waiver of the conditions to the merger set forth in the
merger agreement (but in no event later than two business days after all such
conditions have been satisfied or waived), and that Purchaser will be the
surviving corporation in the merger. However, if either of the conditions set
forth in (A) below, or all of the conditions set forth in (B) below, are
satisfied, then the merger may instead be effected, at Quest Diagnostics'
discretion, as a merger of Purchaser with and into Unilab, with Unilab being the
surviving corporation of the merger:

     - (A)(i) the aggregate value of all Quest Diagnostics shares payable to
       Unilab stockholders upon consummation of the offer and the merger, based
       upon the lower of the closing price of Quest Diagnostics shares on the
       New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape on the date immediately prior to
       the effective time of the merger or the date when Quest Diagnostics
       accepts the Unilab shares for payment pursuant to the offer, which we
       refer to as the stock value, would be less than 42% of the

       aggregate value of the stock value and all cash payable to Unilab
       stockholders upon consummation of the offer and the merger, or (ii) Quest
       Diagnostics and/or Unilab do not obtain a tax opinion, stating that the
       offer and the merger will be treated as a reorganization within the
       meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code; or

     - (B)(i) the aggregate value of all cash payable to Unilab stockholders
       upon consummation of the offer and the merger is less than 18% of the
       aggregate value of the stock value and all cash payable to Unilab
       stockholders upon consummation of the offer and the merger, (ii) Unilab
       stockholders holding more than 82% of the outstanding Unilab shares
       exchange such stock solely for Quest Diagnostics shares in the offer and
       the merger, and (iii) Quest Diagnostics and Unilab obtain tax opinions,
       stating that the offer and the merger will be treated as a reorganization
       within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

     Please be aware that the form of the merger effected may have important tax
consequences to you. See "The Offer -- Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences"
on page 42 for a discussion of the tax consequences of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.

     Effective Time of the Merger.  The merger will become effective upon the
filing of a certificate of merger or certificate of ownership and merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or such later time as is agreed
by Quest Diagnostics, Purchaser and Unilab and specified in the certificate of
merger or certificate of ownership and merger. The filing of the certificate of
merger or certificate of ownership and merger will take place as promptly as
practicable after satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of the conditions
described below under "Conditions to the Merger", but in no event later than two
business days after all such conditions have been satisfied or, if permissible,
waived.

     Certificate of Incorporation; By-Laws; Directors and Officers.  The
certificate of incorporation of Purchaser in effect immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger will be the certificate of incorporation of the
surviving corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions
of the certificate of incorporation and as provided under the DGCL. In the event
the direction of the merger is reversed, and Purchaser is merged with and into
Unilab, the certificate of incorporation of Unilab will be the certificate of
incorporation of the surviving corporation, but, by reason of the merger, will
at the effective time of the merger be amended and restated to read in its
entirety as that of Purchaser immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger. The by-laws of Purchaser in effect immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger will be the by-laws of the surviving corporation until
thereafter amended as provided under applicable Delaware law and in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation and such
by-laws.

     From and after the effective time of the merger and in each case until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, the
directors of Purchaser immediately prior to the effective time of the merger
will be the initial directors of the surviving corporation, and the officers of
Unilab immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will, subject to
the applicable provisions of the certificate of incorporation and the by-laws of
the surviving corporation, be the initial officers of the surviving corporation.

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

     Conversion of Unilab Stock.  At the effective time of the merger, by virtue
of the merger and without any action on the part of Quest Diagnostics,
Purchaser, Unilab or the holders thereof:

     - each Unilab share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
       effective time (other than shares held in Unilab's treasury, Unilab
       shares owned by Quest Diagnostics or Purchaser or any subsidiary of Quest
       Diagnostics or Purchaser and Unilab shares held by stockholders who have
       perfected their appraisal rights, if any) will be converted into the
       right to receive 0.3256 of a Quest Diagnostics share;

     - each share of Unilab restricted common stock issued and outstanding
       immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into the right
       to receive 0.3256 of a Quest Diagnostics share, which will be subject to
       identical vesting and forfeiture provisions that were applicable to the
       shares of Unilab restricted common stock immediately prior to the
       effective time of the merger; and

     - each Unilab share held in Unilab's treasury or owned by Quest
       Diagnostics, Purchaser or any wholly owned subsidiary of Quest
       Diagnostics or Purchaser will be cancelled and retired and will cease to
       exist and no consideration will be paid in exchange for them.

     As of the effective time of the merger, all Unilab shares and shares of
Unilab restricted common stock will no longer be outstanding and will
automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and each holder
of a certificate representing any such shares will cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration described above.

     Exchange of Certificates.  From and after the effective time of the merger,
Quest Diagnostics will deposit, or cause to be deposited, into an exchange fund
administered by Computershare Trust Company of New York or a bank or trust
company designated by Quest Diagnostics that is reasonably satisfactory to
Unilab, which we refer to as the exchange agent, certificates representing Quest
Diagnostics shares issuable to Unilab stockholders in the merger. The exchange
agent will then, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Quest
Diagnostics shares exchangeable in the merger out of such exchange fund. In lieu
of the delivery of fractional Quest Diagnostics shares, the exchange agent will
aggregate all such fractional shares and sell them at the then-prevailing price
on the New York Stock Exchange, and shall deliver to each holder that would have
been entitled to a fractional share an amount in cash equal to such holder's
ratable portion of the cash proceeds.

     Termination of the Exchange Fund.  Any portion of the exchange fund that
remains undistributed to Unilab stockholders for six months after the effective
time of the merger will be delivered to Quest Diagnostics, upon demand. After
such period, any Unilab stockholders who have not by that time complied with the
exchange procedures, as set forth in the merger agreement, must look solely to
Quest Diagnostics for Quest Diagnostics shares, any cash in lieu of fractional
Quest Diagnostics shares and any dividends or other distributions with respect
to the Quest Diagnostics shares to which they are entitled pursuant to the
merger agreement.

UNILAB BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     Upon the acceptance for payment or exchange of Unilab shares pursuant to
the offer, Quest Diagnostics will be entitled to designate a number of directors
to Unilab's board of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, that equals
the product of (1) the total number of directors on the Unilab board of
directors, giving effect to the election of any additional directors pursuant to
the merger agreement and (2) the percentage that the number of Unilab shares
beneficially owned by Quest Diagnostics and/or Purchaser, including Unilab
shares accepted for payment or exchange in the offer, bears to the total number
of Unilab shares outstanding. Unilab will take all action necessary to cause
Quest Diagnostics' designees to be elected or appointed to the Unilab board of
directors, including by increasing the number of directors and seeking and
accepting resignations of incumbent directors. Unilab will also use its best
efforts to cause individuals designated by Quest Diagnostics to constitute the
number of members, rounded up to the next whole number, on (i) each committee of
Unilab's board of directors and (ii) each board of directors of each subsidiary
of Unilab identified by Quest Diagnostics (and each committee thereof) that
represents the same percentage as such individuals represent on Unilab's board
of directors, in each case, only to the extent permitted by applicable law.
Notwithstanding anything in the merger agreement to the contrary, Quest
Diagnostics and Unilab will use their respective best efforts, including by
reducing the number of directors that Quest Diagnostics may designate to
Unilab's board as described above, but in no event to less than a majority of
the directors on Unilab's board of directors, to ensure that at least two of the
members of Unilab's board of directors will, at all times prior to the effective
time of the merger, be directors of Unilab who were directors of Unilab prior to
the consummation of the offer, whom we refer to as "continuing directors".

     The merger agreement provides that Unilab's obligation to appoint Quest
Diagnostics' designees to Unilab's board of directors is subject to Section
14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. Unilab will
promptly take all actions, and will include in the Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9, such information with respect to Unilab and its
officers and directors as

Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require. This information is reflected in Unilab's
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, which is being mailed
to you with this prospectus.

     Following the election or appointment of Quest Diagnostics' designees and
until the effective time of the merger, the approval of a majority of the
continuing directors then in office will be required to authorize any
termination of the merger agreement by Unilab, any amendment of the merger
agreement requiring action by the Unilab board of directors, any extension of
time for performance of any obligation or action under the merger agreement by
Quest Diagnostics or Purchaser, any waiver of compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained in the merger agreement for the benefit of
Unilab, any amendment of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of Unilab,
and any other action of Unilab under the merger agreement which adversely
affects the holders of Unilab shares, other than Quest Diagnostics or Purchaser.

TREATMENT OF UNILAB STOCK OPTIONS

     All stock options outstanding at the effective time of the merger under the
Unilab 2001 Stock Option Plan and the Unilab Amended and Restated 2000 Executive
Stock Option Plan (other than those Unilab stock options that will be cancelled
pursuant to employment agreements entered into with certain Unilab executives)
will be assumed by Quest Diagnostics and will be exercisable on the same terms
and conditions as under the applicable Unilab stock option plan, except that:

     - each assumed Unilab stock option will be exercisable for and represent
       the right to acquire that whole number of Quest Diagnostics shares,
       rounded to the nearest whole share, equal to (a) the number of Unilab
       shares subject to such Unilab stock option multiplied by (b) 0.3256;

     - the option exercise price per Quest Diagnostics share will be an amount
       equal to (a) the option exercise price per Unilab share subject to such
       Unilab stock option in effect immediately prior to the effective time of
       the merger divided by (b) 0.3256, rounded down to the nearest whole cent;
       and

     - the vesting price targets applicable to each unvested performance based
       Unilab stock option will be equal to (a) the vesting price targets
       applicable to such unvested performance based Unilab stock option
       immediately prior to the effective time of the merger divided by (b)
       0.3256.

     The merger agreement provides for certain procedures under which each
holder of a vested Unilab stock option may elect to exercise the vested Unilab
stock option effective as of the date on which Purchaser accepts for payment or
exchange all Unilab shares pursuant to the offer for the purpose of tendering
into the offer all of the Unilab shares issuable to such person upon the
exercise of the vested Unilab stock option.

     Under the terms of the merger agreement, the Quest Diagnostics shares
subject to the Unilab stock options that have been assumed by Quest Diagnostics
will be covered by an effective statement on Form S-8 or another appropriate
form for so long as such stock options remain outstanding.

Merger.  Quest Diagnostics has agreed that, from the date of the merger
agreement to the effective time of the merger, except as expressly contemplated
by any other provision of the merger agreement or as set forth in Quest

       which were issued with an exercise or conversion price of not less than
       the market price at the time of issuance; provided that the merger
       agreement does not prohibit issuances of capital stock, options or rights
       as part of normal employee compensation in the ordinary course of
       business or the issuance of capital stock, options, warrants, convertible

       merger agreement;

     - declare, set aside, make or pay any dividend or other distribution,

     - acquire any corporation, partnership, other business organization or any
       division thereof or any material amount of assets, unless such
       acquisition or the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to
       the consummation of such transaction would not, in the reasonable
       judgment of Quest Diagnostics at the time of such determination, impose
       any material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk
       of not obtaining, any authorizations, consents, orders, declarations or
       approvals of any governmental authority necessary to consummate the offer
       or the merger or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
       period under any antitrust or competition law, or materially increase the
       risk of any governmental authority entering an order prohibiting the
       consummation of the offer or the merger or commencing any action seeking
       to achieve certain effects described in of the merger agreement,
       including actions seeking to challenge or make illegal the merger or the
       transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; or

     - announce an intention, enter into any formal or informal agreement or
       otherwise make a commitment to do any of the foregoing or take any action
       that would materially delay the consummation of the offer and the merger.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

     Unilab and Quest Diagnostics have agreed to certain additional matters in
the merger agreement. The following summarizes the more significant of these
agreements:

     Unilab Stockholder Meeting.  If required by applicable law, Unilab, acting
through the Unilab board of directors, will, in accordance with applicable law,
duly call, convene and hold a special meeting of the Unilab stockholders as soon
as reasonably practicable after the acceptance for payment or exchange of Unilab
shares pursuant to the offer, for the purpose of voting upon the merger
agreement and the merger, and Unilab has agreed that the merger agreement will
be submitted at such meeting. Subject to the terms of the merger agreement,
Unilab will take all action necessary to secure the required votes of Unilab
stockholders to obtain approval for the merger agreement.

     Preparation of Registration Statement On Form S-4 Relating To The Merger
and Proxy Statement/ Prospectus.  If required by applicable law, promptly after
the acceptance for exchange or payment of Unilab shares pursuant to the Offer,
Quest Diagnostics and Unilab will prepare, and Quest Diagnostics will file with
the SEC, a registration statement on Form S-4 relating to the merger, in which a
proxy statement/prospectus will be included as Quest Diagnostics' prospectus.
The parties will cooperate in the preparation of the registration statement on
Form S-4 relating to the merger and proxy statement/prospectus. If required by
applicable law, Unilab will use its reasonable best efforts to mail the proxy
statement/prospectus to its stockholders as promptly as practicable after the
registration statement on Form S-4 relating to the merger is declared effective
under the Securities Act and, if necessary, after the proxy statement/prospectus
will have been so mailed, promptly circulate amended, supplemental or
supplemented proxy material, and, if required in connection therewith, resolicit
proxies. Quest Diagnostics will take any action reasonably required to be taken
under applicable state securities or blue sky laws in connection with the
issuance of Quest Diagnostics shares in the offer and the merger. No amendment
or supplement to the registration statement on Form S-4 relating to the merger
or proxy statement/prospectus will be made by Quest Diagnostics or Unilab
without the approval of the other party, which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Each party will advise the other party promptly, after it
receives notice thereof, of the time when the registration statement on Form S-4
relating to the merger is declared effective or any supplement or amendment
thereto has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order, of the suspension or
qualification of Quest Diagnostics shares issued in connection with the merger
for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of any request by the SEC for
amendment of the proxy statement/prospectus or comments thereon and responses
thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. If at any time prior
to the effective time of the merger, Unilab or Quest Diagnostics discovers any
information relating to either party, or any of their respective affiliates,
officers or directors, that should be set forth in an amendment to the proxy
statement/prospectus, so that such document would not contain any misstatement
of material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers that information shall promptly notify the other party and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law or regulation,
disseminated to Unilab stockholders.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Quest Diagnostics or Purchaser acquire at
least 90% of the outstanding Unilab shares pursuant to the offer or otherwise,
the parties have agreed, subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted
under the merger agreement, waiver of all conditions to the merger, to take, or
cause to be taken, all necessary and appropriate action to cause the merger to
be effective as soon as practicable after the acceptance for payment or exchange
of Unilab shares pursuant to the offer without the Unilab stockholder meeting.

     Access to Information; Confidentiality.  Except as otherwise prohibited by
applicable law or the terms of any contract or agreement (provided that Unilab
will use all reasonable efforts to promptly obtain any consent

required under any such contract or agreement in order that it may comply with
the terms of the covenant described in this paragraph), from the date of the
merger agreement until the effective time of the merger, Unilab will, and will
cause its subsidiary to:

     - provide to Quest Diagnostics and Quest Diagnostics' officers, directors,
       employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents and other
       representatives access at reasonable times during normal business hours
       upon prior notice to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices
       and other facilities of Unilab and its subsidiary and to the books and
       records thereof, and

     - furnish promptly to Quest Diagnostics such information concerning the
       business, properties, contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel and other
       aspects of Unilab and its subsidiary as Quest Diagnostics or its
       representatives may reasonably request.

     All information obtained by the parties pursuant to this provision of the
merger agreement will be kept confidential in accordance with the
confidentiality agreement, dated November 20, 2001, between Quest Diagnostics
and Unilab.

     No Solicitation of Transactions.  The merger agreement provides that Unilab
will, and will cause its subsidiary, and its and their respective officers,
directors, employees, subsidiaries, agents or advisors or other representatives
(including, without limitation, any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by it) to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions
or negotiations with third parties with respect to a competing transaction (as
defined in the merger agreement and as described below). In addition, Unilab has
agreed not to, directly or indirectly, and has agreed to instruct its
representatives not to, directly or indirectly:

     - solicit, initiate or, except as and only to the extent permitted by the
       merger agreement, encourage (including by way of furnishing nonpublic
       information), or take any other action to facilitate, any inquiries or
       the making of any proposal or offer (including, without limitation, any
       proposal or offer to its stockholders) that constitutes, or may
       reasonably be expected to lead to, any competing transaction,

     - except as and only to the extent permitted by the merger agreement, enter
       into or maintain or continue discussions or negotiate with any person or
       entity in furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain a competing
       transaction, or agree to or endorse any competing transaction, or
       authorize or permit any representative of Unilab or any of its
       subsidiaries to take any such action, or

     - release any third party from, or waive any provision of, any
       confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a party.

     A "competing transaction" is defined in the merger agreement as any of the
following (other than the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement):

     - any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
       recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
       involving Unilab or any of its subsidiaries,

     - any sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition of all or a
       substantial part of the assets of Unilab or of any of its subsidiaries,

     - any sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition of 15% or more of any
       class of equity securities of Unilab or of any of its subsidiaries or of
       15% or more of the assets of Unilab or of any of its subsidiaries, or

     - any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in
       any person beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity
       securities of Unilab or of any of its subsidiaries.

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary described above, the merger
agreement provides that Unilab's board of directors may furnish information to,
and enter into discussions with, a person who has made an

unsolicited bona fide written proposal or offer regarding a competing
transaction (that did not result from a breach of the merger agreement), and
with respect to which Unilab's board of directors has:

     - determined, in its good faith judgment (after having consulted with a
       financial advisor of internationally recognized reputation), that such
       proposal or offer constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in or
       lead to a superior proposal (as defined in the merger agreement and as
       described below),

     - determined, in its good faith judgment after consultation with outside
       legal counsel, that, in light of such superior proposal, the failure to
       furnish such information or to enter into such discussions would result
       in a breach of its fiduciary obligations under applicable law,

     - provided written notice to Quest Diagnostics of its intent to furnish
       information or enter into discussions with such person at least two
       business days prior to taking any such action, and

     - obtained from such person an executed confidentiality agreement on terms
       no less favorable to Unilab than those contained in the confidentiality
       agreement, dated November 20, 2001, between Quest Diagnostics and Unilab.

     Unilab has agreed that, promptly following receipt thereof, it will advise
Quest Diagnostics in writing of any request for information or any competing
transaction, or any inquiry, discussions or negotiations with respect to any
competing transaction and the terms and conditions of such request for
information, competing transaction, inquiry, discussions or negotiations, and
Unilab will promptly provide to Quest Diagnostics copies of any written
materials received by Unilab in connection with any of the foregoing, and the
identity of the person or group making any such request for information,
competing transaction or inquiry or with whom any discussions or negotiations
may be taking place. Unilab has agreed that it will keep Quest Diagnostics
informed of the status and material details (including amendments or proposed
amendments) of any such request for information, competing transaction or
inquiry and keep Quest Diagnostics informed as to the material details of any
information requested of or provided by Unilab, and as to the status and
material terms of all substantive discussions or negotiations with respect to
any such request, competing transaction or inquiry. Unilab has also agreed that
it will simultaneously provide to Quest Diagnostics any non-public information
concerning Unilab that may be provided to any other person or group in
connection with any competing transaction that was not previously provided to
Quest Diagnostics.

     Except as otherwise set forth in the merger agreement, Unilab's board of
directors will not withdraw, qualify, modify or amend, or propose to withdraw,
qualify, modify or amend, in any manner adverse to Quest Diagnostics or
Purchaser, its recommendation, or take any action, or make any statement, filing
or release inconsistent with such recommendation. However, if, prior to
consummation of the offer, Unilab's board of directors reasonably determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to
withdraw, qualify, modify or amend its recommendation would be a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law, then Unilab's board of directors will be
permitted to withdraw, qualify, modify or amend, in a manner adverse to Quest
Diagnostics or Purchaser, its recommendation. Unilab's board of directors will
promptly deliver to Quest Diagnostics written notice advising Quest Diagnostics:

     - that it has withdrawn, qualified, modified or amended, in a manner
       adverse to Quest Diagnostics or Purchaser, its recommendation, and

     - if applicable, the material terms and conditions of the superior proposal
       received by Unilab prior to such withdrawal, qualification, modification
       or amendment and the identity of the person or persons making such
       superior proposal.

     Nothing contained in the merger agreement will prohibit Unilab or Unilab's
board of directors from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from making any
disclosure required by applicable law (provided that any withdrawal,
qualification, modification or amendment of the recommendation of Unilab's board
of directors will be made as and only to the extent permitted by the merger
agreement).

     A "superior proposal" means an unsolicited bona fide written offer made by
a third party to consummate any of the following transactions:

     - a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
       recapitalization or other similar transaction involving Unilab pursuant
       to which the stockholders of Unilab immediately preceding such
       transaction would hold less than 50% of the equity interest in the
       surviving or resulting entity of such transaction,

     - the sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition of at least 50%
       of the assets of Unilab and its subsidiary, taken as a whole, in a single
       or related series of transactions, or

     - the acquisition by any person or group (including by means of a tender
       offer or an exchange offer or a two-step transaction involving a tender
       offer followed with reasonable promptness by a merger involving Unilab),
       directly or indirectly, of ownership of at least 50% of the then
       outstanding Unilab shares, in each case, on terms (including conditions
       to consummation of the contemplated transaction) that Unilab's board of
       directors determines, in its good faith judgment (after having consulted
       with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation), to be more
       favorable to Unilab stockholders than the offer and the merger, is
       reasonably capable of being consummated and for which financing, to the
       extent required, is reasonably likely, in the good faith judgment of the
       board of directors (after having consulted with a financial advisor of
       nationally recognized reputation), to be obtained on a timely basis.

     Employee Benefits Matters.  From and after the effective time of the
merger, Quest Diagnostics will cause the surviving corporation and its
subsidiaries to honor in accordance with their terms, all plans, programs and
arrangements of Unilab and its subsidiary as in effect immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger that are applicable to any current or former
employees or directors of Unilab or its subsidiary (except that changes may be
made in accordance with the terms of such plans, programs and arrangements).
Employees of Unilab or its subsidiary will receive full credit for purposes of
eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for benefit accruals) under any
employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by the
surviving corporation or its subsidiary for service accrued or deemed accrued
prior to the effective time of the merger with Unilab or its subsidiary except
that the crediting of service will not operate to duplicate any benefit or the
funding of any such benefit. In addition, Quest Diagnostics will waive, or cause
to be waived, any limitations on benefits relating to any pre-existing
conditions to the same extent such limitations are waived under any comparable
plan of Quest Diagnostics or its subsidiaries, and recognize, for purposes of
annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans,
deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by employees of Unilab and its
subsidiary in the calendar year during which the effective time of the merger
occurs.

     Except as contemplated by the employment agreements entered into with
certain key employees of Unilab, which are described in "Interests of Certain
Persons -- Employment Agreements" beginning on page 74, following the effective
time of the merger, Quest Diagnostics will continue to provide to individuals
who are employed by the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries as of the
effective time of the merger and who remain employed with Quest Diagnostics or
any subsidiary of Quest Diagnostics for so long as such employees remain
employed by Quest Diagnostics or any subsidiary of Quest Diagnostics, employee
benefits (other than salary or incentive compensation) that, in the aggregate,
are no less favorable than those provided to employees of Quest Diagnostics or
its subsidiaries in reasonably comparable positions.

     Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance. See "Interests of
Certain Persons -- Indemnification of Directors and Officers" beginning on page
78.

     Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts.  Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of the merger agreement, each of Quest Diagnostics, Purchaser and
Unilab has agreed to, promptly after the date of the merger agreement:

     - make its respective filings, and thereafter make any other required
       submissions, under the HSR Act with respect to the transaction, and

     - use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
       appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
       proper or advisable under applicable laws or otherwise to consummate and
       make effective the transaction, including, without limitation, using its
       reasonable best efforts to obtain all permits, consents, approvals,
       authorizations, qualifications and orders of governmental authorities and
       parties to contracts with Unilab and its subsidiary as are necessary for
       the consummation of the transaction and to fulfill the conditions to the
       offer and the merger.

     However, neither Purchaser nor Quest Diagnostics will be required to take
any action, including entering into any consent decree, hold separate orders or
other arrangements, that:

     - requires the divestiture of any assets of any of Purchaser, Quest
       Diagnostics, Unilab or any of their respective subsidiaries, or

     - limits Quest Diagnostics' freedom of action with respect to, or its
       ability to retain, Unilab and its subsidiary or any portion thereof or
       any of Quest Diagnostics' or its affiliates' other assets or businesses.

     Each of the parties to the merger agreement has also agreed to use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its respective officers, employees, agents,
auditors and representatives to cooperate with each other, prior to the
effective time of the merger, to ensure the orderly combination of Unilab and
its subsidiary with Quest Diagnostics and its subsidiaries following the
effective time of the merger and to minimize any disruption to the respective
businesses of Quest Diagnostics and its subsidiaries and Unilab and its
subsidiary that might result from the transaction.

     Unilab will cooperate with Quest Diagnostics, and will use its reasonable
best efforts to cause Unilab's accountants to provide to Quest Diagnostics, at
Quest Diagnostics' expense, the requisite consents required to enable Quest
Diagnostics to fulfill any requirements imposed on it by the Exchange Act or the
Securities Act, and Unilab will cooperate with Quest Diagnostics in its efforts
to obtain extended reporting coverage for certain liability insurance policies
maintained by Unilab and its subsidiary as contemplated by the merger agreement.

     Plan of Reorganization.  The merger agreement is intended to constitute a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of section 1.368-2(g) of the income
tax regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code. From and after the
date of the merger agreement and until the effective time of the merger, each
party to the merger agreement will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
offer and the merger to qualify, and will not knowingly take any action, cause
any action to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to
be taken which action or failure to act could prevent the offer and the merger
from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code, except that Quest Diagnostics may effect a taxable
reverse merger as provided in the merger agreement. Following the effective time
of the merger, neither the surviving corporation, Quest Diagnostics nor any of
their affiliates knowingly will take any action, cause any action to be taken,
fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken, which action or
failure to act could cause the offer and the merger to fail to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code.

     Transaction Fees and Expenses.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in the merger agreement, Unilab will not incur, or cause to be
incurred, aggregate transaction fees (as such term is defined in the merger
agreement and as described below) in excess of $10,000,000. The term
"transaction fees" is defined in the merger agreement to mean the fees and
disbursements of Unilab's legal counsel and financial advisors that are incurred
in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery and
performance of the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby, except that any legal costs and expenses incurred solely
in connection with compliance with the HSR Act (including, without limitation,
compliance with any "second request" thereunder) will be excluded from the
calculation of such costs and expenses.

     Restrictions on Acquisition of Unilab Shares.  From and after the date of
the merger agreement and until the earlier to occur of (x) two years following
the purchase of any Unilab shares pursuant to the exercise of the options
granted to Quest Diagnostics under the stockholders agreement and (y) in the
event Quest Diagnostics does not exercise such option and purchase any shares
pursuant thereto, the termination of the

option exercise period, neither Quest Diagnostics, nor any of its subsidiaries
or controlled affiliates will, and Quest Diagnostics will use its reasonable
efforts to cause its affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, acquire,
announce an intention to acquire, offer to acquire, or enter into any agreement,
arrangement or undertaking of any kind the purpose of which is to acquire, by
purchase, exchange or otherwise, any Unilab shares or options or rights to
acquire Unilab shares, except pursuant to:

     - the offer,

     - the merger,

     - the exercise of the options granted pursuant to the stockholders
       agreement, or

     - a transaction made available to all Unilab stockholders which is approved
       by a majority of the Unilab directors who are not, at the time of such
       determination, directors, officers, employees or affiliates of Quest
       Diagnostics or officers or employees of Unilab.

CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER

     The obligations of Quest Diagnostics, Purchaser and Unilab to consummate
the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver (where permissible) of the
following conditions:

     - if required, the registration statement on Form S-4 relating to the
       merger will have been declared effective by the SEC and no stop order
       suspending its effectiveness will have been issued by the SEC and no
       proceeding for that purpose will have been initiated by the SEC that has
       not been concluded or withdrawn;

     - to the extent required by the DGCL, the merger agreement will have been
       approved and adopted by the Unilab stockholders;

     - no governmental authority will have enacted, issued, promulgated,
       enforced or entered any law, rule, regulation, judgment, decree,
       executive order or award that will make the merger illegal or prohibit
       the consummation of the merger;

     - the Quest Diagnostics shares to be issued in the merger will have been
       authorized for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, subject to
       official notice of issuance; and

     - Purchaser will have purchased Unilab shares in the offer.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     Termination by Mutual Agreement.  The merger agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the effective time of the merger by mutual written consent of
Quest Diagnostics and Unilab.

     Termination by either Quest Diagnostics or Unilab.  The merger agreement
may be terminated at any time prior to the effective time of the merger by Quest
Diagnostics or by Unilab if:

     - the offer has not been consummated on or before September 30, 2002,
       except that the right to terminate the merger agreement under this
       provision of the merger agreement is not available to any party whose
       willful or intentional failure to fulfill any obligation of the merger
       agreement or other willful or intentional breach of the merger agreement
       has resulted in the failure of any condition to the offer or the merger
       not to be satisfied prior to such date;

     - the offer has expired or been terminated in accordance with the terms of
       the merger agreement without Quest Diagnostics or Purchaser having
       accepted for exchange any Unilab shares pursuant to the offer; or

     - a permanent injunction exists prohibiting consummation of the merger.

     Termination by Quest Diagnostics.  Quest Diagnostics may terminate the
merger agreement at any time prior to the purchase of Unilab shares pursuant to
the offer if:

     - Unilab has breached or failed to perform in any material respect any
       representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the
       merger agreement, and such breach cannot be or has not been cured prior
       to September 30, 2002; or

     - Unilab's board of directors has (x) withdrawn or adversely changed its
       recommendation of the transaction or (y) approved or recommended, or
       proposed to approve or recommend, a competing transaction.

     Termination by Unilab.  Unilab may terminate the merger agreement at any
time prior to the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer if Quest Diagnostics
has breached or failed to perform in any material respect any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the merger agreement, and
such breach cannot be or has not been cured prior to September 30, 2002.

TERMINATION FEES AND EXPENSES

     Termination Fees Payable by Unilab to Quest Diagnostics.  Unilab must pay a
termination fee of $35 million plus all of Quest Diagnostics' expenses up to $4
million if Quest Diagnostics terminates the merger agreement because Unilab's
board of directors has withdrawn or changed its recommendation of the
transaction, or recommended a competing transaction. However, Unilab will not be
required to pay the termination fee or reimburse Quest Diagnostics for its
expenses if, at the time of the event giving rise to the termination of the
merger agreement, there has occurred and is continuing a "parent share price
decrease" with respect to Quest Diagnostics' common stock. A "parent share price
decrease" means a significant decline in the market value of Quest Diagnostics'
common stock, as more fully described under the heading "The Stockholders
Agreement -- The Option -- Exercisability" on page 72.

     Unilab is also required to pay Quest Diagnostics the termination fee of $35
million if the merger agreement is terminated under circumstances in which all
of the following conditions are satisfied:

     - the merger agreement is terminated by either Quest Diagnostics or Unilab
       by reason of:

      - Unilab having breached or failed to perform in any material respect any
        representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the
        merger agreement, and such breach cannot be or has not been cured prior
        to September 30, 2002;

      - the offer not having been consummated on or before September 30, 2002;
        or

      - the offer having expired or having been terminated in accordance with
        the terms of the merger agreement without Quest Diagnostics having
        purchased any Unilab shares; and

     - prior to such termination, a proposal for a competing transaction
       (replacing references to 15% in the definition thereof with 50%) has been
       made and communicated to Unilab's stockholders and such proposal:

      - had not been withdrawn at the time of termination;

      - provided for more favorable consideration from a financial point of view
        than the consideration being offered in the offer and the merger;

      - was reasonably capable of being consummated; and

      - within eighteen months of such termination, a "third party acquisition
        event" occurs. A "third party acquisition event" means the earlier of
        (a) the consummation of a competing transaction involving the purchase
        of a majority of either the equity securities of Unilab or of the
        consolidated assets of Unilab and its subsidiary, taken as a whole, or
        any such transaction that, if it is proposed prior to the termination of
        the merger agreement, will constitute a "competing transaction" pursuant
        to the terms of the merger agreement or (b) the entering into by Unilab
        or any of its subsidiary of a definitive agreement with respect to any
        such transaction.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, Unilab is not required to pay the
termination fee if:

     - the merger agreement is terminated by reason of the offer not having been
       consummated by September 30, 2002 or the offer having expired on such
       date without the purchase by Quest Diagnostics of Unilab shares pursuant
       thereto if, at the time of such termination, the waiting period under the
       HSR Act had not expired or been terminated, there shall have been issued
       any injunction permanently prohibiting the consummation of the offer and
       the merger, or any governmental authority has filed suit seeking such an
       order on antitrust grounds; or

     - at the time of termination of the merger agreement, Unilab is entitled to
       terminate the merger agreement as a consequence of Quest Diagnostics
       having breached or failed to perform in any material respect any
       representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the
       merger agreement.

     Expenses Payable by Unilab.  If the merger agreement is terminated by Quest
Diagnostics by reason of Unilab having breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
contained in the merger agreement, then Unilab is required to pay Quest
Diagnostics, within five business days after submission of statements therefor,
all of Quest Diagnostics' expenses incurred in connection with the merger
agreement up to a maximum of $5 million.

     Expenses Payable by Quest Diagnostics.  If the merger agreement is
terminated by Unilab by reason of Quest Diagnostics having breached or failed to
perform in any material respect any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained in the merger agreement, then Quest Diagnostics is required
to pay Unilab, within five business days after submission of statements
therefor, all of Unilab's expenses incurred in connection with the merger
agreement up to a maximum of $5 million.

AMENDMENTS AND WAIVER

     The parties may amend, modify or waive the merger agreement prior to the
effective time of the merger, by action taken by or authorized by their
respective board of directors, if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in
writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by Unilab and Quest Diagnostics
or, in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be
effective.

     Following the appointment of any directors selected by Quest Diagnostics
and prior to the effective time of the merger, approval by Unilab of any
amendment or waiver of the merger agreement will be subject to the provisions
set forth under the caption entitled "The Merger Agreement -- Unilab Board of
Directors" beginning on page 57.

                           THE STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT

     THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF THE MATERIAL PROVISIONS OF THE
STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT. THIS SUMMARY IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE
TO THE COMPLETE TEXT OF THE STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN
BY REFERENCE, AND A COPY OF WHICH IS ATTACHED AS ANNEX B TO THIS PROSPECTUS. ALL
UNILAB STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT IN ITS
ENTIRETY.

     Concurrently with entering into the merger agreement, we entered into a
stockholders agreement with Kelso Investment Associates VI, L.P. and KEP VI,
LLC, both stockholders of Unilab which we refer to as Kelso. On April 2, 2002,
the date of execution of the merger agreement and the stockholders agreement,
the Kelso stockholders collectively owned either beneficially or of record
13,841,178 Unilab shares, constituting approximately 37.0% of the Unilab shares
outstanding at such time on a fully diluted basis and 41.2% of the Unilab shares
outstanding at such time on a non-fully diluted basis.

TENDER OF SHARES OF UNILAB COMMON STOCK

     The stockholders agreement provides that the Kelso stockholders will
promptly (and, in any event, not later than two business days prior to the
initial scheduled expiration date of the offer) tender all of the Unilab shares
held by them and will not withdraw such shares from the offer, except following
termination of the offer in accordance with its terms.

VOTING AGREEMENT AND PROXY

     The stockholders agreement provides that during the time the stockholders
agreement is in effect, the Kelso stockholders will vote (or cause to be voted)
or consent (or cause to be consented) all of their Unilab shares:

     - in favor of adoption of the merger agreement, the merger and all the
       transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the stockholders
       agreement and otherwise in such manner as may be necessary to consummate
       the merger,

     - against any action, proposal, agreement or transaction that would result
       in a breach of any covenant, obligation, agreement, representation or
       warranty of Unilab under the merger agreement or of such stockholder
       contained in the stockholders agreement, and

     - against any action, agreement, transaction (other than the merger
       agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby) or proposal,
       including any proposal relating to a competing transaction, that could
       reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to Unilab's
       obligations under the merger agreement not being fulfilled or that is
       intended, or could reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere, delay,
       discourage or adversely affect the merger agreement, the offer, the
       merger or the stockholders agreement.

     Any vote by the stockholders that is not in accordance with the foregoing
will be considered null and void and the provisions set forth in the following
paragraph will take immediate effect.

     Pursuant to the stockholders agreement, if the Kelso stockholders fail to
comply with their obligations to vote their Unilab shares as set forth above,
Quest Diagnostics will automatically be granted an irrevocable proxy with
respect to their Unilab shares to vote and otherwise act with respect to all of
their shares at any meeting of Unilab stockholders (whether annual or special
and whether or not an adjourned or postponed meeting), and in any action by
written consent of the Unilab stockholders, on the matters and in the manner
specified in the above paragraph.

THE OPTION

     Pursuant to the stockholders agreement, the Kelso stockholders granted
Quest Diagnostics an irrevocable option to purchase all of such stockholders'
shares at a purchase price per share of $26.50, which is exercisable under
certain circumstances described below.

     The $26.50 per share is payable by Quest Diagnostics, at the option of
Quest Diagnostics, either in cash or in a combination of cash and Quest
Diagnostics shares in the same proportion as though such shares and any other
Unilab shares tendered for cash had been acquired pursuant to and in accordance
with the terms of the offer, taking into account for this purpose the aggregate
number of Unilab shares tendered for cash in the offer, including the number of
the Kelso stockholders' shares that were tendered for cash in the offer.

     Exercisability.  The options granted by the Kelso stockholders are
exercisable during the ten-business day period following termination of the
merger agreement:

     - by mutual written consent of Quest Diagnostics and Unilab,

     - by Quest Diagnostics, by reason of a material breach by Unilab of its
       representations, warranties or covenants, or by reason of the Unilab
       board having withdrawn or modified its recommendation of the offer and
       the merger or having recommended a competing transaction,

     - by either Quest Diagnostics or Unilab, by reason of the offer not having
       been consummated before September 30, 2002, or

     - by either Quest Diagnostics or Unilab, by reason of the offer having
       expired or been terminated in accordance with the terms of the merger
       agreement without Quest Diagnostics or Purchaser having accepted for
       exchange any Unilab shares pursuant to the offer.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the options will not be exercisable by Quest
Diagnostics if, at the time of termination of the merger agreement:

     - there has been a "parent share price decrease", as described below, with
       respect to Quest Diagnostics' shares;

     - Quest Diagnostics has breached any of its representations, warranties and
       covenants under the merger agreement, or if its representations and
       warranties fail to be true in all material respects as of such time; or

     - in the case of a termination by reason of the offer not having been
       consummated by September 30, 2002, or by reason of the offer having
       expired or been terminated without Quest Diagnostics or the Purchaser
       having accepted for exchange any Unilab shares,

      - there has been declared a general banking moratorium in the United
        States;

      - an order prohibiting consummation of the offer has been issued, or there
        is pending any litigation brought by a governmental authority seeking
        such an order on antitrust grounds; or

      - the antitrust, SEC or the New York Stock Exchange approvals required for
        consummation of the offer is not obtained.

     For purposes of the stockholders agreement, a "parent share price decrease"
will be deemed to occur if (A) during the five trading days ending on the second
trading day prior to the then scheduled expiration date of the offer, the
average closing trading price for a Quest Diagnostics share is less than 50% of
the average closing trading price for a Quest Diagnostics share for the five
trading days immediately preceding the signing date of the stockholders
agreement, (B) at the time of such determination, such percentage decrease in
the trading price of Quest Diagnostics shares is 25% greater than the percentage
decrease in the weighted average trading prices of shares of common stock of a
similarly situated company (measured over the same time period) and (C) at the
time of such determination, all of the conditions to the offer, other than the
minimum tender condition, have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted,
waived by Quest Diagnostics.

     The option is exercisable in whole but not in part, and in no event is
Quest Diagnostics able to exercise an option with respect to a stockholder's
shares unless Quest Diagnostics concurrently exercises all options to purchase
all the shares of both Kelso stockholders. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the stockholders agreement, in no event will any of the Kelso
stockholders' shares be purchased after the close of business on the 45th day
following the termination of the merger agreement.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     In the stockholders agreement, the stockholders made customary
representations and warranties to Quest Diagnostics, including representations

     - authority to enter into the stockholders agreement,

     - no conflict and required filings and consents,

     - absence of litigation; and

     - absence of brokers entitled to fees in connection with the transactions

customary representations and warranties to the stockholders, including
representations and warranties relating to:

     - no conflict and required filings and consents.

COVENANTS

     The stockholders agreement provides, among other things, that the Kelso
stockholders, subject to the terms of the stockholders agreement, will not:

     - sell, transfer, tender (except into the offer), pledge, assign,
       contribute to the capital of any entity, hypothecate, give or otherwise

       agreement) with respect to, any of such stockholder's Unilab shares (or
       agree or consent to, or offer to do, any of the foregoing), or take any
       action that would make any representation or warranty of such stockholder
       in the stockholders agreement untrue or incorrect in any material respect

       performing such stockholder's obligations under the stockholders
       agreement; and

     - directly or indirectly solicit, initiate, endorse, accept or encourage
       the submission of any competing transaction, or participate in any
       discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any
       information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with
       respect to, or participate in, assist, facilitate, endorse or encourage
       any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to,
       a competing transaction.

to the conditions of the stockholders agreement, Quest Diagnostics, Purchaser
and each stockholder will use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to
consummate and make effective the stockholders agreement.

REGISTRATION RIGHTS

     The stockholders agreement provides that as promptly as practicable, and in
any event within five business days, after the date Quest Diagnostics has
accepted shares for payment or exchange pursuant to the offer or, if applicable,
the date on which Quest Diagnostics has exercised its option pursuant to the
stockholders agreement, Quest Diagnostics will file a shelf registration
statement on Form S-3 (pursuant to Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities
Act) in respect of the Quest Diagnostics shares that are received by the Kelso
stockholders in the offer. Quest Diagnostics has agreed, subject to customary
terms and conditions (including, without limitation, blackout periods), to use
its reasonable efforts to keep the shelf

registration statement continuously effective from the date that such shelf
registration statement on Form S-3 is declared effective until the first
anniversary of such effective date.

     The stockholders agreement contains customary indemnification provisions
with respect to matters arising in connection with the registration rights
granted pursuant thereto.

TERMINATION

     The obligations of the stockholders under the stockholders agreement
terminate upon (1) the occurrence of a parent share price decrease, as such term
is defined above under the heading "The Stockholders Agreement -- The
Option -- Exercisability" on page 72 and, with certain exceptions set forth in
the stockholders agreement, (2) the earlier to occur of (i) the effective time
of the merger and (ii) the termination of the merger agreement.

                          INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS

     Some directors and executive officers of Unilab may have interests in the

Information about these interests is more fully set forth in Unilab's
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, including the
Information Statement attached as Annex A to the Schedule 14D-9, which is being
mailed to Unilab stockholders with this prospectus. Each material agreement,

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

     On April 2, 2002, Messrs. Whalen, Urban, Kane and Gee entered into new
employment agreements that will become operative and supersede their current
employment agreements on the date Quest Diagnostics purchases Unilab shares that
have been tendered into the offer. The new employment agreements provide that
neither the offer nor any other transaction contemplated by the merger agreement
will constitute a change of control under their current employment agreements.
If the merger agreement with Quest Diagnostics is terminated, the new employment
agreements will be void and their current employment agreements will continue in
effect.

MR. WHALEN

     The term of Mr. Whalen's new employment agreement will commence on the date
Quest Diagnostics purchases Unilab shares that have been tendered into the offer
and will terminate on February 28, 2005, unless terminated earlier as described
below. The new employment agreement provides for Mr. Whalen to serve as Quest
Diagnostics' Regional Vice President, California and entitles him to receive:

     - an annual salary of $400,000;

     - an annual incentive bonus with a target payout equal to 50% of his annual
       salary if certain performance targets are achieved;

     - a stock option grant at an exercise price equal to the fair market value
       of Quest Diagnostics shares on the date of grant under the Quest
       Diagnostics Employee Equity Participation Plan; and

     - such other benefits and perquisites as are provided to similarly
       positioned Quest Diagnostics executives.

     Mr. Whalen will also be eligible to participate in an integration bonus
arrangement that will entitle him to a bonus equal to $2,766,000 if target
integration results are achieved, up to a bonus equal to $8,298,000 if
exceptional integration results are achieved. The integration bonus is payable
following the closing of the financial statements for fiscal year 2004, however
Quest Diagnostics may, in its sole discretion, pay a portion of the integration
bonus following the closing of Quest Diagnostics' financial statements for
fiscal year 2003. Generally, no integration bonus is payable to Mr. Whalen if he
is not continuously employed by Quest Diagnostics through the expiration of the
agreement, unless his employment terminates due to his death or disability.

     Mr. Whalen's new employment agreement provides that 40% of his outstanding,
unvested Unilab Class C3 stock options will immediately vest and convert into
options to acquire Quest Diagnostics shares and the remaining 60% will be
cancelled. All of Mr. Whalen's unvested Unilab Class A stock options will vest
and become immediately exercisable on the date Quest Diagnostics purchases
Unilab shares that have been tendered into the offer.

     If Mr. Whalen's employment is terminated by Quest Diagnostics without
cause, or if Mr. Whalen terminates his employment for "good reason" (as defined
in his new employment agreement), provided he signs a general release, he will
be entitled to receive:

     - continued payment of his salary for 36 months;

     - continued medical benefits coverage for 36 months; and

     - an amount equal to the integration bonus that would be paid to him if he
       had achieved the target integration results, offset by any amounts that
       may have been previously paid to him in respect of the integration bonus.

     The new employment agreement contains confidentiality obligations that
survive indefinitely and nonsolicitation and noncompetition obligations that end
on the later of four years from the effective date of the new employment
agreement and the second anniversary of the date his employment has ceased.

     If any of the payments to be received by Mr. Whalen will be subject to the
excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, which we
refer to as the Code, such payments will be reduced by an amount sufficient to
avoid the imposition of the excise tax. It is not expected that any of the
payments to be received by Mr. Whalen will be subject to the excise tax imposed
under Section 4999 of the Code.

MR. KANE

     The term of Mr. Kane's new employment agreement will commence on the date
Quest Diagnostics purchases Unilab shares that have been tendered into the offer
and will terminate on February 28, 2005, unless terminated earlier as described
below. The new employment agreement provides for Mr. Kane to perform such

duties and have such responsibilities as are assigned to him by the Regional
Vice President, California, who is expected to be Mr. Whalen. The new employment
agreement entitles him to receive:

     - an annual salary of $225,000;

     - an annual incentive bonus with a target payout equal to 40% of his annual
       salary if certain performance targets are achieved;

     - a stock option grant at an exercise price equal to the fair market value
       of Quest Diagnostics shares on the date of grant under the Quest
       Diagnostics Employee Equity Participation Plan; and

     - such other benefits and perquisites as are provided to similarly
       positioned Quest Diagnostics executives.

     The new employment agreement also provides for an interim integration bonus
of $415,000 to be paid to Mr. Kane if he is employed by Quest Diagnostics
through the first anniversary of the date Quest Diagnostics purchases Unilab
shares that have been tendered into the offer, and an additional integration
bonus of up to $415,000 payable based upon the operating results of the areas
Mr. Kane is responsible for during the integration period commencing with the
date Quest Diagnostics purchases Unilab shares that have been tendered into the
offer and ending with Quest Diagnostics' 2004 fiscal year. No integration bonus
will be paid if the operating results do not exceed target results and a maximum
of $415,000 will be payable if stretch results are achieved. Results that fall
between target and stretch results will entitle Mr. Kane to a pro rated
integration bonus payment. Generally, no integration bonus is payable to Mr.
Kane if he is not continuously employed by Quest Diagnostics through the
expiration of the new employment agreement unless his employment terminates due
to his death or disability.

     Mr. Kane's new employment agreement provides that 40% of his outstanding,
unvested Unilab Class C3 stock options will immediately vest and convert into
options to acquire Quest Diagnostics shares and the remaining 60% will be
cancelled. All of Mr. Kane's unvested Unilab Class A stock options will vest and
become immediately exercisable on the date Quest Diagnostics purchases Unilab
shares that have been tendered into the offer.

     If Mr. Kane's employment is terminated by Quest Diagnostics without cause
or, if Mr. Kane terminates his employment for "good reason" (as defined in his
new employment agreement), provided he signs a general release, he will be
entitled to receive:

     - continued payment of his salary for 24 months;

     - continued medical benefits coverage for 24 months; and

     - an amount equal to the interim integration bonus if Mr. Kane did not
       receive the interim integration bonus.

     If any of the payments to be received by Mr. Kane will be subject to the
excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, such payments will be reduced
by an amount sufficient to avoid the imposition of the excise tax. It is not
expected that any of the payments to be received by Mr. Kane will be subject to
the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code. Mr. Kane's new employment
agreement also contains noncompetition and nonsolicitation provisions that apply
for two years from the date his employment terminates.

MESSRS. URBAN AND GEE

     The term of each of their new employment agreements will commence on the
date Quest Diagnostics purchases Unilab shares that have been tendered into the
offer and will terminate on the first anniversary date of the date Quest
Diagnostics purchases Unilab shares that have been tendered into the offer,
unless earlier terminated as described below. Mr. Urban will perform such duties
and have such responsibilities as are assigned to him by the Regional Vice
President, California, and/or the Chief Financial Officer of Quest Diagnostics,
and Mr. Gee will perform such duties and have such responsibilities as are
assigned to him by the

Regional Vice President, California, and/or the General Counsel of Quest
Diagnostics. The new employment agreements entitle each of them to receive:

     - an annual salary of $225,000;

     - an annual incentive bonus with a target payout equal to a percentage of
       their annual salaries if certain performance targets are achieved (40%
       for Mr. Urban and 30% for Mr. Gee); and

     - such other benefits and perquisites as are provided to similarly
       positioned Quest Diagnostics executives.

     Mr. Gee will also receive a stock option grant at an exercise price equal
to the fair market value of Quest Diagnostics shares on the date of grant under
the Quest Diagnostics Employee Equity Participation Plan. The stock option will
vest in full on the second anniversary of the date of grant.

     Messrs. Urban's and Gee's new employment agreements provide that all of
their unvested Unilab Class C3 and Class A stock options will become immediately
vested and exercisable on the date Quest Diagnostics purchases Unilab shares
that have been tendered into the offer.

     If Messrs. Urban or Gee are terminated by Quest Diagnostics without cause,
or if they terminate their employment for "good reason" (as defined in their new
employment agreements), provided they sign a general release, they will be
entitled to receive:

     - continued payment of salary for 24 months;

     - continued medical benefits coverage for 24 months; and

     - an amount equal to $375,000 for Mr. Urban and $250,000 for Mr. Gee.

     In the event that Messrs. Urban or Gee resign their employment for any
reason during the ten-day period following the expiration of their new
employment agreements, they will be entitled to receive payment of their salary
for 24 months and an amount equal to $375,000 for Mr. Urban and $250,000 for Mr.
Gee, subject to their execution of a general release.

     If any of the payments to be received under these new employment agreements
will be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, such
payments will be reduced by an amount sufficient to avoid the imposition of the
excise tax. It is not expected that any of the payments to be received by either
Mr. Urban or Mr. Gee will be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section
4999 of the Code. These new employment agreements also contain noncompetition
and nonsolicitation provisions that apply for two years from the date their
employment terminates.

MESSRS. HANBURY AND WERTLAKE

     Mr. Hanbury is a party to an employment arrangement with Unilab outlined in
a letter dated March 16, 1998. Mr. Hanbury's current annual base salary is
$190,000 and he is also eligible for bonuses if performance targets are
achieved. In 2001, he received bonuses totaling $16,250. If Mr. Hanbury's
employment is terminated without cause he is entitled to continued payment of
his salary for twelve months. Dr. Wertlake is currently a party to an employment
agreement dated as of October 23, 1995. Mr. Wertlake's current annual base
salary is $240,196 and in 2001 he received a bonus of $31,250. The term of the
employment agreement is automatically extended on each October 23rd by one year
and in the event of a change of control will automatically extend for two years.
The consummation of the offer will constitute a change of control for purposes
of Dr. Wertlake's employment agreement. If Dr. Wertlake's employment is
terminated without cause following a change of control, he is entitled to
continued payment of his salary for 24 months.

UNILAB STOCK OPTIONS

     As of May 14, 2002, approximately 3,786,258 Unilab shares were subject to
stock options granted under Unilab's equity based compensation plans. Generally,
all outstanding unvested service stock options and most outstanding unvested
performance stock options to purchase Unilab shares will become vested on the
effective

time of the merger and will become stock options to purchase Quest Diagnostics
shares, with appropriate adjustments to be made to the number of shares and the
exercise price under such options based on the exchange ratio. The other terms
of each Unilab stock option will continue to apply in accordance with the
applicable Unilab stock option plans that have been amended to provide that upon
the date that Quest Diagnostics purchases Unilab shares that have been tendered
into the offer, restrictions relating to transferability under certain stock
option plans will cease.

INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, the certificate of incorporation of the
surviving corporation will contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification for matters occurring prior to the effective time of the merger
than are set forth in Unilab's certificate of incorporation and by-laws on the
date of the merger agreement. These provisions will not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years from the effective time of the
merger in any manner that would affect adversely the rights of individuals who,
at or prior to the effective time of the merger, were directors, officers,
employees or agents of Unilab, unless such modification is required by law. The
merger agreement also provides that the certificate of incorporation of the
surviving corporation will also contain provisions no less favorable with
respect to indemnification for matters occurring from and after the effective
time of the merger than are set forth in Quest Diagnostics' certificate of
incorporation in effect on the date of the merger agreement.

     The merger agreement also provides that the surviving corporation will
maintain in effect for six years from the effective time of the merger,
directors' and officers' liability insurance covering those persons who were
covered on the date of the merger agreement by the directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies maintained by Unilab (provided that the surviving
corporation or Quest Diagnostics may substitute in lieu of such policies,
policies of at least the same dollar limit coverage containing terms and
conditions that are not, in the aggregate, less favorable) with respect to
matters occurring prior to the effective time of the merger. However, in no
event will the surviving corporation or Quest Diagnostics be required to expend
more than an agreed-upon percentage of the current annual premium paid by Unilab
for its directors' and officers' liability insurance policies now in effect. In
the event the amount of the premiums necessary to maintain or procure such
insurance coverage exceeds such maximum amount, the surviving corporation will
maintain or procure, for such six-year period, the most advantageous policies of
directors' and officers' insurance obtainable for a premium equal to that
maximum amount.

     In addition, for six years from and after the effective time of the merger,
the surviving corporation will, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL on
the date of the merger agreement, indemnify and hold harmless (and release from
any liability to the surviving corporation or any of their respective
subsidiaries) the persons who, at or prior to the effective time of the merger,
were officers or directors of Unilab or served on behalf of Unilab as an officer
or director of any of Unilab's current or former subsidiaries against all
expenses (including attorneys' fees), losses, claims, damages, judgments, fines
and amounts paid in settlement that are actually and reasonably incurred by the
person in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or
proceeding, whether criminal, civil, administrative or investigative, that
related to an event, act or omission which occurred prior to the effective time
of the merger by reason of the fact that such person was at or prior to the
effective time of the merger a director or officer of Unilab or any of its
current or former subsidiaries, provided that the surviving corporation will not
be responsible for any amounts paid in settlement of any such claim without the
prior written consent of Quest Diagnostics or the surviving corporation. In the
event any such claim is asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights
to indemnification will continue until such claim is disposed of or all
judgments, orders, decrees or other rulings in connection with such claim are
fully satisfied.

     The merger agreement provides that all contracts, agreements, arrangements
or understandings between Unilab and any persons who, at prior to the effective
time of the merger, were officers or directors of Unilab or who served on behalf
of Unilab as an officer or director of any of Unilab's current or former
subsidiaries, as in effect on the date of the merger agreement, will survive the
merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

               UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     On April 1, 2002, Quest Diagnostics completed its previously announced
acquisition of all of the outstanding voting stock of American Medical
Laboratories, Incorporated, or AML. The all cash purchase price of approximately
$335 million and related transaction costs, together with the repayment of
approximately $150 million of principal and related accrued interest
representing substantially all of AML's then existing outstanding debt as of the
closing of the AML acquisition, was financed by Quest Diagnostics with cash
on-hand, $300 million of borrowings under its existing secured receivables
credit facility and $175 million of borrowings under its existing unsecured
revolving credit facility. The acquisition of AML will be accounted for under
the purchase method of accounting.

     Because the AML acquisition was completed on April 1, 2002, only subsequent
event-type information regarding AML and the related borrowings is included in
Quest Diagnostics' latest quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on
May 13, 2002. Although not required by the applicable SEC rules, we believe it
would be beneficial to Unilab stockholders to reflect the AML acquisition and
the related borrowings in the following unaudited pro forma combined financial
statements to assist them in understanding the combined financial position and
results of operations of Quest Diagnostics after giving effect to both the AML
and Unilab acquisitions and the related borrowings.

     The following unaudited pro forma combined financial statements of Quest
Diagnostics have been prepared to illustrate the effects of the following
transactions:

     - Quest Diagnostics' purchase of all of AML's outstanding stock, its
       financing of the all cash purchase price and related transaction costs
       associated with the AML acquisition, and the repayment of substantially
       all of AML's outstanding debt and related accrued interest with cash
       on-hand and borrowings under its secured receivables credit facility and
       unsecured revolving credit facility.

     - Quest Diagnostics' purchase of all of Unilab's outstanding common stock,
       the financing of the cash portion of the purchase price and related
       transaction costs associated with the Unilab acquisition, and the
       repayment of substantially all of Unilab's $200 million of outstanding
       debt with cash on-hand and borrowings under a new $550 million one-year
       bridge loan facility. Quest Diagnostics expects to re-finance the bridge
       loan facility with permanent financing in the bank and possibly public
       debt markets. These unaudited pro forma combined financial statements
       assume that the bridge loan facility is outstanding for the entire
       one-year term. The notes to the unaudited pro forma combined financial
       statements disclose the potential impact associated with the refinancing
       of the bridge loan facility on net interest expense. See "Description of
       the Transaction -- Financing of the Transaction".

     - For purposes of these unaudited pro forma combined financial statements,
       we have assumed that all outstanding options to acquire Unilab shares are
       exercised and that $297 million of cash is paid to Unilab stockholders in
       the offer, with the remaining portion of the purchase price paid through
       the issuance of approximately 8.5 million Quest Diagnostics shares
       (valued at approximately $801 million, or $94.08 per share, based on the
       average closing stock price of Quest Diagnostics shares for the five
       trading days ended May 10, 2002).

     The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are subject to change
due to the final determination of the purchase price based on Unilab
stockholders' elections to receive cash or Quest Diagnostics shares in exchange
for their Unilab shares. As such, the final number of Quest Diagnostics shares
and the value assigned to such shares is subject to change. The following table
summarizes the potential range of the purchase price depending on the percentage
of Unilab shares tendered for cash in the offer and the

impact on the total purchase price of each $1 per share change in the value
attributed to the Quest Diagnostics shares, based on the trading price of those
shares issued in the offer or the merger (in millions):

(a)  Represents the maximum and minimum percentage of Unilab shares that can be
     tendered for $26.50 in cash.

(b)  Represents the product of (i) the approximately 37.4 million shares of
     Unilab outstanding as of March 31, 2002 on a fully diluted basis, (ii) the
     cash election percentage specified in column (a) above and (iii) the cash
     consideration per share of $26.50.

(c)  Represents the number of Quest Diagnostics shares issued to Unilab
     stockholders in exchange for the Unilab shares not tendered for cash. The
     number of Quest Diagnostics shares is equal to the product of (i) the
     approximately 37.4 million shares of Unilab outstanding as of March 31,
     2002 on a fully diluted basis, (ii) the percentage of Unilab shares not
     tendered for cash and (iii) the exchange ratio of 0.3256.

(d)  Represents the total value of Quest Diagnostics shares to be issued in
     column (c) above. The value is equal to the product of (i) the number of
     Quest Diagnostics shares in column (c) above and (ii) $94.08 per share
     (representing the average closing stock price of Quest Diagnostics shares
     for the five trading days ended May 10, 2002).

(e)  Represents the total purchase price based on the assumptions in columns (a)
     through (d) above. The total purchase price is equal to the sum of (i) the
     cash portion of the purchase price in column (b) above and (ii) the value
     of the Quest Diagnostics shares in column (d) above. The total purchase
     price does not include the approximately $200 million of Unilab debt
     assumed in connection with the transaction.

(f)  Represents the change in the total purchase price for every $1 change in
     the per share price of the Quest Diagnostics shares in column (c) above.

     The AML acquisition and Unilab acquisition are collectively referred to by
us as the Acquisitions. The borrowings under Quest Diagnostics' existing credit
facilities and anticipated bridge loan facility are collectively referred to by
us as the Borrowings.

     The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet as of March 31, 2002 gives
effect to the Acquisitions, the repayment of substantially all of AML's and
Unilab's existing outstanding debt and the Borrowings as if they had occurred on
March 31, 2002. The unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations assume
the Acquisitions, the repayment of substantially all of AML's and Unilab's
existing outstanding debt and the Borrowings were effected on January 1, 2001.
The Acquisitions will be accounted for under the purchase method. As such, the
cost to acquire AML and Unilab will be allocated to the respective assets and
liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values at the closings of the
AML and Unilab acquisitions. Separate allocations of the costs to acquire AML
and Unilab have been made to the assets and liabilities of AML and Unilab in the
accompanying unaudited pro forma combined financial statements based on
estimates, which in the case of AML are preliminary, and in the case of Unilab
are estimated. The final allocations may be different from the amounts reflected
in the accompanying unaudited pro forma combined financial statements.

     The estimated costs associated with severance and other integration-related
activities for 2002 and 2003, including the elimination of duplicate facilities
and excess capacity, operational realignment and related workforce reductions
are not included in the unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet as of March
31, 2002. We estimate that Quest Diagnostics will incur up to $20 million of
costs to integrate Quest Diagnostics and AML, and up to $20 million of
additional costs to integrate Quest Diagnostics and Unilab. A significant
portion of these costs is expected to require cash outlays. To the extent that
the costs relate to actions that impact the employees and operations of the
acquired companies, such costs will be accounted for as a cost of the
acquisitions. To the extent that the costs relate to actions that impact Quest
Diagnostics' employees and operations, such costs will be accounted for as a
charge to earnings in the periods that the integration plans are approved and
communicated. These estimates are preliminary and will be subject to revisions
as integration

plans are developed and finalized. Quest Diagnostics expects to finalize and
record these costs during the second or third quarter of 2002.

     The unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations do not include
the costs of integrating the Acquisitions, nor do they include the estimated $45
million in annual synergies expected to be realized upon completion of the
integration of the Acquisitions.

     The pro forma adjustments, and the assumptions on which they are based, are
described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma combined
financial statements.

     The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are presented for
illustrative purposes only to aid you in your analysis of the impact to Quest
Diagnostics of the Acquisitions and the Borrowings. The unaudited pro forma
combined financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the combined
financial position or results of operations that would have been realized had
Quest Diagnostics, AML and Unilab been a single entity during the periods
presented. In addition, the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements
are not necessarily indicative of the future results that Quest Diagnostics will
experience after the Acquisitions. The unaudited pro forma combined financial
statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the historical
financial statements of Quest Diagnostics and Unilab incorporated by reference
into this document.

BALANCE SHEET ADJUSTMENTS

RELATING TO THE AML ACQUISITION

(a)  Includes $0.5 million of loans due from stockholders of AML as of March 31,
     2002, which serves to reduce AML's historical common stockholders' equity.

(b)  Reflects the cash proceeds of $475 million in borrowings under Quest
     Diagnostics' existing secured receivables credit facility and unsecured
     revolving credit facility to finance the purchase price and related
     transaction costs associated with the acquisition of AML and to repay
     substantially all of AML's then existing outstanding debt. At the close of
     the transaction on April 1, 2002, Quest Diagnostics borrowed $300 million
     under its secured receivables credit facility and $175 million under its
     unsecured revolving credit facility. On May 2, 2002, Quest Diagnostics
     repaid $100 million of the amount outstanding under its unsecured revolving
     credit facility. This repayment is not reflected in the accompanying
     unaudited pro forma combined financial statements.

(c)  Reflects merger costs and expenses incurred by AML in conjunction with the
     AML acquisition. Approximately $2.5 million represents the write-off of
     costs capitalized in AML's historical balance sheet as of March 31, 2002.
     The costs written off include $1.5 million of notes receivable which were
     forgiven in conjunction with the closing of the AML acquisition. The
     remaining $1.0 million, included in other assets, primarily represents the
     write-off of costs capitalized in connection with AML's original initial
     public offering which was canceled as a result of the AML acquisition.

     In addition to the non-cash charges above, AML incurred approximately $10.3
     million of merger related expenses, primarily comprised of investment
     banking and legal fees, which has been reflected as an increase in accounts
     payable and accrued expenses. Partially offsetting this increase in
     accounts payable and accrued expenses is the estimated tax benefit
     associated with the merger costs and expenses of $2.4 million, resulting in
     a net increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $7.9 million.

     The $10.4 million reduction in common stockholders' equity reflects the
     total merger costs and expenses incurred by AML in conjunction with the AML
     acquisition of $12.8 million, net of the $2.4 million tax benefit disclosed
     above.

(d)  Reflects the purchase of all the outstanding common stock of AML, net of
     amounts owed by AML stockholders to AML, and the payment of transaction
     costs associated with the acquisition of AML as follows (in millions):

- --------------------

(d)(1) Pursuant to the AML merger agreements, AML stockholders and option
       holders received their cash consideration in exchange for their
       outstanding shares net of amounts owed to AML by the stockholders
       and employee option holders, in the form of notes, including accrued
       interest on such notes.

(d)(2) Includes $36.2 million of goodwill recorded in AML's historical
       balance sheet as of March 31, 2002.

(d)(3) Represents the adjustment to reduce AML's historical net book value
       of intangible assets to estimated fair value. Based on the nature
       and operations of the businesses of Quest Diagnostics and AML and
       Quest Diagnostics' strategic justification for pursuing the AML
       acquisition, Quest Diagnostics management determined, in
       consultation with third party valuation specialists, that none of
       the potential AML intangible assets qualify for inclusion as
       intangible assets under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
       No. 141, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141").

(d)(4) Represents the reduction in unamortized deferred financing costs of
       $1.2 million related to AML's outstanding debt that was repaid at
       the closing of the AML acquisition with the remainder representing a
       reduction in the carrying value associated with an affiliated
       company.

(d)(5) Represents the increase in the carrying value of AML's outstanding
       debt as of March 31, 2002 to its estimated fair value based on the
       net present value of the remaining cash flows associated with the
       debt which was repaid at the closing of the AML acquisition.

(d)(6) Primarily represents the tax benefit associated with the tax
       deductible employee compensation related to the exercise of AML's
       outstanding options at the closing of the AML acquisition.

(d)(7) Based on the preliminary allocation of the acquisition cost of AML
       and the amount of goodwill recorded in AML's historical balance
       sheet as of March 31, 2002 (as noted in (d)(2) above), a pro forma
       adjustment of $381.1 million, representing incremental goodwill
       acquired, was reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined balance
       sheet at March 31, 2002.

     The increase in common stockholders' equity of $0.8 million represents the
     elimination of AML's historical net equity of $9.6 million, offset by the
     impact of the net charge to equity of $10.4 million related to the AML
     merger costs and expenses.

(e)  Reflects the payment of the cash portion of the AML merger costs and
     expenses accrued for in (c) above.

(f)  Reflects the repayment of substantially all of AML's outstanding debt of
     $150.3 million, plus accrued interest payable of $3.4 million as of March
     31, 2002, and $1.7 million paid to terminate AML's then existing interest
     rate swap agreement. The accrued interest payable and the liability
     representing the fair value associated with AML's interest rate swap
     agreement were included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in AML's
     historical balance sheet as of March 31, 2002. The portion of AML's
     outstanding debt not repaid is principally associated with obligations
     under capital leases totaling $1 million as of March 31, 2002.

RELATING TO THE UNILAB ACQUISITION

(g)  Reflects the gross cash proceeds of $525 million in borrowings under Quest
     Diagnostics' new $550 million one-year bridge loan facility to finance the
     cash portion of the purchase price and related transaction costs associated
     with the acquisition of Unilab and to repay substantially all of Unilab's
     existing outstanding debt. The gross proceeds have been reduced for debt
     financing costs of $0.8 million which will be capitalized. Quest
     Diagnostics expects to refinance the bridge loan facility with permanent
     financing in the bank and possibly public debt markets. See note(s) below
     regarding the potential impact associated with the refinancing of the
     bridge loan facility on net interest expense included in the unaudited pro
     forma combined statement of operations.

(h)  Reflects special charges expected to be incurred by Unilab in conjunction
     with the Unilab acquisition. Approximately $27.9 million represents
     non-cash expenses related to stock based compensation due to the
     accelerated vesting of outstanding Unilab stock options. The stock based
     compensation for the options would be recorded as a charge to earnings with
     an offsetting increase in additional paid-in-capital. In the accompanying
     unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet, this non-recurring charge
     incurred in conjunction with the acquisition of Unilab, is reflected as a
     reduction in retained earnings within common stockholders' equity.

     In addition to the non-cash charges above, Unilab is expected to incur
     approximately $11.3 million of merger related expenses, primarily comprised
     of investment banking and legal fees, which has been reflected as an
     increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Offsetting this increase
     in accounts payable and accrued expenses is the estimated tax benefit,
     associated with the stock based compensation and merger related expenses
     outlined above, of $11.7 million, resulting in a net decrease in accounts
     payable and accrued expenses of $0.4 million.

     The $0.4 million increase in common stockholders' equity reflects the
     increase in additional paid in capital, associated with the non-cash stock
     based compensation related to the accelerated vesting of the Unilab stock
     options, of $27.9 million, partially offset by a reduction in retained
     earnings resulting from the after-tax impact of the special charges of
     $27.5 million ($39.2 million of total special charges, including the stock
     based compensation and merger related expenses, offset by the $11.7 million
     tax benefit disclosed above).

(i)  Reflects the purchase of all the outstanding Unilab shares and the payment
     of transaction costs associated with the acquisition of Unilab. For
     purposes of the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements, Quest
     Diagnostics assumed that all outstanding options to acquire shares of
     Unilab common stock are exercised and that approximately $297 million of
     cash is paid to Unilab stockholders in the offer, with the remaining
     portion of the purchase price paid through the issuance of approximately
     8.5 million shares of common stock of Quest Diagnostics (valued at
     approximately $801.1 million, or

     $94.08 per share, based on the average closing stock price of Quest
     Diagnostics shares for the five trading days ended May 10, 2002). The
     components of acquisition cost are estimated as follows (in millions):

     -------------------------
(i)(1) Includes $92.9 million of goodwill recorded in Unilab's historical

       intangible assets to estimated fair value. Based on the nature and
       operations of the businesses of Quest Diagnostics and Unilab, and Quest
       Diagnostics' strategic justification for pursuing the Unilab acquisition,
       Quest Diagnostics management determined, in consultation with third party
       valuation specialists, that none of the potential Unilab intangible
       assets qualify for inclusion as intangible assets under SFAS 141.

       present value of the estimated remaining cash flows, reflecting the
       estimated premium to refinance Unilab's 12 3/4% senior subordinated

       options at the closing of the Unilab acquisition and the tax benefit
       associated with the estimated premium to refinance Unilab's 12 3/4%

$1.0 billion, representing incremental goodwill acquired, was reflected in the
unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet at March 31, 2002.

The increase in common stockholders' equity of $768.4 million primarily
represents the elimination of Unilab's historical net equity of $32.3 million,
       offset by the value of the 8.5 million Quest Diagnostics shares assumed
       to be issued in conjunction with the Unilab acquisition of $801.1
       million.

(j)  Reflects the payment of the cash portion of Unilab's accrued merger costs
     and expenses accrued for in (h) above.

     $227.0 million (including the impact of the preliminary purchase price
     allocation adjustments above of $27.7 million), plus accrued interest
     payable of $6.5 million as of March 31, 2002. The portion of Unilab's
     outstanding debt not repaid is principally associated with obligations
     under capital leases totaling $1.7 million as of March 31, 2002.

STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS ADJUSTMENTS

RELATING TO THE AML ACQUISITION

(l)  In order to provide more meaningful comparisons, Quest Diagnostics recorded
     this pro forma adjustment to reclassify certain costs and expenses in the
     historical financial statements of AML on a basis consistent with that of
     Quest Diagnostics. These adjustments are associated with the
     reclassification of:

      (1) Amortization of deferred financing costs,

      (2) Depreciation expense, and

      (3) Information technology costs in support of laboratory operations,
          occupancy costs and the costs related to professional liability
          insurance programs.

(m) The pro forma adjustment to net interest expense represents the difference
    between AML's historical interest expense and the assumed interest expense
    associated with the borrowings under Quest Diagnostics' existing credit
    facilities to finance the acquisition of AML and related transaction costs,
    and repayment of substantially all of AML's existing outstanding debt. For
    purposes of calculating the pro forma net interest expense adjustment, the
    borrowings consist of $300 million under Quest Diagnostics' secured
    receivables credit facility and $175 million under Quest Diagnostics'
    unsecured revolving credit facility. Both the secured receivables credit
    facility and unsecured revolving credit facility bear interest at variable
    rates. The assumed interest rates on the borrowings under the secured
    receivables credit facility and unsecured revolving credit facility were
    2.42% and 3.2%, respectively. If the assumed interest rates fluctuate by
    1/8%, interest expense fluctuates by approximately $0.6 million annually.
    Depending upon interest rates and the rate at which Quest Diagnostics is
    able to repay debt, amounts borrowed under Quest Diagnostics' existing
    credit facilities and ultimately net interest expense may vary from that
    indicated above.

(n)  Reflects the pro forma impact on the amortization of goodwill and
     intangible assets to eliminate AML's historical amortization of goodwill
     and intangible assets, assuming that the nonamortization provisions of
     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
     Intangibles" ("SFAS 142"), were in effect as of January 1, 2001, related to
     the goodwill acquired in the AML acquisition. Based on our preliminary
     allocation of purchase price and in consultation with third party valuation
     specialists, no intangibles assets, meeting the criteria under SFAS 141
     were identified for AML.

(o)  The pro forma adjustment to income tax expense represents the estimated
     income tax impact of the pro forma adjustments at an incremental tax rate
     of approximately 40%. The effective tax rate related to the pro forma
     adjustments is impacted by the pro forma adjustment to AML's historical
     amortization of goodwill and intangible assets, the majority of which is
     not deductible for tax purposes.

RELATING TO THE UNILAB ACQUISITION

(p)  Includes $23.8 million of stock based compensation comprised of a $1.5
     million non-cash charge related to service options issued to non-employee
     consultants that were accelerated in 2001 and $22.3 million of non-cash
     charges related to performance-based stock options that met certain
     contingent vesting provisions in 2001.

(q)  The provision for special charges includes non-recurring charges of $3.0
     million related to a federal investigation under the False Claims Act
     relating to Unilab's billings, $2.5 million paid to Unilab's majority
     shareholder for the termination of annual fees for financial advisory
     services provided to Unilab, $0.9 million related to the secondary offering
     of Unilab's common stock and $0.6 million of legal fees related to the
     settlement of claims brought by a former employee regarding employment
     benefits.

(r)  In order to provide more meaningful comparisons, Quest Diagnostics recorded
     this pro forma adjustment to reclassify depreciation expense in the
     historical financial statements of Unilab on a basis consistent with that
     of Quest Diagnostics.

(s)  The pro forma adjustment to net interest expense represents the difference
     between Unilab's historical interest expense and the assumed interest
     expense associated with the assumed borrowings under the new bridge loan
     facility to finance the acquisition of Unilab and related transaction
     costs, and repayment of substantially all of Unilab's existing outstanding
     debt. For purposes of calculating the pro forma net interest expense
     adjustment, the borrowings were assumed to consist of $525 million under
     Quest Diagnostics' new $550 million one-year bridge loan facility. The
     assumed interest rate on the borrowings under the new bridge loan facility,
     including amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately $0.8
     million on an annual basis, was 3.8%. If the assumed interest rate
     fluctuates by 1/8%, interest expense fluctuates by approximately $0.7
     million annually. Depending upon interest rates and the rate at which Quest
     Diagnostics is able to repay debt, amounts borrowed under the new bridge
     loan facility and ultimately net interest expense may vary from that
     indicated above.

     Additionally, Quest Diagnostics expects to refinance the amounts
     outstanding under the new bridge loan facility with permanent financing in
     the bank and possibly public debt markets. These unaudited pro forma
     combined financial statements assume that the bridge loan facility is
     outstanding for the entire one-year term. The interest rates associated
     with the expected refinancing of the bridge loan facility on a long-term
     permanent basis would be significantly higher than the assumed interest
     rate associated with the bridge loan facility if such refinancing was
     through the public debt markets. The permanent financing may consist of
     both variable and fixed interest rate indebtedness. For every 1%
     fluctuation in interest rates from the bridge loan facility rate of 3.8%,
     interest expense will fluctuate by approximately $5.3 million annually.
     Depending upon interest rates and the rate at which Quest Diagnostics is
     able to repay debt, amounts borrowed and ultimately net interest expense
     may vary from that indicated above.

(t)  Reflects the pro forma impact on the amortization of goodwill and
     intangible assets to eliminate Unilab's historical amortization of goodwill
     and intangible assets, assuming that the nonamortization provisions of SFAS
     142 were in effect as of January 1, 2001, related to the goodwill acquired
     in the Unilab acquisition. Based on our preliminary allocation of purchase
     price and in consultation with third party valuation specialists, no
     intangibles assets, meeting the criteria under SFAS 141, were identified
     for Unilab.

(u)  The pro forma adjustment to income tax expense represents the estimated
     income tax impact of the pro forma adjustments at an incremental tax rate
     of approximately 40%.

(v)  Basic net income per common share is calculated by dividing net income,
     less preferred stock dividends (approximately $118 for 2001), by the
     weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income
     per common share is calculated by dividing net income, less preferred stock
     dividends, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding,
     after giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding
     during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares primarily include
     stock options and restricted common shares granted under Quest Diagnostics'
     Employee Equity Participation Program. Basic and diluted net income per
     common share on a pro forma combined basis gives effect to the assumed 8.5
     million of Quest Diagnostics common stock issued to Unilab stockholders

     to effectuate the acquisition of Unilab, assuming that the Unilab
     acquisition closed on January 1, 2001. For purposes of the unaudited pro
     forma combined financial statements, we assumed that all outstanding
     options to acquire shares of Unilab common stock are exercised and that
     $297 million of cash was paid to Unilab stockholders in the offer, with the
     remaining portion of the purchase price paid through the issuance of
     approximately 8.5 million shares of common stock of Quest Diagnostics.

(w)  Quest Diagnostics adopted SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. Assuming the
     nonamortization provisions of SFAS 142 had been effective at the beginning
     of fiscal 2001, pro forma net income for the year ended December 31, 2001
     would have increased by $36.0 million, representing the reduction in Quest
     Diagnostics' historical goodwill amortization, net of taxes.

DELAWARE LAW AND QUEST DIAGNOSTICS' CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAW
PROVISIONS MAY HAVE AN ANTI-TAKEOVER EFFECT

     Provisions in Quest Diagnostics' certificate of incorporation, by-laws and
Delaware law could make it harder for someone to acquire Quest Diagnostics
through a tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. Quest Diagnostics is
governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which provides that a
person who owns (or within three years, did own) 15% or more of a company's
voting stock is an "interested stockholder". Section 203 prohibits a public
Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested
stockholder for a period commencing three years from the date in which the
person became an interested stockholder unless:

     - the board of directors approved the transaction that resulted in the
       stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;

     - upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder
       becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at
       least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation (excluding shares owned
       by officers, directors, or certain employee stock purchase plans); or

     - at or subsequent to the time the transaction is approved by the board of
       directors, there is an affirmative vote of at least 66.67% of the
       outstanding voting stock.

     Section 203 could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover attempts
against Quest Diagnostics and, accordingly, may discourage attempts to acquire
it through tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise.

     Quest Diagnostics' certificate of incorporation and by-laws include certain
restrictions on who may call a special meeting of stockholders and prohibit
certain actions by written consent of the holders of common stock. These
provisions could delay, deter or prevent a future takeover or acquisition of
Quest Diagnostics unless such takeover or acquisition is approved by the board
of directors. Quest Diagnostics has a staggered board of directors, so that it
would take three successive annual meetings to replace all directors. Quest
Diagnostics' certificate of incorporation also requires the approval of holders
of at least 80% of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of Quest
Diagnostics entitled to vote generally in the election of directors as a
condition for mergers and certain other business combinations with any
beneficial owner of more than 10% of such voting power or an interested
stockholder, unless (1) the transaction is approved by at least a majority of
directors that are not affiliated or associated with the interested stockholder
with whom Quest Diagnostics is seeking a business combination or (2) certain
minimum price, form of consideration and procedural requirements are met.

RIGHTS AGREEMENT

     On December 31, 1996, Quest Diagnostics adopted a shareholder rights
agreement. As with most shareholder rights agreements, the terms of Quest
Diagnostics' rights agreement are complex and not easily summarized. This
summary may not contain all of the information that is important to you.
Accordingly, you should carefully read Quest Diagnostics' rights agreement, as
amended, that is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this S-4
registration statement of which this prospectus is a part.

     Quest Diagnostics' rights agreement provides that each share of Quest
Diagnostics' common stock will have the right to purchase a unit consisting of
one-hundredth of its series A preferred stock at a purchase price of $250. Each
share of series A preferred stock is entitled to 100 votes per share and votes
together with Quest Diagnostics' common stock as a single class. The series A
preferred stock is not redeemable. Holders of rights will have no rights as
Quest Diagnostics' stockholders, including the right to vote or receive
dividends, simply by virtue of holding the rights.

     Initially, the rights under Quest Diagnostics' rights agreement are
attached to outstanding certificates representing Quest Diagnostics' common
stock and no separate certificates representing the rights will be distributed.
The rights will separate from the shares of Quest Diagnostics' common stock and
be represented by separate certificates approximately 10 days after someone
acquires or commences a tender or exchange offer for 20% of Quest Diagnostics'
outstanding common stock except in the case of SmithKline Beecham and its
affiliates, who may acquire up to 29.5% of Quest Diagnostics' outstanding common
stock without triggering the separation of the rights from Quest Diagnostics'
common stock.

     After the rights separate from the shares of Quest Diagnostics' common
stock, certificates representing the rights will be mailed to record holders of
the shares of Quest Diagnostics' common stock. Once distributed, the rights
certificates alone will represent the rights. All of the shares of Quest
Diagnostics' common stock issued prior to the date the rights separate from the
common stock will be issued with the rights attached. The rights are not
exercisable until the date the rights separate from the shares of the common
stock. The rights will expire on December 31, 2006 unless earlier redeemed or
exchanged by Quest Diagnostics.

     If a person or group obtains or has the right to obtain 20% or more of the
shares of Quest Diagnostics' common stock, then each holder of a right shall be
entitled to receive common stock in lieu of the series A preferred stock upon
exercise of the right and payment of the purchase price. The number of shares of
common stock the holder of the right shall be entitled to receive shall have a
value equal to two times the purchase price paid by such holder upon exercise of
the right, unless Quest Diagnostics' board of directors exercises its option
pursuant to the rights agreement to exchange all or part of the outstanding
rights for common stock at an exchange ratio of one common stock per right prior
to a person or group beneficially owning 50% or more of the shares of Quest
Diagnostics' common stock. If Quest Diagnostics is acquired in a merger,
consolidation or other business combination or more than 50% of Quest
Diagnostics' assets are sold or

transferred, each right will thereafter entitle the holder thereof to receive,
upon the exercise of such right, common stock of the acquiring corporation
having a value equal to two times the purchase price of such right.

     Quest Diagnostics' rights agreement may have anti-takeover effects. The
rights may cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to
acquire Quest Diagnostics. Accordingly, the existence of the rights may deter
acquirors from making takeover proposals or tender offers. However, the rights
are not intended to prevent a takeover but rather are designed to enhance the
ability of Quest Diagnostics' board to negotiate with an acquiror on behalf of
all the stockholders. In addition, the rights should not interfere with a proxy
contest.

LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS

     Quest Diagnostics' certificate of incorporation limits the liability of
directors to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides
that directors of a corporation will not be personally liable for monetary
damages for breach of their fiduciary duties as directors, including, without
limitation, directors serving on committees of Quest Diagnostics' board of
directors. Directors remain liable for:

     - any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to Quest Diagnostics or its
       stockholders;

     - any act or omission not in good faith or which involves intentional
       misconduct or a knowing violation of the law;

     - any violation of Section 174 of the DGCL, which proscribes the payment of
       dividends and stock purchases or redemptions under certain circumstances;
       and

     - any transaction from which the directors derive an improper personal
       benefit.

     This provision, however, has no effect on the availability of equitable
remedies such as an injunction or rescission. In addition, this provision will
not limit liability under state or federal securities laws.

     The certificate of incorporation provides that Quest Diagnostics shall
indemnify its officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by such
law. Quest Diagnostics believes that these provisions will assist it in
attracting and retaining qualified individuals to serve as directors.

stockholders of Quest Diagnostics, and their rights as such will be governed by
Delaware law and the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of Quest
Diagnostics. The material differences between the rights of holders of Unilab
