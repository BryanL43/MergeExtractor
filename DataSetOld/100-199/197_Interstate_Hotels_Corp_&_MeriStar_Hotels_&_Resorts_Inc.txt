(1) This registration statement relates to the common stock, par value $0.01 per
    share, of the registrant and associated rights to purchase the registrant's
    Series A junior participating preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, to
    be issued to holders of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
    Interstate Hotels Corporation in connection with the proposed merger of the
    registrant and Interstate.
(2) Based on the maximum number of shares of the registrant's common stock to be
    delivered pursuant to the merger agreement, which includes (i) approximately
    63,500,000 shares of common stock issuable to the holders of the issued and
    outstanding common stock and convertible securities of Interstate; and (ii)
    approximately 3,000,000 shares of the registrant's common stock that may be

(3) Estimated solely for purpose of determining the registration fee in
    accordance with Rule 457(f) of the Securities Act of 1933. Pursuant to Rule
    457(f)(i), the proposed maximum offering price per share of the registrant's
    common stock is based on the average of the high and low prices per share of
    Interstate Class A common stock on May 29, 2002 on the Nasdaq SmallCap
    Market, divided by the exchange ratio in the merger of 4.6 shares of the
    registrant's common stock for each share of Interstate's common stock.
(4) No additional filing fee is payable with respect to the rights to purchase
    the Series A junior participating preferred stock of the registrant, since
    no additional consideration is payable in respect of those rights.

MeriStar. The boards of directors of both Interstate and MeriStar have
unanimously approved the merger. Upon completion of the merger, MeriStar will
change its name to "Interstate Hotels & Resorts, Inc."

     In the merger, Interstate stockholders will be entitled to receive 4.6

each share of Interstate common stock that they own at the effective time of the
merger. Any Interstate convertible securities outstanding at the effective time
of the merger will be converted in connection with the merger into shares of the
combined company common stock and associated stockholder rights. Following the
merger, Interstate's stockholders will hold approximately 62% of the outstanding
common stock of the combined company and MeriStar's current stockholders will
hold approximately 38% of the common stock.

To the Stockholders of MeriStar Hotels & Resorts, Inc.:

     NOTICE IS GIVEN that the annual meeting of the stockholders of MeriStar
Hotels & Resorts, Inc. will be held at the Hilton Crystal City Hotel, 2399
Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, Virginia 22202, on           , 2002, at
      a.m., local time. The board of directors asks you to attend this meeting,
in person or by proxy, for the following purposes:

     1.     To consider, approve and adopt the merger agreement and the
            transactions contemplated by it. (See page 73.)

     2.     To consider and approve the issuance of shares of MeriStar common
            stock in connection with the merger. (See page 73.)

     3.     To elect a new board of directors for the combined company. (See
            page 138.)

     4.     To consider, approve and adopt a proposal to amend the certificate
            of incorporation and bylaws of MeriStar, as provided in the merger
            agreement, which amendments provide for changing the name of
            MeriStar to "Interstate Hotels & Resorts, Inc.," fixing the size of
            the board of directors of the combined company at 13 for the next 18
            months, insuring the nomination of the slate of directors proposed
            in this joint proxy statement and prospectus at all stockholder
            meetings during the next 18 months and increasing the authorized
            number of shares of capital stock to 255 million, of which 250
            million shares will be common stock and 5 million shares will be
            preferred stock. (See page 89.)

     5.     To consider and vote upon an amendment to the certificate of
            incorporation of MeriStar to effect a five to one reverse stock
            split of the outstanding shares of common stock, with the board of
            directors of MeriStar having discretion to determine whether the
            reverse stock split will actually be effected and the timing of the
            reverse stock split, so long as any reverse stock split shall occur
            not later than 12 months after the MeriStar annual meeting, and to
            authorize the board of directors to take all action to give effect
            to the reverse stock split. (See page 107.)

     6.     To consider and adopt an amended and restated incentive plan. (See
            page 91.)

     7.     To consider and adopt amendments to the employee stock purchase
            plan. (See page 100.)

     8.     To consider and adopt amendments to the non-employee directors'
            incentive plan. (See page 104.)

     9.     To elect nominees for director who will serve only in the event that
            the merger does not occur. (See page 112.)

     10. To transact any other business as may properly come before the annual
         meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the annual meeting.

     The approval of proposals 1, 4 and 5 above requires the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of MeriStar common stock.
The election of the directors in proposals 3 and 9 requires the affirmative vote
of a plurality of the votes cast at the annual meeting. The approval of each of
proposals 2, 6, 7 and 8 requires that holders of at least a majority of the
outstanding shares of MeriStar

common stock be present at the annual meeting in person or by proxy and that the
proposal receive the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of those shares
that are present at the annual meeting.

     Approval of proposals 1 through 4 above is a condition to the closing of
the merger. Therefore, if you vote against any one of these proposals, this
would have the effect of a vote against the other proposals and the merger.
Should any of these proposals not be approved by the required vote of the
stockholders at the annual meeting, or if the stockholders of Interstate do not
approve the merger at Interstate's special meeting, then both parties will be
entitled to terminate the merger agreement. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF MERISTAR
HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY IT AND UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE HOLDERS OF MERISTAR COMMON STOCK VOTE
FOR THE APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY IT AND VOTE TO ELECT THE NOMINEES FOR DIRECTOR OF THE COMBINED
COMPANY.

     If for this or any other reason the merger is not completed, none of
proposals 1 through 4 will be adopted. If MeriStar stockholders approve proposal
number 5 regarding the reverse stock split, the reverse stock split may be
implemented, regardless of whether the proposals relating to the merger are

amount of the 8.75% convertible notes plus the stated amount of the Series B
preferred stock is also required for approval of the merger and has been

                    QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MEETINGS

Q:  WHAT IS THE PROPOSED MERGER?

A:   The merger is a transaction in which Interstate will be merged with and
     into MeriStar, and MeriStar will be the surviving company. MeriStar will be
     renamed "Interstate Hotels & Resorts, Inc." in connection with the merger.
     The chairman and chief executive officer of the combined company will be
     Mr. Paul W. Whetsell, the current Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
     MeriStar.

Q:  IS THE MERGER AN ACQUISITION BY ONE COMPANY OF THE OTHER?

A:   No. The merger is structured as a merger of equals. MeriStar is the largest
     independent hotel management company in the United States by number of
     rooms managed, and Interstate is the second-largest. The merger is an
     important opportunity for a strategic alliance between two companies with
     complementary businesses. Each company's stockholders will hold a
     substantial portion of the equity in the combined company. The combined
     company's board of directors will have members drawn from both companies'
     boards of directors, and the management team of the combined company will
     draw from both companies' current management teams.

Q:  WHAT WILL I RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?

A:   MeriStar stockholders:  You will continue to hold the MeriStar securities
     you currently own.

     Interstate stockholders:  You will be entitled to receive 4.6 shares of
     combined company common stock and the associated rights issued under the
     combined company's stockholder rights plan for each share of Interstate
     common stock. The holders of Interstate's convertible securities that are
     outstanding at the time of the merger will be entitled to receive 4.6
     shares of the combined company's common stock and the associated
     stockholder rights for each share of Interstate Class A common stock into
     which the convertible securities could have been converted.

    No fractional shares will be issued. Interstate securityholders will receive
    cash instead of fractional shares.

Q:  WHAT WILL BE THE EQUITY CAPITALIZATION OF THE COMBINED COMPANY?

A:   The combined company's authorized capital stock will consist of 200 million
     shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and 25 million shares of
     preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. The combined company will have
     approximately 105 million shares of common stock outstanding on a
     fully-diluted basis.

Q:  IS THIS MERISTAR'S 2002 ANNUAL MEETING ALSO?

A:   Yes. MeriStar stockholders will be asked to approve and adopt proposals
     regarding business normally brought before MeriStar's annual meeting of
     stockholders.

Q:  IS THIS INTERSTATE'S 2002 ANNUAL MEETING ALSO?

A:   No. Interstate's stockholders are only being asked to approve the merger.
     Interstate will hold an annual meeting in 2002 only if the merger is not
     completed.

Q:  WHAT STOCKHOLDER APPROVALS ARE NEEDED?

A:   Each company's stockholders must approve the merger and related
     transactions. In addition, MeriStar stockholders are being asked to approve
     a number of other proposals, some of which must be adopted in order for the
     merger to occur, and some of which are independent of the merger. The
     various required votes are summarized below.

THE MERGER

     MeriStar:  The merger proposal and the proposals relating to the amendment
     of the certificate of incorporation must be approved and the merger
     agreement must be adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
     outstanding shares of MeriStar common stock. A broker non-vote or an
     abstention has the same effect as a vote against the merger and charter
     amendment proposals.

     The approval of the issuance of MeriStar common stock in connection with
     the merger requires that holders of at least a majority of the outstanding
     shares of MeriStar common stock be present at the annual meeting in person
     or by proxy and that the proposal receive the affirmative vote of holders
     of the majority of those shares. For this proposal, a

     broker non-vote does not count towards determining the number of shares
     present at the meeting or the number of votes cast. An abstention has the
     same effect as a vote against the share issuance proposal.

     Interstate:  The merger must be approved by the affirmative vote of holders
     of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Interstate common stock. A
     broker non-vote or an abstention on the Interstate merger proposal has the
     same effect as a vote against the proposal.

ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

    MeriStar:  The nominees to serve as directors must receive a plurality of
    the votes cast at the MeriStar annual meeting to be elected. Abstentions and
    broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of the election.

    Interstate:  No vote is required.

AMENDED AND RESTATED INCENTIVE PLAN AND AMENDMENTS TO THE NON-EMPLOYEE
DIRECTORS' INCENTIVE PLAN AND THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

    MeriStar:  The approval of the amended and restated incentive plan and the
    approvals of the amendments to the non-employee directors' incentive plan
    and the employee stock purchase plan each require that holders of at least a
    majority of the outstanding shares of MeriStar common stock be present at
    the annual meeting in person or by proxy and that the proposal receive the
    affirmative vote of holders of the majority of those shares. A broker
    non-vote does not count towards determining the number of shares present at
    the meeting or the number of votes cast, and an abstention has the same
    effect as a vote against the proposal.

    Interstate:  No vote is required.

REVERSE STOCK SPLIT

    MeriStar:  The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding
    shares of MeriStar common stock is required to approve the reverse stock
    split proposal. An abstention or a broker non-vote will have the effect of a
    vote against the proposal.

    Interstate:  No vote is required.

Q:  WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE COMBINED COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK WILL BE HELD BY
    MERISTAR STOCKHOLDERS AFTER THE MERGER?

A:   The current MeriStar stockholders will hold approximately 38% of the
     outstanding shares of the combined company's common stock.

Q:  WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE COMBINED COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK WILL BE HELD BY
    FORMER INTERSTATE SECURITYHOLDERS?

A:   The current Interstate securityholders, including the holders of
     Interstate's convertible securities, will hold approximately 62% of the
     outstanding shares of the combined company's common stock.

Q:  HAS SOMEONE DETERMINED THE TRANSACTIONS ARE IN MY BEST INTERESTS?

A:   MeriStar:  The MeriStar board of directors has unanimously determined that
     the merger and the transactions relating to the merger, including the
     proposals relating to the merger described in this joint proxy statement
     and prospectus, are advisable to, and in the best interests of, MeriStar
     and its stockholders and recommends that MeriStar stockholders vote FOR
     approval and adoption of each of the proposals relating to the merger and
     to elect the nominees for director of the combined company.

     In addition, the MeriStar board of directors has unanimously determined
     that the transactions contemplated by the other proposals described in this
     joint proxy statement and prospectus, are advisable to, and in the best
     interests of, MeriStar and its stockholders and recommends that MeriStar
     stockholders vote FOR approval and adoption of each of those proposals and
     to elect the nominees for director of MeriStar.

     Interstate:  The Interstate board of directors has unanimously determined,
     based in part on the recommendation of a special committee of the board of
     directors and the opinion of its financial advisor, that the merger,
     including the proposals described in this joint proxy statement and
     prospectus, is advisable and in the best interests of Interstate and its
     common stockholders, and recommends that Interstate stockholders vote FOR
     approval of the merger.

Q:  IS THERE A RISK THAT MERISTAR WILL BE DELISTED BY THE NEW YORK STOCK
    EXCHANGE?

A:   MeriStar has previously announced that it received notification from the
     NYSE that it was not in compliance with NYSE continued listing standards
     because MeriStar's average closing share price was less than $1.00 over a
     consecutive 30-day trading period. The NYSE's continued listing standards
     require that MeriStar bring its 30-day average closing price and its share
     price above $1.00. MeriStar is otherwise in compliance with the NYSE
     continued listing standards. MeriStar has therefore proposed a reverse
     stock split at a ratio of five to one, which is to occur at the discretion
     of the board of directors not later than 12 months after the MeriStar
     stockholder meeting. The reverse split is intended to allow the combined
     company, or MeriStar if the merger is not completed, to comply with the
     NYSE listing standards. If MeriStar common stock is not listed on the NYSE,
     neither Interstate nor MeriStar is required to close the merger.

Q:  DOES THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON THE EXCHANGE RATIO?

A:   If the reverse stock split is completed prior to the closing of the merger,
     the exchange ratio will be 0.92 shares of combined company common stock for
     each share of Interstate common stock assuming no other adjustment is made.
     If the merger is completed, the reverse stock split will be completed only
     at the discretion of the combined company's board of directors not later
     than 12 months after the date of the MeriStar stockholder meeting, so the
     exchange ratio will not be adjusted.

Q:  DO I HAVE APPRAISAL RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE TRANSACTIONS?

A:   MeriStar stockholders:  Under Delaware law, MeriStar stockholders do not
     have appraisal rights with respect to the merger.

     Interstate stockholders:  In accordance with Section 3-202(c) of the
     Maryland General Corporation Law, no appraisal rights are available to
     holders of shares of Interstate Class A common stock in connection with the
     merger. In accordance with Section 3-202 of the Maryland General
     Corporation Law, appraisal rights are available to the holders of shares of
     Interstate Class B common stock and Interstate Series B preferred stock.

Q:  WHAT ARE THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO ME?

A:   MeriStar stockholders:  There will be no tax consequences to you as
     stockholders as a result of the merger.

     Interstate stockholders:  The merger is structured as a tax free
     reorganization under section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, as
     amended. As a result, except for cash paid instead of fractional shares or
     with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights, U.S. holders of
     Interstate common stock will not recognize any taxable gain or loss for
     U.S. federal income tax purposes on the receipt of the combined company's
     common stock in connection with the merger. Each Interstate stockholder's
     tax basis with respect to the shares of combined company common stock it
     will receive in the merger will be the same as that for the shares of
     Interstate common stock that will be surrendered in the merger, reduced by
     any tax basis of the Interstate common stock surrendered that is allocable
     to any fractional share of the combined company common stock for which cash
     is instead received. Each Interstate stockholder's holding period with
     respect to the shares of combined company common stock received in the
     merger will include the holding period of the shares of Interstate common
     stock that will be surrendered in exchange for the combined company's
     common stock.

Q:  WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE TRANSACTIONS TO BE COMPLETED?

A:   MeriStar and Interstate plan to complete the transactions as soon as
     possible after the stockholder meetings, subject to the satisfaction or
     waiver of the other conditions to the transactions. Although they cannot
     predict when these conditions will be satisfied, MeriStar and Interstate
     hope to complete the transactions during the third calendar quarter of
     2002.

Q:  WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?

A:   You should carefully read and consider the information contained in this
     joint proxy statement and prospectus, including its appendices. It contains
     important information about the combined company, MeriStar and Interstate.
     It also contains important information about what the boards of directors
     of MeriStar and Interstate considered in evaluating the transaction.

     You should then complete and sign your proxy card and return it in the
     enclosed return envelope as soon as possible, so that your shares will be
     represented at your company's stockholder meeting. If you sign and send in
     your proxy but do not indicate how you want to vote, your proxy will be
     counted as a vote in favor of the merger and the other proposals.

Q:  CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I HAVE MAILED MY SIGNED PROXY CARD?

A:   Yes. You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the
     applicable meeting. You can do this in one of three ways:

     - First, you can send a written notice stating that you revoke your proxy
       to MeriStar at the address listed below if you are a MeriStar stockholder
       or to Interstate at the address listed below if you are an Interstate
       stockholder;

     - Second, you can complete and submit a new proxy card, dated a later date
       than the first proxy card and send it to MeriStar or Interstate, as
       applicable. The new proxy card will automatically replace any earlier
       dated proxy card that you returned; or

     - Third, you can attend the appropriate stockholder meeting and vote in
       person.

    Your attendance at your stockholder meeting will not, however, by itself
    revoke your proxy.

    You should send any notice of revocation or your completed new proxy card to
    MeriStar or Interstate, as applicable, to the following addresses:

     to the certificate of incorporation proposal or the proposals to amend the
     benefit plans.

     agent will send you written instructions for exchanging your stock

                                 THE COMPANIES

THE COMBINED COMPANY

     The proposed merger combines the two largest independent hotel management
companies in the United States, measured by number of rooms under management.
The combined company will be the premier independent hotel operator in the
world, operating more than 86,000 rooms in over 400 hotels, representing more
than 30 franchise brands in North America and Europe. The combined company will
include BridgeStreet Corporate Housing Worldwide with offices throughout the
United States and in Toronto, London and Paris. Compared to the separate
companies, the combined company will have a stronger balance sheet with more
stable revenues and greater available liquidity to grow its operations through
the acquisition and development of hotel and other properties, as well as the
acquisition of additional management contracts. The merger is also expected to
result in annualized corporate cost savings of between $8 million and $10
million.

     On a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the merger and related
transactions, including the conversion of Interstate's convertible securities,
Interstate making a $9.25 million conversion incentive payment to some holders
of its convertible securities, the completion by MeriStar of an amendment to and
partial repayment of a credit facility extended by MeriStar Hospitality
Corporation, the repayment of approximately $11.0 million of outstanding
indebtedness of Interstate and its principal operating subsidiary and the
refinancing of the companies' credit facilities, the combined company had:

     - EBITDA of approximately $3.2 million for the year ended December 31,
       2001;

     - revenues of approximately $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31,
       2001;

     - more than $300 million in assets, including approximately $10 million of
       cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2002;

     - more than $30 million in availability under its new senior secured credit
       facility based on existing credit commitments of $113 million; and

     - based on the 30-day trailing average closing price of MeriStar common
       stock on April 30, 2002, an equity market capitalization of approximately
       $96.6 million and a total capitalization, including debt, of
       approximately $236.8 million.

     The combined company will have the following major business units:

     - Hotel Management will combine the customer base and management expertise
       of the two companies and will continue to focus on managing luxury and
       upscale hotels, resorts and conference centers, as well as mid-scale and
       select service hotels under a wide variety of franchise flags.

     - Corporate Housing will operate under the BridgeStreet Corporate Housing
       Worldwide brand, with approximately 3,300 units in the United States,
       Canada and Europe. Currently the world's third largest provider of

       international corporations, including many "Fortune 500" companies.

     The combined company's business strategy will include:

     - utilizing its cash position and available new credit facilities in order
       to grow the company through the securing of additional management
       contracts and acquisition of additional hotel, resort and conference
       center properties;

     - capitalizing on the combined hotel, resort and conference center
       management expertise of the two companies to identify underperforming
       hotel, resort and conference center properties for acquisition and to
       renovate and reposition those underperforming properties through the use
       of each company's most successful business practices;

     - managing upscale resorts and conference centers under the Doral name;

     - taking advantage of the larger market capitalization of the combined
       company to access additional sources of financing;

     - reducing costs through economies of scale;

     - expanding its hotel management operations by securing additional
       management contracts, focusing on properties with favorable economic,
       demographic and supply dynamics;

     - providing hospitality property owners with a wide array of improved
       services and benefits, including:

      - Internet-based business information systems providing real-time data for
        better yield management and cost control,

      - broader electronic and direct sales resources, including more than 2,000
        sales professionals,

      - increased cost efficiency through national purchasing, and

      - capital for co-investments and joint ventures; and

     - expanding BridgeStreet's corporate housing operations by increasing its
       local market share, attracting national accounts with its growing
       national and international network, and expanding into new domestic and
       international markets.

     The combined company will have a dynamic, experienced and fully-integrated
management team drawn from the current management teams of Interstate and
MeriStar, bringing together experienced professionals with in-house expertise in
the hospitality industry. Mr. Paul W. Whetsell, the current Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of MeriStar, will be the combined company's Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer. Mr. Thomas F. Hewitt, the current Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of Interstate, will be a director. The combined company's
directors will be highly-qualified individuals with extensive collective
experience in the real estate, lodging, leisure, investment, financial services
and accounting areas.

     The combined company will be headquartered in Washington, D.C. at the
current headquarters of MeriStar.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF INTERSTATE (SEE PAGE 52)

     The board of directors of Interstate has unanimously determined, based in
part on the recommendation of a special committee of the board of directors and
the opinion of its financial advisor, that the merger, including the proposals
described in this joint proxy statement and prospectus, is advisable and in the
best interests of Interstate and its common stockholders and recommends that
Interstate stockholders vote FOR approval of the merger and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.

FACTORS CONSIDERED BY THE INTERSTATE BOARD OF DIRECTORS (SEE PAGE 52)

     The Interstate board of directors considered a number of factors in
approving the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement and recommending approval to Interstate stockholders, including those
listed below:

     - The size of the combined company and the resulting opportunities for
       growth and for increased recognition and credibility in the industry.

     - The economies of scale and operating efficiencies of the combined company
       and its operational and financial resources.

     - The reasonableness of the anticipated synergies in the merger, and the
       fact that they do not reflect growth opportunities that will be available
       to the combined company.

     - The lowered risk of losing management contracts faced by the larger
       combined company.

     - The combination of two skilled management teams in the merger.

     - The benefits the combined company will receive from MeriStar's
       relationship with MeriStar Hospitality and the long-term management

     - The unique opportunity offered by the merger to combine with a quality
       company that has a business and goals that are similar to Interstate's.

     - The larger market capitalization of the combined company, and the
       increased interest in the combined company and increased coverage by the
       investor community that will likely result.

     - The fact that Interstate's stockholders will hold a majority of the
       outstanding combined company stock, and that the board of the combined
       company will, for a significant period of time, have seven
       representatives of Interstate and six representatives of MeriStar.

     - The qualification of the merger as a reorganization for federal tax
       purposes.

     - The fact that some officers and directors of Interstate may have
       interests in the merger that are in addition to and different from the
       interests of Interstate stockholders generally.

     - The fact that the merger provides for a fixed exchange ratio and, as a
       result, the value of the combined company common stock to be received by
       Interstate stockholders at the effective time of the merger may be higher
       or lower than the value of the stock at the time the merger agreement was
       signed.

LYNCH'S OPINION IS ADDRESSED TO THE INTERSTATE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND DOES NOT

RELATING TO THE PROPOSED MERGER.

                        THE MERGER AND MERGER AGREEMENT

THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 73)

     In the proposed merger, Interstate will be merged with and into MeriStar,
and all of the Interstate stockholders will be entitled to receive the combined
company's common stock. The combined company will operate under the name
"Interstate Hotels & Resorts, Inc." The merger agreement, as amended, is
attached as Appendix A. You should carefully read the merger agreement in its
entirety, as it is the legal document that governs the merger.

RESULTS OF THE MERGER AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS (SEE PAGE 73)

     At the effective time of the merger, each share of Interstate common stock
that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger will be converted into 4.6 shares of the combined company's common stock
and the associated rights to purchase shares of the combined company's Series A
junior participating preferred stock under the combined company's stockholder
rights plan. No fractional shares will be issued. Interstate common stockholders
will receive cash instead of fractional shares.

     The holders of MeriStar securities will continue to hold their MeriStar
securities.

CONVERSION OF INTERSTATE CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES (SEE PAGE 73)

     Prior to the record date for the Interstate stockholders meeting, the
Interstate principal investor group held 500,000 shares of Interstate Series B
preferred stock and $25,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Interstate's
8.75% convertible notes, and three Interstate executive officers held an
aggregate of 225,000 shares of Interstate Series B preferred stock. On the
record date, a share of Series B preferred stock was

convertible into 2.5 shares of Class A common stock, and the 8.75% convertible
notes were convertible into shares of Class A common stock at a rate of $4.00
per share.

     Under a voting and conversion agreement, the holders of Interstate's
outstanding convertible securities converted all but 10 shares of the Series B
preferred stock and approximately $18.6 million in aggregate principal amount of
the 8.75% convertible notes into 6,463,497 shares of Class A common stock, which
represents approximately 53.0% of Interstate's outstanding common stock as of
the Interstate record date. Under the voting and conversion agreement, those
holders also agreed with MeriStar to vote those shares of Class A common stock,
along with an additional 390,876 shares of Class A common stock already held by
those holders, in favor of the merger and related proposals at Interstate's
special stockholder meeting. The total number of shares of Interstate Class A
common stock subject to the Interstate voting and conversion agreement
represented, in the aggregate, 56.2% of the outstanding common stock of
Interstate as of the Interstate record date.

     Because of restrictions contained in the Interstate convertible securities,
some of the holders of the convertible securities were not permitted to convert
all of their convertible securities at Interstate's record date. Each share of
Series B preferred stock that remains outstanding at the effective time will be
converted into the right to receive 11.5 shares of combined company common
stock, and the remaining 8.75% convertible notes will be converted immediately
after the merger into shares of the combined company's common stock as if they
had been converted into Interstate Class A common stock immediately before the
effective time of the merger.

     A copy of the Interstate voting and conversion agreement, as amended, is
attached as Appendix B to this joint proxy statement and prospectus. You should
carefully read the Interstate voting and conversion agreement in its entirety.

     In connection with the Interstate principal investor group's conversion of
their convertible securities and their agreement to vote their shares in favor
of the merger, Interstate agreed, under the conversion incentive agreement, to
pay the Interstate principal investor group $9.25 million upon that conversion.
Interstate made that payment on           , 2002. A copy of the Interstate
conversion incentive agreement, as amended, is attached to this joint proxy
statement and prospectus as Appendix D. You should carefully read the Interstate
conversion incentive agreement in its entirety.

VOTING AGREEMENTS (SEE PAGE 83)

     The principal stockholders of MeriStar, who collectively held, as of the
record date, approximately 21% of MeriStar's outstanding voting power, have
agreed with Interstate to vote their shares of common stock in favor of each of
the proposals described in this joint proxy statement and prospectus relating to
the merger, the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement. A copy of the MeriStar voting agreement, which contains provisions
regarding the voting of those shares, is attached as Appendix C to this joint
proxy statement and prospectus. You should carefully read the MeriStar voting
agreement in its entirety.

     As described above under "Conversion of Interstate convertible securities,"
the principal stockholders of Interstate, including its investor group, who
collectively held, as of the record date, approximately 56.2% of Interstate's
outstanding voting power, have agreed with MeriStar to vote their shares of
common stock in favor of each of the proposals described in this joint proxy
statement and prospectus relating to the merger. A copy of the Interstate voting
and conversion agreement, as amended, which contains provisions relating to the
voting of these shares, is attached as Appendix B to this joint proxy statement
and prospectus. You should carefully read the Interstate voting and conversion
agreement in its entirety.

REFINANCING OF THE MERISTAR AND INTERSTATE CREDIT FACILITIES (SEE PAGE 85)

     A senior secured credit facility of up to $125 million will replace the
existing senior credit facilities of both MeriStar and Interstate. The facility,
for which credit commitments of $113 million have been obtained, will have a
three-year term loan with a principal balance of not less than $65 million nor
more than $72 million and a three-year revolver for the remainder of the
facility. The revolving portion of the facility will include a one-year
extension option. The interest rate on the facility will range from the London
Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 3.00% to LIBOR plus 4.50%, based on the
combined company's ability to meet specified financial covenant levels. On a pro
forma basis, after giving effect to the merger, the refinancing and all related
transactions, the combined company would have had approximately $81.0 million
drawn under the new credit facility as of March 31, 2002.

     MeriStar has a revolving credit facility with MeriStar Hospitality under
which MeriStar Hospitality may lend MeriStar up to $50 million for general
corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2002, MeriStar had $45.0 million of
borrowings outstanding under the MeriStar Hospitality credit facility at an
interest rate of 8.4%. The outstanding loan under the MeriStar Hospitality
credit facility matures on the 91st day after the maturity date of the
outstanding loan under MeriStar's senior secured credit facility.

     MeriStar also has an outstanding $13.1 million term note payable to
MeriStar Hospitality. The term note bears interest at the 30-day LIBOR plus
6.50% and matures on the same date as the MeriStar Hospitality credit facility.

     In connection with the proposed merger, MeriStar Hospitality has agreed, in
a letter agreement, to amend the MeriStar Hospitality revolving credit facility
to provide the following, effective as of the effective time of the merger:

     - the balance of the term note will be added to the MeriStar Hospitality
       credit facility, and the term note will be retired;

     - the MeriStar Hospitality credit facility will become a term facility, and
       the maturity date of the facility will be set at the fifth anniversary of
       the effective time of the merger; and

     - MeriStar will repay $3.0 million of the outstanding loans under the
       MeriStar Hospitality credit facility.

     The completion of these amendments to the MeriStar Hospitality credit
facility and term note by MeriStar Hospitality require the fulfillment of a
number of conditions, including the completion of the merger and the refinancing
of MeriStar's senior secured credit facility as described above.

     In addition, in the letter agreement, MeriStar Hospitality:

     - waived its right to terminate the intercompany agreement between itself
       and MeriStar which is triggered by the merger; and

     - agreed to cause its subsidiaries that are parties to hotel management
       agreements with MeriStar to waive any rights to terminate those
       agreements as a result of the merger.

     Prior to entering into the merger agreement, an affiliate of Wyndham
International, Inc., the holder of a 1.6627% non-controlling economic interest
in Interstate Hotels, LLC, Interstate's principal operating subsidiary, agreed
to permit Interstate to cause Interstate Hotels, LLC, or its subsidiaries, to
provide a guaranty and pledge of assets of Interstate Hotels, LLC, or its
subsidiaries, under the terms of the proposed senior secured credit facility for
the combined company following the merger. In consideration for this agreement,
Interstate repaid a promissory note to Wyndham on May 2, 2002 in the outstanding
principal amount of $0.75 million and agreed to pay to Wyndham the outstanding
principal amount of approximately $3.7 million under a second promissory note
prior to Interstate Hotels, LLC, or its subsidiaries, providing any guaranty and
pledge of any of its or their assets. In addition, Interstate accelerated the
timing of Wyndham's right to require Interstate to redeem Wyndham's interest in
Interstate Hotels, LLC to be the earlier of the date on which Interstate repays
the second promissory note and July 1, 2004.

TREATMENT OF STOCK OPTIONS AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS (SEE PAGE 73)

     The merger agreement provides that MeriStar and Interstate will take all
actions necessary to cause each outstanding option to purchase a share of
Interstate Class A common stock to be converted into an option to purchase 4.6
shares of the combined company's common stock and the exercise price per share
of the combined company's common stock to be the exercise price per share of
Interstate Class A common stock divided by 4.6. These new options will continue
to be governed by the existing Interstate Equity Incentive Plan, which will be
assumed by the combined company, but no additional awards will be made under
that plan. To the extent not previously vested, these options will vest upon
completion of the merger. Each option held under the existing stock option plans
of MeriStar will remain outstanding but will have vested at the effective time
of the merger, which is a change of control under those plans.

     MeriStar stockholders will be voting to adopt an amended and restated
incentive plan under which stock option awards will continue to be granted to
employees and non-employee directors of the combined company. This amended and
restated incentive plan incorporates various clarifying and technical amendments
to the existing MeriStar incentive plan. As this plan will be the combined
company's incentive plan following the merger, stockholders of both MeriStar and
Interstate are encouraged to read the summaries of this plan in this joint proxy
statement and prospectus as well as the form of the proposed plan attached to
this joint proxy statement and prospectus as Appendix G. MeriStar stockholders
will also be voting to amend the MeriStar employee stock purchase plan, which
will be the employee stock purchase plan of the combined company if the merger
occurs.

BOARD COMPOSITION (SEE PAGE 84)

     As provided in the proposed charter amendments and in a letter from
MeriStar and Interstate to the Interstate principal investor group, the
composition of the board of directors of the combined company will remain
unchanged for the 18 months after the completion of the merger, unless, at the
time of any election of directors during that 18-month period, the Interstate
principal investor group and its affiliates and associates beneficially own less
than 75% of the combined company common stock that they beneficially owned at
the effective time of the merger. As a condition precedent to the obligations of
MeriStar and Interstate to complete the merger, MeriStar and the parties that
will be the principal stockholders of the combined company will enter into an
agreement that will provide for procedures for the replacement of directors who
resign or are no longer able to serve as directors. Initially, the board of
directors of the combined company will have seven individuals designated by
Interstate, of which five are affiliated with Interstate's principal investor
group, and six individuals designated by MeriStar.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS (SEE PAGES 42 AND 45)

     Under Delaware law, MeriStar stockholders do not have appraisal rights with
respect to the merger.

     In accordance with Section 3-202(c) of the Maryland General Corporation
Law, no appraisal rights are available to holders of shares of Interstate Class
A common stock. In accordance with Section 3-202 of the Maryland General
Corporation Law, appraisal rights are available to the holders of shares of
Interstate Class B common stock and Series B preferred stock.

       is the cause of the delay; or

     - any order, injunction or decree preventing the merger has been entered by
       any court or governmental entity and is final and nonappealable.

     Either MeriStar or Interstate may terminate the merger agreement if:

     - the other party's board of directors withdraws, modifies or changes its
       approval or recommendation of the merger agreement in a manner adverse to
       the terminating party or the merger;

     - the other party's board of directors recommends to its stockholders
       another acquisition proposal;

     - a tender offer or exchange offer for any outstanding shares of capital
       stock of the other party is commenced, and the other party's board of
       directors fails to recommend against it;

     - there is an uncured breach of a material representation, warranty or
       covenant in the merger agreement by the other party;

     - its board of directors recommends a superior proposal in accordance with
       the non-solicitation provisions in the merger agreement; or

     - there is a material adverse effect on the other party.

TERMINATION PAYMENTS (SEE PAGE 81)

     MeriStar will be required to pay Interstate a termination payment of $2.0
million, plus up to $0.5 million of out-of-pocket expenses, if the MeriStar
stockholders do not approve the proposals described in this joint proxy
statement and prospectus or the merger agreement is otherwise terminated under
the circumstances described on page 79.

     Interstate will be required to pay MeriStar a termination payment of $2.0
million, plus up to $0.5 million of out-of-pocket expenses, if the Interstate
stockholders do not approve the proposals described in this joint proxy
statement and prospectus or the merger agreement is otherwise terminated under
the circumstances described on page 79.

NON-SOLICITATION PROVISIONS (SEE PAGE 78)

     Each of MeriStar and Interstate is subject to substantially identical
non-solicitation provisions in the merger agreement.

     Each party and its subsidiaries are prohibited from soliciting, entering
into or providing nonpublic information with respect to, any competing
acquisition proposal, except that each party may do so with any third party if a
disinterested majority of its board of directors determines in good faith after
consultation with and receipt of advice from outside counsel:

     - that doing so is required by the duties of the board of directors under
       applicable law; and

     - that the third party making the acquisition proposal has the ability and
       financial resources to make a superior proposal.

     Each party must advise the other orally and in writing of any acquisition
proposal or any inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
acquisition proposal. Each party must give the other three days' advance notice
of providing any information to the third party making the proposal.

INTERIM OPERATIONS COVENANTS (SEE PAGE 75)

     MeriStar and Interstate have agreed to limitations on their operations
between the signing of the merger agreement and the effective time of the
merger.

INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 120)

     The merger is intended to be free of United States federal income tax to
holders of Interstate common stock who receive combined company common stock in
exchange for Interstate common stock in connection with the merger, except with
respect to cash received instead of fractional shares of common stock or the
exercise of appraisal rights, if available.

STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING (SEE PAGE 71)

     The shares of common stock of the combined company issuable in connection
with the merger are expected to be listed on the NYSE, subject to official
notice of issuance, and will trade, together with the existing shares of
MeriStar common stock, under the ticker symbol "      ". Neither Interstate nor
MeriStar is required to close the merger if the common stock issuable in
connection with the merger is not approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to
official notice of issuance.

     Under the terms of the merger agreement, the combined company will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Interstate Class A common stock to be
delisted from the Nasdaq SmallCap Market and deregistered under the Securities
Exchange Act after the completion of the merger.

ANTICIPATED ACCOUNTING TREATMENT (SEE PAGE 72)

     The merger will be accounted for as a purchase of MeriStar by Interstate
using the purchase method of accounting. The merger will be accounted for as a
reverse acquisition with Interstate as the accounting acquiror and MeriStar as
the surviving company.

COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDERS' RIGHTS (SEE PAGE 218)

     The charter and bylaws of Interstate and the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of the combined company differ. Furthermore, Interstate is a Maryland
corporation, while the combined company will be incorporated in Delaware. As a
result, Interstate stockholders will have different rights as stockholders of
the combined company from those they hold now. MeriStar stockholders will have
substantially the same rights as they currently have, as modified by the
proposed amendments to the MeriStar certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

                                 OTHER MATTERS

REVERSE STOCK SPLIT (SEE PAGE 107)

     MeriStar stockholders will also vote on a proposal to effect a reverse
stock split in order to allow the combined company to comply with the continued
listing standards of the NYSE. The reverse stock split will occur at a ratio of
five shares of existing stock to one share after the reverse stock split, with
the board of directors of MeriStar having discretion to determine whether the
reverse stock split will actually be effected and the timing of the reverse
stock split, so long as any reverse stock split shall occur not later than 12
months after the MeriStar annual meeting. If the reverse stock split occurs
prior to the completion of the merger, the exchange ratio will be 0.92 shares of
combined company common stock for each share of Interstate common stock,
assuming no other adjustments are made. Approval of the reverse stock split
requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of MeriStar common stock. If the merger is completed, the board of directors of
the combined company will have the discretion given to the MeriStar board of
directors to effect the reverse stock split following the completion of the
merger.

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF MERISTAR HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE PROPOSAL TO
AMEND THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF MERISTAR TO PERMIT THE REVERSE STOCK
SPLIT AND UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE HOLDERS OF MERISTAR COMMON STOCK VOTE
FOR THIS PROPOSAL.

AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF THE MERISTAR EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE PLAN (SEE PAGE 91)

     MeriStar stockholders will vote on a proposal to approve various clarifying
and technical amendments to the existing MeriStar employee incentive plan. If
the merger is completed, the combined company will continue issuing stock-based
compensation to its employees under the amended and restated MeriStar employee
incentive plan. If the merger is not completed, MeriStar will still amend and
restate its existing employee incentive plan.

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF MERISTAR HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE AMENDED AND
RESTATED INCENTIVE PLAN AND UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE HOLDERS OF MERISTAR
COMMON STOCK VOTE FOR THE PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE AMENDED AND RESTATED INCENTIVE
PLAN.

AMENDMENTS TO THE MERISTAR EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (SEE PAGE 100)

     Currently, an aggregate of 1,500,000 shares of MeriStar common stock are
purchasable under the MeriStar employee stock purchase plan. MeriStar
stockholders will also vote on a proposal to amend the employee stock purchase
plan to fix the number of shares of common stock that may be purchased under the
plan at 1,500,000, which number will not be adjusted for the proposed reverse
stock split, if implemented. If the merger occurs and the amendment is approved,
this amended plan will be the employee stock purchase plan of the combined
company.

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF MERISTAR HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE PROPOSAL TO
AMEND THE MERISTAR EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN AND UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT
THE HOLDERS OF MERISTAR COMMON STOCK VOTE FOR THIS PROPOSAL.

AMENDMENTS TO THE MERISTAR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS' INCENTIVE PLAN (SEE PAGE 104)

     Currently, an aggregate of 500,000 shares of MeriStar common stock are
issuable under the MeriStar non-employee directors' incentive plan. MeriStar
stockholders will also vote on a proposal to amend the non-employee directors'
incentive plan to fix the number of shares that may be issued under the plan at
500,000, which number will not be adjusted for the proposed reverse stock split,
if implemented. All awards under the plan will be adjusted if the reverse stock
split occurs. If the merger occurs and the amendment is approved, this amended
plan will be the non-employee directors' incentive plan of the combined company.

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF MERISTAR HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE PROPOSAL TO
AMEND THE MERISTAR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS' INCENTIVE PLAN AND UNANIMOUSLY
RECOMMENDS THAT THE HOLDERS OF MERISTAR COMMON STOCK VOTE FOR THIS PROPOSAL.

                   SUMMARY PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL DATA

     The following summary unaudited pro forma combined financial information of
MeriStar and Interstate has been derived from, and should be read together with,
the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements and related notes included
elsewhere in this joint proxy statement and prospectus.

     The following summary unaudited pro forma combined financial information
gives effect to the merger and the related transactions, including the
conversion of Interstate's convertible securities, Interstate making a $9.25
million conversion incentive payment to some holders of its convertible
securities, the completion by MeriStar of an amendment to and partial repayment
of a credit facility extended by MeriStar Hospitality Corporation and the
refinancing of the companies' credit facilities as if they had occurred on the
dates indicated, and to pro forma adjustments. The unaudited pro forma combined
operating data for the year ended December 31, 2001 and for the three months
ended March 31, 2002 are presented as if the merger and the related transactions
had been completed on January 1, 2001 using Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 141, "Business Combinations", and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets", which were issued in July 2001. SFAS No. 141
requires the application of the purchase method of accounting for all business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, and SFAS No. 142 requires that
goodwill, as well as any intangible assets believed to have an indefinite useful
life, not be amortized for financial reporting purposes. The unaudited pro forma
combined balance sheet data at March 31, 2002 is presented as if the merger and
the related transactions had occurred on March 31, 2002. In the opinion of the
management of MeriStar and Interstate, all adjustments necessary to reflect the
effects of the merger and the related transactions have been made.

     The unaudited pro forma combined financial information is provided for
illustrative purposes only and does not reflect what the results of operations
and financial position of the combined company would have been if the merger and
the related transactions had actually occurred on the dates assumed. This
information also does not purport to indicate the combined company's future
operating results or consolidated financial position.

- ---------------

(A) EBITDA represents earnings before interest expense, income taxes,
    depreciation, amortization, equity in losses of affiliates, and minority
    interests. Management believes that EBITDA is a useful measure of operating
    performance because it is industry practice to evaluate hotel properties
    based on operating income before interest, depreciation, amortization,
    equity in losses of affiliates, and minority interests which is generally
    equivalent to EBITDA, and EBITDA is unaffected by the debt and equity
    structure of the entity. EBITDA does not represent cash flow from operations
    as defined by generally accepted accounting principles, is not generally
    indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs, should not be
    considered as an alternative to net income under GAAP for purposes of
    evaluating the combined company's results of operations and may not be
    comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.

(B) Represents the adoption of the provisions of EITF 01-14 "Income Statement
    Characterization of Reimbursements Received for Out-of-Pocket Expenses
    Incurred." In accordance with EITF 01-14, the operating revenues and
    expenses include the reimbursement of costs incurred on behalf of the
    third-party owners of the combined company's managed hotels. These costs
    relate primarily to payroll and benefit costs. These reimbursements are
    received based upon the costs incurred by the combined company with no added
    margin. The EITF was adopted retroactively for all periods on January 1,
    2002. It is currently not practicable for the combined company to obtain the
    information with respect to periods prior to January 1, 2001.

(A) Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 1998 is
    based on earnings for the period from August 3, 1998, the date of the
    spin-off of MeriStar from CapStar Hotel Company, through December 31, 1998.

(B) As of the last day for the periods presented.

(C) EBITDA represents earnings (loss) before interest expense, income taxes,
    depreciation and amortization and minority interests. MeriStar's management
    believes that EBITDA is a useful measure of operating performance because it
    is industry practice to evaluate hotel properties based on operating income
    before interest, depreciation and amortization and minority interests which
    is generally equivalent to EBITDA, and EBITDA is unaffected by the debt and
    equity structure of the entity. EBITDA does not represent cash flow from
    operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles, is not
    necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs, should
    not be considered as an alternative to net income under GAAP for purposes of
    evaluating MeriStar's results of operations and may not be comparable to
    other similarly titled measures used by other companies.

(D) Represents the adoption of the provisions of EITF 01-14 "Income Statement
    Characterization of Reimbursements Received for Out-of-Pocket Expenses
    Incurred." In accordance with EITF 01-14, the operating revenues and
    expenses include the reimbursement of costs incurred on behalf of the
    third-party owners of MeriStar's managed hotels. These costs relate
    primarily to payroll and benefit costs. These reimbursements are received
    based upon the costs incurred by MeriStar with no added margin. The EITF was
    adopted retroactively for all periods on January 1, 2002. It is currently
    not practicable for MeriStar to obtain the information with respect to
    periods prior to January 1, 2001.

(1) Represents the sum of the balances for Interstate, prior to the merger of
    Interstate's predecessor into Wyndham International, Inc., as the
    predecessor, for the period from January 1, 1998 to June 1, 1998, and for
    Interstate, subsequent to the merger of Interstate's predecessor into
    Wyndham, as the successor, for the period from June 2, 1998 to December 31,
    1998.

(2) Represents the adoption of the provisions of EITF 01-14 "Income Statement
    Characterization of Reimbursements Received for Out-of-Pocket Expenses
    Incurred." In accordance with EITF 01-14, the operating revenues and
    expenses include the reimbursement of costs incurred on behalf of the
    third-party owners of Interstate's managed hotels. These costs relate
    primarily to payroll and benefit costs. These reimbursements are received
    based upon the costs incurred by Interstate with no added margin. The EITF
    was adopted retroactively for all periods on January 1, 2002. It is
    currently not practicable for Interstate or its predecessor to obtain the
    information with respect to periods prior to January 1, 2001.

(3) EBITDA represents earnings (losses) before interest, income tax expense
    (benefit), depreciation and amortization (which includes depreciation and
    amortization included in earnings (losses) from equity investments in hotel
    real estate), mandatorily redeemable preferred stock dividends and
    accretion, the loss on impairment of investment in hotel lease contracts and
    the loss on

    impairment of equity investment in hotel real estate. Historical 1999 EBITDA
    was calculated based on Interstate's 45% share of EBITDA from Interstate
    Hotels, LLC for the period from June 18, 1999 to December 31, 1999.
    Historical 2000 EBITDA was calculated based on the Interstate's 45% share of
    EBITDA from Interstate Hotels, LLC for the period from January 1, 2000 to
    October 31, 2000. Interstate's management believes that EBITDA is a useful
    measure of operating performance because it is industry practice to evaluate
    hotel properties based on operating income before interest, taxes,
    depreciation and amortization, which is generally equivalent to EBITDA, and
    EBITDA is unaffected by the debt and equity structure of the property owner.
    EBITDA, as calculated by Interstate, may not be consistent with computations
    of EBITDA by other companies. EBITDA does not represent cash flow from
    operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles, is not
    necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and
    should not be considered as an alternative to net income under generally
    accepted accounting principles for purposes of evaluating Interstate's
    results of operations.

(4) As of the end of the periods presented.

(5) Represents all hotels, including the previously leased hotels, for which
    Interstate provides management or related services.

                  UNAUDITED COMPARATIVE PER SHARE INFORMATION

     The following table presents per common share data regarding the income,
cash dividends declared and book value of MeriStar and Interstate on both a

                                  RISK FACTORS

     Stockholders of Interstate and MeriStar voting in favor of the merger and
the proposals related to the merger will effectively be choosing to combine the
businesses of the two companies and to invest in combined company common stock.
This combination and this investment involve some risks. You should carefully
consider the information below as well as all other information provided to you
in this joint proxy statement and prospectus in deciding whether to adopt the
merger agreement and approve the related proposals, including information in the
section of this joint proxy statement and prospectus entitled "Special Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."

            RISK FACTORS RELATED TO THE COMBINED COMPANY'S BUSINESS

MERISTAR AND INTERSTATE ENCOUNTER INDUSTRY RISKS RELATED TO OPERATING AND
MANAGING HOTELS THAT COULD CAUSE THEIR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TO SUFFER. THE
COMBINED COMPANY WILL ENCOUNTER THE SAME OR SIMILAR RISKS.

     Various factors could adversely affect the combined company's ability to
generate revenues on which its management fees will be based. The combined
company's business will be subject to all of the operating risks inherent in the
lodging industry. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:

     - changes in general and local economic conditions;

     - cyclical overbuilding in the lodging industry;

     - varying levels of demand for rooms and related services;

     - competition from other hotels, motels and recreational properties, some
       of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than the
       combined company or the owners of the properties the combined company
       will manage;

     - dependence on business and commercial travelers and tourism, which may
       fluctuate and be seasonal;

     - decreases in air travel;

     - fluctuations in operating costs;

     - the recurring costs of necessary renovations, refurbishment and
       improvements of hotel properties;

     - changes in governmental regulations that influence or determine wages,
       prices and construction and maintenance costs; and

     - changes in interest rates and the availability of credit.

     Demographic, geographic or other changes in one or more markets could
impact the convenience or desirability of the sites of some hotels or corporate
housing apartments, which would in turn affect the operations of those hotels or
the corporate housing division. In addition, due to the level of fixed costs
required to operate mid-scale and select-service hotels, resorts and conference
centers, significant expenditures necessary for the operation of these
properties generally cannot be reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in
revenue.

MERISTAR AND INTERSTATE ENCOUNTER INDUSTRY RELATED RISKS RELATED TO THEIR
INVESTMENTS IN AND OWNERSHIP OF HOTELS AND OTHER REAL ESTATE. THE COMBINED
COMPANY WILL ENCOUNTER THE SAME OR SIMILAR RISKS.

     The combined company, as an owner of hotels and investments in real estate,
will be subject to the operating risks described in the immediately preceding
risk factor. In addition, the combined company will be exposed to risks and
uncertainties associated with the ownership of hotels and real estate, including
risks arising from:

     - changes in national, regional and local economic conditions;

     - changes in local real estate market conditions;

     - changes in the markets for particular types of assets;

     - changes in interest rates and in the availability, cost and terms of
       financing;

     - uninsured casualty and other losses;

     - labor disturbances or shortages of labor;

     - present or future environmental legislation;

     - adverse changes in zoning laws;

     - adverse changes in real estate tax assessments;

     - construction or renovation delays and cost overruns; and

     - limitations on the combined company's ability to quickly dispose of
       investments and respond to changes in the economic or competitive
       environment due to the relative illiquidity of real estate assets.

     Many of these factors will be beyond the combined company's control. As the
combined company expands through acquisition or development of real estate, the
magnitude of these risks may increase. Any of these factors could have a
material and adverse impact on the value of the combined company's assets or on
the revenues that can be generated from those assets.

THE RECENT ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN HAS ADVERSELY AFFECTED THE PERFORMANCE OF HOTELS
AND, IF IT WORSENS OR CONTINUES, THESE EFFECTS COULD BE MATERIAL.

     The economic slowdown and the resulting declines in revenue per available
room at the hotels managed by MeriStar and Interstate began in the first quarter
of 2001. These trends are currently continuing. The decline in occupancy during
the second, third and fourth quarters of 2001 and the first quarter of 2002 has
led to declines in room rates as hotels compete more aggressively for guests. If
the current economic slowdown worsens significantly or continues for a
protracted period of time, the declines in occupancy could also lead to further
declines in average daily room rates and could have a material adverse effect on
EBITDA and operating results.

IF THE COMBINED COMPANY IS UNABLE TO IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATE REAL ESTATE
ACQUISITION OR DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND TO ARRANGE THE FINANCING NECESSARY
TO COMPLETE THESE ACQUISITIONS OR DEVELOPMENTS, ITS CONTINUED GROWTH COULD BE
IMPAIRED.

     The combined company will continually evaluate potential real estate
development and acquisition opportunities. Any future acquisitions or
developments will be financed through a combination of internally generated
funds, additional bank borrowings from existing and new credit facilities and
public offerings or private placements of equity or debt securities. The nature
of any future financing will depend on factors such as the size of the
particular acquisition or development and the combined company's capital
structure at the time of a project. The combined company may not be able to
identify appropriate new acquisition or development opportunities and necessary
financing may not be available on suitable terms, if at all.

     Acquisition growth opportunities have decreased. There has been substantial
consolidation in, and capital allocated to, the U.S. lodging industry since the
early 1990s. This generally has resulted in higher prices for hotels. These
conditions have resulted in fewer attractive acquisition opportunities. An
important part of the combined company's growth strategy will be the acquisition
and, in many instances, the renovation and repositioning of hotels at less than
replacement cost. Continued industry consolidation and competition for
acquisitions could adversely affect the growth prospects of the combined company
going forward. The combined company will compete for hotel and other investment
opportunities with other companies, some of which will have greater financial or
other resources than the combined company will have. Competitors may have a
lower cost of capital and may be able to pay higher prices or assume greater
risks than would be prudent for the combined company to pay or assume. If the
combined

company is unable to continue real estate development and acquisition, its
continued growth could be impaired.

     The terms of the combined company's intercompany agreement with MeriStar
Hospitality will also restrict its ability to make some types of investments in
real estate. For more information regarding these restrictions, please refer to
the risk factor under the caption, "The combined company's relationship with
MeriStar Hospitality Corporation may lead to general conflicts of interest that
adversely affect stockholders' interests.--The combined company will have
restrictions on its business and on its future opportunities that could affect
its operations."

ACTS OF TERRORISM, THE THREAT OF TERRORISM AND THE ONGOING WAR AGAINST TERRORISM
HAVE IMPACTED AND WILL CONTINUE TO IMPACT THE INDUSTRY AND ALL HOTEL COMPANIES'
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

     The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 had a negative impact on hotel
operations for the remainder of 2001 and into 2002, causing lower than expected
performance in an already slowing economy. The events of September 11th have
caused a significant decrease in hotels' occupancy and average daily rate due to
disruptions in business and leisure travel patterns, and concerns about travel
safety. Major metropolitan area and airport hotels have been adversely affected
due to concerns about air travel safety and a significant overall decrease in
the amount of air travel, particularly transient business travel.

     The September 11th terrorist attacks were unprecedented in scope, and in
their immediate, dramatic impact on travel patterns. MeriStar and Interstate
have not previously experienced events like the attacks, and it is currently not
possible to accurately predict if and when travel patterns will be restored to
pre-September 11th levels. While there have been improvements in operating
levels from the period immediately following the attacks, the uncertainty
associated with subsequent incidents, threats and the possibility of future
attacks may continue to hamper business and leisure travel patterns.

THE LODGING BUSINESS IS SEASONAL.

     Generally, hotel revenues are greater in the second and third calendar
quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters. This may not be true,
however, for hotels in major tourist destinations. Revenues for hotels in
tourist areas generally are substantially greater during tourist season than
other times of the year. Because of the September 11th events, operating results
for the third and fourth quarters of 2001 and the first quarter of 2002 were
lower than expected. Seasonal variations in revenue at the hotels leased, owned
or managed by the combined company will cause quarterly fluctuations in
revenues. Events beyond the control of the combined company, such as extreme
weather conditions, economic factors and other considerations affecting travel
may also adversely affect earnings.

THE COMBINED COMPANY MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE LIMITATIONS IN ITS
FRANCHISING AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS.

     The combined company will be the franchisee of some of the hotels it owns,
leases or manages. In addition, the combined company, with respect to hotels for
which it is not the franchisee, may sign a manager acknowledgment agreement with
the franchisor which details some of the rights and obligations of the manager
with respect to the hotel and references the hotel's franchise agreement. The
franchise agreements generally contain specific standards for, and restrictions
and limitations on, the operation and maintenance of a hotel in order to
maintain uniformity within the franchisor system. Those limitations may conflict
with the philosophy of creating specific business plans tailored to each hotel
and to each market. Standards are often subject to change over time, in some
cases at the discretion of the franchisor, and may restrict a franchisee's
ability to make improvements or modifications to a hotel without the consent of
the franchisor. In addition, compliance with standards could require a hotel
owner to incur significant expenses or capital expenditures. Action or inaction
on the part of the combined company or by the owner of one of their hotels could
result in a breach of standards or other terms and conditions of the franchise
agreements, and could result in the loss or cancellation of a franchise license.
Loss of franchise licenses without replacement would likely have an adverse
effect on revenues. In connection with terminating or changing the franchise
affiliation of a hotel, the owner of the hotel may be required to incur
significant

expenses or capital expenditures. Moreover, the loss of a franchise license
could have a material adverse effect upon the operation or the underlying value
of the hotel covered by the franchise due to the loss of associated name
recognition, marketing support and centralized reservation systems provided by
the franchisor. Franchise agreements covering the hotels managed or leased by
the combined company expire or terminate, without specified renewal rights, at
various times and have differing remaining terms. As a condition to renewal,
these franchise agreements frequently contemplate a renewal application process.
This process may require an owner to make substantial capital improvements to a
hotel. Although the management agreements generally require owners to make
capital improvements to maintain the quality of a property, the combined company
will not be able to directly control the timing or amount of those expenditures.

     Some of the franchise agreements under which the combined company will
operate and manage hotels restrict the franchisee's ability to own or operate
another hotel within a specified territory or with regard to specific hotels.
These limitations, if found to apply to the combined company, may limit the
combined company's ability to acquire new management agreements and potentially
impair its continued growth.

THE LODGING INDUSTRY AND CORPORATE HOUSING MARKET ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.

     There is no single competitor or small number of competitors that are
dominant either in the hotel management or corporate housing business. MeriStar
and Interstate operate, and the combined company will operate, in areas that
contain numerous competitors, some of which may have substantially greater
resources than the combined company or the owners of properties managed by the
combined company. Competition in the lodging industry and corporate housing
market is based generally on location, availability, room rates or corporate
housing rates, range and quality of services and guest amenities offered. New or
existing competitors could significantly lower rates; offer greater
conveniences, services or amenities; or significantly expand, improve or
introduce new facilities in markets in which MeriStar and Interstate compete and
the combined company will compete. All of these factors could adversely affect
operations and the number of suitable business opportunities. In addition,
MeriStar and Interstate compete and the combined company will compete for hotel
management contracts against numerous other companies, many of which may have
more financial resources. These competitors include the management divisions of
some of the major hotel brands as well as independent, non-brand affiliated
hotel managers.

COSTS OF COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OPERATING
RESULTS.

     Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and
regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be
liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances.
These laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of,
or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. In
addition, the presence of contamination from hazardous or toxic substances, or
the failure to properly remediate contaminated property, may adversely affect
the owner's ability to sell or rent the property or to borrow using the property
as collateral. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or
toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of
those substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not that
facility is or ever was owned or operated by that person. The operation and
removal of underground storage tanks are also regulated by federal and state
laws. In connection with the ownership and operation of hotels, the operators,
such as MeriStar, Interstate or the combined company, or the owners of those
properties could be held liable for the costs of remedial action for regulated
substances and storage tanks and related claims. Activities have been undertaken
to close or remove storage tanks located on the property of several of the
hotels that MeriStar owns, leases or manages.

     A significant number of the hotels that the combined company will own,
lease or manage have undergone Phase I environmental site assessments, which
generally provide a nonintrusive physical inspection and database search, but
not soil or groundwater analyses, by a qualified independent environmental
engineer. The purpose of a Phase I is to identify potential sources of
contamination for which the hotels may be responsible and to assess the status
of environmental regulatory compliance. The

Phase I assessments have not revealed any environmental liability or compliance
concerns that the company that currently operates the property believes would
have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial
condition, nor are MeriStar or Interstate aware of any material environmental
liability or concerns. Nevertheless, it is possible that these environmental
site assessments did not reveal all environmental liabilities or compliance
concerns or that material environmental liabilities or compliance concerns exist
of which MeriStar and Interstate are currently unaware.

     In addition, a significant number of the hotels MeriStar and Interstate
own, lease or manage have been inspected to determine the presence of asbestos.
Federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations also
require abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials and govern
emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. Asbestos-containing
materials are present in various building materials such as sprayed-on ceiling
treatments, roofing materials or floor tiles at some of the hotels. Operations
and maintenance programs for maintaining asbestos-containing materials have been
or are in the process of being designed and implemented, or the
asbestos-containing materials have been scheduled to be or have been abated, at
these hotels. Any liability resulting from non-compliance or other claims
relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on the
results of operations or financial condition of the combined company.

ASPECTS OF HOTEL, RESORT, CONFERENCE CENTER, CORPORATE HOUSING AND RESTAURANT
OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION, AND CHANGES IN REGULATIONS MAY
HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON BUSINESS.

     A number of states regulate various aspects of hotels, resorts, conference
centers, corporate housing and restaurants, including liquor licensing, by
requiring registration, disclosure statements and compliance with specific
standards of conduct. Each of MeriStar and Interstate believes it is
substantially in compliance with these requirements or, in the case of liquor
licenses, that it has or will promptly obtain the appropriate licenses. Managers
of hotels and providers of corporate housing are also subject to employment
laws, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions and work
permit requirements. Compliance with, or changes in, these laws could reduce the
revenue and profitability of hotels and corporate housing units and could
otherwise adversely affect results of operations or financial condition.

     Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, all public
accommodations in the U.S. are required to meet federal requirements related to
access and use by disabled persons. These requirements became effective in 1992.
Although owners of hotels MeriStar and Interstate manage have invested
significant amounts in ADA-required upgrades, a determination that the hotels
they own, lease or manage or the units leased by MeriStar's Corporate Housing
division are not in compliance with the ADA could result in a judicial order
requiring compliance, imposition of fines or an award of damages to private
litigants.

A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF THE HOTELS THAT THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL OWN, MANAGE OR
LEASE ARE IN THE LUXURY AND UPSCALE SEGMENT, AND MERISTAR'S CORPORATE HOUSING
DIVISION PRIMARILY SERVICES BUSINESS TRAVELERS, SO THE COMBINED COMPANY MAY BE
PARTICULARLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN.

     Approximately 68% of the rooms the combined company's Hotel Management
division will manage or lease are in hotels that are in the luxury and upscale,
full-service segment. This hotel segment generally permits higher room rates.
However, in an economic downturn, hotels in this segment may be more susceptible
to a decrease in revenues, as compared to hotels in other segments that have
lower room rates. This characteristic may result from hotels in this segment
generally targeting business and high-end leisure travelers. In periods of
economic difficulties, business and leisure travelers may seek to reduce travel
costs by limiting trips or seeking to reduce costs on their trips. The combined
company's BridgeStreet Corporate Housing Worldwide division is sensitive to
economic conditions for the same reasons. Adverse changes in economic conditions
could have a material adverse effect on the revenues and results of operations
of the combined company.

THIRD-PARTY HOTEL OWNERS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO USE THE ANCILLARY SERVICES THE
COMBINED COMPANY WILL PROVIDE.

     In addition to traditional hotel management services, the combined company
will offer to third-party hotel owners several ancillary services such as
purchasing, project management, insurance and risk management. The combined
company expects to derive a portion of its revenues from these services. The
combined company's management contracts will not obligate third-party hotel
owners to utilize these services, and the failure of a substantial number of
third-party hotel owners to utilize these services could adversely affect the
combined company's overall revenues.

THE COMBINED COMPANY'S RUSSIAN HOTELS, WHICH ARE CURRENTLY MANAGED BY
INTERSTATE, WILL EXPOSE THE COMBINED COMPANY TO ADDITIONAL RISKS.

     Three of the hotels the combined company will manage are located in Russia.
On a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the merger and the related
transactions, the combined company's management contracts for the three Russian
hotels accounted for approximately $3.7 million in net management fees, or
approximately 5.5% of the combined company's net management fees for the year
ended December 31, 2001. Interstate is amortizing, over a five-year period, the
costs incurred in obtaining the management contracts for the three hotels
located in Russia. Current unamortized costs amount to approximately $0.5
million. If these contracts are terminated, the unamortized costs would become
due from the owner of these hotels. In addition, under the management contracts
for the three hotels located in Russia, Interstate agreed to fund loans to the
hotel owners. Interstate has loans outstanding in the amount of $0.9 million to
these owners.

     In addition, the combined company cannot be certain of the effect that
changing political and economic conditions could have on hotel operations in
Russia and on its ability to collect on loans to third-party owners in Russia.
Furthermore, the success of the combined company's operations in Russia depends
on its ability to attract and retain qualified management personnel in Russia
who are familiar not only with the combined company's business and industry but
also with the commercial practices and economic environment in Russia.

THE COMBINED COMPANY'S RELATIONSHIP WITH MERISTAR HOSPITALITY MAY LEAD TO
GENERAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT STOCKHOLDERS' INTERESTS.

     MeriStar has historically had a close business relationship with MeriStar
Hospitality, a real estate investment trust, or REIT. The combined company and
MeriStar Hospitality will have four common board members and five common senior
executives. Currently, MeriStar's relationship with MeriStar Hospitality is
governed by an intercompany agreement and, after the merger, this agreement will
govern the combined company's relationship with MeriStar Hospitality. That
agreement restricts each party from taking advantage of some business
opportunities without first presenting those opportunities to the other party.

     In its relationship with the combined company, MeriStar Hospitality may
have conflicting views on the manner in which the combined company operates and
manage its hotels, as well as lease arrangements, acquisitions and dispositions.
As a result, the combined company's directors and senior executives, who may
serve in similar capacities at MeriStar Hospitality, may well be presented with
several decisions which provide them the opportunity to benefit MeriStar
Hospitality to the combined company's detriment or benefit the combined company
to the detriment of MeriStar Hospitality. Inherent potential conflicts of
interest will be present in all of the numerous transactions among the combined
company and MeriStar Hospitality.

     The combined company will have restrictions on its business and on its
future opportunities that could affect its operations.  So long as the
intercompany agreement with MeriStar Hospitality is in effect, the combined
company will be prohibited from making real property investments that a REIT
could make unless:

     - MeriStar Hospitality is first given the opportunity, but elects not to
       pursue the investments;

     - the investment is on land already owned or leased by the combined company
       or subject to a lease or purchase option in favor of the combined
       company;

     - the combined company will operate the property under a trade name owned
       by it; or

     - the investment is a minority investment made as part of a lease or
       management agreement arrangement by the combined company.

     The intercompany agreement will generally grant the combined company a
right of first refusal to become the manager of any real property acquired by
MeriStar Hospitality. MeriStar Hospitality will make this type of opportunity
available to the combined company only if MeriStar Hospitality determines that:

     - consistent with its status as a REIT, MeriStar Hospitality must enter
       into a management agreement with an unaffiliated third party with respect
       to the property;

     - the combined company is qualified to be the manager of that property; and

     - MeriStar Hospitality decides not to have the property operated by the
       owner of a hospitality trade name under that trade name.

     MeriStar is currently subject to substantially the same types of risks
because it is currently party to the intercompany agreement with MeriStar
Hospitality.

     Because of the provisions of the intercompany agreement, the combined
company will be restricted in the nature of its business and the opportunities
it may pursue. The terms of the intercompany agreement were not negotiated on an
arm's-length basis. Because the combined company and MeriStar Hospitality will
share some of the same executive officers and directors, there is a potential
conflict of interest with respect to the enforcement of the intercompany
agreement to the combined company's benefit and to the detriment of MeriStar
Hospitality, or to the benefit of MeriStar Hospitality and to the combined
company's detriment. Furthermore, because of the independent trading of the two
companies, stockholders in each company may develop divergent interests that
could lead to conflicts of interest. The divergence of interests could also
reduce the anticipated benefits of the combined company's close relationship
with MeriStar Hospitality.

     MeriStar is currently subject to substantially the same types of risks
because it is currently party to the intercompany agreement with MeriStar
Hospitality.

     The combined company may have conflicts relating to the sale of hotels
subject to management agreements. MeriStar Hospitality will generally be
required to pay a termination fee to the combined company if it elects to sell
or transfer a hotel to a person or entity that is not an affiliate of MeriStar
Hospitality or if it elects to permanently close a hotel after a casualty and
does not replace it with another hotel with a management fee equal to that
payable under the management agreement to be terminated. Where applicable, the
termination fee will equal the present value of the management fees payable
during the remainder of the existing term of the management agreement
(discounted using a 10% discount rate), based on fees payable during the
previous twelve months. MeriStar Hospitality's decision to sell a hotel may,
therefore, have significantly different consequences for the combined company
and MeriStar Hospitality. MeriStar Hospitality's obligation to pay a termination
fee to the combined company is reduced by an amount equal to the present value
of the management fees (as calculated above) for any management opportunities it
has executed with MeriStar since August 3, 1998.

     MeriStar is currently subject to substantially the same types of risks with
respect to the hotels it manages for MeriStar Hospitality.

     If the combined company is unable to pursue new growth opportunities
through its relationship with MeriStar Hospitality, its hotel management
business could be negatively affected. Because of the terms of the intercompany
agreement with MeriStar Hospitality if MeriStar Hospitality in the future fails
to qualify as a REIT, it could have a substantial adverse effect on those
aspects of the combined company's business operations and business opportunities
that depend on MeriStar Hospitality. For example, if MeriStar

Hospitality ceases to qualify as a REIT, the requirement in the intercompany
agreement that MeriStar Hospitality enter into management agreements with the
combined company would cease. In that case, MeriStar Hospitality would have the
right to operate newly acquired properties itself. The combined company,
however, would remain subject to all of the limitations on its operations
contained in the existing management agreements. In addition, although it is
anticipated that the management agreements involving it generally will be
assigned to any person or entity acquiring the fee or leasehold interest in a
hotel property from MeriStar Hospitality or its affiliates, it could lose its
rights under any of these management agreements upon the expiration of the
agreement. The likelihood of a sale of the hotel properties could possibly
increase if MeriStar Hospitality fails to qualify as a REIT. In addition, if
there is a change in the Internal Revenue Code that would permit MeriStar
Hospitality or one of its affiliates to operate hotels without adversely
affecting MeriStar Hospitality's status as a REIT, MeriStar Hospitality would
not be required to enter into future renewals of its management agreements.
Furthermore, a change in control of MeriStar Hospitality could have a negative
effect on the combined company, since the combined company's working
relationship with the new owner of those hotels may not be as close as its
working relationship would be with MeriStar Hospitality.

     Also, if the combined company and MeriStar Hospitality do not negotiate a
mutually satisfactory management arrangement within approximately 30 days after
MeriStar Hospitality provides the combined company with written notice of the
management opportunity, MeriStar Hospitality may offer the opportunity to others
for a period of one year before it must again offer the opportunity to the
combined company.

     MeriStar is currently subject to substantially the same types of risks with
respect to the hotels it manages for MeriStar Hospitality.

IF THE COMBINED COMPANY FAILS TO RETAIN ITS EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND KEY
PERSONNEL, ITS BUSINESS WOULD BE HARMED.

     The combined company's ability to maintain its competitive position will
depend to a significant extent on the efforts and ability of its senior
management, particularly its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Paul W.
Whetsell, its President and Chief Operating Officer, John Emery, its
Presidents -- Hotel Operations, Kevin P. Kilkeary and Robert B. Morse, its Chief
Investment Officer, Bruce G. Wiles, its President -- BridgeStreet, Thomas
Vincent, and its Chief Financial Officer, James A. Calder. The combined
company's future success and its ability to manage future growth will depend in
large part upon the efforts of Messrs. Whetsell and Emery and on the combined
company's ability to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel.
Competition for personnel is intense, and the combined company may not be
successful in attracting and retaining its personnel. The combined company's
inability to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel may adversely
affect its results of operations and financial condition. For more information
regarding the employment agreements of the combined company's senior management,
please read the section of this joint proxy statement and prospectus entitled
"Management of the Combined Company after the Merger -- Employment Agreements."

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT AFFECT THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT
OF GOODWILL AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS COULD CAUSE FUTURE LOSSES DUE TO ASSET
IMPAIRMENT.

     As of March 31, 2002, on a pro forma basis, giving effect to the merger and
the related transactions, the combined company's unamortized intangible assets
and other long-lived assets were approximately $173.5 million and $61.3 million,
respectively. Intangible assets primarily include goodwill, the fair value of
management contracts, the fair value of lease contracts, deferred financing fees
and franchise fees. Other long-lived assets primarily include property and
equipment and investments in and advances to affiliates.

     In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"
that requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill and some other
indefinite-lived intangible assets. Under SFAS 142, goodwill and some
indefinite-lived intangibles will not be amortized into results of operations,
but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually, with impairment
being measured as the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill or

intangible over its fair value. In addition, goodwill and intangible assets will
be tested more often for impairment as circumstances warrant. Intangible assets
that have finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful
lives and will be measured for impairment in accordance with SFAS 144,
"Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." After initial
adoption, any impairment losses under SFAS 142 or 144 will be recorded as
operating expenses. The combined company does not currently foresee any
impairments in its assets but circumstances may change, and the combined company
may have write-downs in the future.

     In 2000, Interstate and MeriStar had write-downs of approximately $12.6
million and $21.7 million, respectively, relating to decreases in the estimated
fair value of their agreements on leased hotels.

     The adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002 eliminates the amortization of
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, which was approximately $0.9 million
for MeriStar in the year ended December 31, 2001.

                          RISKS RELATED TO THE MERGER

SOME THIRD-PARTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS OF MERISTAR AND INTERSTATE HAVE CHANGE OF
CONTROL PROVISIONS OR TERMINATION PROVISIONS.

     Some of the management agreements that MeriStar and Interstate have with
third-party owners have change of control provisions or provisions giving the
owner the right to terminate immediately or on short notice as a result of the
merger that have not yet been waived. Management of both companies, after
discussions with the owners of a majority of the hotels to be managed by the
combined company, is not aware of any owners who intend on exercising these
termination provisions. If, however, a large number of owners claimed a change
of control of the hotel manager because of the merger, or had other rights to
terminate, and those contracts were terminated or modified in a manner adverse
to the combined company, the financial condition and results of operations of
the combined company could be adversely affected.

THE OPERATIONS OF MERISTAR AND INTERSTATE MAY NOT BE INTEGRATED SUCCESSFULLY,
AND THE INTENDED BENEFITS OF THE MERGER MAY NOT BE REALIZED, WHICH COULD HAVE A
NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMBINED COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK AFTER
THE MERGER.

     The future operations and earnings of the combined company will depend in
part on the combined company's ability to integrate the two companies'
businesses and realize synergies and cost savings. If the combined company fails
to integrate the businesses of MeriStar and Interstate successfully and/or fails
to realize the intended benefits of the merger, the market price of the combined
company's common stock could decline from its market price at the time of the
completion of the merger. In order to achieve the anticipated benefits of the
merger, the combined company will need to:

     - realize the anticipated cost savings in general and administrative
       expenses from reductions in personnel, closing or restructuring offices
       and the elimination of other duplicate overhead costs;

     - demonstrate to hotel owners that the merger will not result in an adverse
       change to customer service standards or business focus; and

     - effectively control the progress of the integration process and the
       associated costs.

     The combined company's assessment of the potential synergies and cost
savings is preliminary and subject to change. The combined company may need to
incur additional costs to realize them, none of which costs is currently
expected to be material.

BECAUSE THE EXCHANGE RATIO IS FIXED, FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE
MERISTAR COMMON STOCK TO BE ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER COULD RESULT IN
A DECREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE MERGER CONSIDERATION TO BE RECEIVED BY INTERSTATE
STOCKHOLDERS.

     The exchange ratio between shares of Interstate common stock and combined
company common stock to be issued in connection with the merger was fixed at the
time of the signing of the merger agreement and will not be adjusted based on
changes in the trading price of MeriStar common stock or Interstate Class A
common stock before the closing of the merger. Accordingly, the value of the
merger consideration that Interstate stockholders will receive will vary,
depending on fluctuations in the price of MeriStar common stock. The value of
the Interstate common stock to be exchanged in the merger will also fluctuate.
Therefore, the relative value of the Interstate common stock and the merger
consideration will not be known until the effective time of the merger.

     In connection with the merger, Interstate common stockholders will be
entitled to receive 4.6 shares of combined company common stock and the
associated rights issued under the combined company's stockholder rights plan
for each share of Interstate common stock held at the time of the closing of the
merger. The holders of Interstate's convertible securities will be entitled to
receive 4.6 shares of combined company common stock and the associated
stockholder rights for each share of Interstate Class A common stock into which
the convertible securities could have been converted immediately before the
merger, ignoring the restrictions on conversion in those securities. The market
prices of MeriStar and Interstate Class A common stock at the time of the merger
may vary significantly from their prices on the date of execution of the merger
agreement or from their prices on either the date of this joint proxy statement
and prospectus or the date of the MeriStar and Interstate stockholder meetings.
These variances may arise due to, among other things:

     - changes in the business, operations and prospects of MeriStar or
       Interstate;

     - market assessments of the likelihood that the merger will be completed;

     - interest rates;

     - hotel industry performance; and

     - general market and economic conditions and other factors.

     During the 12-month period ending on           , 2002, the most recent date
practicable before the mailing of this joint proxy statement and prospectus, the
closing per share price of MeriStar common stock varied from a low of $     to a
high of $     and ended that period at $     . During the same period, the
closing per share price of Interstate Class A common stock varied from a low of
$     to a high of $     and ended that period at $     . Historical trading
prices are not necessarily indicative of future performance.

     The following table illustrates how the implied value of the merger
consideration will fluctuate based on changes in the trading prices of MeriStar
common stock.

THE INTEGRATION OF INTERSTATE WITH MERISTAR WILL MAKE SUBSTANTIAL DEMANDS ON THE
COMBINED COMPANY'S RESOURCES, WHICH COULD DIVERT NEEDED ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE
COMBINED COMPANY'S OTHER OPERATIONS.

     The integration of Interstate with MeriStar will make substantial demands
on the combined company's management, operational resources and financial and
internal control systems. MeriStar's future operating results will depend in
part on the combined company's ability to continue to implement and improve its
operating and financial controls. The devotion of management's time to the
integration of Interstate with MeriStar may limit the time available to
management to attend to other operational, financial and strategic issues of the
combined company.

THERE MAY BE UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER.

     Either Interstate or MeriStar may be subject to undisclosed or otherwise
unforeseen environmental, tax, pension, litigation or other liabilities which
are not known to the other party, or either Interstate or MeriStar may
underestimate the liabilities of the other party of which it is aware. If
unknown liabilities materialize or known liabilities are greater than are
currently estimated, they could result in a material adverse effect on the
combined company's business, financial condition and results of operations and,
going forward, could adversely affect the results of the combined company and
the market price of the combined company's common stock.

           RISKS RELATED TO THE COMBINED COMPANY'S CAPITAL STRUCTURE

RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE COMBINED COMPANY'S DEBT AGREEMENTS MAY LIMIT ITS
ABILITY TO EXECUTE ITS BUSINESS STRATEGY AND INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFAULT UNDER
ITS DEBT OBLIGATIONS.

     Interstate and MeriStar are parties to senior credit facilities that
contain restrictive covenants. The combined company will be subject to the same
or similar restrictions. These restrictions include requirements to maintain
financial ratios, which may significantly limit its ability to, among other
things:

     - borrow additional money;

     - make capital expenditures and other investments;

     - pay dividends;

     - merge, consolidate or dispose of assets; and

     - incur additional liens.

     While MeriStar and Interstate believe that the current business plan and
outlook for the combined company will provide sufficient liquidity to fund its
operations, a significant decline in its operations could reduce its cash from
operations and cause the combined company to be in default under other covenants
in its debt agreements, leaving it unable to use its new senior credit facility
to supply needed liquidity.

     The new senior secured credit facility of the combined company will mature
in 2005. The combined company's credit facility with MeriStar Hospitality will
mature on the fifth anniversary of the effective time of the merger. As of March
31, 2002, on a pro forma basis, giving effect to the merger and related
transactions, the combined company would have approximately $81.0 million of
outstanding indebtedness under the new senior secured credit facility and
approximately $55.0 million of outstanding indebtedness under the MeriStar
Hospitality facility.

     The combined company may, in the future, be required to refinance or
negotiate an extension of the maturity of its senior secured credit facility.
However, its ability to complete a refinancing or extension is subject to a
number of conditions, many of which are beyond its control. For example, if
there were a disruption in the financial markets because of a terrorist attack
or other event, the combined company may be unable to access the financial
markets. Failure to complete a refinancing or extension of the senior secured
credit facility would have a material adverse effect on the combined company.

A DEFICIT IN WORKING CAPITAL MAY REDUCE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO THE COMBINED COMPANY
FOR EXPANSION OF ITS BUSINESS.

     As of March 31, 2002, on a pro forma basis, giving effect to the merger and
the related transactions, the combined company had a deficit in working capital
of $23.9 million. This deficit in working capital may require the combined
company to make borrowings under the new senior secured credit facility to pay
its current obligations. These borrowings will serve to reduce amounts available
to the combined company for pursuit of its business strategy of growing through
securing additional management contracts and acquiring additional hotel resort
and conference center properties.

THE COMBINED COMPANY'S FAILURE TO MEET THE NYSE'S CONTINUED LISTING STANDARDS
COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT ITS ABILITY TO RAISE FUTURE CAPITAL AND COULD MAKE IT
MORE DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO OBTAIN QUOTATIONS OR TRADE ITS STOCK.

     MeriStar has received notification from the NYSE that it is not in
compliance with the continued listing standards of the NYSE because its average
closing share price was less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30-day trading
period. The NYSE's continued listing standards require that MeriStar bring its
30-day average closing price and its share price above $1.00 by June 20, 2002,
subject to specified conditions. MeriStar has been advised by the NYSE that, if
MeriStar is seeking stockholder approval for a reverse stock split to cure the
trading price condition, MeriStar may seek the approval at its annual meeting
and implement the reverse stock split promptly after the annual meeting. If the
reverse stock split occurs, the trading price condition will be deemed to be
cured if the trading price promptly exceeds $1.00 per share and remains above
that level for at least the following 30 trading days. Although management is
actively seeking to remedy the problem through the proposed reverse stock split,
the combined company may not be able to resolve the problem in a timely fashion
or at all. If the combined company fails to comply with the listing
requirements, its common stock might be delisted by the NYSE. Delisting from the
NYSE would adversely affect the liquidity of the combined company's common stock
and its ability to raise additional capital through a sale of its common stock.

THE COMBINED COMPANY'S STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN, THE ANTITAKEOVER DEFENSE
PROVISIONS OF ITS CHARTER DOCUMENTS AND THE LARGE OWNERSHIP STAKE OF THE
INTERSTATE PRINCIPAL INVESTOR GROUP MAY DETER POTENTIAL ACQUIRORS AND DEPRESS
ITS STOCK PRICE.

     MeriStar's current stockholder rights plan will be the stockholder rights
plan for the combined company. Under this plan, holders of combined company
common stock will be entitled to one preferred share purchase right for each
outstanding share of common stock they hold, exercisable under defined
circumstances involving a potential change of control. The preferred share
purchase rights have the antitakeover effect of causing substantial dilution to
a person or group that attempts to acquire the combined company on terms not
approved by the board of directors of the combined company. Those provisions
could have a material adverse effect on the premium that potential acquirors
might be willing to pay in an acquisition or that investors might be willing to
pay in the future for shares of combined company common stock. For a more
complete description of the combined company stockholder rights plan, please
refer to the description of the plan contained in the discussion under the
caption "Description of the Capital Stock of the Combined Company -- Certain
antitakeover provisions."

     Provisions of Delaware law and of the combined company's charter and bylaws
may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition
proposal for the combined company. These provisions could delay, defer or
prevent a transaction or a change in control of the combined company under
circumstances that could otherwise give the holders of combined company common
stock the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market
prices of combined company common stock. These provisions include the following:

     - the combined company will be able to issue preferred shares with rights
       senior to its common stock;

     - the combined company's certificate of incorporation will prohibit action
       by written consent of its stockholders, and the combined company's
       stockholders will not be able to call special meetings;

     - the combined company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws will
       provide for a classified board of directors;

     - directors of the combined company will be subject to removal only for
       cause and upon the vote of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of
       combined company common stock;

     - the combined company's bylaws will require advance notice for the
       nomination of directors and for stockholder proposals;

     - the combined company will be subject to Section 203 of the Delaware
       General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of the combined company
       to enter into business combination transactions with interested
       stockholders; and

     - specified provisions of the combined company's certificate of
       incorporation and bylaws may be amended only upon the affirmative vote of
       two-thirds of the outstanding shares.

     MeriStar currently has similar antitakeover defenses. Interstate also has a
number of antitakeover defenses in place, although they differ from those of
MeriStar. See "Comparison of the Rights of the Holders of Interstate Class A
Common Stock and the Holders of Common Stock of the Combined Company."

     The Interstate principal investor group will hold, following the merger,
34,500,000 shares of combined company common stock, representing approximately
34.3% of the outstanding common stock of the combined company. The large stake
of the Interstate principal investor group may make it more difficult for a
third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from attempting to
acquire, control of the combined company.

SOME OF THE COMBINED COMPANY'S STOCKHOLDERS MAY SELL SHARES FOLLOWING THE
MERGER, WHICH MAY DEPRESS THE COMBINED COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE.

     Sales of substantial amounts of combined company common stock or the
perception that those sales could occur may adversely affect the market price
for combined company common stock. These sales include sales of combined company
common stock issued in connection with the merger or outstanding stock options.
All of the combined company common stock to be issued in connection with the
merger will be freely transferable, except for the shares of common stock to be
held by persons deemed to be affiliates of Interstate under Rule 145 under the
Securities Act. The 34,500,000 shares of combined company common stock that will
be held by the Interstate principal investor group after the merger will
represent approximately 34.3% of the outstanding combined company common stock
and will be subject to a registration rights agreement providing for demand,
shelf and piggyback registration rights until the time their shares can be sold
without restriction under Securities Act Rule 144(k). By exercising their
registration rights and selling a large number of shares, these holders could
cause the price of the combined company's common stock to decline.

     For more information regarding the registration rights agreement, please
read the section of this joint proxy statement and prospectus entitled
"Description of Related Agreements -- Registration rights agreement."

                          THE MERISTAR ANNUAL MEETING

     THE MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED AT THE MERISTAR ANNUAL MEETING ARE OF GREAT
IMPORTANCE TO MERISTAR STOCKHOLDERS. THE MERISTAR BOARD URGES ALL MERISTAR

JOINT PROXY STATEMENT AND PROSPECTUS, AND TO COMPLETE, DATE, SIGN AND PROMPTLY
RETURN THE ENCLOSED PROXY CARD IN THE ENCLOSED POSTAGE-PAID ENVELOPE.

Highway, Arlington, Virginia 22202, on           , 2002, at      a.m., local
time. MeriStar is first mailing this document, the attached notice of annual
meeting of stockholders and the enclosed proxy card to MeriStar's stockholders
on or about           , 2002.

         directors of the combined company at 13 for the next 18 months,
         insuring the nomination of the slate of directors proposed in this
         joint proxy statement and prospectus at all stockholder meetings during
         the next 18 months and increasing the authorized number of shares of
         capital stock to 255 million, of which 250 million shares will be
         common stock and 5 million shares will be preferred stock. (See page
         89.)

     5.  To consider and vote upon an amendment to the certificate of
         incorporation of MeriStar to effect a five to one reverse stock split
         of the outstanding shares of common stock, with the board of directors
         of MeriStar having discretion to determine whether the reverse stock
         split will actually be effected and the timing of the reverse stock
         split, so long as any reverse stock split shall occur not later than 12
         months after the MeriStar annual meeting, and to authorize the board of

          meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the annual meeting.

     MeriStar knows of no matter to be brought before the MeriStar annual
meeting other than the proposals described above. If any other business should
properly come before the annual meeting, the persons named in the proxy card

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF MERISTAR HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE MERGER
AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY IT AND UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS
THAT THE HOLDERS OF MERISTAR COMMON STOCK VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF
THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY IT AND VOTE TO ELECT
THE NOMINEES FOR DIRECTOR OF THE COMBINED COMPANY.

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS ALSO UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE OTHER PROPOSALS
PRESENTED BY THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT AND PROSPECTUS AND UNANIMOUSLY
RECOMMENDS THAT HOLDERS OF MERISTAR COMMON STOCK VOTE FOR THOSE OTHER PROPOSALS
AND VOTE TO ELECT THE NOMINEES FOR DIRECTOR OF MERISTAR.

RECORD DATE; QUORUM; REQUIRED VOTE; SHARES OUTSTANDING AND ENTITLED TO VOTE

     The MeriStar board has fixed the close of business on           , 2002 as
the record date for the MeriStar annual meeting. Accordingly, only holders of
MeriStar common stock on the record date will be entitled to vote at the
MeriStar annual meeting and any adjournment or postponement of the meeting. At
the record date,           shares of MeriStar common stock were outstanding and
entitled to vote.

     The presence, in person or by proxy, of a majority of these shares is
necessary to constitute a quorum at the MeriStar annual meeting. Each share of
common stock is entitled to one vote with respect to each matter to be voted on
at that annual meeting.

     The adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by
it requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of MeriStar common stock. FOR THIS PROPOSAL, AN ABSTENTION OR A BROKER
NON-VOTE WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF A "NO" VOTE.

     The approval of the issuance of MeriStar common stock in connection with
the merger requires that at least a majority of the outstanding shares of
MeriStar common stock be present at the annual meeting in person or by proxy and
that the proposal receive the affirmative vote of holders of the majority of
those shares. FOR THIS PROPOSAL, A BROKER NON-VOTE DOES NOT COUNT TOWARDS
DETERMINING THE NUMBER OF SHARES PRESENT AT THE MEETING OR THE NUMBER OF VOTES
CAST. AN ABSTENTION HAS THE SAME EFFECT AS A "NO" VOTE.

     The director nominees must receive a plurality of the votes cast at the
MeriStar annual meeting to be elected. ABSTENTIONS AND BROKER NON-VOTES WILL NOT
AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTIONS.

     The approval of the proposal to amend the MeriStar certificate of
incorporation and bylaws requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of MeriStar common stock. FOR THIS PROPOSAL, AN
ABSTENTION OR A BROKER NON-VOTE WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF A "NO" VOTE.

     The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
MeriStar common stock is required to approve the reverse stock split proposal.
FOR THIS PROPOSAL, AN ABSTENTION OR BROKER NON-VOTE WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF A
"NO" VOTE.

     The approval of the amended and restated incentive plan and the approval of
the amendments to the employee stock purchase plan and the non-employee
directors' incentive plan require that at least a majority of the outstanding
shares of MeriStar common stock be present at the annual meeting in person or by
proxy and that the proposal receive the affirmative vote of holders of the
majority of those shares. FOR THESE PROPOSALS, BROKER NON-VOTE DOES NOT COUNT
TOWARDS DETERMINING THE NUMBER OF SHARES PRESENT AT THE MEETING OR THE NUMBER OF
VOTES CAST, AND AN ABSTENTION HAS THE SAME EFFECT AS A "NO" VOTE.

     The merger proposal, the proposal to issue common stock in the merger, the
election of the proposed directors and the proposal to amend MeriStar's
organizational documents all must be approved in order for the merger to occur.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF MANAGEMENT

     As of the record date, the directors and executive officers of MeriStar and
their affiliates beneficially owned approximately 4,079,785 million of the
outstanding shares of MeriStar common stock. Accordingly, MeriStar directors,
executive officers and their affiliates hold shares representing approximately
11.0% of the outstanding shares of MeriStar common stock and 4.3% of the shares
of MeriStar common stock that

will be eligible to vote at the annual meeting other than the common stock held
by the parties to the MeriStar voting agreement described below.

VOTING AGREEMENT

     Oak Hill Capital Partners, L.P., Oak Hill Management Partners, L.P., FW
Hospitality, L.P., Arbor Reit, L.P., MHX Investors, L.P., Paul W. Whetsell,
Steven D. Jorns and John Emery, who beneficially held in the aggregate as of the
record date approximately 21% of the outstanding shares of MeriStar common
stock, have entered into a voting agreement with Interstate in which they
agreed, among other things, to vote all of their shares of MeriStar common stock
in favor of the merger and the related proposals.

VOTING OF PROXIES

     PROPERLY EXECUTED PROXIES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN REVOKED WILL BE VOTED AT THE
ANNUAL MEETING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS INDICATED IN THE PROXIES. IF
NO INSTRUCTIONS ARE INDICATED, THOSE PROXIES WILL BE VOTED FOR ALL OF THE
PROPOSALS DESCRIBED IN THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT AND PROSPECTUS.

     Voting instructions are included on your proxy card. If you properly
complete your proxy card and submit it to MeriStar in time to vote, one of the
individuals named as your proxy will vote your shares as you have directed.

     Please note, however, that if your shares are held of record by a broker,
bank or other nominee and you wish to vote at the annual meeting, you must bring
to the meeting a letter from the broker, bank or other nominee confirming your
beneficial ownership of the shares.

     If any other matters are properly presented at the annual meeting,
including consideration of a motion to adjourn the meeting to another time and
place for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, the persons named in the
enclosed forms of proxy will have discretion to vote on those matters in
accordance with their best judgment.

REVOCATION OF PROXIES

     Any proxy may be revoked by the person giving it at any time before it is
voted.

     Proxies may be revoked by:

     - filing with the secretary of MeriStar a written notice of revocation

     THE MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED AT THE INTERSTATE SPECIAL MEETING ARE OF GREAT
IMPORTANCE TO INTERSTATE STOCKHOLDERS. THE INTERSTATE BOARD URGES ALL INTERSTATE
STOCKHOLDERS TO READ AND CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THIS
JOINT PROXY STATEMENT AND PROSPECTUS, AND TO COMPLETE, DATE, SIGN AND PROMPTLY
RETURN THE ENCLOSED PROXY CARD IN THE ENCLOSED POSTAGE-PAID ENVELOPE.

GENERAL

     This joint proxy statement and prospectus is being furnished in connection
with the solicitation by the board of directors of Interstate of proxies from
the holders of Interstate common stock for use at the Interstate special
meeting. The meeting will be held on           , 2002 at 10:00 a.m., Eastern
Time, at the Radisson Hotel, Pittsburgh-Greentree located at 101 Radisson Drive,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Interstate is first mailing this document, the
attached notice of special meeting of stockholders and the enclosed proxy card
to Interstate's stockholders on or about           , 2002.

MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED AT THE SPECIAL MEETING

     At the special meeting, Interstate stockholders will be asked:

        1.  To approve the merger of Interstate with and into MeriStar on the
            terms and conditions contained in the Agreement and Plan of Merger
            by and between Interstate and MeriStar, and the other transactions
            contemplated by that merger agreement.

        2.  To act upon such other business as may properly come before the
            special meeting or any postponements or adjournments of the special
            meeting.

     Interstate knows of no matter to be brought before the Interstate special
meeting other than the merger proposal. If any other business should properly
come before the special meeting, the persons named in the proxy card will vote
in their discretion.

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF INTERSTATE HAS UNANIMOUSLY DETERMINED, BASED IN
PART ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF A SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND
THE OPINION OF ITS FINANCIAL ADVISOR, THAT THE MERGER IS ADVISABLE AND IN THE
BEST INTERESTS OF INTERSTATE AND ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND UNANIMOUSLY
RECOMMENDS THAT INTERSTATE COMMON STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR APPROVAL OF THE MERGER
AND THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

RECORD DATE; SHARES OUTSTANDING AND ENTITLED TO VOTE; QUORUM; REQUIRED VOTE

     The Interstate board has fixed the close of business on           , 2002 as
the record date for the Interstate special meeting. Accordingly, only holders of
shares of Interstate Class A common stock and Class B common stock who held
their shares on the record date will be entitled to vote at the Interstate
special meeting and any adjournment or postponement of the meeting. At the
record date, the following shares were outstanding and entitled to vote:

     - 11,951,382 shares of Class A common stock; and

     - 242,555 shares of Class B common stock.

     The presence, in person or by proxy, of a majority of these shares,
considered together, is necessary to constitute a quorum at the Interstate
special meeting. Each share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock is
entitled to one vote with respect to the proposals to be considered at the
special meeting. Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote
of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Interstate common
stock.

     The consent and approval of a majority of the combined aggregate principal
amount of the 8.75% convertible notes plus the stated amount of the Series B
preferred stock is also required for approval of the merger and has been
obtained.

     ABSTENTIONS AND BROKER NON-VOTES WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE DETERMINATION OF
SHARES PRESENT AT THE INTERSTATE SPECIAL MEETING FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING A
QUORUM, BUT, ALONG WITH A FAILURE TO VOTE, WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF A VOTE
AGAINST THE MERGER PROPOSAL.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF MANAGEMENT

     As of the record date, the directors and executive officers of Interstate
and their affiliates beneficially owned approximately 6,949,662 shares of
Interstate common stock which represent approximately 57.0% of the outstanding
shares of Interstate common stock. Of these shares, 95,289 shares, representing
approximately 0.8% of the outstanding shares of Interstate common stock, are not
subject to the Interstate voting and conversion agreement described below.

INTERSTATE VOTING AND CONVERSION AGREEMENT

     The Interstate principal investor group, along with Thomas F. Hewitt, J.
William Richardson and Kevin P. Kilkeary, who owned in the aggregate as of the
close of business on the record date approximately 56.2% of the outstanding
shares of Interstate common stock, have entered into a voting agreement with
MeriStar in which they agreed, among other things, to vote all of their shares
of Interstate common stock in favor of the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. This agreement is described in more detail
in this joint proxy statement and prospectus under the heading "Description of
Related Agreements -- Interstate voting and conversion agreement."

complete the proxy card and submit it to us in time to vote, one of the
individuals named as your proxy will vote your shares as you have directed.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

     Under the rules of the SEC relating to when a company must include a
stockholder's proposal in its proxy statement, stockholders may present proper
proposals for inclusion in Interstate's proxy statement for consideration at the
next annual meeting of its stockholders by submitting their proposals to
Interstate in a timely manner.

     Interstate will hold an annual meeting in 2002 only if the merger is not
completed. If the merger has not been completed and Interstate schedules a 2002
annual meeting, Interstate stockholders may present a proposal for presentation
at the Interstate annual meeting if the stockholder complies with the relevant
provision of Interstate's bylaws.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Under Maryland law, holders of Interstate's Class A common stock will not
be entitled to dissenters' rights of appraisal in connection with the merger if
the merger agreement is approved or with respect to any other proposal to be
voted on at the special meeting, because the Class A common stock is traded on a
national exchange. However, holders of Interstate's Class B common stock and its
Series B preferred stock, neither of which is traded on an exchange, will have
dissenters' appraisal rights under Section 3-202 of the Maryland General
Corporation Law.

                                   THE MERGER

     In the proposed merger, Interstate will be merged with and into MeriStar
and all of the Interstate stockholders will become holders of MeriStar common
stock. For more information regarding the terms of the merger, please read the
section of this joint proxy statement and prospectus entitled "The Merger
Agreement."

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     In the fall of 1999, during Interstate's search for a capital partner, Paul
W. Whetsell, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of MeriStar,
contacted Thomas F. Hewitt, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of
Interstate, regarding a potential business combination transaction between the
two companies. Mr. Hewitt advised Mr. Whetsell that Interstate was seeking a
capital partner and was not interested in pursuing a business combination.
Merger discussions did not proceed at this time.

     In June 2001, during a hotel conference in New York City, Mr. Whetsell and
senior officers of Interstate had various discussions with respect to a possible
combination of Interstate and MeriStar. These and future discussions included
representatives of the Interstate principal investor group in light of the right
of the Interstate principal investor group to consent to any potential
transaction. These discussions culminated in Mr. Hewitt sending a draft term
sheet to Mr. Whetsell regarding a potential merger of MeriStar into Interstate.
On June 13, 2001, the companies entered into a confidentiality agreement.

     During July and early August 2001, MeriStar and Interstate exchanged
information and began preliminary due diligence.

     On August 7, 2001, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Interstate board
of directors, Mr. Hewitt advised the Interstate board that management had begun
discussions with MeriStar regarding a potential business combination
transaction.

     From late August to mid-October 2001, no meaningful conversations regarding
a potential merger occurred.

     In mid October 2001, Mr. Whetsell had follow-up conversations with
representatives of Interstate and the Interstate principal investor group
regarding the basic terms of a potential merger. In connection with these
conversations, Interstate and its principal investor group sought and obtained
Marriott International, Inc.'s waiver of standstill and other covenants made by
Interstate and its principal investor group for Marriott's benefit.

     On October 22, 2001, at a regular meeting of the MeriStar board of
directors, Mr. Whetsell advised the board of the discussions with Interstate.

     On October 28, 2001, Messrs. Whetsell and Hewitt met in Washington, DC to
discuss the basic structure of the potential merger.

     On November 5, 2001, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Interstate
board of directors, Mr. Hewitt and J. William Richardson, Interstate's Chief
Financial Officer, discussed the potential MeriStar transaction with the
Interstate board. The Interstate board authorized management to continue
discussions regarding a potential transaction.

     On November 6, 2001, Mr. Whetsell sent to Mr. Hewitt a draft term sheet for
the proposed transaction under which the merger would be structured as a merger
of Interstate into MeriStar. During the next few weeks, Interstate and MeriStar
continued to negotiate the draft term sheet, including a meeting on November 15,
2001, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, among Mr. Whetsell, John Emery, President
and Chief Operating Officer of MeriStar, Mr. Hewitt and three representatives of
the Interstate principal investor group, Messrs. Joseph J. Flannery, Alan J.
Kanders and Ali Elam.

     On December 11, 2001, at a regular meeting of the MeriStar board of
directors, Mr. Whetsell discussed with the board the then current status of the
conversations with Interstate regarding the potential merger.

     Each company began a thorough legal, financial and business due diligence
investigation of the other company in the fall of 2001, which continued
intermittently until the time the merger agreement was signed. During November
and December 2001 and January 2002, MeriStar and Interstate continued to
negotiate the terms of the potential merger, including discussions regarding the
exchange ratio, Meristar's requirement that all Interstate convertible
securities be converted into Interstate common stock and the combined company's
organizational structure.

     On January 31, 2002, Messrs. Whetsell and Hewitt met in Santa Barbara,
California, to discuss the terms of the potential merger.

     In early February 2002, Mr. Whetsell met with representatives of the
Interstate principal investor group to discuss the potential merger.

     On February 11, 2002, the Interstate board of directors met and discussed
the potential merger with MeriStar and the proposal from the Shaner Hotel Group
Limited Partnership received in January 2002. Mr. Hewitt provided a status
report on discussions with MeriStar. Mr. Richardson presented a comparison of
the Shaner Hotel Group proposal, the MeriStar transaction and other alternatives
available to Interstate. At this meeting, the board voted unanimously to reject
the Shaner Hotel Group proposal.

     On February 14, 2002, the board of directors of MeriStar met to discuss the
proposed merger with Interstate. At the meeting, Mr. Whetsell provided the board
with an update on the proposed terms for the transaction as well as the status
of the financial, legal and business due diligence that had been performed to
date. Mr. Whetsell also presented a preliminary outline of the potential
benefits and risks associated with the potential merger.

     On February 19, 2002, the Interstate board of directors met to discuss the
potential merger with MeriStar and modifications to the Shaner Hotel Group
proposal that had been received. Mr. Hewitt advised the board that business,
financial, legal and accounting due diligence was proceeding and that Marriott
International, Inc. had indicated it would consent to the proposed merger if
conditions previously identified by Marriott were satisfied.

     On February 25, 2002, at a meeting of the Interstate board of directors to
discuss the revised proposal received from Shaner Hotel Group, Mr. Hewitt
provided an update on the status of discussions with MeriStar and advised the
board that the due diligence process had resumed after a brief period during
which disagreements over business issues had resulted in both parties
terminating their due diligence investigations. After a lengthy discussion of
the revised Shaner Hotel Group proposal, the board voted unanimously to reject
that Shaner Hotel Group offer.

     On February 26, 2002, the first draft of the merger agreement was
circulated to the two companies and the Interstate principal investor group and
their legal and financial representatives.

     During February, March and early April 2002, MeriStar and Interstate
continued to negotiate the terms of the proposed merger and to complete their
legal, financial and business due diligence investigations. Counsel to the
Interstate principal investor group also participated in the due diligence
process. Messrs. Whetsell and Hewitt had numerous conversations during this
period covering all aspects of the proposed merger. Mr. Whetsell contacted
various members of the MeriStar board of directors during this period to apprise
them of the status of discussions with Interstate and to address inquiries made
by them.

     On March 14, 2002, Mr. Hewitt provided the Interstate board of directors
with an update as to his discussions with Mr. Whetsell. The board also discussed
recent correspondence with Shaner Hotel Group.

     On March 27, 2002, at a special meeting of the Interstate board of
directors in response to the announcement by Shaner Hotel Group of its intention
to launch an unsolicited offer to purchase a portion of the outstanding shares
of Interstate's Class A common stock, the board appointed a special committee of
independent directors with a mandate to evaluate the Shaner Hotel Group proposal
and to evaluate and recommend to the board whether a possible business
combination transaction with MeriStar was in the best interests of Interstate's
public stockholders, including any terms of that transaction with respect to the

Interstate principal investor group that are different from the terms pertaining
to the public stockholders. Once the special committee was formed, its members
were advised and updated on matters relating to the merger discussions.

     On April 2, 2002, at a meeting of the Interstate board of directors,
Interstate's management made a detailed presentation of the potential merger
with MeriStar. Mr. Richardson provided a summary of the status of due diligence
and the board discussed the issues raised by the due diligence completed to
date. The board also received an update as to correspondence with the Shaner
Hotel Group and the failure of the Shaner Hotel Group to properly commence the
tender offer previously announced.

     On April 10, 2002, after numerous telephone calls between the companies
regarding various issues relating to the merger, Mr. Whetsell sent to Mr. Hewitt
a letter stating that, based on the nature of recent discussions regarding some
of the terms of the proposed merger, MeriStar was terminating discussions with
Interstate regarding the proposed merger.

     From April 11 until April 14, 2002, Mr. Whetsell had several discussions
with Mr. Hewitt and representatives of the Interstate principal investor group
regarding the issues that had led to MeriStar's termination of the merger
discussions.

     On April 15, 2002, the Interstate board of directors met to discuss the
tender offer commenced by the Shaner Hotel Group and the status of discussions
with MeriStar. Mr. Hewitt advised the board that discussions with MeriStar were
continuing despite receipt of a letter of termination from MeriStar on April 10,
2002 but indicated that a number of significant business issues remained
unresolved. Mr. Hewitt advised the board of his scheduled meeting with Mr.
Whetsell and Mr. Flannery following the board meeting. The board then received
an update as to current events with the Shaner Hotel Group tender offer. The
board resolved to defer distribution of Interstate's stockholder rights in
connection with the Shaner Hotel Group offer until the board takes further
action. The special committee reported that it had engaged Merrill Lynch as a
financial advisor to the special committee in connection with the Shaner Hotel
Group tender offer. Later, on April 15, 2002, Mr. Whetsell and Bruce G. Wiles,
Chief Investment Officer of MeriStar, met with Mr. Hewitt and representatives of
the Interstate principal investor group regarding the issues leading to
MeriStar's termination of the discussions and the manner in which each of the
parties was willing to proceed with discussions.

     On April 16, 2002, Messrs. Whetsell and Hewitt had a telephone conversation
during which they discussed the organizational structure of the combined company
and the roles of some individuals in the combined company post-merger.

     On April 22, 2002, the Interstate board of directors met to discuss the
Shaner Hotel Group tender offer and the required SEC filling on Schedule 14D-9
being prepared by Interstate in response to it. At the meeting, Mr. Hewitt
provided an update on the potential merger with MeriStar. Mr. Hewitt advised the
board that discussions with MeriStar were continuing but that a number of
significant business issues were not yet resolved and an agreement in principle
had not yet been reached. The special committee and Merrill Lynch reported to
the board with respect to the financial terms of the Shaner tender offer and,
after lengthy discussion, including the recommendation of the special committee
to reject the Shaner tender offer, the board unanimously voted to reject the
Shaner Hotel Group tender offer. The board discussed the likelihood that
disclosing the identity of MeriStar or details of the proposed transaction with
MeriStar would jeopardize the proposed merger and determined to exclude the
identity of MeriStar and the specific details of the proposed MeriStar
transaction from the Schedule 14D-9.

     On April 23, 2002, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the board of
directors of MeriStar, the board discussed the current status of discussions
regarding the proposed merger, the terms of the proposed merger and the benefits
and risks associated with it.

     From April 24 until April 30, 2002, Mr. Whetsell had conversations with a
number of the board members of MeriStar discussing the proposed merger.

     On April 26, 2002, the special committee of Interstate's board of directors
met and agreed to expand Merrill Lynch's engagement as independent financial
advisor to assist the special committee in evaluating the proposed MeriStar
transaction and to render, if requested, a fairness opinion to the Interstate
board of directors regarding the MeriStar transaction.

     From April 26 through May 1, various conversations took place among
executives of Interstate, the members of and counsel to the special committee,
executives of MeriStar, representatives of the Interstate principal investor
group and representatives of the financial advisors of MeriStar and Interstate
regarding various terms of the merger and other related issues.

     On April 30, 2002, a telephonic meeting of the MeriStar board of directors
was convened and the board received a report from management on the status of
the proposed merger. A representative of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &
Garrison, outside counsel for MeriStar, reviewed with the board their
responsibilities in connection with the proposed merger. A representative of
Paul, Weiss led a discussion of the terms of the merger agreement and other
documents associated with the transaction. Salomon Smith Barney reviewed with
the MeriStar board its financial analysis of the exchange ratio provided for in
the merger and delivered to the MeriStar board its oral opinion, which opinion
was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated April 30, 2002, to the
effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to the matters described
in its opinion, the exchange ratio provided for in the merger was fair, from a
financial point of view, to MeriStar. After due discussion and deliberation, the
MeriStar board, by a unanimous vote of all directors voted that the merger and
the transactions relating to the merger were advisable to, and in the best
interests of, MeriStar and its stockholders, and approved the merger and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and related documents. The
board also unanimously recommended that the stockholders of MeriStar vote for
the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by it.

     On April 30, 2002, Interstate's special committee met to discuss the
proposed merger with MeriStar. A representative of Miles & Stockbridge P.C.,
independent legal counsel to the special committee, reviewed with the special
committee members their duties under Maryland law and the special committee's
mandate as articulated by the Interstate board. Representatives of Merrill Lynch
presented a financial evaluation of the proposed merger and confirmed that,
based on the facts then available, it was prepared to render an opinion to the
Interstate board that the exchange ratio and the conversion incentive payment,
are fair, from a financial point of view, to Interstate's public stockholders,
whether or not the merger is completed. The special committee adjourned its
meeting to obtain additional information as to specific legal, financial and
accounting terms of the proposed transaction. The special committee reconvened
its meeting and a representative of Miles & Stockbridge P.C. led a discussion of
the terms of the proposed merger and related transactions. The special committee
discussed the transaction at length and determined to recommend to the board
that the proposed merger is advisable and in the best interests of the public
stockholders and that the board should approve the proposed merger. The special
committee also determined that the exchange ratio is fair, from a financial
point of view, to Interstate's public stockholders and that the proposed
transaction, including the merger, the conversion of a portion of Interstate
convertible securities and the incentive payment to induce that conversion, are
in the best interests of Interstate and its public stockholders, whether or not
the merger is completed.

     On May 1, 2002, the Interstate board of directors met to consider the
proposed merger with MeriStar. A representative of Ballard Spahr Andrews &
Ingersoll, LLP, outside Maryland counsel for Interstate, advised the board
members of their duties under Maryland law. Senior management of Interstate made
a presentation to the board of the strategic benefits of the proposed merger
with MeriStar, the proposed management and board composition of the combined
company following the merger and the status of third-party consents required in
connection with the proposed merger. Representatives of Merrill Lynch,
Interstate's special committee's financial advisor, and representatives of
Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, Interstate's outside legal counsel, led a discussion
of the financial and legal terms of the merger agreement and the related
agreements being entered into in connection with the proposed merger. Merrill
Lynch reviewed its analysis with the Interstate board of the exchange ratio, the
conversion incentive payment and the other financial terms of the proposed
merger. John J. Russell, Jr., a member of the special committee

of the Interstate board, advised the board of the special committee's
determination to recommend that the proposed merger with MeriStar is advisable
and in the best interest of Interstate's public stockholders and the committee's
determination that the exchange ratio, is fair, from a financial point of view,
to the public stockholders and the payment of the $9.25 million to the
Interstate principal investor group, in connection with and in order to
facilitate the merger, is in the best interests of Interstate and its public
stockholders, whether or not the merger is completed. The special committee
unanimously recommended that the board approve the proposed merger transaction.
The special committee reported that, in making its recommendation, it had
assumed that various third-party consents to the merger would be obtained. The
board meeting was adjourned so Interstate and MeriStar could resolve some
matters that remained open.

     During the adjournment of the Interstate board meeting on May 1, 2002, the
special committee convened a meeting to discuss the status of open issues
relating to the proposed merger with MeriStar. The special committee received
updates from a representative of Miles & Stockbridge P.C. on the status of
third-party consents being sought by Interstate and MeriStar in connection with
the proposed merger. The special committee discussed the terms of the fairness
opinion expected to be delivered by Merrill Lynch. At this meeting, the special
committee determined that its recommendation of the proposed merger to the board
need not be subject to receipt of any additional third-party consents.

     The Interstate board reconvened its meeting later on May 1, 2002.
Representatives of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue reported to the board on further
developments regarding the third-party consents. Representatives of Merrill
Lynch delivered to the board Merrill Lynch's oral opinion, subsequently
confirmed in writing, that, as of May 1, 2002, the exchange ratio was fair, from
a financial point of view, to the stockholders of Interstate other than the
Interstate principal investor group and, whether or not the merger is completed,
the conversion incentive payment was fair from a financial point of view, to the
stockholders of Interstate other than the Interstate principal investor group.
Following an extensive discussion, including a discussion of the special
committee's conclusion that the exchange ratio and the conversion incentive
payment were fair to the stockholders of Interstate other than the Interstate
principal investor group and the special committee's reasons for reaching its
conclusion to recommend the proposed merger, the board, by unanimous vote of the
directors present, with one director absent, declared the merger advisable and
approved the merger and the transactions relating to the merger. The Interstate
board directed that the merger be submitted to the Interstate stockholders for
their consideration and recommended that Interstate stockholders vote for the
approval of the merger. The Interstate board reiterated its rejection of the
Shaner Hotel Group tender offer.

     During the evening of May 1, 2002, MeriStar and Interstate executed the
merger agreement and the related agreements.

     On the morning of May 2, 2002, MeriStar and Interstate issued a joint press
release announcing the transactions.

     Following execution of the merger agreement, the parties proceeded with
preparation of the appropriate filings with the SEC and other governmental
agencies and initiated the necessary work to satisfy the closing conditions
specified in the merger agreement.

     At a subsequent meeting of the Interstate board on May 21, 2002, the full
board unanimously declared the merger advisable, voted to approve the merger and
the transactions relating to the merger, directed that the merger be submitted
to the Interstate stockholders for their consideration and recommended that
Interstate stockholders vote for approval of the merger.

     On June 3, 2002, MeriStar, Interstate and the Interstate principal investor
group entered into a letter agreement to confirm and ratify the understanding
that the Interstate principal investor group will convert all but ten shares of
its Series B preferred stock on the record date for the Interstate stockholder
meeting. In addition, on June 3, 2002, the parties to the merger agreement and
the Interstate voting and conversion agreement entered into amendments to those
agreements. The merger agreement was amended to provide, among other things,
that each share of the Series B preferred stock would be converted in the merger
into

11.5 shares of combined company common stock. The voting and conversion
agreement was amended to make various technical corrections.

RECOMMENDATION OF MERISTAR'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS; FACTORS CONSIDERED BY
MERISTAR'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN RELATION TO THE MERGER

     THE MERISTAR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS UNANIMOUSLY DETERMINED THAT THE MERGER
AND THE TRANSACTIONS RELATING TO THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE PROPOSALS RELATING TO
THE MERGER DESCRIBED IN THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT AND PROSPECTUS, ARE ADVISABLE
TO, AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF, MERISTAR AND ITS STOCKHOLDERS AND RECOMMENDS
THAT YOU VOTE FOR APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF EACH OF THE PROPOSALS RELATING TO THE
MERGER.

     In reaching the above determination, the MeriStar board gave significant
consideration to a variety of factors, including those described below. In view
of the wide variety of factors bearing on its decision, the MeriStar board did
not consider it practicable to, nor did it attempt to, quantify or assign
relative specific weight to the factors it considered in reaching its decision.
In addition, individual directors may have given different weights to different
factors. The MeriStar board consulted with its senior management, as well as its
legal and financial advisors, in connection with its consideration of the
merger. The MeriStar board does not intend the following discussion of the
information and factors to be exhaustive but believes the discussion includes
the material factors it considered.

     In making its determination, the MeriStar board considered the following
potentially material factors:

     - Building on MeriStar's position as the largest independent hotel
       management company.  The MeriStar board believes that the merger
       solidifies MeriStar's position as the largest independent hotel
       management company in the United States. The combined company will have
       more than 400 hotels under management with a total of more than 86,000
       rooms, representing more than 30 franchise brands in North America and
       Russia.

     - Stronger balance sheet, better liquidity position and lower
       leverage.  The MeriStar board also considered that the combined company
       will have a stronger balance sheet, substantial cash and availability
       under its credit facility and significantly lower leverage than MeriStar
       on a stand-alone basis. The combined company will have more than $30
       million in availability under its new senior secured credit facility
       based on existing credit commitments of $113 million.

     - Larger market capitalization.  The MeriStar board recognized that the
       larger market capitalization of the combined company could allow greater
       access to the financial markets and better liquidity for stockholders.
       Based on the 30-day trailing average closing price of MeriStar's common
       stock on April 30, 2002, MeriStar's equity capitalization was $35.7
       million and total capitalization was $173.8 million. Based on that
       average closing stock price, the combined company would have a total
       equity capitalization of $96.6 million and a total capitalization of
       $236.8 million. The MeriStar board also considered that increased market
       capitalization could also result in additional analyst coverage for the
       combined company.

     - Opportunity for growth.  The MeriStar board also believes that the merger
       will position the combined company for growth through acquisitions of
       underperforming or undervalued hotels, and resort and conference center
       properties. The MeriStar board believes that the greater access to
       financing and the strong liquidity position of the combined company will
       enable the combined company to leverage the skills of the combined
       company's management team to identify underperforming and undervalued
       assets and renovate and reposition those assets, providing new
       opportunities for growth in both revenues and asset value.

     - Cost savings and synergies.  The MeriStar board also took into account
       the potential for significant cost savings, synergies and revenue
       enhancements that could result from the merger. By consolidating the
       headquarters and administrative staff of the two companies, the MeriStar
       board believes that the combined company could realize annualized cost
       savings of between $8 million and $10 million.

     - Opportunity to take advantage of increased scale and purchasing
       power.  The MeriStar board recognized that the increased scale of the
       combined company will likely enable it to exercise increased bargaining
       power in negotiations with suppliers of energy, food and beverage
       supplies, capital equipment, labor and other products.

     - Accretive nature of the transaction.  The MeriStar board also recognized
       that the merger is expected to be accretive to MeriStar stockholders in
       2002, after giving effect to potential cost savings and other synergies
       anticipated to result from the merger, related transactions contemplated
       by the merger and potential income from a proposed joint venture to
       acquire hotel assets.

     - Terms of the merger agreement and other transaction agreements.  The
       MeriStar board evaluated the overall terms of the merger agreement and
       the other transaction agreements, including, but not limited to, the
       fixed exchange ratio, the non-solicitation provisions, voting
       commitments, the termination fee provisions, the interim covenants and
       the representations and warranties of the parties.

     - Ownership interests of the current Interstate principal investor
       group.  The MeriStar board also considered the effects of having a large
       stockholder with significant board representation. The Interstate
       principal investor group is expected to hold approximately 34.3% of the
       outstanding common stock of the combined company. Initially, five of the
       13 members of the board of directors of the combined company will be
       nominees of the combined company designated by the Interstate principal
       investor group.

     - Premium over the market price of Interstate Class A common stock.  The
       MeriStar board considered that, based on the trailing 30-day average
       closing prices for MeriStar common stock and Interstate Class A common
       stock on April 30, 2002, the exchange ratio in the merger represented a
       premium of $1.88 per share, or 78.5% over the market price of Interstate
       Class A common stock.

     - Captive insurance company.  The MeriStar board evaluated both the risks
       and advantages associated with Interstate's captive insurance company,
       which enters into reinsurance contracts with the primary insurers
       providing insurance to the owners of hotels managed by Interstate.

     - Additional foreign operations.  The MeriStar board also evaluated the
       risks and advantages associated with Interstate's hotel management
       operations in Russia, determining that they were complementary with
       MeriStar's existing operations in Western Europe.

     - Opinion of MeriStar's financial advisor.  The MeriStar board also
       considered the opinion of Salomon Smith Barney described in this joint
       proxy statement and prospectus.

     - Failure to complete the transactions.  The MeriStar board noted the
       possibility that the merger and related transactions may not be
       completed.

     - Interests of MeriStar Officers and Directors in the merger.  The MeriStar
       board also considered that some executive officers and directors of
       MeriStar may have interests with respect to the merger in addition to
       their interests as stockholders of MeriStar generally.

     - Tax Treatment.  The qualification of the merger as a reorganization for
       federal tax purposes.

FACTORS CONSIDERED BY INTERSTATE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN RELATION TO THE MERGER;
RECOMMENDATION OF INTERSTATE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF INTERSTATE HAS UNANIMOUSLY DETERMINED, BASED IN
PART ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF A SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
COMPOSED OF INDEPENDENT MEMBERS, AND THE OPINION OF ITS FINANCIAL ADVISOR, THAT
THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE PROPOSALS DESCRIBED IN THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT AND
PROSPECTUS, IS ADVISABLE AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF INTERSTATE AND ITS COMMON
STOCKHOLDERS AND UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT INTERSTATE COMMON STOCKHOLDERS VOTE
FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE MERGER AND THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE
MERGER AGREEMENT.

     In reaching the above determination, the Interstate board and its special
committee gave significant consideration to a variety of factors, including
those described below. In view of the wide variety of factors bearing on its
decision, the Interstate board and its special committee did not consider it
practicable to, nor did it attempt to, quantify or assign relative specific
weight to the factors it considered in reaching its decision. In addition,
individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The
Interstate board and its special committee received the advice of its senior
management, as well as its legal and financial advisors, throughout its
consideration of the merger agreement. The Interstate board and its special
committee do not intend the following discussion of the information and factors
to be exhaustive but believe the following discussion includes the material
factors it considered.

     In making its determination, the Interstate board considered the following
potentially material factors:

     - The combined company will be one of the largest, publicly owned
       independent hotel management companies. The size of the combined company
       will result in increased opportunities for growth and for increased
       recognition and credibility in the industry.

     - The combined company will benefit from economies of scale and operating
       efficiencies not currently available to Interstate. The combined company
       will have operational and financial resources not currently available to
       Interstate. Interstate's business, customers and stockholders will
       benefit.

     - The anticipated synergies are reasonable and do not reflect growth
       opportunities that will be available to the combined company.

     - The larger combined company will not be at risk of losing management
       contracts to the same extent that Interstate, in light of its smaller
       size, currently is.

     - The merger will result in combining two skilled management teams. The
       combined company will benefit from the enhanced depth and experience of
       management.

     - The combined company will benefit from MeriStar's relationship with
       MeriStar Hospitality and the long-term management contracts with MeriStar
       Hospitality.

     - The merger offers a unique opportunity for Interstate. It will be a
       strategic combination with a quality company that has a business and
       goals that are similar to Interstate's.

     - The combined company will have a larger market capitalization than
       Interstate currently has. Increased interest in the combined company and
       increased coverage by the investor community will likely result. That
       should result in increased liquidity which will benefit Interstate
       stockholders.

     - Interstate's stockholders will represent a majority of ownership of the
       combined company. The board of the combined company will, for a
       significant period of time, have seven representatives of Interstate and
       six representatives of MeriStar.

     - The expected tax-free structure of the merger is beneficial for
       Interstate stockholders.

     - The potential strategic and other benefits of the merger, including the
       complementary nature of various Interstate and MeriStar businesses.

     - The positive effect of the combined company's increased size on its
       ability to raise financing and the cost of that financing.

     - The anticipated improvement in Interstate's ability to capitalize upon
       its growth and development opportunities.

     - Historical and prospective financial information with respect to
       Interstate, including with respect to the impact or expected impact of
       Interstate's historical and prospective financial performance on existing
       covenants contained in Interstate's debt instruments.

     - The fact that Interstate's investor group and other stockholders have
       signed voting agreements binding them to approve the proposals.

     - The fact that the merger provides for a fixed exchange ratio and, as a
       result, the value of the MeriStar common stock to be received by
       Interstate stockholders in connection with the merger may be higher or
       lower than the value of the stock at the time the merger agreement was
       signed.

     - The opportunity for continued use of the Interstate name for marketing
       and brand building purposes.

     - The terms of the merger agreement, including those provisions regarding
       third party proposals, permitting the Interstate board of directors to
       consider superior proposals in some circumstances, and the potential
       payment of a termination fee to MeriStar, as well as the terms of the
       Interstate voting and conversion agreement, the MeriStar voting agreement
       and the Interstate conversion incentive agreement.

     - The opinion of Merrill Lynch described below.

     - The interests that some executive officers and directors of Interstate
       may have with respect to the merger in addition to their interests as
       stockholders of Interstate generally.

In considering the recommendation of the Interstate board of directors to
approve the merger proposal described in this joint proxy statement and
prospectus, Interstate stockholders should be aware that some officers and
directors of Interstate have interests in the proposed merger that are different
from and in addition to the interests of Interstate stockholders generally. The
Interstate board of directors and its special committee were aware of these
interests and considered them in approving the merger agreement and the merger.
See "Interests of certain persons in the merger."

OPINION OF THE FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO MERISTAR

     MeriStar retained Salomon Smith Barney to act as its exclusive financial
advisor in connection with the proposed merger and requested that Salomon Smith
Barney evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, to MeriStar of the
exchange ratio provided for in the merger. On April 30, 2002, at a meeting of
the MeriStar board of directors held to evaluate the proposed merger, Salomon
Smith Barney rendered to the MeriStar board an oral opinion, which opinion was
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated the same date, to the effect
that, as of that date and based on and subject to the matters described in the
opinion, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to
MeriStar.

     In arriving at its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney:

     - reviewed a draft dated April 30, 2002 of the merger agreement;

     - held discussions with senior officers, directors and other
       representatives and advisors of MeriStar and senior officers and other
       representatives and advisors of Interstate concerning the businesses,
       operations and prospects of MeriStar and Interstate;

     - examined publicly available business and financial information relating
       to MeriStar and Interstate;

     - examined financial forecasts and other information and data relating to
       MeriStar and Interstate which were provided to or otherwise discussed
       with Salomon Smith Barney by the management teams of MeriStar and
       Interstate, including information relating to the potential strategic
       implications and operational benefits anticipated by the management teams
       of MeriStar and Interstate to result from the merger;

     - reviewed the financial terms of the merger reflected in the merger
       agreement in relation to, among other things, current and historical
       market prices and trading volumes of MeriStar common stock and Interstate
       Class A common stock, historical and projected operating data of MeriStar
       and Interstate, and the capitalization and financial condition of
       MeriStar and Interstate, including the near-term liquidity needs of, and
       capital resources available to, MeriStar;

     - considered, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of
       other transactions recently effected which Salomon Smith Barney
       considered relevant in evaluating the merger;

     - analyzed financial, stock market and other publicly available information
       relating to the businesses of other companies whose operations Salomon
       Smith Barney considered relevant in evaluating those of MeriStar and
       Interstate;

     - evaluated the potential pro forma financial impact of the merger on
       MeriStar; and

     - conducted other analyses and examinations and considered other financial,
       economic and market criteria as Salomon Smith Barney deemed appropriate
       in arriving at its opinion.

     In rendering its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney assumed and relied, without
independent verification, on the accuracy and completeness of all financial and
other information and data publicly available or furnished to or otherwise
reviewed by or discussed with Salomon Smith Barney. With respect to financial
forecasts and other information and data relating to MeriStar and Interstate
provided to or otherwise discussed with Salomon Smith Barney, the management
teams of MeriStar and Interstate advised Salomon Smith Barney that these
forecasts and other information and data, including adjustments to the forecasts
and other information and data relating to Interstate prepared by MeriStar's
management, were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of the management teams of MeriStar and
Interstate as to the future financial performance of MeriStar and Interstate and
the potential strategic implications and operational benefits anticipated to
result from the merger, including the amount, timing and achievability of those
strategic implications and operational benefits. Salomon Smith Barney assumed,
with MeriStar's consent, that the merger and related transactions would be
completed in accordance with their terms, without waiver, modification or
amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course
of obtaining the necessary regulatory or third party approvals and consents for
the merger and related transactions, no delay, limitation, restriction or
condition would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on MeriStar or
Interstate or the contemplated benefits of the merger. Salomon Smith Barney also
assumed, with MeriStar's consent, that the merger would be treated as a tax-free
reorganization for federal income tax purposes. In addition, representatives of
MeriStar advised Salomon Smith Barney, and Salomon Smith Barney therefore
further assumed, that the final terms of the merger agreement would not vary
materially from those reflected in the draft reviewed by Salomon Smith Barney.

     Salomon Smith Barney's opinion relates to the relative values of MeriStar
and Interstate. Salomon Smith Barney did not express any opinion as to what the
value of the MeriStar common stock actually will be when issued in connection
with the merger or the prices at which MeriStar's common stock will trade or
otherwise be transferable at any time. Salomon Smith Barney did not make and was
not provided with an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or
liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of MeriStar or Interstate and did not make
any physical inspection of the properties or assets of MeriStar or Interstate.

     Salomon Smith Barney expressed no view as to, and its opinion does not
address, the relative merits of the merger as compared to any alternative
business strategies that might exist for MeriStar or the effect of any other
transaction in which MeriStar might engage. Salomon Smith Barney's opinion was
necessarily based on information available, and financial, stock market and
other conditions and circumstances existing and disclosed, to Salomon Smith
Barney as of the date of its opinion. Although Salomon Smith Barney evaluated
the exchange ratio from a financial point of view, Salomon Smith Barney was not
asked to and did not recommend the specific consideration payable in the merger,
which was determined through negotiation between MeriStar and Interstate.
MeriStar imposed no other instructions or limitations on Salomon Smith Barney
with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by Salomon Smith
Barney in rendering its opinion.

     THE FULL TEXT OF SALOMON SMITH BARNEY'S WRITTEN OPINION DATED APRIL 30,
2002, WHICH DESCRIBES THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE, PROCEDURES FOLLOWED, MATTERS
CONSIDERED AND LIMITATIONS ON THE REVIEW UNDERTAKEN, IS ATTACHED TO THIS
DOCUMENT AS APPENDIX E AND IS INCORPORATED INTO THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT AND
PROSPECTUS BY REFERENCE. SALOMON SMITH BARNEY'S OPINION IS ADDRESSED TO THE
MERISTAR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND RELATES ONLY TO THE FAIRNESS, FROM A FINANCIAL
POINT OF VIEW, TO MERISTAR OF THE EXCHANGE RATIO, DOES NOT ADDRESS ANY OTHER
ASPECT OF THE MERGER AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION TO ANY STOCKHOLDER
WITH RESPECT TO ANY MATTERS RELATING TO THE PROPOSED MERGER.

     In preparing its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney performed a variety of
financial and comparative analyses, including those described below. The summary
of these analyses is not a complete description of the analyses underlying
Salomon Smith Barney's opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a
complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most
appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of
those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial
opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description. Accordingly, Salomon
Smith Barney believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that
selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on information
presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors, could
create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying its analyses
and opinion.

     In its analyses, Salomon Smith Barney considered industry performance,
general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters
existing as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond the control of
MeriStar and Interstate. No company, transaction or business used in those
analyses as a comparison is identical to MeriStar, Interstate or the proposed
merger, and an evaluation of those analyses is not entirely mathematical.
Rather, the analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning
financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the
acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies, business segments
or transactions analyzed.

     The estimates contained in Salomon Smith Barney's analyses and the
valuation ranges resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily
indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may
be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by its analyses. In
addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses or securities do not
necessarily purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which
businesses or securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, Salomon Smith
Barney's analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial
uncertainty.

     Salomon Smith Barney's opinion and analyses were only one of many factors
considered by the MeriStar board of directors in its evaluation of the merger
and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the MeriStar board of
directors or management with respect to the exchange ratio or the proposed
merger.

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by
Salomon Smith Barney in connection with the rendering of its opinion dated April
30, 2002. THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES SUMMARIZED BELOW INCLUDE INFORMATION PRESENTED
IN TABULAR FORMAT. IN ORDER TO FULLY UNDERSTAND SALOMON SMITH BARNEY'S FINANCIAL
ANALYSES, THE TABLES MUST BE READ TOGETHER WITH THE TEXT OF EACH SUMMARY. THE
TABLES ALONE DO NOT CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES.
CONSIDERING THE DATA BELOW WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE FULL NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF
THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES, INCLUDING THE METHODOLOGIES AND ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING
THE ANALYSES, COULD CREATE A MISLEADING OR INCOMPLETE VIEW OF SALOMON SMITH
BARNEY'S FINANCIAL ANALYSES.

     Selected companies analysis.  Using publicly available information, Salomon
Smith Barney reviewed the market values and trading multiples of MeriStar,
Interstate and the following five selected publicly held companies in the
lodging management and services and real estate management and services
industries:

     - Marriott International, Inc.;

     - Choice Hotels International, Inc.;

     - Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated;

     - Trammell Crow Company; and

     - ResortQuest International, Inc.

     All multiples were based on closing stock prices on April 26, 2002.
Estimated financial data for the selected companies were based on publicly
available research analysts' estimates. Estimated financial data for MeriStar
and Interstate were based on, in the case of MeriStar, internal estimates of
MeriStar's

management and, in the case of Interstate, internal estimates of Interstate's
management as adjusted by MeriStar's management. Salomon Smith Barney compared
enterprise values, calculated as equity value on a fully diluted basis, plus
debt, less cash and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, as a multiple of
fiscal year 2001 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
commonly referred to as EBITDA, and fiscal year 2002 estimated EBITDA. For
purposes of its analysis, Salomon Smith Barney excluded the multiples derived
from Marriott International, Inc. due to the size of its market capitalization
relative to the other selected companies. Salomon Smith Barney then applied a
range of selected multiples derived from the selected companies other than
Marriott International, Inc. to corresponding financial data of MeriStar and
Interstate in order to derive implied equity reference ranges for MeriStar and
Interstate. These implied equity reference ranges were then used to calculate an
implied exchange ratio range. This analysis indicated the following implied
exchange ratio range, as compared to the exchange ratio provided for in the
merger:

IMPLIED EXCHANGE RATIO                                     MERGER EXCHANGE RATIO
- ----------------------                                     ---------------------

4.38x -- 13.64x                                                    4.6x

     Discounted cash flow analysis.  Salomon Smith Barney performed separate
discounted cash flow analyses of MeriStar and Interstate in order to calculate
the estimated present value of the stand-alone, unlevered, after-tax free cash
flows that each company could generate over fiscal years 2002 through 2005.
Estimated financial data were based on, in the case of MeriStar, internal
estimates of MeriStar's management and, in the case of Interstate, internal
estimates of Interstate's management as adjusted by MeriStar's management.
Salomon Smith Barney calculated a range of estimated terminal values for
MeriStar and Interstate by applying to MeriStar's and Interstate's fiscal year
2005 estimated EBITDA a range of terminal EBITDA multiples of 8.5x to 9.5x in
the case of MeriStar and 7.5x to 8.5x in the case of Interstate. The present
value of the cash flows and terminal values were calculated using discount rates
ranging from 8.5% to 9.5%. This analysis indicated implied equity reference
ranges for MeriStar and Interstate, which were then used to calculate the
following implied exchange ratio range, as compared to the exchange ratio
provided for in the merger:

IMPLIED EXCHANGE RATIO                         MERGER EXCHANGE RATIO
- ----------------------                         ---------------------

3.79x -- 8.44x                                         4.6x

     Precedent transactions analysis.  Using publicly available information,
Salomon Smith Barney reviewed the implied transaction value multiples paid or
proposed to be paid in the following 11 selected transactions in the lodging
management and services, real estate management and services, and corporate
housing industries:

                           CORPORATE HOUSING INDUSTRY

              ACQUIROR                                 TARGET
              --------                                 ------

- - Marriott International, Inc.          - ExecuStay Corporation
- - Equity Residential Properties Trust   - Globe Business Resources, Inc.
- - MeriStar                              - BridgeStreet Accommodations, Inc.

     All multiples for the selected transactions were based on publicly
available financial information. Estimated financial data for Interstate were
based on internal estimates of Interstate's management as adjusted by MeriStar's
management. Salomon Smith Barney compared transaction values in the selected
transactions as a multiple of latest 12 months EBITDA and forward 12 months
estimated EBITDA. Salomon Smith Barney then applied a range of selected
multiples derived from the selected transactions to Interstate's latest 12
months EBITDA and forward 12 months estimated EBITDA. This analysis indicated
the following approximate implied per share equity reference range for
Interstate, as compared to the estimated implied per share value for Interstate
based on the exchange ratio provided for in the merger and the closing price of
MeriStar common stock on April 26, 2002:

IMPLIED PER SHARE EQUITY REFERENCE RANGE  PER SHARE VALUE IMPLIED BY MERGER EXCHANGE RATIO
- ----------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------

             $5.30-$6.25                                    $5.01

     Contribution analysis.  Salomon Smith Barney compared the relative
contributions of MeriStar and Interstate to the combined company's EBITDA for
fiscal year 2001 and estimated EBITDA for fiscal years 2002 and 2003. Estimated
financial data were based on, in the case of MeriStar, internal estimates of
MeriStar's management and, in the case of Interstate, internal estimates of
Interstate's management as adjusted by MeriStar's management. Salomon Smith
Barney then calculated an implied exchange ratio range, and pro forma equity
ownership percentage range for Interstate's stockholders in the combined
company, based on these percentage contributions. This analysis resulted in an
approximate implied exchange ratio range of 3.91x to 6.40x, as compared to the
exchange ratio provided for in the merger of 4.60x, and an implied pro forma
equity ownership range of Interstate's stockholders in the combined company of
approximately 57.7% to 69.0%, as compared to the implied pro forma equity
ownership for Interstate's stockholders based on the exchange ratio provided for
in the merger of approximately 62%.

     Pro forma merger analysis.  Salomon Smith Barney analyzed the potential pro
forma financial effect of the merger on MeriStar's estimated earnings per share,
commonly referred to as EPS, for fiscal years 2002 through 2005, after giving
effect to potential cost savings and other synergies anticipated by the
management teams of MeriStar and Interstate to result from the merger, related
transactions contemplated by the merger and potential income from a proposed
joint venture to acquire hotel assets. Estimated financial data were based on,
in the case of MeriStar, internal estimates of MeriStar's management and, in the
case of Interstate, internal estimates of Interstate's management as adjusted by
MeriStar's management. Based on the exchange ratio provided for in the merger,
this analysis indicated that the proposed merger could be accretive to
MeriStar's estimated EPS in fiscal years 2002 through 2005, after giving effect
to potential cost savings and other synergies anticipated to result from the
merger, related transactions contemplated by the merger and potential income
from a proposed joint venture to acquire hotel assets. The actual results
achieved by the combined company may vary from projected results and the
variations may be material.

     Other factors.  In rendering its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney also
reviewed and considered other factors, including:

     - the relationship between movements in Interstate Class A common stock and
       movements in the common stock of selected companies in the lodging
       management and services and real estate management and services
       industries; and

     - a profile of Interstate's stockholder base.

     Miscellaneous.  Under the terms of its engagement, MeriStar has agreed to
pay Salomon Smith Barney an aggregate fee of $750,000 for its financial advisory
services in connection with the merger. MeriStar also has agreed to reimburse
Salomon Smith Barney for reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by
Salomon Smith Barney in performing its services, including reasonable fees and
expenses of its legal counsel, and to indemnify Salomon Smith Barney and related
persons against liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities
laws, arising out of its engagement.

     In the ordinary course of business, Salomon Smith Barney and its affiliates
may actively trade or hold the securities of MeriStar and Interstate for their
own account or for the account of customers and, accordingly, may at any time
hold a long or short position in those securities. Salomon Smith Barney and its
affiliates in the past have provided services to MeriStar and its affiliates and
Interstate, and currently are providing services to affiliates of MeriStar,
unrelated to the proposed merger, for which services Salomon Smith Barney and
its affiliates have received and will receive compensation. In addition, Salomon
Smith Barney and its affiliates, including Citigroup Inc. and its affiliates,
may maintain relationships with MeriStar, Interstate and their respective
affiliates.

     MeriStar selected Salomon Smith Barney as its exclusive financial advisor
based on Salomon Smith Barney's reputation, experience and familiarity with
MeriStar and its business. Salomon Smith Barney is an internationally recognized
investment banking firm which regularly engages in the valuation of businesses
and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated
underwritings, competitive bids, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted
securities, private placements and valuations for estate, corporate and other
purposes.

OPINION OF THE FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO INTERSTATE

     Under an engagement letter dated April 11, 2002, as supplemented and
amended on April 29, 2002, Interstate engaged Merrill Lynch to act as its
financial advisor in connection with the proposed merger. In connection with
this engagement, Interstate requested that Merrill Lynch evaluate the fairness,
from a financial point of view, to the holders of Interstate common stock, other
than Interstate's principal investor group, of the exchange ratio in the merger
and, whether or not the merger is completed, of the $9.25 million conversion
incentive payment that is payable to Interstate's principal investor group. On
May 1, 2002, on a conference call with the Interstate Board of Directors held to
consider the proposed transaction, Merrill Lynch rendered an oral opinion, which
opinion was confirmed by delivery to the Interstate board of a written opinion
dated May 1, 2002, that was subsequently revised to make non-substantive
clarifying changes, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject
to the matters described in its opinion, the exchange ratio in the merger and,
whether or not the merger is completed, the $9.25 million conversion incentive
payment that is payable to Interstate's principal investor group was fair, from
a financial point of view, to holders of Interstate common stock other than
Interstate's principal investor group.

     The full text of Merrill Lynch's written opinion dated May 1, 2002, which
describes the assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the review
undertaken, is attached to this joint proxy statement and prospectus as Appendix
F. Merrill Lynch's opinion is addressed to Interstate's board and relates only
to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio in the
merger and, whether or not the merger is completed, the $9.25 million conversion
incentive payment to Interstate's principal investor group. The opinion does not
address any other aspect of the proposed transaction or any related transaction
and does not constitute a recommendation to any holder of Interstate common
stock as to whether such stockholder should vote or act with respect to any
matters relating to the transaction.

     THE SUMMARY OF THE MATERIAL TERMS OF MERRILL LYNCH'S OPINION DESCRIBED
BELOW IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL TEXT OF THE OPINION
ATTACHED TO THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT AND PROSPECTUS AS APPENDIX F. YOU ARE
ENCOURAGED TO READ THE OPINION CAREFULLY IN ITS ENTIRETY.

     In arriving at its opinion, Merrill Lynch:

     - Reviewed publicly available business and financial information relating
       to Interstate and MeriStar that Merrill Lynch deemed to be relevant.

     - Reviewed information, including financial forecasts, relating to the
       business, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of
       Interstate and MeriStar, as well as the amount and timing of the cost
       savings and related expenses and synergies expected to result from the
       merger as furnished by Interstate and MeriStar.

     - Conducted discussions with members of senior management of Interstate and
       MeriStar concerning the matters described in the previous two bullet
       paragraphs, as well as their respective businesses and prospects before
       and after giving effect to the proposed transaction and the cost savings
       and related expenses and synergies expected to result from the merger.

     - Reviewed the market prices and valuation multiples for Interstate common
       stock and MeriStar common stock and compared them with those of publicly
       traded companies that Merrill Lynch deemed to be relevant.

     - Reviewed the results of operations of Interstate and MeriStar and
       compared them with those of publicly traded companies that Merrill Lynch
       deemed to be relevant.

     - Compared the proposed financial terms of the transaction with the
       financial terms of other transactions that Merrill Lynch deemed to be
       relevant.

     - Participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of
       Interstate and MeriStar and their financial and legal advisors.

     - Reviewed the potential pro forma impact of the merger.

     - Reviewed drafts, dated April 29, 2002, of the merger agreement, the
       Interstate voting and conversion agreement, the MeriStar voting agreement
       and the conversion incentive agreement.

     In preparing its opinion, Merrill Lynch has assumed and relied on the
accuracy and completeness of all information supplied or otherwise made
available to it, discussed with or reviewed by or for it, or publicly available,
and did not assume any responsibility for independently verifying such
information or undertaking an independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the
assets or liabilities of Interstate or MeriStar. In addition, Merrill Lynch was
not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal and has not assumed any
obligation to conduct any physical inspection of the properties or facilities of
Interstate or MeriStar. With respect to the financial forecast information and
the cost savings and related expenses and synergies information furnished to or
discussed with Merrill Lynch by Interstate or MeriStar, Merrill Lynch assumed
that they were reasonably prepared and reflected the best currently available
estimates and judgment of Interstate's or MeriStar's management as to the
expected future financial performance of Interstate or MeriStar, as the case may
be, and the cost savings and related expenses and synergies expected to result
from the merger. Merrill Lynch also assumed that the final form of the
transaction agreements would be substantially similar to the last drafts
reviewed by it.

     Merrill Lynch's opinion was necessarily based upon market, economic and
other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on, and on the
information made available to Merrill Lynch as of, the date of the Merrill Lynch
opinion. In rendering its opinion, Merrill Lynch assumed that in the course of
obtaining the necessary regulatory or other consents or approvals, contractual
or otherwise, for the transaction no restrictions, including any divestiture
requirements or amendments or modifications, would be imposed that would have a
material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits of the transaction. Merrill
Lynch further assumed that the merger would qualify as a tax-free reorganization
under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended.

     The summary below is not a complete description of Merrill Lynch's opinion
to Interstate's board or the financial analyses performed and factors considered
by Merrill Lynch in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a fairness
opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to

the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the
application of those methods to the particular circumstances, and, therefore, a
fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description. Merrill
Lynch believes that its analyses and this summary must be considered as a whole
and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on
information presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and
factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading
or incomplete view of the processes underlying Merrill Lynch's analyses and
opinion.

     In performing its analyses, Merrill Lynch considered industry performance,
general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters
existing as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond the control of
Interstate and MeriStar. No company, business or acquisition transaction used in
the analyses as a comparison is identical to Interstate or MeriStar or the
proposed transaction, and an evaluation of the results of those analyses is not
entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses involve complex considerations and
judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors
that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the
companies or business segments analyzed.

     The estimates contained in Merrill Lynch's analysis and the ranges of
valuations resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative
of actual values or future results, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those suggested by its analyses. In addition, analyses relating
to the value of businesses or securities do not necessarily purport to be
appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually
may be sold. Accordingly, Merrill Lynch's analyses and estimates are inherently
subject to substantial uncertainty.

     The type and amount of consideration payable in the proposed transaction
was determined through negotiation between Interstate and MeriStar, and the
decision to enter into the proposed transaction was solely that of Interstate's
board. Merrill Lynch's opinion and financial analyses were only one of many
factors considered by Interstate's board in its evaluation of the proposed
transaction and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of
Interstate's board or Interstate's management with respect to the proposed
transaction or the consideration to be received by the holders of Interstate
common stock in the merger.

     Each of the analyses conducted by Merrill Lynch was carried out to provide
a different perspective on the proposed transaction. Merrill Lynch did not form
a conclusion as to whether any individual analysis, considered in isolation,
supported or failed to support its opinion. Merrill Lynch did not place any
specific reliance or weight on any individual analysis, but instead concluded
that its analyses, taken as a whole, supported its determination.

     Selected companies analysis.  Merrill Lynch reviewed and compared
financial, operating and stock market information related to Interstate with the
following publicly held companies in the hotel management/ franchise industry:

     - MeriStar,

     - Marriott International, Inc.,

     - Four Seasons Hotels, and

     - Choice Hotels International, Inc.

     Merrill Lynch analyzed enterprise values, calculated as equity value, plus
debt, less cash, as a multiple of estimated calendar year 2002 and 2003 earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or "EBITDA", for each of
these comparable companies and Interstate. All multiples were based on closing
stock prices on April 29, 2002. The estimated financial data for these
comparable companies was based on publicly available research analysts'
estimates. The estimated financial data for Interstate was based on

information received from the senior management of Interstate. This analysis
indicated the following multiples:

                                                              MEAN   MEDIAN   INTERSTATE
                                                              ----   ------   ----------

Enterprise value as a multiple of 2002 EBITDA:..............  17.0x    13.9x     2.4x
Enterprise value as a multiple of 2003 EBITDA:..............  14.6     12.3      2.5

     Based on a multiple range of 4.0x to 6.0x calendar year 2002 EBITDA, the
analysis implied an equity value range for the Interstate common stock of
between $4.40 and $5.90 per share. This compares to the equity value of the
Interstate common stock implied by the merger of $5.20 per share, based on
MeriStar's common stock price of $1.13 per share on April 29, 2002 and the
exchange ratio in the merger.

     Merrill Lynch also reviewed and compared financial, operating and stock
market information related to MeriStar with the same group of publicly held
companies in the hotel management franchise industry, but substituting
Interstate for MeriStar as a comparable company. Merrill Lynch analyzed
enterprise values as a multiple of estimated calendar year 2002 and 2003 EBITDA
for each of these comparable companies and MeriStar. All multiples were based on
closing stock prices on April 29, 2002. Estimated financial data for these
comparable companies and MeriStar was based on publicly available research
analysts' estimates except for estimated financial data for Interstate, which
was based on information received from the senior management of Interstate. This
analysis indicated the following multiples:

                                                              MEAN   MEDIAN   MERISTAR
                                                              ----   ------   --------

Enterprise value as a multiple of 2002 EBITDA:..............  15.5x   13.9x     8.4x
Enterprise value as a multiple of 2003 EBITDA:..............  13.2    12.3      7.8

     Based on a multiple range of 7.0x to 9.0x calendar year 2002 EBITDA, the
analysis implied an equity value range for MeriStar's common stock of between
$0.40 and $1.50 per share. This compares to the closing price of a share of
MeriStar common stock on April 29, 2002 of $1.13.

     Comparable mergers and acquisitions analysis.  Using publicly available
information, Merrill Lynch reviewed and compared the purchase prices, including
net debt, and implied transaction value multiples paid in the following four
selected merger and acquisition transactions in the hotel management/franchise
industry with the proposed merger:

ACQUIROR                                                     TARGET
- --------                                                     ------

Crestline Capital Corporation     Stormont Trice Management Corporation/Durbin Companies
Bass PLC                          Bristol Hotels & Resorts
American Skiing Company           MeriStar Hotels & Resorts, Inc.
Barcelo Hotels & Resorts          Crestline Capital Corporation

     Merrill Lynch compared the transaction values implied by the purchase
prices in these selected merger and acquisition transactions as multiples of
trailing and forward EBITDA. For each transaction, trailing EBITDA was based on
publicly available financial information for the four quarters preceding the
transaction announcement date, and forward EBITDA was based on publicly
available research analysts estimates for the four quarters after the
transaction announcement date. The analysis indicated the following multiples:

                                                              HIGH   LOW   MEAN   MEDIAN
                                                              ----   ---   ----   ------

Transaction value as a multiple of trailing EBITDA..........  10.7x  4.5x  8.4x     10.1x
Transaction value as a multiple of forward EBITDA...........  8.5    4.5   6.9       7.8

     Merrill Lynch believed that the transaction most comparable to the
Interstate/MeriStar transaction was the acquisition of Stormont Trice Management
Corporation/Durbin Companies by Crestline Capital Corporation, which had implied
trailing and forward EBITDA multiples of 4.5x. Based on the range of multiples
for Interstate's 2002 EBITDA of 4.0x to 6.0x, this analysis implied an equity
value range for the Interstate common stock of between $4.40 and $5.90 per
share. This compares to the equity value of the

Interstate common stock implied by the merger of $5.20 per share, based on
MeriStar's common stock price of $1.13 per share on April 29, 2002, and the
exchange ratio in the merger.

     Merrill Lynch also reviewed this information as it applied to MeriStar.
Based on the range of multiples for MeriStar's 2002 EBITDA of 7.0x to 9.0x, this
analysis indicated an equity value range for MeriStar's common stock of between
$0.40 and $1.50 per share. This compares to the closing price of a share of
MeriStar common stock on April 29, 2002 of $1.13.

     Discounted cash flow analysis.  Merrill Lynch performed a discounted cash
flow analysis on the projected financial information of Interstate for the
calendar years 2002 through 2006. This analysis was based upon operating and
financial assumptions that were provided by the senior management of Interstate.
To estimate the residual value of Interstate at the end of the forecast period,
or "terminal value", Merrill Lynch applied a multiple of 4.0x to 6.0x to
Interstate's projected 2006 EBITDA. Merrill Lynch used discount rates ranging
from 11% to 13%. Based on the discounted cash flow analysis, Merrill Lynch
calculated that the implied equity value per Interstate share ranged from $4.60
to $5.60. This compares to the equity value of the Interstate common stock
implied by the merger of $5.20 per share, based on MeriStar's price of $1.13 per
share of common stock on April 29, 2002 and the exchange ratio in the merger.

     Merrill Lynch also performed a discounted cash flow analysis on the
projected financial information of MeriStar for the calendar years 2002 through
2006. This analysis was based upon operating and financial assumptions that were
provided by the senior management of MeriStar. To estimate the terminal value of
MeriStar, Merrill Lynch applied a multiple of 7.0x to 9.0x to MeriStar's
projected 2006 EBITDA. Merrill Lynch used discount rates ranging from 11% to
13%. Based on the discounted cash flow analysis, Merrill Lynch calculated that
the implied equity value per MeriStar share ranged from $0.80 to $1.90. This
compares to the closing price of a share of MeriStar common stock on April 29,
2002 of $1.13.

     Pro forma EPS accretion/(dilution) analysis.  Merrill Lynch reviewed and
analyzed the potential pro forma effect of the merger on the future earnings per
share, or EPS, of MeriStar and the implied effect on Interstate stockholders
based on the exchange ratio in the merger of 4.6x. For purposes of this
analysis, Merrill Lynch analyzed information from 2002 through 2004 based upon
management estimates for the future financial performance of Interstate and
MeriStar as well as the pro forma cost savings and related expenses and
synergies expected to result from the merger as furnished by the senior
managements of Interstate and MeriStar. Based on information received from the
senior management of Interstate and MeriStar, Merrill Lynch assumed pre-tax
synergies of $5 million in 2002 and $10 million annually after 2002. The merger
was assumed to have closed on June 30, 2002, and 2002 results are pro-forma for
the whole year. This analysis resulted in the following impact on the future
earnings per share to current Interstate and MeriStar stockholders:

                       PRO FORMA EPS ACCRETION/(DILUTION)

YEAR                                         TO INTERSTATE STOCKHOLDERS   TO MERISTAR STOCKHOLDERS
- ----                                         --------------------------   ------------------------

2002E.....................................             $0.58                       $(0.01)
2003E.....................................              0.41                         0.03
2004E.....................................              0.15                         0.03

     The financial forecasts that underlie this analysis are subject to
substantial uncertainty, and accordingly, actual results may be substantially
different.

     Historical Stock Price and Exchange Ratios.  Merrill Lynch compared the
ratio of the Interstate Class A common stock closing prices to the MeriStar
share closing prices and the exchange ratio of 4.6 shares of combined company
common stock for each share of Interstate common stock in the merger, for time
periods ranging from June 18, 1999, the date of Interstate's spin-off, to April
29, 2002. Merrill

Lynch then calculated the resulting premium to the market exchange ratio that
the exchange ratio of 4.6 in the merger represented. The following table
summarizes the results of this analysis:

                                                          AVERAGE MARKET   MERGER EXCHANGE
                                                          EXCHANGE RATIO    RATIO PREMIUM
                                                          --------------   ---------------

As of April 29, 2002....................................      2.212x            108.0%
One week ended April 29, 2002...........................      2.256             103.9%
One month ended April 29, 2002..........................      2.595              77.3%
Six months ended April 29, 2002.........................      2.414              90.6%
One year ended April 29, 2002...........................      2.029             126.7%
Two years ended April 29, 2002..........................      1.484             210.0%
Since June 18, 1999.....................................      1.370             235.8%

     Merrill Lynch also reviewed the trading history of the Interstate Class A
common stock and the MeriStar common stock for the 52-week period ending April
29, 2002 and observed that the low and high closing share prices during that
period for the Interstate Class A common stock were $1.31 and $3.00,
respectively, and the low and high closing share prices during that period for
the MeriStar shares were $0.54 and $2.14, respectively.

     EBITDA contribution analysis.  Merrill Lynch analyzed the implied exchange
ratio resulting from a debt-adjusted EBITDA contribution in fiscal years 2001,
2002 and 2003 of Interstate and MeriStar. For the purposes of the analysis,
Interstate was valued based on multiples of its projected EBITDA of from 4.0x to
6.0x, and MeriStar was valued based on its EBITDA multiples on April 29, 2002.
The analysis resulted in an implied exchange ratio range of 3.262x to 4.616x.
This compares to the exchange ratio in the merger of 4.6 shares of combined
company common stock for each share of Interstate common stock.

     Investor group conversion and incentive payment.  Merrill Lynch reviewed
and analyzed the theoretical current valuation of the Interstate securities held
by the Interstate principal investor group and compared that valuation to the
value received by the Interstate principal investor group following conversion
of their securities and receipt of the $9.25 million conversion incentive
payment. For the purpose of valuing the Interstate principal investor group
securities Merrill Lynch examined the "bond component" and the underlying option
value of the securities. In valuing the bond component, Merrill Lynch used
discounted cash flows for future coupon and preferred dividend payments with a
discount rate range of 9.6% to 11.6%, which was derived from a spread range of
5.0% to 7.0% over the August 15, 2007 Treasury securities yield of 4.6%. In
valuing the option component, Merrill Lynch used a Black-Scholes model with a
volatility range of 60% to 80%, based on MeriStar's historical volatility, and
assumed MeriStar's share price of $1.13 as of April 29, 2002 and 34.5 million
shares of combined company common stock underlying the Interstate convertible
securities held by the principal investor group, assuming conversion of the
Interstate convertible securities into Interstate common stock and the exchange
in the merger of those Interstate shares of common stock for shares of combined
company common stock. The following table summarizes the results of this
analysis:

    VALUE OF THE BOND     VALUE OF THE OPTION
        COMPONENT              COMPONENT         TOTAL THEORETICAL VALUE
    -----------------    ---------------------   -----------------------

  $26.5-$28.9 million      $24.9-$28.7 million      $51.4-$57.6 million

     The following table summarizes the economic value of the conversion
incentive payment and the combined company securities received by the Interstate
principal investor group after the conversion of the Interstate securities held
by that group into Interstate common stock and the exchange of those shares of
common stock for shares of combined company common stock in the merger:

                              VALUE OF THE COMBINED
  VALUE OF THE CONVERSION    COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK
     INCENTIVE PAYMENT      RECEIVED AFTER CONVERSION    TOTAL VALUE
  -----------------------   -------------------------   -------------

       $9.2 million               $39.0 million         $48.2 million

     Based on its analysis, Merrill Lynch determined that the Interstate
principal investor group received 6% to 16% less than the current theoretical
value of their securities.

     Merrill Lynch also analyzed the economic value to the Interstate principal
investor group assuming conversion of their securities into Interstate Class A
common stock and receipt of the conversion incentive payment, but assuming that
the merger is not completed. The current theoretical value was based on the bond
component and the underlying option value of the securities. To value the bond
component, Merrill Lynch used discounted cash flow for future coupon and
preferred dividend payments with a discount rate range of 9.6% to 11.6%, which
was derived from a spread range of 5.0% to 7.0% over the August 15, 2007
Treasury securities yield of 4.6%. To value the option component, Merrill Lynch
used a Black-Scholes model with a volatility range of 50% to 70%, based on
Interstate's historical volatility, and Interstate's share price of $2.50 as of
April 29, 2002. The conversion incentive payment was valued at $9.25 million and
the shares owned by the Interstate principal investor group following the
conversion of their securities into Interstate Class A common stock were valued
assuming 7.5 million underlying shares of Interstate common stock and a price
range of $2.50 to $5.00. The following table illustrates the potential economic
value to the Interstate principal investor group:

     INTERSTATE
    COMMON STOCK     CURRENT THEORETICAL   PRO FORMA VALUE     PREMIUM/
       PRICE          VALUE (MILLIONS)       (MILLIONS)       (DISCOUNT)
    ------------     -------------------   ---------------   -------------

       $2.50            $33.7 - $39.0           $28.0        (17)% - (28)%
        3.00             33.7 -  39.0            31.8         (6)% - (19)%

        4.50             33.7 -  39.0            43.0         28 % -  10 %
        5.00             33.7 -  39.0            46.8         39 % -  20 %

     Miscellaneous.  Interstate selected Merrill Lynch as its financial advisor
in connection with the proposed transaction based on Merrill Lynch's reputation,
expertise and familiarity with Interstate and its business. Merrill Lynch is an
internationally recognized investment banking firm and, as part of its
investment banking business, is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses
and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, private
placements and related financing, bankruptcy reorganizations and similar
recapitalizations, negotiated underwriting, secondary distributions of listed
and unlisted securities, and valuations for corporate and other purposes.

     Under an engagement letter dated April 11, 2002, as supplemented and
amended on April 29, 2002, Merrill Lynch was retained to provide financial
advisory services in connection with the Shaner Hotel Group tender offer and the
proposed merger with MeriStar and to provide an opinion as to the fairness of
the proposed merger. The terms of this engagement include payment to Merrill
Lynch of fees totaling $1,100,000 for services rendered in connection with the
Shaner Hotel Group tender offer and the proposed merger. Interstate has also
agreed to reimburse Merrill Lynch for its expenses incurred in performing its
services. In addition, Interstate has agreed to indemnify Merrill Lynch and its
affiliates, controlling persons, officers, agents and employees against selected
liabilities and expenses, related to or arising out of Merrill Lynch's
engagements and any related transactions.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER

     General.  In considering the recommendations of the respective boards of
directors and managers of MeriStar and Interstate, you should be aware that
members of the boards and management of each of MeriStar and Interstate may have
interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, your
interests as a stockholder resulting in potential conflicts of interest. The
boards of each company recognized these interests and determined that these
interests neither supported nor detracted from the fairness of the merger to
you.

     Interests of MeriStar's directors, officers and significant
stockholders.  Some of MeriStar's officers and directors and significant
stockholders have interests in the merger that are different from, or in
addition to, your interests generally and that may create a potential conflict
of interest.

     In connection with the merger, some of MeriStar's senior management will
become senior management of the combined company. Mr. Paul W. Whetsell, the
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of MeriStar, will become the Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer of the combined company and Mr. John Emery, the
President and Chief Operating Officer of MeriStar, will become the President and
Chief Operating Officer of the combined company. Mr. Robert Morse, the
President -- Hotels & Resorts of MeriStar, will become President -- Hotel
Operations of the combined company. Mr. James A. Calder, the Chief Financial
Officer of MeriStar, Bruce G. Wiles, the Chief Investment Officer of MeriStar
and Mr. Thomas Vincent, President -- BridgeStreet of MeriStar, will each have
the same positions at the combined company. Mr. Steven D. Jorns, a director and
Vice-Chairman of MeriStar, will be a director of the combined company. In
addition, Ms. Leslie R. Doggett and Messrs. J. Taylor Crandall and James B.
McCurry, who are directors of MeriStar, will be directors of the combined
company.

     MeriStar has entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Whetsell,
Emery, Jorns, Morse and Calder which entitle each to payments and other benefits
in the event his employment terminates under specified circumstances.

     Under Mr. Whetsell's November 1, 2001 employment agreement, if he is
terminated by MeriStar without cause or other than by reason of death or
disability, or if he voluntarily terminates his employment with good reason, in
each case, within 24 months following a change in control of MeriStar, he will
receive a lump sum payment equal to the sum of his then annual base salary and
his bonus for the preceding year times the greater of:

     - a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days remaining in the
       original term of the employment agreement and the denominator of which is
       365 and

     - 3.5.

     In addition, under those circumstances, all of his unvested stock options
and restricted stock awards will immediately vest, and these options, along with
his previously vested and unexercised options, will be exercisable for one year.
In addition, his health insurance benefits under his employment agreement will
continue for a period equal to the greater of two and a half years or the
remaining term of his employment agreement, without further extension, provided,
however, that those continued health insurance benefits cease at the time he
obtains health coverage from another employer. In the event any payment, benefit
or compensation to Mr. Whetsell or any accelerated vesting of his rights with
respect to stock options or restricted stock, results in the imposition of an
excise tax payable by him under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, or
any successor or other provision with respect to "excess parachute payments"
within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, MeriStar
will make a cash payment to Mr. Whetsell in the amount of that excise tax and
must also make a cash payment to Mr. Whetsell in an amount equal to the total of
federal, state and local income and excise taxes for which he may be liable on
account of that excise tax. The merger will be a change in control of MeriStar
under Mr. Whetsell's employment agreement.

     Under Mr. Emery's April 1, 2000 employment agreement, as amended as of
November 1, 2000 if he is terminated by MeriStar without cause or other than by
reason of death or disability, or if he voluntarily terminates his employment
with good reason, in each case, within 24 months following a change in control
of MeriStar, he will receive a lump sum payment equal to the sum of his then
annual base salary and his bonus for the preceding year times the greater of:

     - a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days remaining in the
       original term of the employment agreement and the denominator of which is
       365 and

     - 3.0.

     In addition, under those circumstances, all of his unvested stock options
and restricted stock awards will immediately vest, and these options, along with
his previously vested and unexercised options, will be exercisable for one year,
and his health insurance benefits under his employment agreement will continue
for a period equal to the greater of two years or the remaining term of his
employment agreement, without further extension; provided, however, that those
continued health insurance benefits cease on the date on which Mr. Emery obtains
health insurance from a subsequent employer. In the event any payment, benefit
or compensation to Mr. Emery, or any accelerated vesting of his rights with
respect to stock options or restricted stock, results in the imposition of an
excise tax payable by him under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, or
any successor or other provision with respect to "excess parachute payments"
within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, MeriStar
will make a cash payment to Mr. Emery in the amount of that excise tax and must
also make a cash payment to Mr. Emery in an amount equal to the total of
federal, state and local income and excise taxes for which he may be liable on
account of that excise tax. The merger will be a change in control of MeriStar
under Mr. Emery's employment agreement.

     Under Mr. Jorns' August 3, 1998 employment agreement, which was amended by
a letter agreement dated December 10, 1998, if he is terminated by MeriStar
without cause or other than by reason of death or disability, or if he
voluntarily terminates his employment with good reason, in each case, within 24
months following a change in control of MeriStar, he will receive a lump sum
payment equal to the sum of his then annual base salary and his bonus for the
preceding year times the greater of:

     - a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days remaining in the
       original term of the employment agreement and the denominator of which is
       365 and

     - 3.0.

     In addition, under those circumstances, all of his unvested stock options
and restricted stock awards will immediately vest and, along with his previously
vested and unexercised options, be exercisable for one year, and his health
insurance, life insurance and disability insurance benefits under his employment
agreement will continue for a period equal to the greater of two years or the
remaining term of his agreement without extension. The merger will be a change
in control of MeriStar under Mr. Jorns' employment agreement.

     Under Mr. Morse's November 1, 2001 employment agreement, if he is
terminated by MeriStar without cause or other than by reason of death or
disability, or if he voluntarily terminates his employment with good reason, in
each case, within 18 months following a change in control of MeriStar, he will
receive a lump sum payment equal to two times the sum of his then annual base
salary and his bonus for the preceding year. In addition, under those
circumstances, all of his unvested stock options will immediately vest and these
options, along with his previously vested and unexercised options, will be
exercisable for one year, and his health insurance benefits under his employment
agreement will continue for a period equal to the earlier of one year from the
end of the term of the agreement or the date on which Mr. Morse obtains health
insurance from a subsequent employer. In the event any payment, benefit or
compensation to Mr. Morse, or any accelerated vesting of his rights with respect
to stock options or restricted stock, would result in Mr. Morse receiving
"parachute payments" under Section 280G and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, a
"contingent cut back" provision in the agreement would be applicable. Under this
provision, cash payments and other benefits, such as health insurance benefits
and the acceleration of vesting, would be cut back to a level such that none of
the payments and benefits provided to Mr. Morse would constitute "excess
parachute payments" and, therefore, MeriStar would be entitled to take a
deduction for the amount of those payments and benefits and Mr. Morse would not
be subject to the 20% excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, unless the
cut-back would result in Mr. Morse receiving an amount less than he would have
received if the payments and benefits had not been cut back and he had been
subject to the 20% excise tax. The merger will be a change in control of
MeriStar under Mr. Morse's employment agreement.

     Under Mr. Calder's August 3, 1998 employment agreement, if he is terminated
by MeriStar without cause or other than by reason of death or disability, or if
he voluntarily terminates his employment with

good reason, in each case, within 18 months following a change in control of
MeriStar, he will receive a lump sum payment equal to two times the sum of his
then annual base salary and his bonus for the preceding year. In addition, under
those circumstances, all of his unvested stock options and restricted stock will
immediately vest and, along with his previously vested and unexercised options,
be exercisable for one year and shares of restricted stock previously granted to
Mr. Calder will become free of all contractual restrictions. Mr. Calder will
also be entitled to health insurance benefit continuation for a period equal to
the earlier of one year from the end of the term of the agreement and the date
on which Mr. Calder obtains health insurance from a subsequent employer. Mr.
Calder's agreement contains a "contingent cut-back" provision similar to the one
contained in Mr. Morse's agreement. The merger will be a change in control of
MeriStar under Mr. Calder's employment agreement.

     Mr. Vincent's employment contract does not contain change of control
provisions.

     As of the record date, approximately 4.8 million shares of MeriStar common
stock were subject to options granted to executive officers and directors under
MeriStar's incentive plan. Under the terms of MeriStar's incentive plan, the
approval of the merger by the MeriStar board of directors caused all of the
options issued under that plan to vest.

     None of the directors or officers of MeriStar beneficially owns more than
1.0% of the outstanding common stock of MeriStar except for Messrs. Crandall
(3.4%), Jorns (3.6%) and Whetsell (2.3%). All percentages are as of April 30,
2002. As of April 30, 2002, the directors and executive officers of MeriStar
beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately 10.7% of the total outstanding
shares of MeriStar voting stock.

     Interests of Interstate's directors, officers and significant
stockholders.  Some of Interstate's officers and directors and significant
stockholders have interests in the merger that are different from, or in
addition to, your interests generally and that may create a potential conflict
of interest.

     Mr. Kevin P. Kilkeary, President and Chief Operating Officer of Interstate,
will become President -- Hotel Operations of the combined company. Mr. Thomas F.
Hewitt, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Interstate, will be
a director of the combined company.

     On April 30, 2002, Mr. Kilkeary entered into an amended and restated
employment agreement with Interstate, which will become effective upon the
closing of the merger. The terms of this amended and restated employment
agreement are substantially similar to the terms of Mr. Kilkeary's employment
agreement, dated August 31, 2000, with the exception of the following:

     - Mr. Kilkeary's title will be President--Hotel Operations of the combined
       company.

     - Mr. Kilkeary will be employed for a three-year term beginning on the
       closing date of the merger, with automatic one-year extensions beginning
       on the one and one-half year anniversary of the closing date of the
       merger, unless either party gives 90 days' prior written notice. Mr.
       Kilkeary's current employment agreement has a term ending on October 20,
       2002, with annual extensions after that, subject to each party's right
       not to extend upon 90 days' written notice.

     - Mr. Kilkeary will receive an annual base salary of $325,000 per year,
       subject to increase by the board of directors, compared to $300,000 under
       his current employment agreement.

     - Mr. Kilkeary will be eligible for a performance bonus of between 87.5%
       and 175% of his base salary. Mr. Kilkeary's current employment agreement
       has no minimum bonus amount.

     - If Mr. Kilkeary's employment is terminated by Mr. Kilkeary for good
       reason or by the combined company for any reason other than cause, death
       or disability, he will be entitled to receive:

        - the greater of his salary and bonus for the year preceding his
          termination or his salary and a bonus equal to the greater of 87% of
          Mr. Kilkeary's base pay or the highest bonus received during the term
          of the employment agreement, compared to his current employment
          agreement, which entitles him to receive the greater of his salary and
          bonus for the year

preceding his termination or his salary and a bonus equal to the highest bonus
received during the term of the employment agreement; and

        - the continuation of health and welfare benefits for one year following
          termination of employment.

     None of the directors or officers of Interstate holds more than 1.0% of the
outstanding common stock of Interstate, except for Messrs. Hewitt (3.6%),
Richardson (2.8%) and Kilkeary (1.4%). In addition Mr. Alibhai personally owns
30,000 shares of Interstate's Class A common stock, and Mr. Weiser personally
owns 22,642 shares of Interstate's Class A common stock, each of which is less
than 1.0% but, because of their respective interests in the Interstate principal
investor group, they are each deemed to beneficially own 49.0% of Interstate's
outstanding common stock. As of the record date for the Interstate stockholder
meeting, the directors and executive officers of Interstate beneficially owned
an aggregate of approximately 57.0% of the total outstanding shares of
Interstate common stock.

     Subject to the completion of the merger, the Interstate principal investor
group has agreed to pay, on the date which is 180 days from the effective time
of the merger, Messrs. Hewitt and Kilkeary $286,822 and $143,411, respectively,
in either cash or registered, unrestricted stock of the combined company or a
combination of cash and stock, at the Interstate principal investor group's
election in connection with their conversion of their shares of Interstate
Series B preferred stock into shares of Interstate Class A common stock.

     As described in Interstate's proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on September 15, 2000, Interstate formed a
joint venture with affiliates of the Interstate principal investor group for the
purpose of acquiring hotel properties to be managed by Interstate. Under the
terms of their respective employment agreements, Messrs. Hewitt and Richardson
were granted limited partnership interests in this joint venture of 3% and
2.25%, respectively. Mr. Hewitt's interest was structured to entitle him to
receive a preferential distribution of $1 million of capital proceeds and to
participate in 3.0% of residual cash flows from the joint venture. Mr.
Richardson's interest was structured to entitle him to receive a preferential
distribution of $750,000 of capital proceeds and to participate in 2.25% of
residual cash flows. Subject to the completion of the merger, the combined
company will, if requested by Mr. Hewitt at any time following the two year
anniversary of the effective time of the merger, negotiate in good faith the
purchase and/or redemption of Mr. Hewitt's interest in the joint venture at a
price to be mutually agreed by the parties at the time of Mr. Hewitt's request.

     Subject to the completion of the merger, Mr. Richardson will receive
payments totaling $950,000 in connection with the purchase and/or redemption of
his interest in the joint venture described above, the conversion of his shares
of Interstate Series B preferred stock into shares of Interstate Class A common
stock, a bonus and a consulting arrangement, under which he will provide
consulting services to the combined company regarding the operations of
Interstate's insurance business. Of these payments, $483,000 will be made by
Interstate's principal investor group at its election in either cash,
registered, unrestricted stock of the combined company or a combination of both,
and $467,000 will be made in cash by the combined company.

     The combined company has agreed, from and after the effective time of the
merger, to indemnify the present and former directors and officers of Interstate
and has agreed to maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance for
these individuals in place for six years following completion of the merger.

     On February 12, 2002, Interstate entered into an amended and restated
employment agreement with Mr. Hewitt. Under the terms of this agreement, Mr.
Hewitt is entitled to the following payments upon his termination:

     - Mr. Hewitt was previously granted 181,907 restricted shares of
       Interstate's Class A common stock. All previously unvested shares vested
       on October 20, 2000, in exchange for his waiver of stock option rights
       and severance payments owed to him by Interstate under a previous
       employment agreement. In addition, Interstate loaned Mr. Hewitt $259,254
       for payment of his income tax liabilities associated with a restricted
       stock grant in 1999. If, on the earlier to occur of June 17,

       2003 or the date that Mr. Hewitt's employment is terminated other than
       for cause, the market value of the stock granted to Mr. Hewitt is less
       than $1.5 million, Interstate will forgive this loan in proportion to the
       amount by which the market value of the stock granted to Mr. Hewitt is
       less than $1.5 million.

     - Interstate loaned Mr. Hewitt $400,000, which is due on June 18, 2005 or
       30 days after the termination of his employment, whichever is earlier. If
       his employment is terminated by Interstate for any reason other than for
       cause, the loan will be forgiven.

     - If Mr. Hewitt resigns without good reason, he will be entitled to receive
       his minimum bonus.

     - If Mr. Hewitt is terminated for any reason other than for cause, or death
       or disability or if he resigns for good reason, he will be entitled to
       receive:

        - His minimum bonus;

        - The greater of:

           - twice his base pay and the average of each of his annual
             performance bonuses during the term of his agreement, but in no
             event less than his minimum bonus, and

           - his base pay and the average of each of his annual performance
             bonuses during the term of his agreement, but in no event less than
             his minimum bonus, for the remainder of the term;

        - The continuation of health and welfare benefits for 24 months; and

        - Immediate vesting and nonforfeiture of his Series B preferred stock
          and his joint venture interest described above.

        - If Mr. Hewitt is terminated as a result of his death or disability, he
          will be entitled to receive his minimum bonus for the year of
          termination of his employment, his base pay and minimum bonus for a
          period of 12 months following the termination of his employment, and
          immediate vesting and nonforfeiture of his Series B preferred stock
          and his joint venture interest.

     The completion of the merger will result in a "termination" of Mr. Hewitt's
employment other than "for cause." Mr. Hewitt has waived his right to receive
from Interstate a lump sum payment of $3.15 million to which he is entitled as a
result of the merger and will instead receive monthly payments from the combined
company of $75,000 as well as the continuation of all benefits for a period
beginning in the month in which the merger becomes effective and ending in
January 2006. The combined company will forgive the $400,000 loan made by
Interstate to Mr. Hewitt in June 2005 rather than at the time of the termination
of his employment other than "for cause" as currently contemplated by Mr.
Hewitt's employment agreement. The agreements described in this paragraph are
conditioned upon the completion of the merger.

     On August 31, 2000, Interstate entered into an amended and restated
employment agreement with Mr. Richardson. Under the terms of this agreement, Mr.
Richardson is entitled to the following payments upon his termination:

     - If Mr. Richardson is terminated for any reason other than for cause, or
       death or disability or if he resigns for good reason, he will be entitled
       to receive:

        - The greater of:

           - his salary and bonus for the year preceding termination; and

           - his salary and bonus for the remainder of the term of the
             agreement;

        - The continuation of health and welfare benefits for 24 months; and

        - Immediate vesting and nonforfeiture of his Series B preferred stock
          and his joint venture interest described above.

     - If Mr. Richardson is terminated as a result of his death or disability,
       he will be entitled to receive his base pay for a period of 12 months
       following the termination of his employment, and immediate vesting and
       nonforfeiture of his Series B preferred stock and his joint venture
       interest.

     The completion of the merger will result in a "termination" of Mr.
Richardson's employment other than "for cause." As a result of the merger, Mr.
Richardson will receive payments totaling $1.2 million from the combined company
as well as the continuation of his health and welfare benefits for a period of
24 months following the effective time of the merger.

     Mr. Mahmood J. Khimji, a director of Interstate, holds indirect interests
in CapStar Management Company LLC, which owns preferred units constituting an
approximately 1% ownership interest in MeriStar H&R Operating Company, L.P.

REGULATORY APPROVALS

     It is a condition to MeriStar's and Interstate's obligations to complete
the merger that the applicable waiting period to the completion of the merger
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 shall have
expired or terminated. On May 15, 2002, Interstate and MeriStar each filed a
Notification and Report Form with the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice and the Bureau of Competition of the Federal Trade Commission.

STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING

     The MeriStar common stock to be issued to Interstate stockholders in
connection with the merger is expected to be listed on the NYSE under the symbol
"     ," subject to official notice of issuance. Neither Interstate nor MeriStar
is required to close the merger if the common stock issuable in connection with
the merger is not approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice
of issuance. See the discussion under the caption "Proposal to Amend MeriStar's
Certificate of Incorporation to Effect a Reverse Stock Split -- Reasons for the
reverse stock split."

     Under the terms of the merger agreement, the combined company will use its
reasonable efforts to cause the Interstate Class A common stock to be de-listed
from the Nasdaq SmallCap Market and de-registered under the Exchange Act after
the completion of the merger.

FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS CONSEQUENCES

     All shares of MeriStar common stock received by Interstate stockholders in
connection with the merger will be freely transferable under the federal
securities laws, except for shares received by persons who are deemed to be
"affiliates" of MeriStar or Interstate for purposes of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act prior to the completion of the merger. These shares may be resold
only in transactions permitted by the resale provisions of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act or Rule 144 under the Securities Act in the case of persons who
become affiliates of Interstate or as otherwise permitted under the Securities
Act. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates of MeriStar or Interstate
generally include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or
are under common control with, those companies and may include some of their
officers and directors, as well as their principal stockholders.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THE HOLDERS OF INTERSTATE COMMON STOCK

     The merger is structured as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As a result, except for cash
paid to them instead of fractional shares of combined company common stock, U.S.
holders of Interstate common stock will not recognize any taxable gain from the
receipt of combined company common stock in connection with the merger. For more
information regarding the tax treatment of the merger, please read the section
of this joint proxy statement and prospectus entitled "Material United States
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger."

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     The merger will be accounted for as a purchase of MeriStar by Interstate
using the purchase method of accounting. The merger will be accounted for as a
reverse acquisition, with Interstate as the accounting acquiror and MeriStar as
the surviving company. The combined company will record goodwill as the excess
of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net identifiable tangible
and intangible assets acquired.

DIVIDEND POLICY

     The combined company anticipates that for the foreseeable future its
earnings, if any, will be retained for use in the operation of its business and
that no cash dividends will be paid on its common stock. In addition, the
combined company's new senior secured credit facility will contain restrictive
covenants, which will limit the combined company's ability to make dividend
payments or other distributions on its equity interests. The decision of the
combined company's board as to whether or not to pay cash dividends in the
future will depend upon a number of factors, including the combined company's
future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and the existence or
absence of any contractual limitations on the payment of dividends.

     Under the merger agreement, MeriStar and Interstate have each agreed not to
declare, set aside or pay any dividend on their equity securities until the
merger is completed without the prior written consent of the other, except for
dividends required under the terms of Interstate's Series B preferred stock, or
as otherwise permitted.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The following is a summary of the material provisions of the merger
agreement, as amended on June 3, 2002. A copy of the merger agreement, as
amended, is attached as Appendix A to this joint proxy statement and prospectus.
You should read it carefully and in its entirety for a more complete
understanding of its terms. The provisions of several related agreements are
summarized in the next section entitled "Description of Related Agreements."

GENERAL

     The merger agreement provides that, following the receipt of the requisite
approvals of the MeriStar stockholders and the Interstate stockholders and the
satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions to the merger, Interstate will be
merged with and into MeriStar. After the merger, MeriStar will continue as the
combined company under the name "Interstate Hotels & Resorts, Inc."

     The merger will be effective at the time MeriStar and Interstate file a
certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and articles of
merger with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland. These
filings will occur as soon as is practicable after the closing under the merger
agreement. Unless agreed otherwise, the closing will occur at 10:00 a.m. on the
second business day after the date on which the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions to closing in the merger agreement occurs.

     On        , 2002, the record date for the Interstate stockholder meeting,
as required by the Interstate voting and conversion agreement, holders of
Interstate's Series B preferred stock and 8.75% convertible notes converted all
but 10 shares of the outstanding Series B preferred stock and $18.6 million of
the $25.0 million outstanding principal amount of 8.75% convertible notes into
6,463,497 shares of Interstate's Class A common stock. Under the Interstate
voting and conversion agreement, those holders agreed to convert their
securities as described above and to vote their shares of Class A common stock
in favor of the merger proposal presented by Interstate. For more information
about the Interstate voting and conversion agreement, please see the section of
this joint proxy statement and prospectus entitled "Description of Related
Agreements -- Interstate voting and conversion agreement."

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

     At the effective time of the merger, each share of Interstate common stock
that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger will be converted into 4.6 shares of combined company common stock and
the associated stockholder rights issued under the combined company's
stockholder rights plan. The holders of Interstate's convertible securities will
be entitled to receive 4.6 shares of MeriStar common stock and the associated
stockholder rights issued under the combined company's stockholder rights plan
for each share of Interstate Class A common stock into which their convertible
securities could have been converted immediately before the merger, ignoring the
restrictions on conversion contained in those securities. No fractional shares
of combined company stock will be issued.

     If there is a change in the number of shares, or securities or other
instruments convertible or exchangeable into, or exercisable for, common stock
of MeriStar or Interstate prior to the completion of the merger, the exchange
ratio will be adjusted to eliminate the effects of that event.

TREATMENT OF STOCK OPTIONS AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

     The merger agreement provides that MeriStar and Interstate will take all
actions necessary to cause each outstanding option to purchase Interstate Class
A common stock to vest and be converted into an option to purchase 4.6 shares of
combined company common stock. The exercise price per share of the combined
company common stock will be the exercise price per share of Interstate Class A
common stock under the Interstate options divided by 4.6.

     Each option held under the existing stock option plans of MeriStar will
remain outstanding but will have vested at the effective time of the merger,
which is a change of control under those plans.

     For more information regarding the combined company's employee benefit
plans, please refer to the section of this joint proxy statement and prospectus
entitled "Management of the Combined Company After the Merger -- Benefit plans."

EXCHANGE OF STOCK CERTIFICATES

     Exchange agent.  Following the merger, the combined company will cause the
exchange agent to mail to each record holder of Interstate common stock a letter
of transmittal with instructions on how to exchange Interstate common stock
certificates for certificate(s) representing shares of combined company common
stock. Upon surrender of its Interstate stock certificate to the exchange agent,
each Interstate stockholder will be entitled to receive a certificate
representing that number of whole shares of combined company common stock and a
cash payment instead of fractional shares, if any, plus dividends, if any, which
that stockholder is entitled to receive in the merger. Interstate stock
certificates will then be canceled. INTERSTATE STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD NOT ENCLOSE
STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH THEIR PROXY CARDS.

     Fractional shares.  The combined company will not issue any fractional
shares of its stock in the merger. Instead, the exchange agent will pay
Interstate stockholders for each fraction of the combined company's share of
common stock, an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying the
fractional share interest to which the stockholder would otherwise have been
entitled by the closing price of a share of MeriStar common stock as reported on
the NYSE Composite Transaction Tape on the first trading day immediately
preceding the date on which the merger becomes effective.

     Lost certificates.  If Interstate stock certificates have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, Interstate stockholders will only be entitled to obtain shares of
the combined company common stock and any cash payment for fractional shares, by
providing an affidavit of loss and posting a bond in an amount sufficient to
protect the combined company against claims related to the Interstate
certificates, all as explained in the letter of transmittal that will be sent to
Interstate stockholders.

cause each of its subsidiaries to use its reasonable best efforts to:

     The interim operations covenants also contain restrictions on Interstate's
ability to make specified changes to its insurance business and on MeriStar's
ability to amend, waive or terminate some of its leases entered into in
connection with its BridgeStreet long-term stay business.

     Prior to the time clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act is obtained,
the parties can agree in writing to permit transactions that would otherwise be
prohibited by the interim operations covenants. After that clearance is
received, any transactions that are prohibited by the interim operations
covenant require the approval of an interim transactions committee composed of
two members, one appointed by each of MeriStar and Interstate.

     Stockholders Meetings.  MeriStar has agreed to call and hold, as promptly
as practicable after the effective date of the registration statement of which
this joint proxy statement and prospectus forms a part, a special meeting of its
stockholders to consider and vote upon the merger proposals to be voted upon by
the stockholders of MeriStar as described in this joint proxy statement and
prospectus.

     MeriStar has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies
in favor of those proposals and to take all other action necessary or advisable
to secure the required vote of the MeriStar stockholders for the merger, except
to the extent that taking those actions would cause the MeriStar board to breach
its fiduciary duties under applicable law, as determined in good faith by the
MeriStar board, having received the advice of independent legal counsel.

     Interstate has agreed to call and hold, as promptly as practicable after
the effective date of the registration statement of which this joint proxy
statement and prospectus forms a part, a special meeting of its stockholders to
consider and vote upon the merger proposal to be voted upon by the stockholders
of Interstate as described in this joint proxy statement and prospectus.

     Interstate has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies
in favor of those proposals and to take all other action necessary or advisable
to secure the required vote of the Interstate stockholders for the merger,
except to the extent that taking those actions would cause the Interstate board
to violate the duties of the Interstate board under applicable law, as
determined in good faith by a majority of the disinterested directors, having
received the advice of outside counsel.

     Non-solicitation of competing transactions.  Each of MeriStar and
Interstate is subject to substantially identical non-solicitation provisions in
the merger agreement.

     Each party and its subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers
and other representatives may not solicit, enter into, or provide any nonpublic
information to a third party related to, any proposal regarding:

     - mergers, consolidations, share exchanges, business combinations or other
       similar transactions involving it or its subsidiaries; or

     - any proposal or offer, including, without limitation, any proposal or
       offer to stockholders of one party, other than a proposal or offer by the
       other party, or a subsidiary of the other party, to acquire in any
       manner, directly or indirectly, securities representing more than 30% of
       the outstanding voting power of that party as of the date of the merger
       agreement or more than 30% of the consolidated assets of the party.

     Each party may furnish information to, and engage in discussions with, any
third party who delivers an unsolicited acquisition proposal to the extent that
a disinterested majority of its board of directors determines in good faith
after consultation with and receipt of advice from outside counsel that to do so
is required by its duties under applicable law and the third party has the
ability and financial resources to complete a superior proposal for that party.

     The board of directors or special committee of each party may not withdraw
or modify its recommendation of the merger to the stockholders unless that party
receives a superior proposal. In order for an acquisition proposal to be a
superior proposal for purposes of the merger agreement:

     - a majority of the party's disinterested directors must determine in good
       faith, after consultation with a nationally-recognized financial advisor,
       and taking into account all relevant factors, that the proposal is more
       favorable to that party and its stockholders; and

     - the acquisition proposal must be reasonably capable of being financed.

     Each party must advise the other orally and in writing of any acquisition
proposal or any inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
acquisition proposal. Each party must give the other three days' advance notice
of any information provided to the third party making the proposal.

     Indemnification and Insurance.  After the merger is completed, the combined
company has agreed to preserve all rights to indemnification existing as of the
date of the merger agreement in favor of any directors, officers, employees or
agents of Interstate or its subsidiaries for a period of at least six years
following the effective time of the merger. The right to indemnification with
respect to a claim asserted during the six-year period will be extended until
its final disposition. The combined company will also indemnify directors,
officers, employees or agents of Interstate or its subsidiaries against
liabilities or claims arising before the merger is completed and in connection
with their positions at Interstate. Finally, the combined company will pay those
persons legal and other expenses in connection with any proceeding arising out
of any matter occurring at or after the effective time of the merger.

     The combined company has agreed to maintain for at least six years after
the effective time of the merger the liability insurance Interstate currently
maintains for its directors and officers, or similar insurance, provided that
the combined company will not be required to pay an insurance premium in excess
of 300% of the last insurance premium paid by Interstate before the date of the
merger agreement. If this insurance coverage is unavailable, the combined
company will obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an annual
premium equal to that maximum amount.

                       DESCRIPTION OF RELATED AGREEMENTS

MERISTAR VOTING AGREEMENT

     The following is a summary of the material provisions of the MeriStar
voting agreement. You should read, carefully and in its entirety, the copy of
the MeriStar voting agreement that is attached to this joint proxy statement and
prospectus as Appendix B.

     In connection with the merger agreement, Messrs. Whetsell, Emery and Jorns
and Oak Hill Capital Partners, L.P. and parties related to it, who together
beneficially own shares of MeriStar common stock representing, as of the record
date, approximately 21% of the outstanding MeriStar common stock, entered into a
voting agreement with Interstate. These stockholders have agreed to vote in
favor of the merger proposals.

     These stockholders have also agreed to vote against any proposal or action
that is not a superior proposal of MeriStar and which is intended or could
reasonably be expected to result in a breach of any covenant, representation or
warranty of MeriStar under the merger agreement or could reasonably be expected
to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or adversely affect the merger and
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or the voting agreement.
These stockholders have also agreed not to transfer or assign any of their
shares of MeriStar common stock prior to the effective time of the merger
agreement, except to other holders who agree to be bound by the MeriStar voting
agreement.

     The MeriStar voting agreement terminates upon the termination of the merger
agreement.

INTERSTATE VOTING AND CONVERSION AGREEMENT

     The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Interstate
voting and conversion agreement, as amended. You should read, carefully and in
its entirety, the copy of the Interstate voting and conversion agreement
attached to this joint proxy statement and prospectus as Appendix C.

     The Interstate principal investor group, Mr. Thomas F. Hewitt, the Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer of Interstate, Mr. J. William Richardson, the Vice
Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of Interstate, and Mr. Kevin P. Kilkeary,
the President and Chief Operating Officer of Interstate, are parties to the
Interstate voting and conversion agreement.

     The Interstate voting and conversion agreement required the holders of all
outstanding Interstate Series B preferred stock and 8.75% convertible notes to
convert those convertible securities into Interstate Class A common stock on the
record date for the Interstate stockholder meeting, subject to pre-existing
restrictions in those securities on the amount that could be converted. As of
          , 2002, the record date for Interstate's stockholder meeting, a share
of Series B preferred stock was convertible into 2.5 shares of Interstate Class
A common stock, and the 8.75% convertible notes were convertible into Interstate
Class A common stock at a conversion price of $4.00 per share. On the record
date for the Interstate stockholder meeting:

     - Mr. Hewitt converted all 100,000 shares of his Series B preferred stock
       into 250,000 shares of Interstate Class A common stock;

     - Mr. Richardson converted all 75,000 shares of his Series B preferred
       stock into 187,500 shares of Interstate Class A common stock;

     - Mr. Kilkeary converted all 50,000 shares of his Series B preferred stock
       into 125,000 shares of Interstate Class A common stock;

     - CGLH Partners I LP converted 499,990 of its 500,000 shares of its Series
       B preferred stock into 1,249,975 shares of Interstate Class A common
       stock; and

     - CGLH Partners II LP converted $18.6 million of its $25 million
       outstanding aggregate principal amount of Interstate 8.75% convertible
       notes into 4,651,022 shares of Interstate Class A common stock.

     The Interstate principal investor group was not permitted to convert all of
its Series B preferred stock and 8.75% convertible notes on the record date
because the terms of those securities prohibit any holder and its affiliates
from beneficially owning a total of more than 49% of Interstate's outstanding
common stock. Accordingly, the Interstate principal investor group on the record
date beneficially owned approximately 49% of Interstate's outstanding common
stock, along with $6.4 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.75%
convertible notes and 10 shares of Series B preferred stock. The merger
agreement provides that those 10 shares of Series B preferred stock will be
converted in the merger into 11.5 shares of the combined company's common stock.
The Interstate voting and conversion agreement provides that, immediately
following the effective time of the merger, the combined company will convert
the remaining 8.75% convertible notes into shares of the combined company's
common as if they had been converted into shares of Interstate's common stock
immediately before the effective time of the merger and exchanged in the merger,
based on the exchange ratio in the merger.

     The Interstate voting and conversion agreement requires Messrs. Hewitt,
Richardson and Kilkeary and the Interstate principal investor group, who
collectively held, as of the record date for the Interstate stockholder meeting,
approximately 56.2% of the outstanding common stock of Interstate, to vote their
shares of common stock in favor of the merger. These stockholders have also
agreed to vote against any proposal or action that is not a superior proposal or
is intended or could reasonably be expected to result in a breach of any
covenant, representation or warranty of Interstate under the merger agreement or
reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or adversely
affect the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or
the voting agreement. These stockholders have also agreed not to transfer or
assign any of their Interstate securities prior to the effective time of the
merger agreement, except to other holders who agree to be bound by the
Interstate voting and conversion agreement.

COMBINED COMPANY BOARD COMPOSITION AGREEMENT

     As provided in the proposed charter amendments and in a letter from
MeriStar and Interstate to the Interstate principal investor group, the
composition of the board of directors of the combined company will remain
unchanged for the 18 months after the completion of the merger. In addition,
during the 18-month period after the completion of the merger, the combined
company, at the request of the Interstate principal investor group, will include
five individuals specified by the Interstate principal investor group in the
slate of directors recommended for election as director by the board of
directors of the combined company, unless, at the time of the election, the
Interstate principal investor group and its affiliates and associates
beneficially own less than 75% of the combined company common stock that they
beneficially owned at the effective time of the merger.

     As a condition to the obligations of both MeriStar and Interstate to
complete the merger, the combined company, Interstate's principal investor
group, Oak Hill Capital Partners, L.P. and parties related to it and Messrs.
Whetsell, Emery, Jorns, Hewitt, Richardson and Kilkeary will enter into a
stockholder and board composition agreement.

     The agreement will provide that, during the 18 months after the completion
of the merger:

     - if any of Ms. Doggett or Messrs. Jorns, McCurry, Whetsell, Emery or
       Crandall or any replacement as director for any of them resigns, retires
       or is no longer able to serve as a director by reason of death,
       disqualification, removal from office or any other cause, Mr. Whetsell or
       his replacement as director, if any, will have the right to designate a
       person for nomination to be a successor to the director no longer
       serving;

     - if any of Messrs. Flannery, Khimji, Mikulich, Alibhai or Weiser or any
       replacement as director for any of them resigns, retires or is no longer
       able to serve as a director by reason of death, disqualification, removal
       from office or any other cause, then the majority of that group of
       individuals, including any of their replacements, if any, will have the
       right to designate a person for nomination to be a successor to the
       director no longer serving;

      - if all of Messrs. Flannery, Khimji, Mikulich, Alibhai or Weiser or any
        replacement as director for any of them resigns, retires or is no longer
        able to serve as a director by reason of death, disqualification,
        removal from office or any other cause, then Mr. Hewitt or his
        replacement as director, if any, will have the right to designate a
        person for nomination to be a successor to the director no longer
        serving;

     - if any of Messrs. Hewitt or Russell or any replacement as director for
       either of them resigns, retires or is no longer able to serve as a
       director by reason of death, disqualification, removal from office or any
       other cause then Mr. Hewitt or his replacement as director, if any, will
       have the right to designate a person for nomination to be a successor to
       the director no longer serving;

     - the combined company will use its best efforts, subject to the fiduciary
       duties of its board of directors under applicable law, to have any such
       successor that is designated for nomination under the agreement to be
       nominated and elected; and

     - the parties to the agreement other than the combined company itself will,
       if the matter is put to a vote of stockholders, vote their shares of
       combined company common stock in a manner to cause the election of any
       such successor that is nominated under the agreement.

CONVERSION INCENTIVE AGREEMENT

     The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Interstate
conversion incentive agreement, as amended by a letter agreement between the
parties dated June 3, 2002. You should read, carefully and in its entirety, the
copy of the Interstate conversion incentive agreement and amending letter
agreement attached to this joint proxy statement and prospectus as Appendix D.

     Interstate and the Interstate principal investor group are parties to the
Interstate conversion incentive agreement.

     Under the Interstate conversion incentive agreement, Interstate agreed to
pay the Interstate principal investor group $9.25 million as an inducement to
enter into the Interstate voting and conversion agreement and complete the
conversion transaction required by the Interstate voting and conversion
agreement. Interstate made this $9.25 million payment on           , 2002. The
Interstate conversion incentive agreement also provides for the termination, at
the effective time of the merger, of the existing agreements among Interstate
and the Interstate principal investor group that were entered into in connection
with the initial sale of the Interstate Series B preferred stock and 8.75%
convertible notes.

NEW CREDIT FACILITY

     A senior secured credit facility of up to $125 million will replace the
existing senior credit facilities of both MeriStar and Interstate. The facility,
for which credit commitments of $113 million have been obtained, will have a
three-year term loan with a principal balance of not less than $65 million nor
more than $72 million and a three-year revolver for the balance of the facility.
There is a one-year option to extend the revolving facility. The interest rate
on the facility will range from LIBOR plus 3.00% to LIBOR plus 4.50%, based on
the combined company's ability to meet specified financial covenant levels. On a
pro forma basis, after giving effect to the merger, the refinancing and all
related transactions, the combined company would have had approximately $81.0
million drawn under the new credit facility as of March 31, 2002.

     The senior secured credit facility will contain affirmative and negative
covenants customary for similar financings, including:

     - maintenance of insurance;

     - restrictions upon guarantees of other indebtedness by the combined
       company's subsidiaries;

     - restrictions upon the combined company's and its subsidiaries' ability to
       merge with or transfer all or substantially all of its assets to another
       company;

     - restrictions upon the combined company's and its subsidiaries' ability to
       incur liens;

     - restrictions upon the combined company's and its subsidiaries' ability to
       incur indebtedness;

     - restrictions upon the combined company's and its subsidiaries' ability to
       make restricted payments, including dividends on capital stock; and

     - limitations on affiliated transactions.

     The senior secured credit facility will also contain financial covenants
customary for similar financings, including:

     - a total leverage test;

     - a minimum net worth test; and

     - an interest coverage test.

     The senior secured credit facility will contain customary events of
default. Some of these events of default allow for grace periods.

AMENDMENT TO THE MERISTAR HOSPITALITY CREDIT FACILITY

     MeriStar has a revolving credit facility with MeriStar Hospitality under
which MeriStar Hospitality may lend MeriStar up to $50 million for general
corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2002, MeriStar had $45.0 million of
borrowings outstanding under the MeriStar Hospitality credit facility at an
interest rate of 8.4%. The MeriStar Hospitality credit facility matures on the
91st day after the maturity date of MeriStar's senior secured credit agreement.

     MeriStar also has an outstanding $13.1 million term note payable to
MeriStar Hospitality. The term note bears interest at the 30-day LIBOR plus
6.50% and matures on the same date as the MeriStar Hospitality credit facility.

     In connection with the proposed merger, MeriStar Hospitality has agreed, in
a letter agreement, to amend the MeriStar Hospitality credit facility and term
note to provide the following, effective as of the effective time of the merger:

     - the balance of the term note will be added to the MeriStar Hospitality
       credit facility, and the term note will be retired;

     - the MeriStar Hospitality credit facility will become a term facility, and
       the maturity date of the facility will be set at the fifth anniversary of
       the effective time of the merger; and

     - MeriStar will repay $3.0 million of the outstanding loans under the
       MeriStar Hospitality credit facility.

     The completion of these amendments to the MeriStar Hospitality credit
facility and term note by MeriStar Hospitality require the fulfillment of a
number of conditions at the effective time of the merger, including:

     - the completion of the merger in accordance with the merger agreement;

     - the refinancing of the MeriStar senior secured credit facility as
       described under "-- New credit facility";

     - the absence of a default or event of default under the MeriStar
       Hospitality credit facility;

     - MeriStar Hospitality being reasonably satisfied with the proposed
       amendment to the MeriStar Hospitality credit facility and the related
       documentation;

     - the absence of amendments to the merger agreement not approved by
       MeriStar Hospitality; and

     - the receipt of all reasonably requested legal opinions by MeriStar
       Hospitality.

     In addition, in the letter agreement, MeriStar Hospitality:

     - waived its right to terminate the intercompany agreement between itself
       and MeriStar as a result of the merger; and

     - agreed to cause its subsidiaries that are parties to hotel management
       agreements with MeriStar to waive any rights to terminate those
       agreements as a result of the merger.

     MeriStar has agreed to pay the expenses of MeriStar Hospitality incurred in
connection with the proposed amendments and the evaluation of the merger
agreement.

PREPAYMENT OF INDEBTEDNESS OF PRINCIPAL OPERATING SUBSIDIARY OF INTERSTATE

     Prior to entering into the merger agreement, an affiliate of Wyndham
International, Inc., the holder of a 1.6627% non-controlling economic interest
in Interstate Hotels, LLC, Interstate's principal operating subsidiary, agreed
to permit Interstate to cause Interstate Hotels, LLC, or its subsidiaries, to
provide a guaranty and pledge of assets of Interstate Hotels, LLC, or its
subsidiaries, under the terms of the proposed senior secured credit facility for
the combined company following the merger. In consideration for this agreement,
Interstate repaid a promissory note to Wyndham on May 2, 2002 in the outstanding
principal amount of $0.75 million and agreed to pay to Wyndham the outstanding
principal amount of approximately $3.7 million under a second promissory note
prior to Interstate Hotels, LLC, or its subsidiaries, providing any guaranty and
pledge of any of its or their assets. In addition, Interstate accelerated the
timing of Wyndham's right to require Interstate to redeem Wyndham's interest in
Interstate Hotels, LLC to be the earlier of the date on which Interstate repays
the second promissory note and July 1, 2004.

REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT

     Under the merger agreement, as a condition to Interstate's obligation to
complete the merger, MeriStar is required to enter into a registration rights
agreement providing the Interstate principal investor group with registration
rights in respect of the combined company's common stock they will receive in
connection with the merger.

     Incidental registration rights.  Under the registration rights agreement,
if at any time the combined company proposes to file a registration statement
with the SEC to register any of its common stock or other debt or equity
securities that may be converted into or exchanged for shares of its common
stock, for sale to the public, the Interstate principal investor group will have
the right to include in that registration their shares of common stock. This
right will be triggered whether the sale to the public is made by the combined
company for its own account, or on behalf of any selling stockholder of the
combined company.

     However, this right will not be triggered if the sale is:

     - not for cash consideration,

     - is being made in connection with the conversion, exchange or exercise,
       for shares of the combined company's common stock,

     - of shares of the combined company's common stock that are issuable upon
       the exercise of stock options, or issuable under the employee stock
       purchase plan,

     - in connection with an acquisition by the combined company,

     - in connection with any securities exchange offer, dividend reinvestment
       plan, corporate reorganization, or

     - in connection with any amalgamation, merger or consolidation of the
       combined company where the combined company is the surviving corporation.

     The ability of the Interstate principal investor group to include shares of
common stock in combined company registrations is subject to customary
provisions relating to the ability of underwriters to reduce the number of
securities to be sold in an offering.

     Demand registration rights.  The Interstate principal investor group will
also have the right to obligate the combined company to file a registration
statement covering the resale their combined company common stock upon written
notice to the combined company, so long as this demand for registration is for:

     - at least 2,500,000 shares of the combined company's common stock;

     - securities that are convertible into 2,500,000 shares of the combined
       company's common stock; or

     - a lesser number of shares, so long as the gross proceeds of the intended
       sale would not be less than $2,000,000, calculated based on the average
       closing price of the combined company's common stock over the 10 day
       trading period immediately preceding the date of the written demand
       request.

     The combined company may delay filing the demanded registration, or delay
the effectiveness of the related registration statement for a period of not more
than 90 days if, in the sole judgment of the combined company's board of
directors:

     - a delay is necessary in light of pending financing transactions,
       corporate reorganizations or other major events involving the combined
       company; or

     - the filing at the time requested would materially and adversely affect
       the business or prospects of the combined company in light of the
       disclosures that may be required by applicable law in connection with
       filing the registration statement.

     These principal stockholders will be entitled to make up to seven demands
for registration of their common stock to the company under the registration
rights agreement.

     Most favorable registration rights.  The registration rights agreement will
also provide that if the combined company gives any person registration rights
that are more favorable than those granted to these stockholders, other than the
number of registrations that may be demanded, with respect to any security of
the combined company, the combined company will be required to provide these
stockholders with notice of that event, and accord them those more favorable
rights.

                       PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO MERISTAR'S
             CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS IN CONNECTION
                                WITH THE MERGER

     IN CONNECTION WITH APPROVING AND ADOPTING THE OTHER PROPOSALS RELATING TO
THE MERGER, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF MERISTAR HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE
AMENDMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE AND UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE HOLDERS OF
MERISTAR COMMON STOCK VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THIS PROPOSAL.

           PROPOSAL TO AMEND AND RESTATE THE MERISTAR INCENTIVE PLAN

     The board of directors of MeriStar has adopted an amended and restated
incentive plan, a copy of which is attached as Appendix G to this joint proxy
statement and prospectus, subject to approval of MeriStar's stockholders. The
principal provisions of the new plan are summarized below. As used in this
summary, the term "administrator" means the compensation committee or its
designees. This summary is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by the
literal terms of the amended and restated incentive plan.

Approval of the amended and restated incentive plan is required in order to:

     - qualify options granted under the amended and restated incentive plan as
       incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of
       1986, as amended, to the extent that options are intended to be
       qualified;

     - allow shares purchased under the amended and restated incentive plan by
       officers and directors of the combined company to be listed on the NYSE;
       and

     - to the extent applicable, assure that some stock options and other awards
       granted under the amended and restated incentive plan are qualified
       "performance-based compensation" and therefore exempt from the
       application of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
       amended.

     If approved and adopted by MeriStar's stockholders, the amended and
restated incentive plan will replace MeriStar's current incentive plan and will
be the incentive plan for the combined company if the merger is completed.

     The purposes of the amended and restated incentive plan are to:

     - attract and retain employees, directors and other service providers with
       ability and initiative;

     - provide incentives to those deemed important to the success of the
       combined company and related entities; and

     - align the interests of these individuals with the interests of the
       combined company and its stockholders through opportunities for increased
       stock ownership.

     The number of persons expected to participate in the amended and restated
incentive plan is approximately 250 if the merger is not completed and 350 if
the merger is completed.

     AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION, MERISTAR'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS UNANIMOUSLY
APPROVED THE ADOPTION OF THE AMENDED AND RESTATED INCENTIVE PLAN AND UNANIMOUSLY
RECOMMENDS THAT HOLDERS OF MERISTAR COMMON STOCK VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL AND
ADOPTION OF THE AMENDED AND RESTATED INCENTIVE PLAN.

SUMMARY OF MATERIAL AMENDMENTS TO THE INCENTIVE PLAN

     The following is a summary of the material amendments that will be made to
the amended and restated incentive plan. This summary is not complete, and
MeriStar stockholders should read both the summary of the plan that is set forth
in this section as well as the form of the plan, which is attached as Appendix G
to this joint proxy statement and prospectus.

     Clarification of maximum number of shares issuable under the plan.  Both
the existing incentive plan and the amended and restated incentive plan limit
the aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the plan
to 15% of the outstanding number of shares of common stock issued and
outstanding as of the end of the preceding fiscal year. The amended and restated
incentive plan clarifies that if the number of outstanding shares declines in
any period so that the maximum aggregate number of shares issuable under the
plan declines below the actual number of shares subject to outstanding options,
the outstanding options will not be affected by that decline. However, in that
event, no additional options may be granted until the number of shares subject
to outstanding options is less than the maximum aggregate. In addition, the
amended and restated incentive plan will provide that if the merger is
completed, the aggregate limit will be 15% of the number of outstanding shares
of common

stock of the combined company, giving effect to the conversion of all of the
8.75% convertible notes, after the completion of the merger. If the merger is
completed, the aggregate number of shares issued under the plan will also
include the number of shares subject to options granted under Interstate's
incentive plan, which will be assumed by the combined company.

     Increase in individual award limits.  The maximum number of shares that are
subject to options granted to any individual in any calendar year may not exceed
3,000,000, compared to 750,000 shares under the existing plan. The maximum
number of shares subject to stock awards granted to any individual in any
calendar year may not exceed 500,000 shares, compared to 50,000 shares under the
existing plan.

     Amended conditions for vesting upon a "change of control."  The events that
cause awards under the amended and restated incentive plan to vest automatically
are different from those events under the existing plan. Under the existing
plan, the following events cause vesting of awards:

     - the commencement of a public tender offer for all or any portion of the
       common stock of MeriStar;

     - the submission to the stockholders of MeriStar of a proposal to merge,
       consolidate or otherwise combine another company with or into MeriStar;
       or

     - the MeriStar board of directors approves any transaction or event that
       would constitute a change of control of MeriStar that would be required
       to be reported under Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A under the Exchange Act.

Awards vest as of the time the tender offer, merger, consolidation, combination,
transaction or event is completed.

     The following events would cause awards to vest under the amended and
restated incentive plan:

     - other than in connection with the merger, any individual, entity or group
       acquiring beneficial ownership of 30% or more, on a fully-diluted basis,
       of either;

      - the outstanding shares of common stock of MeriStar; or

      - the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of
        MeriStar;

     - incumbent directors or replacements for them that are approved by at
       least 2/3 of the incumbent directors then on the MeriStar board no longer
       constitute at least a majority of the MeriStar board, provided that if
       the merger occurs, the directors elected as a result of the merger will
       be considered to be incumbent directors;

     - other than in connection with the merger, MeriStar is dissolved or
       liquidated or sells all or substantially all of its business or assets;
       or

     - a business combination transaction other than the merger occurs, unless,
       in the transaction:

      - at least 50% of the outstanding voting power of the surviving
        corporation is held by MeriStar stockholders;

      - no person or entity becomes the beneficial owner of 30% or more of the
        outstanding voting power of the surviving corporation; and

      - at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the
        surviving corporation were members of the MeriStar board at the time of
        the MeriStar board's approval of the relevant transaction agreement.

     Limit on incentive stock options.  The amended and restated incentive plan
will provide that no more than 8,000,000 shares issuable under the plan may be
subject to incentive stock options.

     Default vesting periods for awards.  The amended and restated incentive
plan will provide that, unless otherwise determined by the administrator on the
date of grant and provided in the relevant option agreement, options and
restricted stock awards will vest ratably over a three-year period on the first,
second and third anniversaries of the grant date. The amended and restated
incentive plan will provide

that, unless otherwise determined by the administrator on the date of grant and
provided in the relevant option agreement, if an employee is terminated, the
employee's vested stock options granted under the plan will be exercisable for a
period of 90 days after the employee is terminated. The current MeriStar
incentive plan does not have these provisions.

     Default option term.  The amended and restated incentive plan will provide
that, subject to some restrictions on the term of incentive stock options,
options granted under the plan will have a term of 10 years, unless otherwise
determined by the administrator on the date of grant and provided in the
relevant option agreement. The current MeriStar incentive plan contains no
default term for non-incentive stock options.

     Tax withholding.  The amended and restated incentive plan will add
provisions under which participants in the plan will be required to pay MeriStar
amounts in respect of required tax withholding and payroll taxes in respect of
awards under the plan. In addition, MeriStar will be permitted to withhold a
portion of the cash, shares of stock or other property to be delivered to
participants under the plan to satisfy those withholding and payroll tax
obligations. Participants will also be permitted to deliver shares of MeriStar
common stock to satisfy those withholding obligations.

SHARE AUTHORIZATION

     In no event may the total of the following exceed 15% of the number of
issued and outstanding shares of MeriStar common stock outstanding as of the end
of the preceding calendar year:

     - the number of shares of MeriStar's common stock covered by outstanding
       awards under the incentive plan; plus

     - the number of shares of MeriStar's common stock issued under the
       incentive plan; plus

     - if the merger is completed, the number of shares of the combined
       company's common stock covered by outstanding options that have been
       granted under the existing Interstate equity incentive plan; plus

     - if the merger is completed, the number of shares of the combined
       company's common stock issued upon the exercise of stock options that
       have been granted under the existing Interstate equity incentive plan;

provided, however, that for the year in which the merger is completed, the total
of the above shall not exceed 15% of the number of issued and outstanding shares
of the combined company as of the day after the effective time of the merger.

     All awards made under the amended and restated incentive plan will be
evidenced by written agreements between MeriStar and the participant. The terms
of outstanding awards and the per individual limitations on the number of shares
subject to award, will be adjusted, as the administrator deems appropriate, in
the event of an increase or decrease in the number of shares of common stock or
any change in the shares of common stock by reason of a merger, consolidation,
reorganization, spin-off, change in corporate structure, stock dividend, stock
split, combination, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar event.

     Not more than 1,500,000 shares issuable under the amended and restated
incentive plan may be subject to incentive stock options.

ADMINISTRATION

     The incentive plan will be administered by the compensation committee. The
compensation committee shall have authority to grant awards under the amended
and restated incentive plan upon whatever terms, not inconsistent with the
provisions of the plan, that the compensation committee may consider
appropriate. These terms may include conditions on the exercisability of all or
any part of an

option or on the transferability or forfeitability of a stock award, incentive
award or performance shares; provided, however, that the compensation committee
may, in its discretion, accelerate the time at which any option may be
exercised, or the time at which a stock award may become transferable or
nonforfeitable or the time at which an incentive award or performance shares may
be settled. In addition, the compensation committee shall have complete
authority to interpret all provisions of the amended and restated incentive plan
and to adopt, amend, and rescind rules and regulations pertaining to the
administration of the amended and restated incentive plan; and to make all other
determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the amended and
restated incentive plan. Any decision made, or action taken, by the compensation
committee or in relation to the administration of the amended and restated
incentive plan shall be final and conclusive.

     The compensation committee may delegate its authority to administer the
amended and restated incentive plan to one or more of MeriStar's officers. The
compensation committee may not, however, delegate its authority with respect to
grants and awards to individuals subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, its
authority to accelerate the vesting of any award, or to make appropriate
adjustments to the terms of outstanding awards and the per individual
limitations because of stock splits, combinations and other capital
transactions.

ELIGIBILITY

     Each employee of MeriStar or its affiliates, including employees who are
directors of MeriStar or its affiliates, or any other person whose efforts
contribute to MeriStar's or its affiliates' performance or success is eligible
to participate in the amended and restated incentive plan.

AWARDS

     The administrator may, from time to time, grant stock options, stock
awards, incentive awards or performance shares to eligible employees or other
individuals under the amended and restated incentive plan.

OPTIONS

     Options granted under the amended and restated incentive plan may be
incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options. An option entitles a
participant to purchase a designated number of shares of MeriStar common stock
at the exercise price. The exercise price and number of shares subject to the
option will be fixed by the administrator at the time the option is granted.

     The exercise price per share of a non-qualified stock option cannot be less
than:

     - for options granted to existing employees, 100% of the fair market value
       of MeriStar's common stock on the date of grant; and

     - for options granted in connection with the hiring of new employees, 85%
       of fair market value of MeriStar's common stock on the date of grant.

     The exercise price per share of an incentive stock option cannot be less
than:

     - for options granted to a 10% or more stockholder of MeriStar, 110% of the
       fair market value of MeriStar's common stock on the date of grant;

     - for options granted to all other participants, 100% of the fair market
       value of MeriStar's common stock on the date of grant.

     No more than 10% of the shares subject to non-qualified stock options under
the incentive plan may be granted at less than 100% of fair market value.

     Subject to the provisions of the amended and restated incentive plan and
the applicable award agreement, an option shall become exercisable in equal
installments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date,
unless otherwise determined by the administrator on the date of grant and
provided in the applicable award agreement; provided, however, that, with
respect to each participant, the aggregate fair market value, determined as of
the date of grant, of the securities issuable under all incentive stock options
held by the participant that vest during any calendar year may not exceed
$100,000.

     Unless otherwise determined by the administrator on the date of grant and
provided in the relevant option agreement, the term of each option granted under
the plan will be ten years, provided that the maximum term of an incentive stock
option granted to a 10% stockholder shall not exceed five years and ten years
for all other incentive stock options. The maximum term of a non-qualified stock
option shall be determined by the administrator on the date of grant, provided
that the maximum term shall not exceed ten years. The exercise price may be paid
in cash or with a cash equivalent acceptable to the administrator, and, if the
award agreement so provides, with shares of MeriStar's common stock with a fair
market value equal to the exercise price of the option.

     Incentive stock options may only be granted to employees. In addition, no
participant may be granted options in any calendar year for more than 1,500,000
shares of common stock.

STOCK AWARDS

     Participants may also be awarded shares of MeriStar's common stock under a
stock award. Unless otherwise determined by the administrator on the date of
grant and provided in the relevant option agreement, each award of restricted
stock under the plan will vest ratably over a three-year period on the first,
second and third anniversaries of the grant date. The administrator will
determine other conditions, if any, for the transferability and vesting of the
stock award which shall be listed in the applicable award agreement. These
conditions may include, for example, a requirement that the participant continue
employment with MeriStar for a specified period or that MeriStar or the
participant achieve stated performance-related objectives. The
performance-related objectives may be stated with reference to the fair market
value of MeriStar's common stock or MeriStar's, an affiliate's, or an operating
unit's return on equity, earnings per share, total earnings, earnings growth,
return on capital or funds from operations.

     Until the time a stock award is forfeited in accordance with the terms of
the applicable award agreement, a participant will have all rights of a
stockholder with respect to a stock award, including the right to receive
dividends and vote the shares.

     The number of shares of common stock awarded to an individual in any
calendar year under a stock award may not exceed 250,000. No more than 30% of
the shares of common stock available under the amended and restated incentive
plan may be issued in the form of stock awards.

INCENTIVE AWARDS

     Incentive awards may also be granted under the amended and restated
incentive plan. An incentive award is an opportunity to earn a bonus, payable in
cash, upon attainment of stated performance-related objectives. The
performance-related objectives may be stated with reference to the fair market
value of MeriStar's common stock or based on MeriStar's, an affiliate's, or an
operating unit's return on equity, earnings per share, total earnings, earnings
growth, return on capital, or funds from operations, return on assets or other
acceptable performance criteria. These terms and conditions also may include
other limitations on the payment of incentive awards including, but not limited
to, requirements that the participant complete a specified period of employment
with MeriStar or an affiliate or the participant attain stated objectives or
goals, in addition to those prescribed in accordance with the preceding
sentence. The administrator at the time an incentive award is granted, shall
also specify when amounts shall be payable under the incentive award and whether
amounts shall be payable in the event of the participant's

death, disability, or retirement. No payment shall be made under an incentive
award except to the extent that the administrator certifies that the objectives
governing the award have been achieved. The period in which performance will be
measured must be at least one year.

     In any calendar year, no participant may receive an incentive award payment
that exceeds $250,000 or 100% of the participant's base salary as of the date of
grant of the incentive award, whichever is lesser.

PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS

     The amended and restated incentive plan will also provide for the award of
performance shares. A performance share award entitles the participant to
receive a payment equal to the fair market value of a specified number of shares
of the MeriStar's common stock if specified standards are met. The administrator
will prescribe the requirements that must be satisfied before a performance
share award is earned. These conditions may include, for example, a requirement
that the participant continue employment with MeriStar for a specified period or
that MeriStar or the participant attain stated performance-related objectives.
The performance-related objectives may be stated with reference to the fair
market value of MeriStar's common stock or based on MeriStar's, an affiliate's,
or an operating unit's return on equity, earnings per share, total earnings,
earnings growth, return on capital, funds from operations, return on assets or
other acceptable performance criteria. If the administrator, on the date the
award is granted, prescribes that no payments will be made with respect to a
performance share award unless the performance objectives are achieved, then no
payment shall be made unless the compensation committee certifies that the
objectives have been achieved.

     To the extent that performance shares are earned, the obligation may be
settled in cash, MeriStar's common stock, or by a combination of the two. In any
calendar year, no participant may be granted a performance share award for more
than 100,000 shares of common stock.

TRANSFERABILITY

     Awards under the incentive plan are generally nontransferable. Except for
incentive stock options, the compensation committee may, however, grant awards
that are transferable to permitted family members, as defined in Rule 16b-3
under the Exchange Act.

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

     No option or stock award may be granted, and no performance shares may be
awarded under the amended and restated incentive plan more than ten years after
the earlier of the date that the incentive plan is adopted by the board of
directors or the date that it is approved by MeriStar's stockholders.

     The board of directors of MeriStar may amend or terminate the amended and
restated incentive plan at any time, but an amendment will not become effective
without stockholder approval if the amendment materially:

     - increases the number of shares of MeriStar's common stock that may be
       issued under the amended and restated incentive plan other than an
       adjustment on account of capital as described above;

     - changes in the class of individuals eligible to participate in the
       amended and restated incentive plan eligibility requirements; or

     - increases the benefits that may be provided under the amended and
       restated incentive plan.

     The administrator may, to the extent consistent with the terms of any
award, waive any conditions or rights under, amend any terms of, or alter,
suspend, discontinue, cancel or terminate, any award granted

after that under the amended and restated incentive plan; provided that no
action of this type shall, without a participant's consent, adversely affect any
rights of the participant under any outstanding award.

CHANGE OF CONTROL

     All outstanding options and awards under the amended and restated incentive
plan will become fully vested and/or exercisable, as applicable, upon the
occurrence of change in control, as defined in the amended and restated
incentive plan and, upon at least 10 days prior written notice by the
administrator before the date of the completion of the change in control, the
administrator may, in its sole discretion, elect to either force the exercise of
any outstanding awards within the 10 day period, or cancel any outstanding
awards and pay to the holders of them in cash or stock or any combination of
them, the value of those awards based upon the price per share of the common
stock received or to be received by other stockholders of MeriStar in the event
of a change in control.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

     The following summary of the federal income tax consequences of the grant
and exercise of awards under the amended and restated incentive plan and the
disposition of shares of common stock purchased as a result of the exercise of
those awards is intended to reflect the current provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code and the regulations under it. This summary is not intended to be a
complete statement of applicable law, nor does it address state and local tax
considerations. Moreover, the federal income tax consequences to any particular
participant may differ from those described by reason of, among other things,
the particular circumstances of the participant. FOR THESE REASONS, PARTICIPANTS
ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE CONSEQUENCES OF
THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE AMENDED AND RESTATED INCENTIVE PLAN.

     Options.  No income will be realized by a participant upon grant of a
non-qualified stock option. Upon the exercise of a non-qualified stock option,
the participant will recognize ordinary compensation income in an amount equal
to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the underlying shares over
the option exercise price at the time of exercise. The spread will be deductible
by MeriStar for federal income tax purposes, provided that income tax reporting
requirements are satisfied and, subject to the possible limitations on
deductibility under sections 280G and 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code for
compensation paid to executives designated in those sections. The participant's
tax basis in the underlying shares of common stock acquired through the exercise
of a non-qualified stock will equal the exercise price plus the amount taxable
as compensation to the participant. Upon the sale of the shares of common stock
received by the participant upon exercise of the non-qualified stock option, any
gain or loss is generally long-term or short-term capital gain or loss,
depending on the holding period. The participant's holding period for shares of
common stock acquired as a result of the exercise of a non-qualified stock
option will begin on the date of exercise of the option. Special rules may apply
under the Exchange Act.

     The Internal Revenue Code requires that, for incentive stock option
treatment, shares of common stock acquired through the exercise of an incentive
stock option cannot be disposed of before the later of two years from the date
of grant of the option, or one year from the date of exercise. Holders of
incentive stock options will generally incur no federal income tax liability at
the time of grant or upon exercise of those options. However, the spread at
exercise will be an item of tax preference which may give rise to alternative
minimum tax liability for the taxable year in which the exercise occurs. If the
participant does not dispose of the shares of common stock before two years
following the date of grant and one year following the date of exercise, the
difference between the exercise price and the amount realized upon disposition
of the shares of common stock will constitute long-term capital gain or loss, as
applicable. Assuming both holding periods are satisfied, no deduction will be
allowed to MeriStar for federal income tax purposes in connection with the grant
or exercise of an incentive stock option. If, within two years following the
date of grant or within one year following the date of exercise, the holder of
shares of common stock acquired through the exercise of an incentive stock
option disposes of the shares, the

participant will generally realize taxable compensation at the time of the
disposition equal to the difference between the exercise price and the lesser of
the fair market value of the share on the date of initial exercise or the amount
realized on the subsequent disposition of the shares, and that amount will
generally be deductible by MeriStar for federal income tax purposes, subject to
the possible limitations on deductibility under sections 280G and 162(m) of the
Internal Revenue Code for compensation paid to executives and other persons
designated in those sections. Gain recognized on the disposition in excess of
the ordinary income resulting from it will be capital gain, and any loss
recognized will be a capital loss.

     Stock awards.  A participant will generally not be subject to tax upon the
grant of a stock award unless the participant otherwise elects to be taxed under
section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. On the date shares of common stock
that are subject to a stock award become transferable or are no longer subject
to a substantial risk of forfeiture, the participant will have taxable
compensation equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares
common stock on that date over the amount the participant paid for those shares,
unless the participant made an election under section 83(b) of the Internal
Revenue Code to be taxed at the time of grant. Special rules apply to the
receipt and disposition of shares received by officers and directors who are
subject to section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. The participant will have a tax
basis in the shares of common stock acquired under a stock award equal to the
amount the participant paid for those shares plus the amount taxable as
compensation to the participant. Upon the sale of the shares of common stock
acquired under a stock award, any gain or loss is generally long-term or
short-term capital gain or loss, depending on the holding period. The amount of
taxable compensation to the participant will be deductible by MeriStar for
federal income tax purposes, provided income tax reporting requirements are
satisfied and subject to the possible limitations on deductibility under
sections 280G and 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code for compensation paid to
executives and other persons designated in those sections.

     Performance share awards.  A participant will not be subject to tax upon
the grant of a performance share award. Upon the delivery of shares of common
stock under a performance share award, the participant will have taxable
compensation equal to the difference between the fair market value of the number
of shares of common stock subject to the award on the date the award is settled
over the amount the participant paid for those shares. Special rules apply to
the receipt and disposition of shares received by officers and directors who are
subject to section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. The participant will have a tax
basis in the shares of common stock acquired under a performance share award
equal to the amount the participant paid for those shares plus the amount
taxable as compensation to the participant. Upon the sale of the shares of
common stock acquired under a performance share award, any gain or loss is
generally long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending on the holding
period. The participant's holding period for shares acquired as a result of the
settlement of a performance share award will begin on the date the participant
receives those shares. If the participant receives a cash payment in settlement
of his performance share award, the full amount of the cash payment will taxable
compensation to him or her. In either case, the amount of taxable compensation
to the participant will be deductible by MeriStar for federal income tax
purposes, provided that income tax reporting requirements are satisfied and
subject to the possible limitations on deductibility under sections 280G and
162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code for compensation paid to executives and
other persons designated in those sections.

     Incentive awards.  A participant will not be subject to tax upon the grant
of an incentive award. If the participant receives a cash payment in settlement
of his incentive award, the full amount of the cash payment will taxable
compensation to him or her. The amount of taxable compensation to the
participant will be deductible by MeriStar for federal income tax purposes,
subject to the possible limitations on deductibility under sections 280G and
162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code for compensation paid to executives and
other persons designated in those sections.

     Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.  In general, section 162(m) of
the Internal Revenue Code denies a publicly held corporation a deduction for
federal income tax purposes for compensation in excess of $1,000,000 per year
per person to its chief executive officer and the four other officers whose
compensation is disclosed in its proxy statement, subject to exceptions. Options
will generally qualify under

the performance-based compensation exception if they are granted under a plan
that states the maximum number of shares with respect to which options may be
granted to any employee during a specified period, the exercise price is not
less than the fair market value of the common stock at the time of grant, and
the plan under which the options are granted is approved by stockholders and is
administered by a committee comprised of two or more outside directors. Other
than with respect to grants of non-qualified stock options at less than fair
market value, the amended and restated incentive plan is intended to satisfy
these requirements with respect to grants of options to covered employees.

     With respect to stock awards, performance share awards and incentive
awards, in order to satisfy the performance-based compensation exception to the
deduction limitation of section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, the vesting
of the award must be contingent solely on the attainment of one or more
performance goals determined by a committee of two or more outside directors.
The award must also be granted under a stockholder approved plan containing a
specified limit on the number of shares, or a maximum dollar amount that, a
participant may receive within a specified time period or periods. The amended
and restated incentive plan is designed to permit awards of stock awards,
performance share awards and incentive awards to qualify under the
performance-based compensation exception to section 162(m) of the Internal
Revenue Code.

     Sections 2806 and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code.  Where payments to
some persons that are contingent on a change in control exceed limits specified
in the Internal Revenue Code, the person generally is liable for a 20% excise
tax on, and the entity making the payment generally is not entitled to any
deduction for, a specified portion of these payments. In the event the
exercisability, vesting or payment of any option, or other award granted under
the amended and restated incentive plan is accelerated by a change in control,
that acceleration would be relevant in determining whether the excise tax and
deduction disallowance rules would be triggered.

NEW PLAN BENEFITS

     Because awards to be granted in the future under the amended and restated
incentive plan are at the discretion of the administrator, it is not possible to
determine the benefits or the amounts received under the amended and restated
incentive by MeriStar's directors, officers, employees or service providers.

                          PROPOSAL TO AMEND MERISTAR'S
                          EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

     On July 28, 1998, the MeriStar board of directors and stockholders adopted
an employee stock purchase plan under which 1,500,000 shares of MeriStar common
stock are reserved for issuance. The board of directors of MeriStar has adopted
an amendment to the MeriStar employee stock purchase plan, subject to the
approval of MeriStar's stockholders.

     The amendment is as follows:

     The following paragraph (c) shall be added to Section 12.4 of the employee
stock purchase plan: "(c) No adjustment to the maximum number of shares that may
be purchased under the Plan shall be made in respect of any reverse stock split
approved at the Company's 2002 Annual Meeting of stockholders that is effected
by the Company in accordance with such approval."

     The effect of this amendment is to fix the number of shares that may be
purchased under the employee stock purchase plan at 1,500,000 shares even though
a reverse stock split may be implemented by MeriStar. If the amendment is
approved and the merger is completed, the amended plan will be the employee
stock purchase plan of the combined company.

     The MeriStar board of directors believes that it is advisable and in the
best interests of MeriStar to make the amendment to the employee stock purchase
plan described above. The MeriStar board believes that adjusting the number of
shares that may be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan upon the
effectiveness of the proposed reverse stock split would reduce the number of
shares purchasable under the plan below a level that the MeriStar board believes
is necessary to permit broad participation by MeriStar's employees in the
employee stock purchase plan. In the judgment of the MeriStar board, having too
few shares eligible for issuance under the plan would reduce the number of
"round-lot" purchases that could be made under the plan and would therefore
effectively reduce the number of employees who could participate in the plan. If
the merger is completed, a number of current Interstate employees would also be
able to participate in the plan, and the need for additional shares available
for issuance under the plan would be increased.

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF MERISTAR HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE PROPOSAL TO
AMEND THE MERISTAR EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN AND UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT
THE HOLDERS OF MERISTAR COMMON STOCK VOTE FOR THIS PROPOSAL.

     The principal provisions of the employee stock purchase plan are summarized
below. This summary is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by the
literal terms of the employee stock purchase plan.

PURPOSE AND ELIGIBILITY

     The MeriStar employee stock purchase plan is intended to provide an
opportunity for eligible employees of MeriStar and any affiliated entity to
acquire a proprietary interest in MeriStar through the purchase of shares of
MeriStar common stock. Each employee of MeriStar customarily employed at least
20 hours or more per week by MeriStar or an affiliate, other than an employee
who owns beneficially 5% or more of MeriStar's outstanding common stock, will be
eligible to participate in the employee stock purchase plan. The approximate
number of persons eligible to participate is 250. If the merger occurs,
approximately 350 persons will be eligible to participate.

ADMINISTRATION

     MeriStar's board of directors shall appoint a committee of two or more
directors to administer the employee stock purchase plan. No member of the
committee shall be an employee eligible to purchase MeriStar's common stock
under the employee stock purchase plan. Subject to the express provisions of the
employee stock purchase plan, the committee shall have plenary authority in its
discretion to appoint, remove and replace the agent selected by the committee to
hold MeriStar common stock purchased under the employee stock purchase plan, to
interpret and construe any and all provisions of the employee stock

purchase plan, to adopt rules and regulations for administering the employee
stock purchase plan, and to make all other determinations deemed necessary or
advisable for administering the employee stock purchase plan. The committee's
determination on the above matters shall be conclusive.

DEFERRAL OF COMPENSATION

     Each person electing to participate in the employee stock purchase plan
must file a payroll deduction authorization with the chief financial officer of
MeriStar, or his or her delegate, which indicates the amount to be deducted from
the participant's paychecks. This deduction may not be greater than 8 percent of
the participant's base pay. Deductions are accumulated for one month beginning
on the first day on which shares are traded on the NYSE during a calendar month
and ending on the last day on which shares are traded on the NYSE during a
calendar month. This period is referred to as an "offering period."

GRANTING OF OPTIONS

     On the first trading day of every month, participating employees shall be
deemed to have been granted options to purchase a number of shares of MeriStar's
common stock equal to the number of shares determined by dividing the amount of
the employee's payroll deductions authorized to be made through the end of that
calendar month plus any carryovers, by 85% of the lesser of the closing price of
a share of MeriStar's common stock on the NYSE, or any other exchange on which
MeriStar's common stock is principally traded, on the first trading day of the
calendar month, or the closing price of a share of MeriStar's common stock on
the NYSE, or any other exchange on which MeriStar's common stock is principally
traded, on the last trading day of that calendar month.

OPTION PRICE

     The option price of MeriStar's common stock issued under MeriStar's
employee stock purchase plan shall be the lesser of:

     - 85% multiplied by the closing price of MeriStar's common stock on the
       first trading day of each calendar month; or

     - 85% multiplied by the closing price of MeriStar's common stock on the
       last trading day of the calendar month.

LIMITATIONS ON THE GRANT OF OPTIONS

     No participant may purchase more than 1,000 shares of MeriStar's common
stock in any one offering period. In addition, no person shall be granted an
option under the employee stock purchase plan which permits his or her rights to
purchase shares of MeriStar's common stock under all employee stock purchase
plans of MeriStar to accrue at a rate which exceeds $25,000 of the fair market
value of the common stock of MeriStar, determined as of the date the option is
granted, for each calendar year in which the option is outstanding.

WITHDRAWAL

     By written notice to the agent at any time prior to two days prior to the
last trading day applicable to any offering period, a participant may elect to
withdraw all, but not less than all, of the amount then credited to the
participant's payroll deduction account. Payment of the amount credited to the
participant's payroll deduction account will be made to the participant in cash
promptly after receipt of the participant's notice of withdrawal, and no further
payroll deductions will be made from the participant's pay unless the
participant again elects to participate in the employee stock purchase plan in
accordance with the terms of the employee stock purchase plan.

ADJUSTMENT

     If, while any options are outstanding, the outstanding shares of MeriStar's
common stock have increased, decreased, changed into, or been exchanged for a
different number or kind of shares or securities of MeriStar without the receipt
of consideration through reorganization, merger, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock split, reverse stock split or similar transaction,
appropriate and proportionate adjustments may be made by the committee or its
appointed agent in the number and/or kind of shares which are subject to
purchase under outstanding options and on the option exercise price applicable
to those outstanding options. In addition, in any event of this type, the number
and/or kind of shares which may be offered during the offering periods shall
also be proportionately adjusted. No adjustments shall be made for stock
dividends. For the purposes of this paragraph, any distribution of shares to
stockholders in an amount aggregating 20% or more of the outstanding shares
shall be deemed a stock split and any distributions of shares aggregating less
than 20% of the outstanding shares shall be deemed a stock dividend. IN SPITE OF
THE ABOVE, NO ADJUSTMENT SHALL BE MADE TO THE 1,500,000 SHARES RESERVED FOR
ISSUANCE UNDER THIS EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN ON ACCOUNT OF THE PROPOSED
REVERSE STOCK SPLIT.

     Upon the dissolution or liquidation of MeriStar, or upon a reorganization,
merger or consolidation of MeriStar with one or more corporations because of
which MeriStar is not the surviving corporation, or upon a sale of substantially
all of the property or stock of MeriStar to another corporation, the holder of
each option then outstanding under the employee stock purchase plan will then be
entitled to receive at the end of the next offering period upon the exercise of
that option for each share as to which this option is exercised, as nearly as
reasonably may be determined, the cash, securities and/or property which a
holder of one share of MeriStar's common stock was entitled to receive upon and
at the time of the transaction.

AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

     MeriStar's board of directors shall have complete power and authority to
terminate or amend the employee stock purchase plan; provided, however, that the
board of directors shall not, without the approval of the stockholders of
MeriStar:

     - increase the maximum number of shares which may be issued under any
       offering; or

     - amend the requirements as to the class of employees eligible to purchase
       stock under the employee stock purchase plan.

     No termination, modification, or amendment of the employee stock purchase
plan may, without the consent of an employee then having an option, adversely
affect any right of that employee.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

     The following discussion is a brief summary of the principal United States
federal income tax consequences under current federal income tax laws relating
to awards under the employee stock purchase plan. This summary is not intended
to be complete and, among other things, does not describe state, local or
foreign income and other tax consequences. PARTICIPANTS IN THE EMPLOYEE STOCK
PURCHASE PLAN ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE
CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN.

     The employee stock purchase plan is intended to qualify as an "employee
stock purchase plan" within the meaning of Section 423(b) of the Internal
Revenue Code. The employee stock purchase plan is not subject to the provisions
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and is not
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

     No income will be taxable to a participant until the shares purchased under
the employee stock purchase plan are sold or otherwise disposed of. If the
shares are sold or otherwise disposed of more than

two years from the applicable offering date and more than one year from the date
of transfer of the shares to the participant, then the participant generally
will recognize ordinary income measured as the lesser of:

     - the excess of the fair market value of the shares at the time of this
       sale or disposition over the purchase price; or

     - an amount equal to 15% of the fair market value of the shares as of the
       date of grant; any additional gain or loss should be treated as long-term
       capital gain or loss.

     If the shares are sold or otherwise disposed of before the expiration of
this holding period, the participant will recognize ordinary income generally
measured as the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date the
shares are purchased over the purchase price; any additional gain or loss on a
sale or disposition will be long-term or short-term capital gain or loss,
depending on the holding period. There are special rules for recognizing income
that apply in the case of death. MeriStar is not entitled to a deduction for
amounts taxed as ordinary income or capital gain to a participant except to the
extent ordinary income is recognized by participants upon a sale or disposition
of shares prior to the expiration of the holding periods described above. In all
other cases, no deduction is allowed to MeriStar.

     If an affected participant's total compensation from MeriStar, including
compensation related to some awards under the employee stock purchase plan,
exceeds $1 million, the compensation in excess of $1 million may not be tax
deductible by MeriStar under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Affected participants are generally the MeriStar's chief executive officer and
the four most highly compensated employees of the MeriStar, other than the chief
executive officer, at the end of MeriStar's taxable year.

NEW PLAN BENEFITS

     Because the number of options to be granted in the future under the
employee stock purchase plan is contingent upon the number of employees who
elect to participate in the employee stock purchase plan, it is not possible to
determine the benefits or the amounts received under the employee stock purchase
plan by MeriStar's officers and employees.

                             PROPOSAL TO AMEND THE
                     NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS' INCENTIVE PLAN

     On July 28, 1998, the MeriStar board of directors adopted a non-employee
directors' incentive plan under which 125,000 shares of MeriStar common stock
were authorized for issuance. Effective June 14, 2000, the plan was amended to
increase the number of shares authorized for issuance under the plan to 500,000.
The board of directors of MeriStar has adopted an amendment to the MeriStar
non-employee directors' incentive plan, subject to the approval of MeriStar's
stockholders.

     The amendment is as follows:

     The following paragraph shall be added to the end of Article VII of the
     non-employee directors' incentive plan: "Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
     adjustment to the maximum aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that
     may be issued under the Plan shall be made in respect of any reverse stock
     split approved at the Company's 2002 Annual Meeting of stockholders that is
     effected by the Company in accordance with such approval."

     The effect of this amendment is to fix the maximum number of shares that
may be granted under the non-employee directors' incentive plan at 500,000
shares even though a reverse split may be implemented by MeriStar. If the
amendment is approved and the merger is completed, the amended plan will be the
non-employee directors' incentive plan of the combined company.

     The MeriStar board of directors believes that it is advisable and in the
best interests of MeriStar to make the amendment to the non-employee directors'
plan described above. The MeriStar board of directors believes that adjusting
the number of shares that may be purchased under the non-employee directors'
plan upon the effectiveness of the proposed reverse stock split would reduce the
number of shares purchasable under the plan below a level that the MeriStar
board of directors believes is necessary to permit participation in the plan by
MeriStar's board of directors. As of March 31, 2002, approximately 150,000 of
the 500,000 shares authorized to be issued under the plan had been issued. If
the merger is completed, seven new directors will be appointed as directors of
the combined company, and the number of directors of the combined company will
be 13, compared to 11 directors for MeriStar, further increasing the demand for
option shares.

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF MERISTAR HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE PROPOSAL TO
AMEND THE MERISTAR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS' INCENTIVE PLAN AND UNANIMOUSLY
RECOMMENDS THAT THE HOLDERS OF MERISTAR COMMON STOCK VOTE FOR THIS PROPOSAL.

     The principal provisions of the non-employee directors' incentive plan, and
some federal income tax consequences associated with it, are summarized below.
This summary is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by the literal
terms of the non-employee directors' incentive plan.

OPTIONS

     Under this plan, each independent director will be awarded an option to
purchase 7,500 shares of MeriStar's common stock upon initial commencement of
service as a director, whether by appointment or election. After that, each
independent director will be granted an option to purchase 5,000 shares of
MeriStar's common stock on the first business day following MeriStar's annual
meeting of stockholders. The exercise price of option grants will be 100% of the
fair market value of MeriStar's common stock on the date of grant, and options
will vest in three annual installments. The exercise price may be paid in cash,
cash equivalents acceptable to the committee, the common stock of MeriStar or
any combination of them. Options granted under this plan, once vested, will be
exercisable for ten years from the date of grant. Upon termination of service as
a director, options which have not vested will be forfeited and vested options
may be exercised until they expire. All options will vest upon a change in
control of MeriStar.

PURPOSE

     The purpose of the non-employee directors' incentive plan is to assist
MeriStar in recruiting and retaining non-employee directors and to promote a
greater identity of interest between non-employee directors and stockholders by
allowing non-employee directors to participate in the success of MeriStar. The
number of persons expected to participate in the non-employee directors'
incentive plan is approximately 20. If the merger does occur approximately 25
persons will be eligible to participate.

SHARE AUTHORIZATION

     A maximum of 500,000 shares of MeriStar's common stock may be issued under
this plan. The share limitation and terms of outstanding awards may be adjusted,
as the compensation committee deems appropriate, in the event of a stock
dividend, stock split, combination, reclassification, recapitalization or other
similar event; provided, however, that no adjustment shall be made to the
maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the
non-employee directors' incentive plan on account of any reverse stock split
approved at MeriStar's 2002 annual meeting of stockholders.

ELIGIBILITY

     MeriStar's non-employee directors' incentive plan will provide for awards
to be granted to each director who is not an employee of MeriStar or any of its
parents and subsidiaries. The non-employee directors' incentive plan shall be
administered by a committee appointed by MeriStar's board of directors or, if
the board fails to appoint a committee, the board shall administer the
non-employee directors' incentive plan. The committee shall have complete
authority to interpret all provisions of the non-employee directors' incentive
plan and to adopt, amend, and rescind rules and regulations pertaining to the
administration of the non-employee directors' incentive plan; and to make all
other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the
non-employee directors' incentive plan. Any decision made, or action taken, by
the committee or in connection with the administration of the non-employee
directors' incentive plan shall be final and conclusive.

AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

     MeriStar's non-employee directors' incentive plan will provide that the
board of directors may amend or terminate the non-employee directors' incentive
plan at any time. An amendment will not become effective without stockholder
approval if the amendment:

     - materially increases the number of shares that may be issued under the
       plan, or

     - stockholder approval would be required for compliance with stock exchange
       rules.

No options may be granted under non-employee directors' incentive plan after
December 31, 2008.

TRANSFERABILITY

     Options will be generally non-transferable. However, the non-employee
directors' incentive plan will authorize the granting of options that are
transferable to permitted family members of the independent directors.

CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

     The following summary of the federal income tax consequences of the grant
and exercise of options under the non-employee directors' incentive plan and the
disposition of shares of common stock purchased upon the exercise of options is
intended to reflect the current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the
related regulations. This summary is not intended to be a complete statement of
applicable law, nor does it address state and local tax considerations.
Moreover, the federal income tax consequences to any

particular participant may differ from those described in this joint proxy
statement and prospectus by reason of, among other things, the particular
circumstances of the participant. FOR THESE REASONS, PARTICIPANTS ARE URGED TO
CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR
PARTICIPATION IN THE AMENDED AND RESTATED INCENTIVE PLAN.

     Generally, an eligible director will not recognize any taxable income, and
MeriStar will not be entitled to a deduction upon the grant of an option. Upon
the exercise of an option, the eligible director will recognize ordinary income
equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares acquired over the
option exercise price, if any. The director will then take a basis in the shares
equal to their fair market value at the time of option exercise, and any gain or
loss subsequently recognized upon a sale or exchange of the shares is treated as
capital gain or loss to the director. Special rules may apply as a result of
Section 16 of the Exchange Act. MeriStar will generally be entitled to a
deduction equal to the compensation taxable to the eligible director as ordinary
income, provided that income tax reporting requirements are satisfied.

COMMON STOCK IN LIEU OF FEES

     Independent directors may elect to receive all or a portion of their annual
fees shares of MeriStar's common stock rather than cash. Unless an independent
director elects otherwise, fees paid in stock will be paid at the same time as
fees paid in cash.

           PROPOSAL TO AMEND MERISTAR'S CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION
                        TO EFFECT A REVERSE STOCK SPLIT

     The board of directors of MeriStar has adopted a resolution to amend its
certificate of incorporation to permit a reverse stock split at a ratio of five
shares of existing stock to one share after the reverse stock split.

     The board of directors of MeriStar will be given discretion to determine:

     - whether the reverse stock split will actually be effected; and

     - the timing of the reverse stock split, subject to the requirement that
       the reverse stock split occur not later than 12 months after the date of
       the MeriStar annual meeting.

     MeriStar stockholders are being asked to approve an amendment to MeriStar's
certificate of incorporation relating to the possible reverse stock split, with
MeriStar's board of directors having the authority and discretion described
above to give its final approval to effect, or not to effect, the amendment. By
approving the proposed amendment to permit the reverse stock split, MeriStar
stockholders will be authorizing MeriStar's board of directors, at its option,
to implement the reverse stock split at any time during the 12-month period
following the approval of the amendment, if it determines that the reverse stock
split is in the best interest of the holders of MeriStar's common stock or to
abandon the reverse stock split at any time. If MeriStar has not filed an
amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State by the close of business on the
last day of the 12-month period, MeriStar's board of directors will either
re-solicit stockholder approval or abandon the reverse stock split.

     If the reverse stock split occurs prior to the completion of the merger,
the exchange ratio will be 0.92 shares of combined company common stock for each
share of Interstate common stock, assuming no other adjustments are made. If the
merger is completed before the reverse stock split occurs, the combined company
board of directors will have the discretion to implement the reverse stock split
with respect to the combined company's common stock, if it determines that the
reverse stock split is in the best interest of the holders of the combined
company's common stock. The considerations and reasons for the reverse stock
split and its effects stated below would then apply to the combined company as
they do to MeriStar.

REASONS FOR THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT

     The trading price of MeriStar's common stock decreased significantly in the
aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks. As a result, the New York
Stock Exchange notified MeriStar that it was not in compliance with the NYSE's
continued listing requirements because the average closing price of MeriStar's
common stock was below $1.00 for a consecutive 30-day trading period. MeriStar
has been advised by the NYSE that, if MeriStar is seeking stockholder approval
for a reverse stock split to cure the trading price condition, MeriStar may seek
the approval at its annual meeting and implement the reverse stock split
promptly after the annual meeting. If the reverse stock split occurs, the
trading price condition will be deemed to be cured if the trading price promptly
exceeds $1.00 per share and remains above that level for at least the following
30 trading days. In addition to compliance with the minimum trading price
requirement, the continued listing of MeriStar's common stock on the NYSE is
subject to MeriStar's compliance with all of the other NYSE continued listing
requirements. As of the date of this proxy statement, MeriStar is currently in
compliance with all of the other NYSE continued listing requirements.

     In response to the events described above, MeriStar has examined and is
continuing to examine numerous alternatives, including the following:

     - effecting the reverse stock split of MeriStar's common stock described
       above;

     - continuing to pursue discussions with the NYSE in an attempt to reach an
       agreement upon the extension of the term of the cure period for the
       minimum trading price deficiency; and

     - monitoring the trading price of MeriStar's common stock to see if the
       trading price will likely increase by a sufficient amount to cure the
       minimum trading price deficiency prior to the expiration of the cure
       period.

     MeriStar will continue to diligently examine all of its alternatives,
including the alternatives mentioned above.

     MeriStar's primary purpose in seeking stockholder approval for a reverse
stock split is to provide it with the flexibility to implement a reverse stock
split if MeriStar determines that it needs to do so in order to increase the
trading price of its common stock and regain compliance with the NYSE's
continued listing standards. MeriStar's board of directors believes that if the
proposed amendment is approved at the MeriStar stockholders' meeting and a
reverse stock split is effected, MeriStar should regain compliance with the
$1.00 per share minimum trading price required to remain listed on the NYSE.
However, the trading price of its common stock following a reverse stock split
may not rise in exact proportion to the reduction in the number of then
outstanding shares of its common stock, and any rise in its trading price may
not be maintained for any period of time. Also, a reverse stock split may not
lead to a sustained increase in the trading price of the MeriStar common stock,
and the trading price may not remain above the minimum trading price required by
the NYSE. Furthermore, while MeriStar believes that it is and will continue to
be in compliance with other NYSE continued listing requirements, MeriStar may
not be able to continue to meet the other continued listing requirements of the
NYSE. The trading price of MeriStar's common stock may change due to a variety
of other factors, some of which are unrelated to the number of shares
